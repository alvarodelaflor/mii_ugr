NEVEUX\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entered literary life as a meteor, and I shall leave it like a\r\nthunderbolt.\xe2\x80\x9d These words of Maupassant to Jose Maria de Heredia on the\r\noccasion of a memorable meeting are, in spite of their morbid solemnity,\r\nnot an inexact summing up of the brief career during which, for ten\r\nyears, the writer, by turns undaunted and sorrowful, with the fertility\r\nof a master hand produced poetry, novels, romances and travels, only to\r\nsink prematurely into the abyss of madness and death. . . . .\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, 1880, an article appeared in the \xe2\x80\x9cLe Gaulois\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nannouncing the publication of the Soirees de Medan. It was signed by a\r\nname as yet unknown: Guy de Maupassant. After a juvenile diatribe\r\nagainst romanticism and a passionate attack on languorous literature,\r\nthe writer extolled the study of real life, and announced the\r\npublication of the new work. It was picturesque and charming. In the\r\nquiet of evening, on an island, in the Seine, beneath poplars instead of\r\nthe Neapolitan cypresses dear to the friends of Boccaccio, amid the\r\ncontinuous murmur of the valley, and no longer to the sound of the\r\nPyrennean streams that murmured a faint accompaniment to the tales of\r\nMarguerite's cavaliers, the master and his disciples took turns in\r\nnarrating some striking or pathetic episode of the war. And the issue,\r\nin collaboration, of these tales in one volume, in which the master\r\njostled elbows with his pupils, took on the appearance of a manifesto,\r\nthe tone of a challenge, or the utterance of a creed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, however, the beginnings had been much more simple, and they had\r\nconfined themselves, beneath the trees of Medan, to deciding on a\r\ngeneral title for the work. Zola had contributed the manuscript of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttaque du Moulin,\xe2\x80\x9d and it was at Maupassant's house that the five\r\nyoung men gave in their contributions. Each one read his story,\r\nMaupassant being the last. When he had finished Boule de Suif, with a\r\nspontaneous impulse, with an emotion they never forgot, filled with\r\nenthusiasm at this revelation, they all rose and, without superfluous\r\nwords, acclaimed him as a master.\r\n\r\nHe undertook to write the article for the Gaulois and, in cooperation\r\nwith his friends, he worded it in the terms with which we are familiar,\r\namplifying and embellishing it, yielding to an inborn taste for\r\nmystification which his youth rendered excusable. The essential point,\r\nhe said, is to \xe2\x80\x9cunmoor\xe2\x80\x9d criticism.\r\n\r\nIt was unmoored. The following day Wolff wrote a polemical dissertation\r\nin the Figaro and carried away his colleagues. The volume was a\r\nbrilliant success, thanks to Boule de Suif. Despite the novelty, the\r\nhonesty of effort, on the part of all, no mention was made of the other\r\nstories. Relegated to the second rank, they passed without notice. From\r\nhis first battle, Maupassant was master of the field in literature.\r\n\r\nAt once the entire press took him up and said what was appropriate\r\nregarding the budding celebrity. Biographers and reporters sought\r\ninformation concerning his life. As it was very simple and perfectly\r\nstraightforward, they resorted to invention. And thus it is that at the\r\npresent day Maupassant appears to us like one of those ancient heroes\r\nwhose origin and death are veiled in mystery.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on Guy de Maupassant's younger days. His relatives, his\r\nold friends, he himself, here and there in his works, have furnished us\r\nin their letters enough valuable revelations and touching remembrances\r\nof the years preceding his literary debut. His worthy biographer, H.\r\nEdouard Maynial, after collecting intelligently all the writings,\r\ncondensing and comparing them, has been able to give us some definite\r\ninformation regarding that early period.\r\n\r\nI will simply recall that he was born on the 5th of August, 1850, near\r\nDieppe, in the castle of Miromesnil which he describes in Une Vie. . . .\r\n\r\nMaupassant, like Flaubert, was a Norman, through his mother, and through\r\nhis place of birth he belonged to that strange and adventurous race,\r\nwhose heroic and long voyages on tramp trading ships he liked to recall.\r\nAnd just as the author of \xe2\x80\x9cEducation sentimentale\xe2\x80\x9d seems to have\r\ninherited in the paternal line the shrewd realism of Champagne, so de\r\nMaupassant appears to have inherited from his Lorraine ancestors their\r\nindestructible discipline and cold lucidity.\r\n\r\nHis childhood was passed at Etretat, his beautiful childhood; it was\r\nthere that his instincts were awakened in the unfoldment of his\r\nprehistoric soul. Years went by in an ecstasy of physical happiness. The\r\ndelight of running at full speed through fields of gorse, the charm of\r\nvoyages of discovery in hollows and ravines, games beneath the dark\r\nhedges, a passion for going to sea with the fishermen and, on nights\r\nwhen there was no moon, for dreaming on their boats of imaginary\r\nvoyages.\r\n\r\nMme. de Maupassant, who had guided her son's early reading, and had\r\ngazed with him at the sublime spectacle of nature, put, off as long as\r\npossible the hour of separation. One day, however, she had to take the\r\nchild to the little seminary at Yvetot. Later, he became a student at\r\nthe college at Rouen, and became a literary correspondent of Louis\r\nBouilhet. It was at the latter's house on those Sundays in winter when\r\nthe Norman rain drowned the sound of the bells and dashed against the\r\nwindow panes that the school boy learned to write poetry.\r\n\r\nVacation took the rhetorician back to the north of Normandy. Now it was\r\nshooting at Saint Julien l'Hospitalier, across fields, bogs, and through\r\nthe woods. From that time on he sealed his pact with the earth, and\r\nthose \xe2\x80\x9cdeep and delicate roots\xe2\x80\x9d which attached him to his native soil\r\nbegan to grow. It was of Normandy, broad, fresh and virile, that he\r\nwould presently demand his inspiration, fervent and eager as a boy's\r\nlove; it was in her that he would take refuge when, weary of life, he\r\nwould implore a truce, or when he simply wished to work and revive his\r\nenergies in old-time joys. It was at this time that was born in him that\r\nvoluptuous love of the sea, which in later days could alone withdraw him\r\nfrom the world, calm him, console him.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 he lived in the country, then he came to Paris to live; for, the\r\nfamily fortunes having dwindled, he had to look for a position. For\r\nseveral years he was a clerk in the Ministry of Marine, where he turned\r\nover musty papers, in the uninteresting company of the clerks of the\r\nadmiralty.\r\n\r\nThen he went into the department of Public Instruction, where\r\nbureaucratic servility is less intolerable. The daily duties are\r\ncertainly scarcely more onerous and he had as chiefs, or colleagues,\r\nXavier Charmes and Leon Dierx, Henry Roujon and Rene Billotte, but his\r\noffice looked out on a beautiful melancholy garden with immense plane\r\ntrees around which black circles of crows gathered in winter.\r\n\r\nMaupassant made two divisions of his spare hours, one for boating, and\r\nthe other for literature. Every evening in spring, every free day, he\r\nran down to the river whose mysterious current veiled in fog or\r\nsparkling in the sun called to him and bewitched him. In the islands in\r\nthe Seine between Chatou and Port-Marly, on the banks of Sartrouville\r\nand Triel he was long noted among the population of boatmen, who have\r\nnow vanished, for his unwearying biceps, his cynical gaiety of good-\r\nfellowship, his unfailing practical jokes, his broad witticisms.\r\nSometimes he would row with frantic speed, free and joyous, through the\r\nglowing sunlight on the stream; sometimes, he would wander along the\r\ncoast, questioning the sailors, chatting with the ravageurs, or junk\r\ngatherers, or stretched at full length amid the irises and tansy he\r\nwould lie for hours watching the frail insects that play on the surface\r\nof the stream, water spiders, or white butterflies, dragon flies,\r\nchasing each other amid the willow leaves, or frogs asleep on the lily-\r\npads.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his life was taken up by his work. Without ever becoming\r\ndespondent, silent and persistent, he accumulated manuscripts, poetry,\r\ncriticisms, plays, romances and novels. Every week he docilely submitted\r\nhis work to the great Flaubert, the childhood friend of his mother and\r\nhis uncle Alfred Le Poittevin. The master had consented to assist the\r\nyoung man, to reveal to him the secrets that make chefs-d'oeuvre\r\nimmortal. It was he who compelled him to make copious research and to\r\nuse direct observation and who inculcated in him a horror of vulgarity\r\nand a contempt for facility.\r\n\r\nMaupassant himself tells us of those severe initiations in the Rue\r\nMurillo, or in the tent at Croisset; he has recalled the implacable\r\ndidactics of his old master, his tender brutality, the paternal advice\r\nof his generous and candid heart. For seven years Flaubert slashed,\r\npulverized, the awkward attempts of his pupil whose success remained\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in a flight of spontaneous perfection, he wrote Boule de Suif.\r\nHis master's joy was great and overwhelming. He died two months later.\r\n\r\nUntil the end Maupassant remained illuminated by the reflection of the\r\ngood, vanished giant, by that touching reflection that comes from the\r\ndead to those souls they have so profoundly stirred. The worship of\r\nFlaubert was a religion from which nothing could distract him, neither\r\nwork, nor glory, nor slow moving waves, nor balmy nights.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his short life, while his mind was still clear: he wrote\r\nto a friend: \xe2\x80\x9cI am always thinking of my poor Flaubert, and I say to\r\nmyself that I should like to die if I were sure that anyone would think\r\nof me in the same manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring these long years of his novitiate Maupassant had entered the\r\nsocial literary circles. He would remain silent, preoccupied; and if\r\nanyone, astonished at his silence, asked him about his plans he answered\r\nsimply: \xe2\x80\x9cI am learning my trade.\xe2\x80\x9d However, under the pseudonym of Guy de\r\nValmont, he had sent some articles to the newspapers, and, later, with\r\nthe approval and by the advice of Flaubert, he published, in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepublique des Lettres,\xe2\x80\x9d poems signed by his name.\r\n\r\nThese poems, overflowing with sensuality, where the hymn to the Earth\r\ndescribes the transports of physical possession, where the impatience of\r\nlove expresses itself in loud melancholy appeals like the calls of\r\nanimals in the spring nights, are valuable chiefly inasmuch as they\r\nreveal the creature of instinct, the fawn escaped from his native\r\nforests, that Maupassant was in his early youth. But they add nothing to\r\nhis glory. They are the \xe2\x80\x9crhymes of a prose writer\xe2\x80\x9d as Jules Lemaitre\r\nsaid. To mould the expression of his thought according to the strictest\r\nlaws, and to \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow it down\xe2\x80\x9d to some extent, such was his aim.\r\nFollowing the example of one of his comrades of Medan, being readily\r\ncarried away by precision of style and the rhythm of sentences, by the\r\nimperious rule of the ballad, of the pantoum or the chant royal,\r\nMaupassant also desired to write in metrical lines. However, he never\r\nliked this collection that he often regretted having published. His\r\nencounters with prosody had left him with that monotonous weariness that\r\nthe horseman and the fencer feel after a period in the riding school, or\r\na bout with the foils.\r\n\r\nSuch, in very broad lines, is the story of Maupassant's literary\r\napprenticeship.\r\n\r\nThe day following the publication of \xe2\x80\x9cBoule de Suif,\xe2\x80\x9d his reputation\r\nbegan to grow rapidly. The quality of his story was unrivalled, but at\r\nthe same time it must be acknowledged that there were some who, for the\r\nsake of discussion, desired to place a young reputation in opposition to\r\nthe triumphant brutality of Zola.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, Maupassant, at the solicitation of the entire press,\r\nset to work and wrote story after story. His talent, free from all\r\ninfluences, his individuality, are not disputed for a moment. With a\r\nquick step, steady and alert, he advanced to fame, a fame of which he\r\nhimself was not aware, but which was so universal, that no contemporary\r\nauthor during his life ever experienced the same. The \xe2\x80\x9cmeteor\xe2\x80\x9d sent out\r\nits light and its rays were prolonged without limit, in article after\r\narticle, volume on volume.\r\n\r\nHe was now rich and famous . . . . He is esteemed all the more as they\r\nbelieve him to be rich and happy. But they do not know that this young\r\nfellow with the sunburnt face, thick neck and salient muscles whom they\r\ninvariably compare to a young bull at liberty, and whose love affairs\r\nthey whisper, is ill, very ill. At the very moment that success came to\r\nhim, the malady that never afterwards left him came also, and, seated\r\nmotionless at his side, gazed at him with its threatening countenance.\r\nHe suffered from terrible headaches, followed by nights of insomnia. He\r\nhad nervous attacks, which he soothed with narcotics and anesthetics,\r\nwhich he used freely. His sight, which had troubled him at intervals,\r\nbecame affected, and a celebrated oculist spoke of abnormality, asymetry\r\nof the pupils. The famous young man trembled in secret and was haunted\r\nby all kinds of terrors.\r\n\r\nThe reader is charmed at the saneness of this revived art and yet, here\r\nand there, he is surprised to discover, amid descriptions of nature that\r\nare full of humanity, disquieting flights towards the supernatural,\r\ndistressing conjurations, veiled at first, of the most commonplace, the\r\nmost vertiginous shuddering fits of fear, as old as the world and as\r\neternal as the unknown. But, instead of being alarmed, he thinks that\r\nthe author must be gifted with infallible intuition to follow out thus\r\nthe taints in his characters, even through their most dangerous mazes.\r\nThe reader does not know that these hallucinations which he describes so\r\nminutely were experienced by Maupassant himself; he does not know that\r\nthe fear is in himself, the anguish of fear \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is not caused by the\r\npresence of danger, or of inevitable death, but by certain abnormal\r\nconditions, by certain mysterious influences in presence of vague\r\ndangers,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cfear of fear, the dread of that horrible sensation of\r\nincomprehensible terror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow can one explain these physical sufferings and this morbid distress\r\nthat were known for some time to his intimates alone? Alas! the\r\nexplanation is only too simple. All his life, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, Maupassant fought this malady, hidden as yet, which was\r\nlatent in him.\r\n\r\nAs his malady began to take a more definite form, he turned his steps\r\ntowards the south, only visiting Paris to see his physicians and\r\npublishers. In the old port of Antibes beyond the causeway of Cannes,\r\nhis yacht, Bel Ami, which he cherished as a brother, lay at anchor and\r\nawaited him. He took it to the white cities of the Genoese Gulf, towards\r\nthe palm trees of Hyeres, or the red bay trees of Antheor.\r\n\r\nAfter several tragic weeks in which, from instinct, he made a desperate\r\nfight, on the 1st of January, 1892, he felt he was hopelessly\r\nvanquished, and in a moment of supreme clearness of intellect, like\r\nGerard de Nerval, he attempted suicide. Less fortunate than the author\r\nof Sylvia, he was unsuccessful. But his mind, henceforth \xe2\x80\x9cindifferent to\r\nall unhappiness,\xe2\x80\x9d had entered into eternal darkness.\r\n\r\nHe was taken back to Paris and placed in Dr. Meuriot's sanatorium,\r\nwhere, after eighteen months of mechanical existence, the \xe2\x80\x9cmeteor\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nquietly passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOULE DE SUIF\r\n\r\nFor several days in succession fragments of a defeated army had passed\r\nthrough the town. They were mere disorganized bands, not disciplined\r\nforces. The men wore long, dirty beards and tattered uniforms; they\r\nadvanced in listless fashion, without a flag, without a leader. All\r\nseemed exhausted, worn out, incapable of thought or resolve, marching\r\nonward merely by force of habit, and dropping to the ground with fatigue\r\nthe moment they halted. One saw, in particular, many enlisted men,\r\npeaceful citizens, men who lived quietly on their income, bending\r\nbeneath the weight of their rifles; and little active volunteers, easily\r\nfrightened but full of enthusiasm, as eager to attack as they were ready\r\nto take to flight; and amid these, a sprinkling of red-breeched\r\nsoldiers, the pitiful remnant of a division cut down in a great battle;\r\nsomber artillerymen, side by side with nondescript foot-soldiers; and,\r\nhere and there, the gleaming helmet of a heavy-footed dragoon who had\r\ndifficulty in keeping up with the quicker pace of the soldiers of the\r\nline. Legions of irregulars with high-sounding names \xe2\x80\x9cAvengers of\r\nDefeat,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCitizens of the Tomb,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBrethren in Death\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94passed in their\r\nturn, looking like banditti. Their leaders, former drapers or grain\r\nmerchants, or tallow or soap chandlers\xe2\x80\x94warriors by force of\r\ncircumstances, officers by reason of their mustachios or their\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94covered with weapons, flannel and gold lace, spoke in an\r\nimpressive manner, discussed plans of campaign, and behaved as though\r\nthey alone bore the fortunes of dying France on their braggart\r\nshoulders; though, in truth, they frequently were afraid of their own\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94scoundrels often brave beyond measure, but pillagers and debauchees.\r\n\r\nRumor had it that the Prussians were about to enter Rouen.\r\n\r\nThe members of the National Guard, who for the past two months had been\r\nreconnoitering with the utmost caution in the neighboring woods,\r\noccasionally shooting their own sentinels, and making ready for fight\r\nwhenever a rabbit rustled in the undergrowth, had now returned to their\r\nhomes. Their arms, their uniforms, all the death-dealing paraphernalia\r\nwith which they had terrified all the milestones along the highroad for\r\neight miles round, had suddenly and marvellously disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe last of the French soldiers had just crossed the Seine on their way\r\nto Pont-Audemer, through Saint-Sever and Bourg-Achard, and in their rear\r\nthe vanquished general, powerless to do aught with the forlorn remnants\r\nof his army, himself dismayed at the final overthrow of a nation\r\naccustomed to victory and disastrously beaten despite its legendary\r\nbravery, walked between two orderlies.\r\n\r\nThen a profound calm, a shuddering, silent dread, settled on the city.\r\nMany a round-paunched citizen, emasculated by years devoted to business,\r\nanxiously awaited the conquerors, trembling lest his roasting-jacks or\r\nkitchen knives should be looked upon as weapons.\r\n\r\nLife seemed to have stopped short; the shops were shut, the streets\r\ndeserted. Now and then an inhabitant, awed by the silence, glided\r\nswiftly by in the shadow of the walls. The anguish of suspense made men\r\neven desire the arrival of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the day following the departure of the French\r\ntroops, a number of uhlans, coming no one knew whence, passed rapidly\r\nthrough the town. A little later on, a black mass descended St.\r\nCatherine's Hill, while two other invading bodies appeared respectively\r\non the Darnetal and the Boisguillaume roads. The advance guards of the\r\nthree corps arrived at precisely the same moment at the Square of the\r\nHotel de Ville, and the German army poured through all the adjacent\r\nstreets, its battalions making the pavement ring with their firm,\r\nmeasured tread.\r\n\r\nOrders shouted in an unknown, guttural tongue rose to the windows of the\r\nseemingly dead, deserted houses; while behind the fast-closed shutters\r\neager eyes peered forth at the victors-masters now of the city, its\r\nfortunes, and its lives, by \xe2\x80\x9cright of war.\xe2\x80\x9d The inhabitants, in their\r\ndarkened rooms, were possessed by that terror which follows in the wake\r\nof cataclysms, of deadly upheavals of the earth, against which all human\r\nskill and strength are vain. For the same thing happens whenever the\r\nestablished order of things is upset, when security no longer exists,\r\nwhen all those rights usually protected by the law of man or of Nature\r\nare at the mercy of unreasoning, savage force. The earthquake crushing a\r\nwhole nation under falling roofs; the flood let loose, and engulfing in\r\nits swirling depths the corpses of drowned peasants, along with dead\r\noxen and beams torn from shattered houses; or the army, covered with\r\nglory, murdering those who defend themselves, making prisoners of the\r\nrest, pillaging in the name of the Sword, and giving thanks to God to\r\nthe thunder of cannon\xe2\x80\x94all these are appalling scourges, which destroy\r\nall belief in eternal justice, all that confidence we have been taught\r\nto feel in the protection of Heaven and the reason of man.\r\n\r\nSmall detachments of soldiers knocked at each door, and then disappeared\r\nwithin the houses; for the vanquished saw they would have to be civil to\r\ntheir conquerors.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a short time, once the first terror had subsided, calm was\r\nagain restored. In many houses the Prussian officer ate at the same\r\ntable with the family. He was often well-bred, and, out of politeness,\r\nexpressed sympathy with France and repugnance at being compelled to take\r\npart in the war. This sentiment was received with gratitude; besides,\r\nhis protection might be needful some day or other. By the exercise of\r\ntact the number of men quartered in one's house might be reduced; and\r\nwhy should one provoke the hostility of a person on whom one's whole\r\nwelfare depended? Such conduct would savor less of bravery than of fool-\r\nhardiness. And foolhardiness is no longer a failing of the citizens of\r\nRouen as it was in the days when their city earned renown by its heroic\r\ndefenses. Last of all-final argument based on the national\r\npoliteness\xe2\x80\x94the folk of Rouen said to one another that it was only right\r\nto be civil in one's own house, provided there was no public exhibition\r\nof familiarity with the foreigner. Out of doors, therefore, citizen and\r\nsoldier did not know each other; but in the house both chatted freely,\r\nand each evening the German remained a little longer warming himself at\r\nthe hospitable hearth.\r\n\r\nEven the town itself resumed by degrees its ordinary aspect. The French\r\nseldom walked abroad, but the streets swarmed with Prussian soldiers.\r\nMoreover, the officers of the Blue Hussars, who arrogantly dragged their\r\ninstruments of death along the pavements, seemed to hold the simple\r\ntownsmen in but little more contempt than did the French cavalry\r\nofficers who had drunk at the same cafes the year before.\r\n\r\nBut there was something in the air, a something strange and subtle, an\r\nintolerable foreign atmosphere like a penetrating odor\xe2\x80\x94the odor of\r\ninvasion. It permeated dwellings and places of public resort, changed\r\nthe taste of food, made one imagine one's self in far-distant lands,\r\namid dangerous, barbaric tribes.\r\n\r\nThe conquerors exacted money, much money. The inhabitants paid what was\r\nasked; they were rich. But, the wealthier a Norman tradesman becomes,\r\nthe more he suffers at having to part with anything that belongs to him,\r\nat having to see any portion of his substance pass into the hands of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, within six or seven miles of the town, along the course of\r\nthe river as it flows onward to Croisset, Dieppedalle and Biessart,\r\nboat-men and fishermen often hauled to the surface of the water the body\r\nof a German, bloated in his uniform, killed by a blow from knife or\r\nclub, his head crushed by a stone, or perchance pushed from some bridge\r\ninto the stream below. The mud of the river-bed swallowed up these\r\nobscure acts of vengeance\xe2\x80\x94savage, yet legitimate; these unrecorded deeds\r\nof bravery; these silent attacks fraught with greater danger than\r\nbattles fought in broad day, and surrounded, moreover, with no halo of\r\nromance. For hatred of the foreigner ever arms a few intrepid souls,\r\nready to die for an idea.\r\n\r\nAt last, as the invaders, though subjecting the town to the strictest\r\ndiscipline, had not committed any of the deeds of horror with which they\r\nhad been credited while on their triumphal march, the people grew\r\nbolder, and the necessities of business again animated the breasts of\r\nthe local merchants. Some of these had important commercial interests at\r\nHavre \xe2\x80\x94occupied at present by the French army\xe2\x80\x94and wished to attempt to\r\nreach that port by overland route to Dieppe, taking the boat from there.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of the German officers whose acquaintance they had\r\nmade, they obtained a permit to leave town from the general in command.\r\n\r\nA large four-horse coach having, therefore, been engaged for the\r\njourney, and ten passengers having given in their names to the\r\nproprietor, they decided to start on a certain Tuesday morning before\r\ndaybreak, to avoid attracting a crowd.\r\n\r\nThe ground had been frozen hard for some time-past, and about three\r\no'clock on Monday afternoon\xe2\x80\x94large black clouds from the north shed their\r\nburden of snow uninterruptedly all through that evening and night.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four in the morning the travellers met in the courtyard of\r\nthe Hotel de Normandie, where they were to take their seats in the\r\ncoach.\r\n\r\nThey were still half asleep, and shivering with cold under their wraps.\r\nThey could see one another but indistinctly in the darkness, and the\r\nmountain of heavy winter wraps in which each was swathed made them look\r\nlike a gathering of obese priests in their long cassocks. But two men\r\nrecognized each other, a third accosted them, and the three began to\r\ntalk. \xe2\x80\x9cI am bringing my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said one. \xe2\x80\x9cSo am I.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, too.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nfirst speaker added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not return to Rouen, and if the Prussians\r\napproach Havre we will cross to England.\xe2\x80\x9d All three, it turned out, had\r\nmade the same plans, being of similar disposition and temperament.\r\n\r\nStill the horses were not harnessed. A small lantern carried by a\r\nstable-boy emerged now and then from one dark doorway to disappear\r\nimmediately in another. The stamping of horses' hoofs, deadened by the\r\ndung and straw of the stable, was heard from time to time, and from\r\ninside the building issued a man's voice, talking to the animals and\r\nswearing at them. A faint tinkle of bells showed that the harness was\r\nbeing got ready; this tinkle soon developed into a continuous jingling,\r\nlouder or softer according to the movements of the horse, sometimes\r\nstopping altogether, then breaking out in a sudden peal accompanied by a\r\npawing of the ground by an iron-shod hoof.\r\n\r\nThe door suddenly closed. All noise ceased.\r\n\r\nThe frozen townsmen were silent; they remained motionless, stiff with\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nA thick curtain of glistening white flakes fell ceaselessly to the\r\nground; it obliterated all outlines, enveloped all objects in an icy\r\nmantle of foam; nothing was to be heard throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of the silent, winter-bound city save the vague, nameless rustle\r\nof falling snow\xe2\x80\x94a sensation rather than a sound\xe2\x80\x94the gentle mingling of\r\nlight atoms which seemed to fill all space, to cover the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe man reappeared with his lantern, leading by a rope a melancholy-\r\nlooking horse, evidently being led out against his inclination. The\r\nhostler placed him beside the pole, fastened the traces, and spent some\r\ntime in walking round him to make sure that the harness was all right;\r\nfor he could use only one hand, the other being engaged in holding the\r\nlantern. As he was about to fetch the second horse he noticed the\r\nmotionless group of travellers, already white with snow, and said to\r\nthem: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't you get inside the coach? You'd be under shelter, at\r\nleast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis did not seem to have occurred to them, and they at once took his\r\nadvice. The three men seated their wives at the far end of the coach,\r\nthen got in themselves; lastly the other vague, snow-shrouded forms\r\nclambered to the remaining places without a word.\r\n\r\nThe floor was covered with straw, into which the feet sank. The ladies\r\nat the far end, having brought with them little copper foot-warmers\r\nheated by means of a kind of chemical fuel, proceeded to light these,\r\nand spent some time in expatiating in low tones on their advantages,\r\nsaying over and over again things which they had all known for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAt last, six horses instead of four having been harnessed to the\r\ndiligence, on account of the heavy roads, a voice outside asked: \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nevery one there?\xe2\x80\x9d To which a voice from the interior replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthey set out.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle moved slowly, slowly, at a snail's pace; the wheels sank\r\ninto the snow; the entire body of the coach creaked and groaned; the\r\nhorses slipped, puffed, steamed, and the coachman's long whip cracked\r\nincessantly, flying hither and thither, coiling up, then flinging out\r\nits length like a slender serpent, as it lashed some rounded flank,\r\nwhich instantly grew tense as it strained in further effort.\r\n\r\nBut the day grew apace. Those light flakes which one traveller, a native\r\nof Rouen, had compared to a rain of cotton fell no longer. A murky light\r\nfiltered through dark, heavy clouds, which made the country more\r\ndazzlingly white by contrast, a whiteness broken sometimes by a row of\r\ntall trees spangled with hoarfrost, or by a cottage roof hooded in snow.\r\n\r\nWithin the coach the passengers eyed one another curiously in the dim\r\nlight of dawn.\r\n\r\nRight at the back, in the best seats of all, Monsieur and Madame\r\nLoiseau, wholesale wine merchants of the Rue Grand-Pont, slumbered\r\nopposite each other. Formerly clerk to a merchant who had failed in\r\nbusiness, Loiseau had bought his master's interest, and made a fortune\r\nfor himself. He sold very bad wine at a very low price to the retail-\r\ndealers in the country, and had the reputation, among his friends and\r\nacquaintances, of being a shrewd rascal a true Norman, full of quips and\r\nwiles. So well established was his character as a cheat that, in the\r\nmouths of the citizens of Rouen, the very name of Loiseau became a\r\nbyword for sharp practice.\r\n\r\nAbove and beyond this, Loiseau was noted for his practical jokes of\r\nevery description\xe2\x80\x94his tricks, good or ill-natured; and no one could\r\nmention his name without adding at once: \xe2\x80\x9cHe's an extraordinary\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94Loiseau.\xe2\x80\x9d He was undersized and potbellied, had a florid face with\r\ngrayish whiskers.\r\n\r\nHis wife-tall, strong, determined, with a loud voice and decided manner\r\n\xe2\x80\x94represented the spirit of order and arithmetic in the business house\r\nwhich Loiseau enlivened by his jovial activity.\r\n\r\nBeside them, dignified in bearing, belonging to a superior caste, sat\r\nMonsieur Carre-Lamadon, a man of considerable importance, a king in the\r\ncotton trade, proprietor of three spinning-mills, officer of the Legion\r\nof Honor, and member of the General Council. During the whole time the\r\nEmpire was in the ascendancy he remained the chief of the well-disposed\r\nOpposition, merely in order to command a higher value for his devotion\r\nwhen he should rally to the cause which he meanwhile opposed with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccourteous weapons,\xe2\x80\x9d to use his own expression.\r\n\r\nMadame Carre-Lamadon, much younger than her husband, was the consolation\r\nof all the officers of good family quartered at Rouen. Pretty, slender,\r\ngraceful, she sat opposite her husband, curled up in her furs, and\r\ngazing mournfully at the sorry interior of the coach.\r\n\r\nHer neighbors, the Comte and Comtesse Hubert de Breville, bore one of\r\nthe noblest and most ancient names in Normandy. The count, a nobleman\r\nadvanced in years and of aristocratic bearing, strove to enhance by\r\nevery artifice of the toilet, his natural resemblance to King Henry IV,\r\nwho, according to a legend of which the family were inordinately proud,\r\nhad been the favored lover of a De Breville lady, and father of her\r\nchild \xe2\x80\x94the frail one's husband having, in recognition of this fact, been\r\nmade a count and governor of a province.\r\n\r\nA colleague of Monsieur Carre-Lamadon in the General Council, Count\r\nHubert represented the Orleanist party in his department. The story of\r\nhis marriage with the daughter of a small shipowner at Nantes had always\r\nremained more or less of a mystery. But as the countess had an air of\r\nunmistakable breeding, entertained faultlessly, and was even supposed to\r\nhave been loved by a son of Louis-Philippe, the nobility vied with one\r\nanother in doing her honor, and her drawing-room remained the most\r\nselect in the whole countryside\xe2\x80\x94the only one which retained the old\r\nspirit of gallantry, and to which access was not easy.\r\n\r\nThe fortune of the Brevilles, all in real estate, amounted, it was said,\r\nto five hundred thousand francs a year.\r\n\r\nThese six people occupied the farther end of the coach, and represented\r\nSociety\xe2\x80\x94with an income\xe2\x80\x94the strong, established society of good people\r\nwith religion and principle.\r\n\r\nIt happened by chance that all the women were seated on the same side;\r\nand the countess had, moreover, as neighbors two nuns, who spent the\r\ntime in fingering their long rosaries and murmuring paternosters and\r\naves. One of them was old, and so deeply pitted with smallpox that she\r\nlooked for all the world as if she had received a charge of shot full in\r\nthe face. The other, of sickly appearance, had a pretty but wasted\r\ncountenance, and a narrow, consumptive chest, sapped by that devouring\r\nfaith which is the making of martyrs and visionaries.\r\n\r\nA man and woman, sitting opposite the two nuns, attracted all eyes.\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x94a well-known character\xe2\x80\x94was Cornudet, the democrat, the terror of\r\nall respectable people. For the past twenty years his big red beard had\r\nbeen on terms of intimate acquaintance with the tankards of all the\r\nrepublican cafes. With the help of his comrades and brethren he had\r\ndissipated a respectable fortune left him by his father, an old-\r\nestablished confectioner, and he now impatiently awaited the Republic,\r\nthat he might at last be rewarded with the post he had earned by his\r\nrevolutionary orgies. On the fourth of September\xe2\x80\x94possibly as the result\r\nof a practical joke\xe2\x80\x94he was led to believe that he had been appointed\r\nprefect; but when he attempted to take up the duties of the position the\r\nclerks in charge of the office refused to recognize his authority, and\r\nhe was compelled in consequence to retire. A good sort of fellow in\r\nother respects, inoffensive and obliging, he had thrown himself\r\nzealously into the work of making an organized defence of the town. He\r\nhad had pits dug in the level country, young forest trees felled, and\r\ntraps set on all the roads; then at the approach of the enemy,\r\nthoroughly satisfied with his preparations, he had hastily returned to\r\nthe town. He thought he might now do more good at Havre, where new\r\nintrenchments would soon be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe woman, who belonged to the courtesan class, was celebrated for an\r\nembonpoint unusual for her age, which had earned for her the sobriquet\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cBoule de Suif\xe2\x80\x9d (Tallow Ball). Short and round, fat as a pig, with\r\npuffy fingers constricted at the joints, looking like rows of short\r\nsausages; with a shiny, tightly-stretched skin and an enormous bust\r\nfilling out the bodice of her dress, she was yet attractive and much\r\nsought after, owing to her fresh and pleasing appearance. Her face was\r\nlike a crimson apple, a peony-bud just bursting into bloom; she had two\r\nmagnificent dark eyes, fringed with thick, heavy lashes, which cast a\r\nshadow into their depths; her mouth was small, ripe, kissable, and was\r\nfurnished with the tiniest of white teeth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was recognized the respectable matrons of the party began\r\nto whisper among themselves, and the words \xe2\x80\x9chussy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpublic scandal\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwere uttered so loudly that Boule de Suif raised her head. She forthwith\r\ncast such a challenging, bold look at her neighbors that a sudden\r\nsilence fell on the company, and all lowered their eyes, with the\r\nexception of Loiseau, who watched her with evident interest.\r\n\r\nBut conversation was soon resumed among the three ladies, whom the\r\npresence of this girl had suddenly drawn together in the bonds of\r\nfriendship\xe2\x80\x94one might almost say in those of intimacy. They decided that\r\nthey ought to combine, as it were, in their dignity as wives in face of\r\nthis shameless hussy; for legitimized love always despises its easygoing\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe three men, also, brought together by a certain conservative instinct\r\nawakened by the presence of Cornudet, spoke of money matters in a tone\r\nexpressive of contempt for the poor. Count Hubert related the losses he\r\nhad sustained at the hands of the Prussians, spoke of the cattle which\r\nhad been stolen from him, the crops which had been ruined, with the easy\r\nmanner of a nobleman who was also a tenfold millionaire, and whom such\r\nreverses would scarcely inconvenience for a single year. Monsieur Carre-\r\nLamadon, a man of wide experience in the cotton industry, had taken care\r\nto send six hundred thousand francs to England as provision against the\r\nrainy day he was always anticipating. As for Loiseau, he had managed to\r\nsell to the French commissariat department all the wines he had in\r\nstock, so that the state now owed him a considerable sum, which he hoped\r\nto receive at Havre.\r\n\r\nAnd all three eyed one another in friendly, well-disposed fashion.\r\nAlthough of varying social status, they were united in the brotherhood\r\nof money\xe2\x80\x94in that vast freemasonry made up of those who possess, who can\r\njingle gold wherever they choose to put their hands into their breeches'\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nThe coach went along so slowly that at ten o'clock in the morning it had\r\nnot covered twelve miles. Three times the men of the party got out and\r\nclimbed the hills on foot. The passengers were becoming uneasy, for they\r\nhad counted on lunching at Totes, and it seemed now as if they would\r\nhardly arrive there before nightfall. Every one was eagerly looking out\r\nfor an inn by the roadside, when, suddenly, the coach foundered in a\r\nsnowdrift, and it took two hours to extricate it.\r\n\r\nAs appetites increased, their spirits fell; no inn, no wine shop could\r\nbe discovered, the approach of the Prussians and the transit of the\r\nstarving French troops having frightened away all business.\r\n\r\nThe men sought food in the farmhouses beside the road, but could not\r\nfind so much as a crust of bread; for the suspicious peasant invariably\r\nhid his stores for fear of being pillaged by the soldiers, who, being\r\nentirely without food, would take violent possession of everything they\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nAbout one o'clock Loiseau announced that he positively had a big hollow\r\nin his stomach. They had all been suffering in the same way for some\r\ntime, and the increasing gnawings of hunger had put an end to all\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nNow and then some one yawned, another followed his example, and each in\r\nturn, according to his character, breeding and social position, yawned\r\neither quietly or noisily, placing his hand before the gaping void\r\nwhence issued breath condensed into vapor.\r\n\r\nSeveral times Boule de Suif stooped, as if searching for something under\r\nher petticoats. She would hesitate a moment, look at her neighbors, and\r\nthen quietly sit upright again. All faces were pale and drawn. Loiseau\r\ndeclared he would give a thousand francs for a knuckle of ham. His wife\r\nmade an involuntary and quickly checked gesture of protest. It always\r\nhurt her to hear of money being squandered, and she could not even\r\nunderstand jokes on such a subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a matter of fact, I don't feel well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did I not\r\nthink of bringing provisions?\xe2\x80\x9d Each one reproached himself in similar\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nCornudet, however, had a bottle of rum, which he offered to his\r\nneighbors. They all coldly refused except Loiseau, who took a sip, and\r\nreturned the bottle with thanks, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThat's good stuff; it warms\r\none up, and cheats the appetite.\xe2\x80\x9d The alcohol put him in good humor, and\r\nhe proposed they should do as the sailors did in the song: eat the\r\nfattest of the passengers. This indirect allusion to Boule de Suif\r\nshocked the respectable members of the party. No one replied; only\r\nCornudet smiled. The two good sisters had ceased to mumble their rosary,\r\nand, with hands enfolded in their wide sleeves, sat motionless, their\r\neyes steadfastly cast down, doubtless offering up as a sacrifice to\r\nHeaven the suffering it had sent them.\r\n\r\nAt last, at three o'clock, as they were in the midst of an apparently\r\nlimitless plain, with not a single village in sight, Boule de Suif\r\nstooped quickly, and drew from underneath the seat a large basket\r\ncovered with a white napkin.\r\n\r\nFrom this she extracted first of all a small earthenware plate and a\r\nsilver drinking cup, then an enormous dish containing two whole chickens\r\ncut into joints and imbedded in jelly. The basket was seen to contain\r\nother good things: pies, fruit, dainties of all sorts-provisions, in\r\nfine, for a three days' journey, rendering their owner independent of\r\nwayside inns. The necks of four bottles protruded from among the food.\r\nShe took a chicken wing, and began to eat it daintily, together with one\r\nof those rolls called in Normandy \xe2\x80\x9cRegence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll looks were directed toward her. An odor of food filled the air,\r\ncausing nostrils to dilate, mouths to water, and jaws to contract\r\npainfully. The scorn of the ladies for this disreputable female grew\r\npositively ferocious; they would have liked to kill her, or throw, her\r\nand her drinking cup, her basket, and her provisions, out of the coach\r\ninto the snow of the road below.\r\n\r\nBut Loiseau's gaze was fixed greedily on the dish of chicken. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, this lady had more forethought than the rest of us. Some\r\npeople think of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like some, sir? It is hard to go on fasting all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul, I can't refuse; I cannot hold out another minute. All is\r\nfair in war time, is it not, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d And, casting a glance on those\r\naround, he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt times like this it is very pleasant to meet with obliging people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spread a newspaper over his knees to avoid soiling his trousers, and,\r\nwith a pocketknife he always carried, helped himself to a chicken leg\r\ncoated with jelly, which he thereupon proceeded to devour.\r\n\r\nThen Boule le Suif, in low, humble tones, invited the nuns to partake of\r\nher repast. They both accepted the offer unhesitatingly, and after a few\r\nstammered words of thanks began to eat quickly, without raising their\r\neyes. Neither did Cornudet refuse his neighbor's offer, and, in\r\ncombination with the nuns, a sort of table was formed by opening out the\r\nnewspaper over the four pairs of knees.\r\n\r\nMouths kept opening and shutting, ferociously masticating and devouring\r\nthe food. Loiseau, in his corner, was hard at work, and in low tones\r\nurged his wife to follow his example. She held out for a long time, but\r\noverstrained Nature gave way at last. Her husband, assuming his politest\r\nmanner, asked their \xe2\x80\x9ccharming companion\xe2\x80\x9d if he might be allowed to offer\r\nMadame Loiseau a small helping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with an amiable smile, holding out\r\nthe dish.\r\n\r\nWhen the first bottle of claret was opened some embarrassment was caused\r\nby the fact that there was only one drinking cup, but this was passed\r\nfrom one to another, after being wiped. Cornudet alone, doubtless in a\r\nspirit of gallantry, raised to his own lips that part of the rim which\r\nwas still moist from those of his fair neighbor.\r\n\r\nThen, surrounded by people who were eating, and well-nigh suffocated by\r\nthe odor of food, the Comte and Comtesse de Breville and Monsieur and\r\nMadame Carre-Lamadon endured that hateful form of torture which has\r\nperpetuated the name of Tantalus. All at once the manufacturer's young\r\nwife heaved a sigh which made every one turn and look at her; she was\r\nwhite as the snow without; her eyes closed, her head fell forward; she\r\nhad fainted. Her husband, beside himself, implored the help of his\r\nneighbors. No one seemed to know what to do until the elder of the two\r\nnuns, raising the patient's head, placed Boule de Suif's drinking cup to\r\nher lips, and made her swallow a few drops of wine. The pretty invalid\r\nmoved, opened her eyes, smiled, and declared in a feeble voice that she\r\nwas all right again. But, to prevent a recurrence of the catastrophe,\r\nthe nun made her drink a cupful of claret, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's just hunger\r\n\xe2\x80\x94that's what is wrong with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Boule de Suif, blushing and embarrassed, stammered, looking at the\r\nfour passengers who were still fasting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Mon Dieu', if I might offer these ladies and gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, fearing a snub. But Loiseau continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it all, in such a case as this we are all brothers and sisters and\r\nought to assist each other. Come, come, ladies, don't stand on ceremony,\r\nfor goodness' sake! Do we even know whether we shall find a house in\r\nwhich to pass the night? At our present rate of going we sha'n't be at\r\nTotes till midday to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey hesitated, no one daring to be the first to accept. But the count\r\nsettled the question. He turned toward the abashed girl, and in his most\r\ndistinguished manner said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe accept gratefully, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs usual, it was only the first step that cost. This Rubicon once\r\ncrossed, they set to work with a will. The basket was emptied. It still\r\ncontained a pate de foie gras, a lark pie, a piece of smoked tongue,\r\nCrassane pears, Pont-Leveque gingerbread, fancy cakes, and a cup full of\r\npickled gherkins and onions\xe2\x80\x94Boule de Suif, like all women, being very\r\nfond of indigestible things.\r\n\r\nThey could not eat this girl's provisions without speaking to her. So\r\nthey began to talk, stiffly at first; then, as she seemed by no means\r\nforward, with greater freedom. Mesdames de Breville and Carre-Lamadon,\r\nwho were accomplished women of the world, were gracious and tactful. The\r\ncountess especially displayed that amiable condescension characteristic\r\nof great ladies whom no contact with baser mortals can sully, and was\r\nabsolutely charming. But the sturdy Madame Loiseau, who had the soul of\r\na gendarme, continued morose, speaking little and eating much.\r\n\r\nConversation naturally turned on the war. Terrible stories were told\r\nabout the Prussians, deeds of bravery were recounted of the French; and\r\nall these people who were fleeing themselves were ready to pay homage to\r\nthe courage of their compatriots. Personal experiences soon followed,\r\nand Boule le Suif related with genuine emotion, and with that warmth of\r\nlanguage not uncommon in women of her class and temperament, how it came\r\nabout that she had left Rouen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought at first that I should be able to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy house\r\nwas well stocked with provisions, and it seemed better to put up with\r\nfeeding a few soldiers than to banish myself goodness knows where. But\r\nwhen I saw these Prussians it was too much for me! My blood boiled with\r\nrage; I wept the whole day for very shame. Oh, if only I had been a man!\r\nI looked at them from my window\xe2\x80\x94the fat swine, with their pointed\r\nhelmets!\xe2\x80\x94and my maid held my hands to keep me from throwing my furniture\r\ndown on them. Then some of them were quartered on me; I flew at the\r\nthroat of the first one who entered. They are just as easy to strangle\r\nas other men! And I'd have been the death of that one if I hadn't been\r\ndragged away from him by my hair. I had to hide after that. And as soon\r\nas I could get an opportunity I left the place, and here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was warmly congratulated. She rose in the estimation of her\r\ncompanions, who had not been so brave; and Cornudet listened to her with\r\nthe approving and benevolent smile of an apostle, the smile a priest\r\nmight wear in listening to a devotee praising God; for long-bearded\r\ndemocrats of his type have a monopoly of patriotism, just as priests\r\nhave a monopoly of religion. He held forth in turn, with dogmatic self-\r\nassurance, in the style of the proclamations daily pasted on the walls\r\nof the town, winding up with a specimen of stump oratory in which he\r\nreviled \xe2\x80\x9cthat besotted fool of a Louis-Napoleon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Boule de Suif was indignant, for she was an ardent Bonapartist. She\r\nturned as red as a cherry, and stammered in her wrath: \xe2\x80\x9cI'd just like to\r\nhave seen you in his place\xe2\x80\x94you and your sort! There would have been a\r\nnice mix-up. Oh, yes! It was you who betrayed that man. It would be\r\nimpossible to live in France if we were governed by such rascals as\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCornudet, unmoved by this tirade, still smiled a superior, contemptuous\r\nsmile; and one felt that high words were impending, when the count\r\ninterposed, and, not without difficulty, succeeded in calming the\r\nexasperated woman, saying that all sincere opinions ought to be\r\nrespected. But the countess and the manufacturer's wife, imbued with the\r\nunreasoning hatred of the upper classes for the Republic, and instinct,\r\nmoreover, with the affection felt by all women for the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of despotic government, were drawn, in spite of themselves,\r\ntoward this dignified young woman, whose opinions coincided so closely\r\nwith their own.\r\n\r\nThe basket was empty. The ten people had finished its contents without\r\ndifficulty amid general regret that it did not hold more. Conversation\r\nwent on a little longer, though it flagged somewhat after the passengers\r\nhad finished eating.\r\n\r\nNight fell, the darkness grew deeper and deeper, and the cold made Boule\r\nde Suif shiver, in spite of her plumpness. So Madame de Breville offered\r\nher her foot-warmer, the fuel of which had been several times renewed\r\nsince the morning, and she accepted the offer at once, for her feet were\r\nicy cold. Mesdames Carre-Lamadon and Loiseau gave theirs to the nuns.\r\n\r\nThe driver lighted his lanterns. They cast a bright gleam on a cloud of\r\nvapor which hovered over the sweating flanks of the horses, and on the\r\nroadside snow, which seemed to unroll as they went along in the changing\r\nlight of the lamps.\r\n\r\nAll was now indistinguishable in the coach; but suddenly a movement\r\noccurred in the corner occupied by Boule de Suif and Cornudet; and\r\nLoiseau, peering into the gloom, fancied he saw the big, bearded\r\ndemocrat move hastily to one side, as if he had received a well-\r\ndirected, though noiseless, blow in the dark.\r\n\r\nTiny lights glimmered ahead. It was Totes. The coach had been on the\r\nroad eleven hours, which, with the three hours allotted the horses in\r\nfour periods for feeding and breathing, made fourteen. It entered the\r\ntown, and stopped before the Hotel du Commerce.\r\n\r\nThe coach door opened; a well-known noise made all the travellers start;\r\nit was the clanging of a scabbard, on the pavement; then a voice called\r\nout something in German.\r\n\r\nAlthough the coach had come to a standstill, no one got out; it looked\r\nas if they were afraid of being murdered the moment they left their\r\nseats. Thereupon the driver appeared, holding in his hand one of his\r\nlanterns, which cast a sudden glow on the interior of the coach,\r\nlighting up the double row of startled faces, mouths agape, and eyes\r\nwide open in surprise and terror.\r\n\r\nBeside the driver stood in the full light a German officer, a tall young\r\nman, fair and slender, tightly encased in his uniform like a woman in\r\nher corset, his flat shiny cap, tilted to one side of his head, making\r\nhim look like an English hotel runner. His exaggerated mustache, long\r\nand straight and tapering to a point at either end in a single blond\r\nhair that could hardly be seen, seemed to weigh down the corners of his\r\nmouth and give a droop to his lips.\r\n\r\nIn Alsatian French he requested the travellers to alight, saying\r\nstiffly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly get down, ladies and gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two nuns were the first to obey, manifesting the docility of holy\r\nwomen accustomed to submission on every occasion. Next appeared the\r\ncount and countess, followed by the manufacturer and his wife, after\r\nwhom came Loiseau, pushing his larger and better half before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the officer as he put his foot to the\r\nground, acting on an impulse born of prudence rather than of politeness.\r\nThe other, insolent like all in authority, merely stared without\r\nreplying.\r\n\r\nBoule de Suif and Cornudet, though near the door, were the last to\r\nalight, grave and dignified before the enemy. The stout girl tried to\r\ncontrol herself and appear calm; the democrat stroked his long russet\r\nbeard with a somewhat trembling hand. Both strove to maintain their\r\ndignity, knowing well that at such a time each individual is always\r\nlooked upon as more or less typical of his nation; and, also, resenting\r\nthe complaisant attitude of their companions, Boule de Suif tried to\r\nwear a bolder front than her neighbors, the virtuous women, while he,\r\nfeeling that it was incumbent on him to set a good example, kept up the\r\nattitude of resistance which he had first assumed when he undertook to\r\nmine the high roads round Rouen.\r\n\r\nThey entered the spacious kitchen of the inn, and the German, having\r\ndemanded the passports signed by the general in command, in which were\r\nmentioned the name, description and profession of each traveller,\r\ninspected them all minutely, comparing their appearance with the written\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nThen he said brusquely: \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d and turned on his heel.\r\n\r\nThey breathed freely, All were still hungry; so supper was ordered. Half\r\nan hour was required for its preparation, and while two servants were\r\napparently engaged in getting it ready the travellers went to look at\r\ntheir rooms. These all opened off a long corridor, at the end of which\r\nwas a glazed door with a number on it.\r\n\r\nThey were just about to take their seats at table when the innkeeper\r\nappeared in person. He was a former horse dealer\xe2\x80\x94a large, asthmatic\r\nindividual, always wheezing, coughing, and clearing his throat.\r\nFollenvie was his patronymic.\r\n\r\nHe called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Elisabeth Rousset?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoule de Suif started, and turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle, the Prussian officer wishes to speak to you immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if you are Mademoiselle Elisabeth Rousset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, reflected a moment, and then declared roundly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be; but I'm not going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey moved restlessly around her; every one wondered and speculated as\r\nto the cause of this order. The count approached:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong, madame, for your refusal may bring trouble not only on\r\nyourself but also on all your companions. It never pays to resist those\r\nin authority. Your compliance with this request cannot possibly be\r\nfraught with any danger; it has probably been made because some\r\nformality or other was forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll added their voices to that of the count; Boule de Suif was begged,\r\nurged, lectured, and at last convinced; every one was afraid of the\r\ncomplications which might result from headstrong action on her part. She\r\nsaid finally:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am doing it for your sakes, remember that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe countess took her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are grateful to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left the room. All waited for her return before commencing the meal.\r\nEach was distressed that he or she had not been sent for rather than\r\nthis impulsive, quick-tempered girl, and each mentally rehearsed\r\nplatitudes in case of being summoned also.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of ten minutes she reappeared breathing hard, crimson\r\nwith indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the scoundrel! the scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.\r\n\r\nAll were anxious to know what had happened; but she declined to\r\nenlighten them, and when the count pressed the point, she silenced him\r\nwith much dignity, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the matter has nothing to do with you, and I cannot speak of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they took their places round a high soup tureen, from which issued\r\nan odor of cabbage. In spite of this coincidence, the supper was\r\ncheerful. The cider was good; the Loiseaus and the nuns drank it from\r\nmotives of economy. The others ordered wine; Cornudet demanded beer. He\r\nhad his own fashion of uncorking the bottle and making the beer foam,\r\ngazing at it as he inclined his glass and then raised it to a position\r\nbetween the lamp and his eye that he might judge of its color. When he\r\ndrank, his great beard, which matched the color of his favorite\r\nbeverage, seemed to tremble with affection; his eyes positively squinted\r\nin the endeavor not to lose sight of the beloved glass, and he looked\r\nfor all the world as if he were fulfilling the only function for which\r\nhe was born. He seemed to have established in his mind an affinity\r\nbetween the two great passions of his life\xe2\x80\x94pale ale and revolution\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nassuredly he could not taste the one without dreaming of the other.\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame Follenvie dined at the end of the table. The man,\r\nwheezing like a broken-down locomotive, was too short-winded to talk\r\nwhen he was eating. But the wife was not silent a moment; she told how\r\nthe Prussians had impressed her on their arrival, what they did, what\r\nthey said; execrating them in the first place because they cost her\r\nmoney, and in the second because she had two sons in the army. She\r\naddressed herself principally to the countess, flattered at the\r\nopportunity of talking to a lady of quality.\r\n\r\nThen she lowered her voice, and began to broach delicate subjects. Her\r\nhusband interrupted her from time to time, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would do well to hold your tongue, Madame Follenvie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she took no notice of him, and went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame, these Germans do nothing but eat potatoes and pork, and\r\nthen pork and potatoes. And don't imagine for a moment that they are\r\nclean! No, indeed! And if only you saw them drilling for hours, indeed\r\nfor days, together; they all collect in a field, then they do nothing\r\nbut march backward and forward, and wheel this way and that. If only\r\nthey would cultivate the land, or remain at home and work on their high\r\nroads! Really, madame, these soldiers are of no earthly use! Poor people\r\nhave to feed and keep them, only in order that they may learn how to\r\nkill! True, I am only an old woman with no education, but when I see\r\nthem wearing themselves out marching about from morning till night, I\r\nsay to myself: When there are people who make discoveries that are of\r\nuse to people, why should others take so much trouble to do harm?\r\nReally, now, isn't it a terrible thing to kill people, whether they are\r\nPrussians, or English, or Poles, or French? If we revenge ourselves on\r\nany one who injures us we do wrong, and are punished for it; but when\r\nour sons are shot down like partridges, that is all right, and\r\ndecorations are given to the man who kills the most. No, indeed, I shall\r\nnever be able to understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCornudet raised his voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWar is a barbarous proceeding when we attack a peaceful neighbor, but\r\nit is a sacred duty when undertaken in defence of one's country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked down:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it's another matter when one acts in self-defence; but would it\r\nnot be better to kill all the kings, seeing that they make war just to\r\namuse themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCornudet's eyes kindled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, citizens!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Carre-Lamadon was reflecting profoundly. Although an ardent\r\nadmirer of great generals, the peasant woman's sturdy common sense made\r\nhim reflect on the wealth which might accrue to a country by the\r\nemployment of so many idle hands now maintained at a great expense, of\r\nso much unproductive force, if they were employed in those great\r\nindustrial enterprises which it will take centuries to complete.\r\n\r\nBut Loiseau, leaving his seat, went over to the innkeeper and began\r\nchatting in a low voice. The big man chuckled, coughed, sputtered; his\r\nenormous carcass shook with merriment at the pleasantries of the other;\r\nand he ended by buying six casks of claret from Loiseau to be delivered\r\nin spring, after the departure of the Prussians.\r\n\r\nThe moment supper was over every one went to bed, worn out with fatigue.\r\n\r\nBut Loiseau, who had been making his observations on the sly, sent his\r\nwife to bed, and amused himself by placing first his ear, and then his\r\neye, to the bedroom keyhole, in order to discover what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nmysteries of the corridor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the end of about an hour he heard a rustling, peeped out quickly, and\r\ncaught sight of Boule de Suif, looking more rotund than ever in a\r\ndressing-gown of blue cashmere trimmed with white lace. She held a\r\ncandle in her hand, and directed her steps to the numbered door at the\r\nend of the corridor. But one of the side doors was partly opened, and\r\nwhen, at the end of a few minutes, she returned, Cornudet, in his shirt-\r\nsleeves, followed her. They spoke in low tones, then stopped short.\r\nBoule de Suif seemed to be stoutly denying him admission to her room.\r\nUnfortunately, Loiseau could not at first hear what they said; but\r\ntoward the end of the conversation they raised their voices, and he\r\ncaught a few words. Cornudet was loudly insistent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow silly you are! What does it matter to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe seemed indignant, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my good man, there are times when one does not do that sort of\r\nthing; besides, in this place it would be shameful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently he did not understand, and asked the reason. Then she lost\r\nher temper and her caution, and, raising her voice still higher, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Can't you understand why? When there are Prussians in the house!\r\nPerhaps even in the very next room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent. The patriotic shame of this wanton, who would not suffer\r\nherself to be caressed in the neighborhood of the enemy, must have\r\nroused his dormant dignity, for after bestowing on her a simple kiss he\r\ncrept softly back to his room. Loiseau, much edified, capered round the\r\nbedroom before taking his place beside his slumbering spouse.\r\n\r\nThen silence reigned throughout the house. But soon there arose from\r\nsome remote part\xe2\x80\x94it might easily have been either cellar or attic\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nstertorous, monotonous, regular snoring, a dull, prolonged rumbling,\r\nvaried by tremors like those of a boiler under pressure of steam.\r\nMonsieur Follenvie had gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nAs they had decided on starting at eight o'clock the next morning, every\r\none was in the kitchen at that hour; but the coach, its roof covered\r\nwith snow, stood by itself in the middle of the yard, without either\r\nhorses or driver. They sought the latter in the stables, coach-houses\r\nand barns \xe2\x80\x94but in vain. So the men of the party resolved to scour the\r\ncountry for him, and sallied forth. They found themselves in the square,\r\nwith the church at the farther side, and to right and left low-roofed\r\nhouses where there were some Prussian soldiers. The first soldier they\r\nsaw was peeling potatoes. The second, farther on, was washing out a\r\nbarber's shop. Another, bearded to the eyes, was fondling a crying\r\ninfant, and dandling it on his knees to quiet it; and the stout peasant\r\nwomen, whose men-folk were for the most part at the war, were, by means\r\nof signs, telling their obedient conquerors what work they were to do:\r\nchop wood, prepare soup, grind coffee; one of them even was doing the\r\nwashing for his hostess, an infirm old grandmother.\r\n\r\nThe count, astonished at what he saw, questioned the beadle who was\r\ncoming out of the presbytery. The old man answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those men are not at all a bad sort; they are not Prussians, I am\r\ntold; they come from somewhere farther off, I don't exactly know where.\r\nAnd they have all left wives and children behind them; they are not fond\r\nof war either, you may be sure! I am sure they are mourning for the men\r\nwhere they come from, just as we do here; and the war causes them just\r\nas much unhappiness as it does us. As a matter of fact, things are not\r\nso very bad here just now, because the soldiers do no harm, and work\r\njust as if they were in their own homes. You see, sir, poor folk always\r\nhelp one another; it is the great ones of this world who make war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCornudet indignant at the friendly understanding established between\r\nconquerors and conquered, withdrew, preferring to shut himself up in the\r\ninn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are repeopling the country,\xe2\x80\x9d jested Loiseau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are undoing the harm they have done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monsieur Carre-Lamadon\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nBut they could not find the coach driver. At last he was discovered in\r\nthe village cafe, fraternizing cordially with the officer's orderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you not told to harness the horses at eight o'clock?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; but I've had different orders since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat orders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to harness at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you such orders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the Prussian officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know. Go and ask him. I am forbidden to harness the horses, so\r\nI don't harness them\xe2\x80\x94that's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you so himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; the innkeeper gave me the order from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast evening, just as I was going to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three men returned in a very uneasy frame of mind.\r\n\r\nThey asked for Monsieur Follenvie, but the servant replied that on\r\naccount of his asthma he never got up before ten o'clock. They were\r\nstrictly forbidden to rouse him earlier, except in case of fire.\r\n\r\nThey wished to see the officer, but that also was impossible, although\r\nhe lodged in the inn. Monsieur Follenvie alone was authorized to\r\ninterview him on civil matters. So they waited. The women returned to\r\ntheir rooms, and occupied themselves with trivial matters.\r\n\r\nCornudet settled down beside the tall kitchen fireplace, before a\r\nblazing fire. He had a small table and a jug of beer placed beside him,\r\nand he smoked his pipe\xe2\x80\x94a pipe which enjoyed among democrats a\r\nconsideration almost equal to his own, as though it had served its\r\ncountry in serving Cornudet. It was a fine meerschaum, admirably colored\r\nto a black the shade of its owner's teeth, but sweet-smelling,\r\ngracefully curved, at home in its master's hand, and completing his\r\nphysiognomy. And Cornudet sat motionless, his eyes fixed now on the\r\ndancing flames, now on the froth which crowned his beer; and after each\r\ndraught he passed his long, thin fingers with an air of satisfaction\r\nthrough his long, greasy hair, as he sucked the foam from his mustache.\r\n\r\nLoiseau, under pretence of stretching his legs, went out to see if he\r\ncould sell wine to the country dealers. The count and the manufacturer\r\nbegan to talk politics. They forecast the future of France. One believed\r\nin the Orleans dynasty, the other in an unknown savior\xe2\x80\x94a hero who should\r\nrise up in the last extremity: a Du Guesclin, perhaps a Joan of Arc? or\r\nanother Napoleon the First? Ah! if only the Prince Imperial were not so\r\nyoung! Cornudet, listening to them, smiled like a man who holds the keys\r\nof destiny in his hands. His pipe perfumed the whole kitchen.\r\n\r\nAs the clock struck ten, Monsieur Follenvie appeared. He was immediately\r\nsurrounded and questioned, but could only repeat, three or four times in\r\nsuccession, and without variation, the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe officer said to me, just like this: 'Monsieur Follenvie, you will\r\nforbid them to harness up the coach for those travellers to-morrow. They\r\nare not to start without an order from me. You hear? That is\r\nsufficient.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they asked to see the officer. The count sent him his card, on\r\nwhich Monsieur Carre-Lamadon also inscribed his name and titles. The\r\nPrussian sent word that the two men would be admitted to see him after\r\nhis luncheon\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, about one o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe ladies reappeared, and they all ate a little, in spite of their\r\nanxiety. Boule de Suif appeared ill and very much worried.\r\n\r\nThey were finishing their coffee when the orderly came to fetch the\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nLoiseau joined the other two; but when they tried to get Cornudet to\r\naccompany them, by way of adding greater solemnity to the occasion, he\r\ndeclared proudly that he would never have anything to do with the\r\nGermans, and, resuming his seat in the chimney corner, he called for\r\nanother jug of beer.\r\n\r\nThe three men went upstairs, and were ushered into the best room in the\r\ninn, where the officer received them lolling at his ease in an armchair,\r\nhis feet on the mantelpiece, smoking a long porcelain pipe, and\r\nenveloped in a gorgeous dressing-gown, doubtless stolen from the\r\ndeserted dwelling of some citizen destitute of taste in dress. He\r\nneither rose, greeted them, nor even glanced in their direction. He\r\nafforded a fine example of that insolence of bearing which seems natural\r\nto the victorious soldier.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a few moments he said in his halting French:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe wish to start on our journey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask the reason of your refusal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don't choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would respectfully call your attention, monsieur, to the fact that\r\nyour general in command gave us a permit to proceed to Dieppe; and I do\r\nnot think we have done anything to deserve this harshness at your\r\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't choose\xe2\x80\x94that's all. You may go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey bowed, and retired.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was wretched. They could not understand the caprice of\r\nthis German, and the strangest ideas came into their heads. They all\r\ncongregated in the kitchen, and talked the subject to death, imagining\r\nall kinds of unlikely things. Perhaps they were to be kept as hostages\r\n\xe2\x80\x94but for what reason? or to be extradited as prisoners of war? or\r\npossibly they were to be held for ransom? They were panic-stricken at\r\nthis last supposition. The richest among them were the most alarmed,\r\nseeing themselves forced to empty bags of gold into the insolent\r\nsoldier's hands in order to buy back their lives. They racked their\r\nbrains for plausible lies whereby they might conceal the fact that they\r\nwere rich, and pass themselves off as poor\xe2\x80\x94very poor. Loiseau took off\r\nhis watch chain, and put it in his pocket. The approach of night\r\nincreased their apprehension. The lamp was lighted, and as it wanted yet\r\ntwo hours to dinner Madame Loiseau proposed a game of trente et un. It\r\nwould distract their thoughts. The rest agreed, and Cornudet himself\r\njoined the party, first putting out his pipe for politeness' sake.\r\n\r\nThe count shuffled the cards\xe2\x80\x94dealt\xe2\x80\x94and Boule de Suif had thirty-one to\r\nstart with; soon the interest of the game assuaged the anxiety of the\r\nplayers. But Cornudet noticed that Loiseau and his wife were in league\r\nto cheat.\r\n\r\nThey were about to sit down to dinner when Monsieur Follenvie appeared,\r\nand in his grating voice announced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prussian officer sends to ask Mademoiselle Elisabeth Rousset if she\r\nhas changed her mind yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoule de Suif stood still, pale as death. Then, suddenly turning crimson\r\nwith anger, she gasped out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly tell that scoundrel, that cur, that carrion of a Prussian, that\r\nI will never consent\xe2\x80\x94you understand?\xe2\x80\x94never, never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fat innkeeper left the room. Then Boule de Suif was surrounded,\r\nquestioned, entreated on all sides to reveal the mystery of her visit to\r\nthe officer. She refused at first; but her wrath soon got the better of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he want? He wants to make me his mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nNo one was shocked at the word, so great was the general indignation.\r\nCornudet broke his jug as he banged it down on the table. A loud outcry\r\narose against this base soldier. All were furious. They drew together in\r\ncommon resistance against the foe, as if some part of the sacrifice\r\nexacted of Boule de Suif had been demanded of each. The count declared,\r\nwith supreme disgust, that those people behaved like ancient barbarians.\r\nThe women, above all, manifested a lively and tender sympathy for Boule\r\nde Suif. The nuns, who appeared only at meals, cast down their eyes, and\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\nThey dined, however, as soon as the first indignant outburst had\r\nsubsided; but they spoke little and thought much.\r\n\r\nThe ladies went to bed early; and the men, having lighted their pipes,\r\nproposed a game of ecarte, in which Monsieur Follenvie was invited to\r\njoin, the travellers hoping to question him skillfully as to the best\r\nmeans of vanquishing the officer's obduracy. But he thought of nothing\r\nbut his cards, would listen to nothing, reply to nothing, and repeated,\r\ntime after time: \xe2\x80\x9cAttend to the game, gentlemen! attend to the game!\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nabsorbed was his attention that he even forgot to expectorate. The\r\nconsequence was that his chest gave forth rumbling sounds like those of\r\nan organ. His wheezing lungs struck every note of the asthmatic scale,\r\nfrom deep, hollow tones to a shrill, hoarse piping resembling that of a\r\nyoung cock trying to crow.\r\n\r\nHe refused to go to bed when his wife, overcome with sleep, came to\r\nfetch him. So she went off alone, for she was an early bird, always up\r\nwith the sun; while he was addicted to late hours, ever ready to spend\r\nthe night with friends. He merely said: \xe2\x80\x9cPut my egg-nogg by the fire,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand went on with the game. When the other men saw that nothing was to be\r\ngot out of him they declared it was time to retire, and each sought his\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThey rose fairly early the next morning, with a vague hope of being\r\nallowed to start, a greater desire than ever to do so, and a terror at\r\nhaving to spend another day in this wretched little inn.\r\n\r\nAlas! the horses remained in the stable, the driver was invisible. They\r\nspent their time, for want of something better to do, in wandering round\r\nthe coach.\r\n\r\nLuncheon was a gloomy affair; and there was a general coolness toward\r\nBoule de Suif, for night, which brings counsel, had somewhat modified\r\nthe judgment of her companions. In the cold light of the morning they\r\nalmost bore a grudge against the girl for not having secretly sought out\r\nthe Prussian, that the rest of the party might receive a joyful surprise\r\nwhen they awoke. What more simple?\r\n\r\nBesides, who would have been the wiser? She might have saved appearances\r\nby telling the officer that she had taken pity on their distress. Such a\r\nstep would be of so little consequence to her.\r\n\r\nBut no one as yet confessed to such thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, seeing that they were all bored to death, the count\r\nproposed a walk in the neighborhood of the village. Each one wrapped\r\nhimself up well, and the little party set out, leaving behind only\r\nCornudet, who preferred to sit over the fire, and the two nuns, who were\r\nin the habit of spending their day in the church or at the presbytery.\r\n\r\nThe cold, which grew more intense each day, almost froze the noses and\r\nears of the pedestrians, their feet began to pain them so that each step\r\nwas a penance, and when they reached the open country it looked so\r\nmournful and depressing in its limitless mantle of white that they all\r\nhastily retraced their steps, with bodies benumbed and hearts heavy.\r\n\r\nThe four women walked in front, and the three men followed a little in\r\ntheir rear.\r\n\r\nLoiseau, who saw perfectly well how matters stood, asked suddenly \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nthat trollop were going to keep them waiting much longer in this\r\nGodforsaken spot.\xe2\x80\x9d The count, always courteous, replied that they could\r\nnot exact so painful a sacrifice from any woman, and that the first move\r\nmust come from herself. Monsieur Carre-Lamadon remarked that if the\r\nFrench, as they talked of doing, made a counter attack by way of Dieppe,\r\ntheir encounter with the enemy must inevitably take place at Totes. This\r\nreflection made the other two anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing we escape on foot?\xe2\x80\x9d said Loiseau.\r\n\r\nThe count shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you think of such a thing, in this snow? And with our wives?\r\nBesides, we should be pursued at once, overtaken in ten minutes, and\r\nbrought back as prisoners at the mercy of the soldiery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was true enough; they were silent.\r\n\r\nThe ladies talked of dress, but a certain constraint seemed to prevail\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at the end of the street, the officer appeared. His tall,\r\nwasp-like, uniformed figure was outlined against the snow which bounded\r\nthe horizon, and he walked, knees apart, with that motion peculiar to\r\nsoldiers, who are always anxious not to soil their carefully polished\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nHe bowed as he passed the ladies, then glanced scornfully at the men,\r\nwho had sufficient dignity not to raise their hats, though Loiseau made\r\na movement to do so.\r\n\r\nBoule de Suif flushed crimson to the ears, and the three married women\r\nfelt unutterably humiliated at being met thus by the soldier in company\r\nwith the girl whom he had treated with such scant ceremony.\r\n\r\nThen they began to talk about him, his figure, and his face. Madame\r\nCarre-Lamadon, who had known many officers and judged them as a\r\nconnoisseur, thought him not at all bad-looking; she even regretted that\r\nhe was not a Frenchman, because in that case he would have made a very\r\nhandsome hussar, with whom all the women would assuredly have fallen in\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nWhen they were once more within doors they did not know what to do with\r\nthemselves. Sharp words even were exchanged apropos of the merest\r\ntrifles. The silent dinner was quickly over, and each one went to bed\r\nearly in the hope of sleeping, and thus killing time.\r\n\r\nThey came down next morning with tired faces and irritable tempers; the\r\nwomen scarcely spoke to Boule de Suif.\r\n\r\nA church bell summoned the faithful to a baptism. Boule de Suif had a\r\nchild being brought up by peasants at Yvetot. She did not see him once a\r\nyear, and never thought of him; but the idea of the child who was about\r\nto be baptized induced a sudden wave of tenderness for her own, and she\r\ninsisted on being present at the ceremony.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had gone out, the rest of the company looked at one\r\nanother and then drew their chairs together; for they realized that they\r\nmust decide on some course of action. Loiseau had an inspiration: he\r\nproposed that they should ask the officer to detain Boule de Suif only,\r\nand to let the rest depart on their way.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Follenvie was intrusted with this commission, but he returned\r\nto them almost immediately. The German, who knew human nature, had shown\r\nhim the door. He intended to keep all the travellers until his condition\r\nhad been complied with.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Madame Loiseau's vulgar temperament broke bounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe're not going to die of old age here!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cSince it's that\r\nvixen's trade to behave so with men I don't see that she has any right\r\nto refuse one more than another. I may as well tell you she took any\r\nlovers she could get at Rouen\xe2\x80\x94even coachmen! Yes, indeed, madame\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncoachman at the prefecture! I know it for a fact, for he buys his wine\r\nof us. And now that it is a question of getting us out of a difficulty\r\nshe puts on virtuous airs, the drab! For my part, I think this officer\r\nhas behaved very well. Why, there were three others of us, any one of\r\nwhom he would undoubtedly have preferred. But no, he contents himself\r\nwith the girl who is common property. He respects married women. Just\r\nthink. He is master here. He had only to say: 'I wish it!' and he might\r\nhave taken us by force, with the help of his soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two other women shuddered; the eyes of pretty Madame Carre-Lamadon\r\nglistened, and she grew pale, as if the officer were indeed in the act\r\nof laying violent hands on her.\r\n\r\nThe men, who had been discussing the subject among themselves, drew\r\nnear. Loiseau, in a state of furious resentment, was for delivering up\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat miserable woman,\xe2\x80\x9d bound hand and foot, into the enemy's power. But\r\nthe count, descended from three generations of ambassadors, and endowed,\r\nmoreover, with the lineaments of a diplomat, was in favor of more\r\ntactful measures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must persuade her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThen they laid their plans.\r\n\r\nThe women drew together; they lowered their voices, and the discussion\r\nbecame general, each giving his or her opinion. But the conversation was\r\nnot in the least coarse. The ladies, in particular, were adepts at\r\ndelicate phrases and charming subtleties of expression to describe the\r\nmost improper things. A stranger would have understood none of their\r\nallusions, so guarded was the language they employed. But, seeing that\r\nthe thin veneer of modesty with which every woman of the world is\r\nfurnished goes but a very little way below the surface, they began\r\nrather to enjoy this unedifying episode, and at bottom were hugely\r\ndelighted \xe2\x80\x94feeling themselves in their element, furthering the schemes\r\nof lawless love with the gusto of a gourmand cook who prepares supper\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\nTheir gaiety returned of itself, so amusing at last did the whole\r\nbusiness seem to them. The count uttered several rather risky\r\nwitticisms, but so tactfully were they said that his audience could not\r\nhelp smiling. Loiseau in turn made some considerably broader jokes, but\r\nno one took offence; and the thought expressed with such brutal\r\ndirectness by his wife was uppermost in the minds of all: \xe2\x80\x9cSince it's\r\nthe girl's trade, why should she refuse this man more than another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDainty Madame Carre-Lamadon seemed to think even that in Boule de Suif's\r\nplace she would be less inclined to refuse him than another.\r\n\r\nThe blockade was as carefully arranged as if they were investing a\r\nfortress. Each agreed on the role which he or she was to play, the\r\narguments to be used, the maneuvers to be executed. They decided on the\r\nplan of campaign, the stratagems they were to employ, and the surprise\r\nattacks which were to reduce this human citadel and force it to receive\r\nthe enemy within its walls.\r\n\r\nBut Cornudet remained apart from the rest, taking no share in the plot.\r\n\r\nSo absorbed was the attention of all that Boule de Suif's entrance was\r\nalmost unnoticed. But the count whispered a gentle \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d which made\r\nthe others look up. She was there. They suddenly stopped talking, and a\r\nvague embarrassment prevented them for a few moments from addressing\r\nher. But the countess, more practiced than the others in the wiles of\r\nthe drawing-room, asked her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the baptism interesting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl, still under the stress of emotion, told what she had seen and\r\nheard, described the faces, the attitudes of those present, and even the\r\nappearance of the church. She concluded with the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does one good to pray sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUntil lunch time the ladies contented themselves with being pleasant to\r\nher, so as to increase her confidence and make her amenable to their\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they took their seats at table the attack began. First they\r\nopened a vague conversation on the subject of self-sacrifice. Ancient\r\nexamples were quoted: Judith and Holofernes; then, irrationally enough,\r\nLucrece and Sextus; Cleopatra and the hostile generals whom she reduced\r\nto abject slavery by a surrender of her charms. Next was recounted an\r\nextraordinary story, born of the imagination of these ignorant\r\nmillionaires, which told how the matrons of Rome seduced Hannibal, his\r\nlieutenants, and all his mercenaries at Capua. They held up to\r\nadmiration all those women who from time to time have arrested the\r\nvictorious progress of conquerors, made of their bodies a field of\r\nbattle, a means of ruling, a weapon; who have vanquished by their heroic\r\ncaresses hideous or detested beings, and sacrificed their chastity to\r\nvengeance and devotion.\r\n\r\nAll was said with due restraint and regard for propriety, the effect\r\nheightened now and then by an outburst of forced enthusiasm calculated\r\nto excite emulation.\r\n\r\nA listener would have thought at last that the one role of woman on\r\nearth was a perpetual sacrifice of her person, a continual abandonment\r\nof herself to the caprices of a hostile soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe two nuns seemed to hear nothing, and to be lost in thought. Boule de\r\nSuif also was silent.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole afternoon she was left to her reflections. But instead\r\nof calling her \xe2\x80\x9cmadame\xe2\x80\x9d as they had done hitherto, her companions\r\naddressed her simply as \xe2\x80\x9cmademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d without exactly knowing why, but\r\nas if desirous of making her descend a step in the esteem she had won,\r\nand forcing her to realize her degraded position.\r\n\r\nJust as soup was served, Monsieur Follenvie reappeared, repeating his\r\nphrase of the evening before:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prussian officer sends to ask if Mademoiselle Elisabeth Rousset has\r\nchanged her mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoule de Suif answered briefly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at dinner the coalition weakened. Loiseau made three unfortunate\r\nremarks. Each was cudgeling his brains for further examples of self-\r\nsacrifice, and could find none, when the countess, possibly without\r\nulterior motive, and moved simply by a vague desire to do homage to\r\nreligion, began to question the elder of the two nuns on the most\r\nstriking facts in the lives of the saints. Now, it fell out that many of\r\nthese had committed acts which would be crimes in our eyes, but the\r\nChurch readily pardons such deeds when they are accomplished for the\r\nglory of God or the good of mankind. This was a powerful argument, and\r\nthe countess made the most of it. Then, whether by reason of a tacit\r\nunderstanding, a thinly veiled act of complaisance such as those who\r\nwear the ecclesiastical habit excel in, or whether merely as the result\r\nof sheer stupidity\xe2\x80\x94a stupidity admirably adapted to further their\r\ndesigns\xe2\x80\x94the old nun rendered formidable aid to the conspirator. They had\r\nthought her timid; she proved herself bold, talkative, bigoted. She was\r\nnot troubled by the ins and outs of casuistry; her doctrines were as\r\niron bars; her faith knew no doubt; her conscience no scruples. She\r\nlooked on Abraham's sacrifice as natural enough, for she herself would\r\nnot have hesitated to kill both father and mother if she had received a\r\ndivine order to that effect; and nothing, in her opinion, could\r\ndisplease our Lord, provided the motive were praiseworthy. The countess,\r\nputting to good use the consecrated authority of her unexpected ally,\r\nled her on to make a lengthy and edifying paraphrase of that axiom\r\nenunciated by a certain school of moralists: \xe2\x80\x9cThe end justifies the\r\nmeans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cyou think God accepts all methods, and\r\npardons the act when the motive is pure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly, madame. An action reprehensible in itself often derives\r\nmerit from the thought which inspires it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in this wise they talked on, fathoming the wishes of God, predicting\r\nHis judgments, describing Him as interested in matters which assuredly\r\nconcern Him but little.\r\n\r\nAll was said with the utmost care and discretion, but every word uttered\r\nby the holy woman in her nun's garb weakened the indignant resistance of\r\nthe courtesan. Then the conversation drifted somewhat, and the nun began\r\nto talk of the convents of her order, of her Superior, of herself, and\r\nof her fragile little neighbor, Sister St. Nicephore. They had been sent\r\nfor from Havre to nurse the hundreds of soldiers who were in hospitals,\r\nstricken with smallpox. She described these wretched invalids and their\r\nmalady. And, while they themselves were detained on their way by the\r\ncaprices of the Prussian officer, scores of Frenchmen might be dying,\r\nwhom they would otherwise have saved! For the nursing of soldiers was\r\nthe old nun's specialty; she had been in the Crimea, in Italy, in\r\nAustria; and as she told the story of her campaigns she revealed herself\r\nas one of those holy sisters of the fife and drum who seem designed by\r\nnature to follow camps, to snatch the wounded from amid the strife of\r\nbattle, and to quell with a word, more effectually than any general, the\r\nrough and insubordinate troopers\xe2\x80\x94a masterful woman, her seamed and\r\npitted face itself an image of the devastations of war.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke when she had finished for fear of spoiling the excellent\r\neffect of her words.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the meal was over the travellers retired to their rooms,\r\nwhence they emerged the following day at a late hour of the morning.\r\n\r\nLuncheon passed off quietly. The seed sown the preceding evening was\r\nbeing given time to germinate and bring forth fruit.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the countess proposed a walk; then the count, as had\r\nbeen arranged beforehand, took Boule de Suif's arm, and walked with her\r\nat some distance behind the rest.\r\n\r\nHe began talking to her in that familiar, paternal, slightly\r\ncontemptuous tone which men of his class adopt in speaking to women like\r\nher, calling her \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d and talking down to her from the\r\nheight of his exalted social position and stainless reputation. He came\r\nstraight to the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you prefer to leave us here, exposed like yourself to all the\r\nviolence which would follow on a repulse of the Prussian troops, rather\r\nthan consent to surrender yourself, as you have done so many times in\r\nyour life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl did not reply.\r\n\r\nHe tried kindness, argument, sentiment. He still bore himself as count,\r\neven while adopting, when desirable, an attitude of gallantry, and\r\nmaking pretty\xe2\x80\x94nay, even tender\xe2\x80\x94speeches. He exalted the service she\r\nwould render them, spoke of their gratitude; then, suddenly, using the\r\nfamiliar \xe2\x80\x9cthou\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know, my dear, he could boast then of having made a conquest of\r\na pretty girl such as he won't often find in his own country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoule de Suif did not answer, and joined the rest of the party.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they returned she went to her room, and was seen no more. The\r\ngeneral anxiety was at its height. What would she do? If she still\r\nresisted, how awkward for them all!\r\n\r\nThe dinner hour struck; they waited for her in vain. At last Monsieur\r\nFollenvie entered, announcing that Mademoiselle Rousset was not well,\r\nand that they might sit down to table. They all pricked up their ears.\r\nThe count drew near the innkeeper, and whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut of regard for propriety he said nothing to his companions, but\r\nmerely nodded slightly toward them. A great sigh of relief went up from\r\nall breasts; every face was lighted up with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Gad!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Loiseau, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll stand champagne all round if there's\r\nany to be found in this place.\xe2\x80\x9d And great was Madame Loiseau's dismay\r\nwhen the proprietor came back with four bottles in his hands. They had\r\nall suddenly become talkative and merry; a lively joy filled all hearts.\r\nThe count seemed to perceive for the first time that Madame Carre-\r\nLamadon was charming; the manufacturer paid compliments to the countess.\r\nThe conversation was animated, sprightly, witty, and, although many of\r\nthe jokes were in the worst possible taste, all the company were amused\r\nby them, and none offended\xe2\x80\x94indignation being dependent, like other\r\nemotions, on surroundings. And the mental atmosphere had gradually\r\nbecome filled with gross imaginings and unclean thoughts.\r\n\r\nAt dessert even the women indulged in discreetly worded allusions. Their\r\nglances were full of meaning; they had drunk much. The count, who even\r\nin his moments of relaxation preserved a dignified demeanor, hit on a\r\nmuch-appreciated comparison of the condition of things with the\r\ntermination of a winter spent in the icy solitude of the North Pole and\r\nthe joy of shipwrecked mariners who at last perceive a southward track\r\nopening out before their eyes.\r\n\r\nLoiseau, fairly in his element, rose to his feet, holding aloft a glass\r\nof champagne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drink to our deliverance!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n\r\nAll stood up, and greeted the toast with acclamation. Even the two good\r\nsisters yielded to the solicitations of the ladies, and consented to\r\nmoisten their lips with the foaming wine, which they had never before\r\ntasted. They declared it was like effervescent lemonade, but with a\r\npleasanter flavor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Loiseau, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we have no piano; we might have had\r\na quadrille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCornudet had not spoken a word or made a movement; he seemed plunged in\r\nserious thought, and now and then tugged furiously at his great beard,\r\nas if trying to add still further to its length. At last, toward\r\nmidnight, when they were about to separate, Loiseau, whose gait was far\r\nfrom steady, suddenly slapped him on the back, saying thickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're not jolly to-night; why are you so silent, old man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCornudet threw back his head, cast one swift and scornful glance over\r\nthe assemblage, and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you all, you have done an infamous thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, reached the door, and repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cInfamous!\xe2\x80\x9d disappeared.\r\n\r\nA chill fell on all. Loiseau himself looked foolish and disconcerted for\r\na moment, but soon recovered his aplomb, and, writhing with laughter,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, you are all too green for anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPressed for an explanation, he related the \xe2\x80\x9cmysteries of the corridor,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhereat his listeners were hugely amused. The ladies could hardly\r\ncontain their delight. The count and Monsieur Carre-Lamadon laughed till\r\nthey cried. They could scarcely believe their ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you are sure? He wanted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I saw it with my own eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she refused?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the Prussian was in the next room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you are mistaken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear I'm telling you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe count was choking with laughter. The manufacturer held his sides.\r\nLoiseau continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you may well imagine he doesn't think this evening's business at all\r\namusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd all three began to laugh again, choking, coughing, almost ill with\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\nThen they separated. But Madame Loiseau, who was nothing if not\r\nspiteful, remarked to her husband as they were on the way to bed that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat stuck-up little minx of a Carre-Lamadon had laughed on the wrong\r\nside of her mouth all the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen women run after uniforms it's all the same\r\nto them whether the men who wear them are French or Prussian. It's\r\nperfectly sickening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning the snow showed dazzling white tinder a clear winter\r\nsun. The coach, ready at last, waited before the door; while a flock of\r\nwhite pigeons, with pink eyes spotted in the centres with black, puffed\r\nout their white feathers and walked sedately between the legs of the six\r\nhorses, picking at the steaming manure.\r\n\r\nThe driver, wrapped in his sheepskin coat, was smoking a pipe on the\r\nbox, and all the passengers, radiant with delight at their approaching\r\ndeparture, were putting up provisions for the remainder of the journey.\r\n\r\nThey were waiting only for Boule de Suif. At last she appeared.\r\n\r\nShe seemed rather shamefaced and embarrassed, and advanced with timid\r\nstep toward her companions, who with one accord turned aside as if they\r\nhad not seen her. The count, with much dignity, took his wife by the\r\narm, and removed her from the unclean contact.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood still, stupefied with astonishment; then, plucking up\r\ncourage, accosted the manufacturer's wife with a humble \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\r\nmadame,\xe2\x80\x9d to which the other replied merely with a slight and insolent\r\nnod, accompanied by a look of outraged virtue. Every one suddenly\r\nappeared extremely busy, and kept as far from Boule de Suif as if her\r\nskirts had been infected with some deadly disease. Then they hurried to\r\nthe coach, followed by the despised courtesan, who, arriving last of\r\nall, silently took the place she had occupied during the first part of\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\nThe rest seemed neither to see nor to know her\xe2\x80\x94all save Madame Loiseau,\r\nwho, glancing contemptuously in her direction, remarked, half aloud, to\r\nher husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mercy I am not sitting beside that creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lumbering vehicle started on its way, and the journey began afresh.\r\n\r\nAt first no one spoke. Boule de Suif dared not even raise her eyes. She\r\nfelt at once indignant with her neighbors, and humiliated at having\r\nyielded to the Prussian into whose arms they had so hypocritically cast\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut the countess, turning toward Madame Carre-Lamadon, soon broke the\r\npainful silence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you know Madame d'Etrelles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she is a friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a charming woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelightful! Exceptionally talented, and an artist to the finger tips.\r\nShe sings marvellously and draws to perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer was chatting with the count, and amid the clatter of\r\nthe window-panes a word of their conversation was now and then\r\ndistinguishable: \xe2\x80\x9cShares\xe2\x80\x94maturity\xe2\x80\x94premium\xe2\x80\x94time-limit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLoiseau, who had abstracted from the inn the timeworn pack of cards,\r\nthick with the grease of five years' contact with half-wiped-off tables,\r\nstarted a game of bezique with his wife.\r\n\r\nThe good sisters, taking up simultaneously the long rosaries hanging\r\nfrom their waists, made the sign of the cross, and began to mutter in\r\nunison interminable prayers, their lips moving ever more and more\r\nswiftly, as if they sought which should outdistance the other in the\r\nrace of orisons; from time to time they kissed a medal, and crossed\r\nthemselves anew, then resumed their rapid and unintelligible murmur.\r\n\r\nCornudet sat still, lost in thought.\r\n\r\nAh the end of three hours Loiseau gathered up the cards, and remarked\r\nthat he was hungry.\r\n\r\nHis wife thereupon produced a parcel tied with string, from which she\r\nextracted a piece of cold veal. This she cut into neat, thin slices, and\r\nboth began to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may as well do the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess. The rest agreed, and\r\nshe unpacked the provisions which had been prepared for herself, the\r\ncount, and the Carre-Lamadons. In one of those oval dishes, the lids of\r\nwhich are decorated with an earthenware hare, by way of showing that a\r\ngame pie lies within, was a succulent delicacy consisting of the brown\r\nflesh of the game larded with streaks of bacon and flavored with other\r\nmeats chopped fine. A solid wedge of Gruyere cheese, which had been\r\nwrapped in a newspaper, bore the imprint: \xe2\x80\x9cItems of News,\xe2\x80\x9d on its rich,\r\noily surface.\r\n\r\nThe two good sisters brought to light a hunk of sausage smelling\r\nstrongly of garlic; and Cornudet, plunging both hands at once into the\r\ncapacious pockets of his loose overcoat, produced from one four hard-\r\nboiled eggs and from the other a crust of bread. He removed the shells,\r\nthrew them into the straw beneath his feet, and began to devour the\r\neggs, letting morsels of the bright yellow yolk fall in his mighty\r\nbeard, where they looked like stars.\r\n\r\nBoule de Suif, in the haste and confusion of her departure, had not\r\nthought of anything, and, stifling with rage, she watched all these\r\npeople placidly eating. At first, ill-suppressed wrath shook her whole\r\nperson, and she opened her lips to shriek the truth at them, to\r\noverwhelm them with a volley of insults; but she could not utter a word,\r\nso choked was she with indignation.\r\n\r\nNo one looked at her, no one thought of her. She felt herself swallowed\r\nup in the scorn of these virtuous creatures, who had first sacrificed,\r\nthen rejected her as a thing useless and unclean. Then she remembered\r\nher big basket full of the good things they had so greedily devoured:\r\nthe two chickens coated in jelly, the pies, the pears, the four bottles\r\nof claret; and her fury broke forth like a cord that is overstrained,\r\nand she was on the verge of tears. She made terrible efforts at self-\r\ncontrol, drew herself up, swallowed the sobs which choked her; but the\r\ntears rose nevertheless, shone at the brink of her eyelids, and soon two\r\nheavy drops coursed slowly down her cheeks. Others followed more\r\nquickly, like water filtering from a rock, and fell, one after another,\r\non her rounded bosom. She sat upright, with a fixed expression, her face\r\npale and rigid, hoping desperately that no one saw her give way.\r\n\r\nBut the countess noticed that she was weeping, and with a sign drew her\r\nhusband's attention to the fact. He shrugged his shoulders, as if to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of it? It's not my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Loiseau chuckled\r\ntriumphantly, and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe's weeping for shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two nuns had betaken themselves once more to their prayers, first\r\nwrapping the remainder of their sausage in paper:\r\n\r\nThen Cornudet, who was digesting his eggs, stretched his long legs under\r\nthe opposite seat, threw himself back, folded his arms, smiled like a\r\nman who had just thought of a good joke, and began to whistle the\r\nMarseillaise.\r\n\r\nThe faces of his neighbors clouded; the popular air evidently did not\r\nfind favor with them; they grew nervous and irritable, and seemed ready\r\nto howl as a dog does at the sound of a barrel-organ. Cornudet saw the\r\ndiscomfort he was creating, and whistled the louder; sometimes he even\r\nhummed the words:\r\n\r\nAmour sacre de la patrie, Conduis, soutiens, nos bras vengeurs, Liberte,\r\nliberte cherie, Combats avec tes defenseurs!\r\n\r\nThe coach progressed more swiftly, the snow being harder now; and all\r\nthe way to Dieppe, during the long, dreary hours of the journey, first\r\nin the gathering dusk, then in the thick darkness, raising his voice\r\nabove the rumbling of the vehicle, Cornudet continued with fierce\r\nobstinacy his vengeful and monotonous whistling, forcing his weary and\r\nexasperated-hearers to follow the song from end to end, to recall every\r\nword of every line, as each was repeated over and over again with\r\nuntiring persistency.\r\n\r\nAnd Boule de Suif still wept, and sometimes a sob she could not restrain\r\nwas heard in the darkness between two verses of the song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO FRIENDS\r\n\r\nBesieged Paris was in the throes of famine. Even the sparrows on the\r\nroofs and the rats in the sewers were growing scarce. People were eating\r\nanything they could get.\r\n\r\nAs Monsieur Morissot, watchmaker by profession and idler for the nonce,\r\nwas strolling along the boulevard one bright January morning, his hands\r\nin his trousers pockets and stomach empty, he suddenly came face to face\r\nwith an acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Sauvage, a fishing chum.\r\n\r\nBefore the war broke out Morissot had been in the habit, every Sunday\r\nmorning, of setting forth with a bamboo rod in his hand and a tin box on\r\nhis back. He took the Argenteuil train, got out at Colombes, and walked\r\nthence to the Ile Marante. The moment he arrived at this place of his\r\ndreams he began fishing, and fished till nightfall.\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly,\r\nlittle man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an\r\nardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in\r\nhand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung\r\nup between the two.\r\n\r\nSome days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they\r\nunderstood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar\r\ntastes and feelings.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun\r\ncaused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of\r\nthe two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his\r\nneighbor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy, but it's pleasant here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the other would reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't imagine anything better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a\r\nblood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson\r\nclouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of\r\nthe two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning\r\nat the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes\r\nsmile at Morissot, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a glorious spectacle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially,\r\naffected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are sad times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorissot shook his head mournfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.\r\n\r\nThey walked along, side by side, reflective and sad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think of the fishing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Morissot. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good times we used\r\nto have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall we be able to fish again?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monsieur Sauvage.\r\n\r\nThey entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed\r\ntheir walk along the pavement.\r\n\r\nMorissot stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we have another absinthe?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Monsieur Sauvage.\r\n\r\nAnd they entered another wine shop.\r\n\r\nThey were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the\r\nalcohol on their empty stomachs. It was a fine, mild day, and a gentle\r\nbreeze fanned their faces.\r\n\r\nThe fresh air completed the effect of the alcohol on Monsieur Sauvage.\r\nHe stopped suddenly, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we go there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to the old place. The French outposts are close to Colombes. I\r\nknow Colonel Dumoulin, and we shall easily get leave to pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorissot trembled with desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they separated, to fetch their rods and lines.\r\n\r\nAn hour later they were walking side by side on the-highroad. Presently\r\nthey reached the villa occupied by the colonel. He smiled at their\r\nrequest, and granted it. They resumed their walk, furnished with a\r\npassword.\r\n\r\nSoon they left the outposts behind them, made their way through deserted\r\nColombes, and found themselves on the outskirts of the small vineyards\r\nwhich border the Seine. It was about eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nBefore them lay the village of Argenteuil, apparently lifeless. The\r\nheights of Orgement and Sannois dominated the landscape. The great\r\nplain, extending as far as Nanterre, was empty, quite empty-a waste of\r\ndun-colored soil and bare cherry trees.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sauvage, pointing to the heights, murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prussians are up yonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the sight of the deserted country filled the two friends with vague\r\nmisgivings.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians! They had never seen them as yet, but they had felt their\r\npresence in the neighborhood of Paris for months past\xe2\x80\x94ruining France,\r\npillaging, massacring, starving them. And a kind of superstitious terror\r\nmingled with the hatred they already felt toward this unknown,\r\nvictorious nation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we were to meet any of them?\xe2\x80\x9d said Morissot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'd offer them some fish,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monsieur Sauvage, with that\r\nParisian light-heartedness which nothing can wholly quench.\r\n\r\nStill, they hesitated to show themselves in the open country, overawed\r\nby the utter silence which reigned around them.\r\n\r\nAt last Monsieur Sauvage said boldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, we'll make a start; only let us be careful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they made their way through one of the vineyards, bent double,\r\ncreeping along beneath the cover afforded by the vines, with eye and ear\r\nalert.\r\n\r\nA strip of bare ground remained to be crossed before they could gain the\r\nriver bank. They ran across this, and, as soon as they were at the\r\nwater's edge, concealed themselves among the dry reeds.\r\n\r\nMorissot placed his ear to the ground, to ascertain, if possible,\r\nwhether footsteps were coming their way. He heard nothing. They seemed\r\nto be utterly alone.\r\n\r\nTheir confidence was restored, and they began to fish.\r\n\r\nBefore them the deserted Ile Marante hid them from the farther shore.\r\nThe little restaurant was closed, and looked as if it had been deserted\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sauvage caught the first gudgeon, Monsieur Morissot the second,\r\nand almost every moment one or other raised his line with a little,\r\nglittering, silvery fish wriggling at the end; they were having\r\nexcellent sport.\r\n\r\nThey slipped their catch gently into a close-meshed bag lying at their\r\nfeet; they were filled with joy\xe2\x80\x94the joy of once more indulging in a\r\npastime of which they had long been deprived.\r\n\r\nThe sun poured its rays on their backs; they no longer heard anything or\r\nthought of anything. They ignored the rest of the world; they were\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a rumbling sound, which seemed to come from the bowels of\r\nthe earth, shook the ground beneath them: the cannon were resuming their\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nMorissot turned his head and could see toward the left, beyond the banks\r\nof the river, the formidable outline of Mont-Valerien, from whose summit\r\narose a white puff of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe next instant a second puff followed the first, and in a few moments\r\na fresh detonation made the earth tremble.\r\n\r\nOthers followed, and minute by minute the mountain gave forth its deadly\r\nbreath and a white puff of smoke, which rose slowly into the peaceful\r\nheaven and floated above the summit of the cliff.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sauvage shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are at it again!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMorissot, who was anxiously watching his float bobbing up and down, was\r\nsuddenly seized with the angry impatience of a peaceful man toward the\r\nmadmen who were firing thus, and remarked indignantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fools they are to kill one another like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey're worse than animals,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monsieur Sauvage.\r\n\r\nAnd Morissot, who had just caught a bleak, declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think that it will be just the same so long as there are\r\ngovernments!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Republic would not have declared war,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Monsieur Sauvage.\r\n\r\nMorissot interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder a king we have foreign wars; under a republic we have civil war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the two began placidly discussing political problems with the sound\r\ncommon sense of peaceful, matter-of-fact citizens\xe2\x80\x94agreeing on one point:\r\nthat they would never be free. And Mont-Valerien thundered ceaselessly,\r\ndemolishing the houses of the French with its cannon balls, grinding\r\nlives of men to powder, destroying many a dream, many a cherished hope,\r\nmany a prospective happiness; ruthlessly causing endless woe and\r\nsuffering in the hearts of wives, of daughters, of mothers, in other\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is life!\xe2\x80\x9d declared Monsieur Sauvage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, rather, such is death!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Morissot, laughing.\r\n\r\nBut they suddenly trembled with alarm at the sound of footsteps behind\r\nthem, and, turning round, they perceived close at hand four tall,\r\nbearded men, dressed after the manner of livery servants and wearing\r\nflat caps on their heads. They were covering the two anglers with their\r\nrifles.\r\n\r\nThe rods slipped from their owners' grasp and floated away down the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nIn the space of a few seconds they were seized, bound, thrown into a\r\nboat, and taken across to the Ile Marante.\r\n\r\nAnd behind the house they had thought deserted were about a score of\r\nGerman soldiers.\r\n\r\nA shaggy-looking giant, who was bestriding a chair and smoking a long\r\nclay pipe, addressed them in excellent French with the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen, have you had good luck with your fishing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen a soldier deposited at the officer's feet the bag full of fish,\r\nwhich he had taken care to bring away. The Prussian smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot bad, I see. But we have something else to talk about. Listen to me,\r\nand don't be alarmed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know that, in my eyes, you are two spies sent to reconnoitre\r\nme and my movements. Naturally, I capture you and I shoot you. You\r\npretended to be fishing, the better to disguise your real errand. You\r\nhave fallen into my hands, and must take the consequences. Such is war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as you came here through the outposts you must have a password for\r\nyour return. Tell me that password and I will let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two friends, pale as death, stood silently side by side, a slight\r\nfluttering of the hands alone betraying their emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will ever know,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the officer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will return\r\npeacefully to your homes, and the secret will disappear with you. If you\r\nrefuse, it means death-instant death. Choose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood motionless, and did not open their lips.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian, perfectly calm, went on, with hand outstretched toward the\r\nriver:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think that in five minutes you will be at the bottom of that\r\nwater. In five minutes! You have relations, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMont-Valerien still thundered.\r\n\r\nThe two fishermen remained silent. The German turned and gave an order\r\nin his own language. Then he moved his chair a little way off, that he\r\nmight not be so near the prisoners, and a dozen men stepped forward,\r\nrifle in hand, and took up a position, twenty paces off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you one minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer; \xe2\x80\x9cnot a second longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he rose quickly, went over to the two Frenchmen, took Morissot by\r\nthe arm, led him a short distance off, and said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick! the password! Your friend will know nothing. I will pretend to\r\nrelent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorissot answered not a word.\r\n\r\nThen the Prussian took Monsieur Sauvage aside in like manner, and made\r\nhim the same proposal.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sauvage made no reply.\r\n\r\nAgain they stood side by side.\r\n\r\nThe officer issued his orders; the soldiers raised their rifles.\r\n\r\nThen by chance Morissot's eyes fell on the bag full of gudgeon lying in\r\nthe grass a few feet from him.\r\n\r\nA ray of sunlight made the still quivering fish glisten like silver. And\r\nMorissot's heart sank. Despite his efforts at self-control his eyes\r\nfilled with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Monsieur Sauvage,\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Monsieur Morissot,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sauvage.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, trembling from head to foot with a dread beyond their\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\nThe officer cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe twelve shots were as one.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sauvage fell forward instantaneously. Morissot, being the\r\ntaller, swayed slightly and fell across his friend with face turned\r\nskyward and blood oozing from a rent in the breast of his coat.\r\n\r\nThe German issued fresh orders.\r\n\r\nHis men dispersed, and presently returned with ropes and large stones,\r\nwhich they attached to the feet of the two friends; then they carried\r\nthem to the river bank.\r\n\r\nMont-Valerien, its summit now enshrouded in smoke, still continued to\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nTwo soldiers took Morissot by the head and the feet; two others did the\r\nsame with Sauvage. The bodies, swung lustily by strong hands, were cast\r\nto a distance, and, describing a curve, fell feet foremost into the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThe water splashed high, foamed, eddied, then grew calm; tiny waves\r\nlapped the shore.\r\n\r\nA few streaks of blood flecked the surface of the river.\r\n\r\nThe officer, calm throughout, remarked, with grim humor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's the fishes' turn now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he retraced his way to the house.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he caught sight of the net full of gudgeons, lying forgotten in\r\nthe grass. He picked it up, examined it, smiled, and called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilhelm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA white-aproned soldier responded to the summons, and the Prussian,\r\ntossing him the catch of the two murdered men, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave these fish fried for me at once, while they are still alive;\r\nthey'll make a tasty dish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he resumed his pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANCER'S WIFE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt was after Bourbaki's defeat in the east of France. The army, broken\r\nup, decimated, and worn out, had been obliged to retreat into\r\nSwitzerland after that terrible campaign, and it was only its short\r\nduration that saved a hundred and fifty thousand men from certain death.\r\nHunger, the terrible cold, forced marches in the snow without boots,\r\nover bad mountain roads, had caused us 'francs-tireurs', especially, the\r\ngreatest suffering, for we were without tents, and almost without food,\r\nalways in the van when we were marching toward Belfort, and in the rear\r\nwhen returning by the Jura. Of our little band that had numbered twelve\r\nhundred men on the first of January, there remained only twenty-two\r\npale, thin, ragged wretches, when we at length succeeded in reaching\r\nSwiss territory.\r\n\r\nThere we were safe, and could rest. Everybody knows what sympathy was\r\nshown to the unfortunate French army, and how well it was cared for. We\r\nall gained fresh life, and those who had been rich and happy before the\r\nwar declared that they had never experienced a greater feeling of\r\ncomfort than they did then. Just think. We actually had something to eat\r\nevery day, and could sleep every night.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the war continued in the east of France, which had been\r\nexcluded from the armistice. Besancon still kept the enemy in check, and\r\nthe latter had their revenge by ravaging Franche Comte. Sometimes we\r\nheard that they had approached quite close to the frontier, and we saw\r\nSwiss troops, who were to form a line of observation between us and\r\nthem, set out on their march.\r\n\r\nThat pained us in the end, and, as we regained health and strength, the\r\nlonging to fight took possession of us. It was disgraceful and\r\nirritating to know that within two or three leagues of us the Germans\r\nwere victorious and insolent, to feel that we were protected by our\r\ncaptivity, and to feel that on that account we were powerless against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne day our captain took five or six of us aside, and spoke to us about\r\nit, long and furiously. He was a fine fellow, that captain. He had been\r\na sublieutenant in the Zouaves, was tall and thin and as hard as steel,\r\nand during the whole campaign he had cut out their work for the Germans.\r\nHe fretted in inactivity, and could not accustom himself to the idea of\r\nbeing a prisoner and of doing nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to us, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes it not pain you to know that there\r\nis a number of uhlans within two hours of us? Does it not almost drive\r\nyou mad to know that those beggarly wretches are walking about as\r\nmasters in our mountains, when six determined men might kill a whole\r\nspitful any day? I cannot endure it any longer, and I must go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can you manage it, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? It is not very difficult! Just as if we had not done a thing or\r\ntwo within the last six months, and got out of woods that were guarded\r\nby very different men from the Swiss. The day that you wish to cross\r\nover into France, I will undertake to get you there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be; but what shall we do in France without any arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout arms? We will get them over yonder, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are forgetting the treaty,\xe2\x80\x9d another soldier said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall run the\r\nrisk of doing the Swiss an injury, if Manteuffel learns that they have\r\nallowed prisoners to return to France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthose are all bad reasons. I mean to go and\r\nkill some Prussians; that is all I care about. If you do not wish to do\r\nas I do, well and good; only say so at once. I can quite well go by\r\nmyself; I do not require anybody's company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNaturally we all protested, and, as it was quite impossible to make the\r\ncaptain alter his mind, we felt obliged to promise to go with him. We\r\nliked him too much to leave him in the lurch, as he never failed us in\r\nany extremity; and so the expedition was decided on.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe captain had a plan of his own, that he had been cogitating over for\r\nsome time. A man in that part of the country whom he knew was going to\r\nlend him a cart and six suits of peasants' clothes. We could hide under\r\nsome straw at the bottom of the wagon, which would be loaded with\r\nGruyere cheese, which he was supposed to be going to sell in France. The\r\ncaptain told the sentinels that he was taking two friends with him to\r\nprotect his goods, in case any one should try to rob him, which did not\r\nseem an extraordinary precaution. A Swiss officer seemed to look at the\r\nwagon in a knowing manner, but that was in order to impress his\r\nsoldiers. In a word, neither officers nor men could make it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain said to the horses, as he cracked his whip, while\r\nour three men quietly smoked their pipes. I was half suffocated in my\r\nbox, which only admitted the air through those holes in front, and at\r\nthe same time I was nearly frozen, for it was terribly cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain said again, and the wagon loaded with Gruyere\r\ncheese entered France.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian lines were very badly guarded, as the enemy trusted to the\r\nwatchfulness of the Swiss. The sergeant spoke North German, while our\r\ncaptain spoke the bad German of the Four Cantons, and so they could not\r\nunderstand each other. The sergeant, however, pretended to be very\r\nintelligent; and, in order to make us believe that he understood us,\r\nthey allowed us to continue our journey; and, after travelling for seven\r\nhours, being continually stopped in the same manner, we arrived at a\r\nsmall village of the Jura in ruins, at nightfall.\r\n\r\nWhat were we going to do? Our only arms were the captain's whip, our\r\nuniforms our peasants' blouses, and our food the Gruyere cheese. Our\r\nsole wealth consisted in our ammunition, packages of cartridges which we\r\nhad stowed away inside some of the large cheeses. We had about a\r\nthousand of them, just two hundred each, but we needed rifles, and they\r\nmust be chassepots. Luckily, however, the captain was a bold man of an\r\ninventive mind, and this was the plan that he hit upon:\r\n\r\nWhile three of us remained hidden in a cellar in the abandoned village,\r\nhe continued his journey as far as Besancon with the empty wagon and one\r\nman. The town was invested, but one can always make one's way into a\r\ntown among the hills by crossing the tableland till within about ten\r\nmiles of the walls, and then following paths and ravines on foot. They\r\nleft their wagon at Omans, among the Germans, and escaped out of it at\r\nnight on foot; so as to gain the heights which border the River Doubs;\r\nthe next day they entered Besancon, where there were plenty of\r\nchassepots. There were nearly forty thousand of them left in the\r\narsenal, and General Roland, a brave marine, laughed at the captain's\r\ndaring project, but let him have six rifles and wished him \xe2\x80\x9cgood luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere he had also found his wife, who had been through all the war with\r\nus before the campaign in the East, and who had been only prevented by\r\nillness from continuing with Bourbaki's army. She had recovered,\r\nhowever, in spite of the cold, which was growing more and more intense,\r\nand in spite of the numberless privations that awaited her, she\r\npersisted in accompanying her husband. He was obliged to give way to\r\nher, and they all three, the captain, his wife, and our comrade, started\r\non their expedition.\r\n\r\nGoing was nothing in comparison to returning. They were obliged to\r\ntravel by night, so as to avoid meeting anybody, as the possession of\r\nsix rifles would have made them liable to suspicion. But, in spite of\r\neverything, a week after leaving us, the captain and his two men were\r\nback with us again. The campaign was about to begin.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe first night of his arrival he began it himself, and, under pretext\r\nof examining the surrounding country, he went along the high road.\r\n\r\nI must tell you that the little village which served as our fortress was\r\na small collection of poor, badly built houses, which had been deserted\r\nlong before. It lay on a steep slope, which terminated in a wooded\r\nplain. The country people sell the wood; they send it down the slopes,\r\nwhich are called coulees, locally, and which lead down to the plain, and\r\nthere they stack it into piles, which they sell thrice a year to the\r\nwood merchants. The spot where this market is held in indicated by two\r\nsmall houses by the side of the highroad, which serve for public houses.\r\nThe captain had gone down there by way of one of these coulees.\r\n\r\nHe had been gone about half an hour, and we were on the lookout at the\r\ntop of the ravine, when we heard a shot. The captain had ordered us not\r\nto stir, and only to come to him when we heard him blow his trumpet. It\r\nwas made of a goat's horn, and could be heard a league off; but it gave\r\nno sound, and, in spite of our cruel anxiety, we were obliged to wait in\r\nsilence, with our rifles by our side.\r\n\r\nIt is nothing to go down these coulees; one just lets one's self slide\r\ndown; but it is more difficult to get up again; one has to scramble up\r\nby catching hold of the hanging branches of the trees, and sometimes on\r\nall fours, by sheer strength. A whole mortal hour passed, and he did not\r\ncome; nothing moved in the brushwood. The captain's wife began to grow\r\nimpatient. What could he be doing? Why did he not call us? Did the shot\r\nthat we had heard proceed from an enemy, and had he killed or wounded\r\nour leader, her husband? They did not know what to think, but I myself\r\nfancied either that he was dead or that his enterprise was successful;\r\nand I was merely anxious and curious to know what he had done.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we heard the sound of his trumpet, and we were much surprised\r\nthat instead of coming from below, as we had expected, it came from the\r\nvillage behind us. What did that mean? It was a mystery to us, but the\r\nsame idea struck us all, that he had been killed, and that the Prussians\r\nwere blowing the trumpet to draw us into an ambush. We therefore\r\nreturned to the cottage, keeping a careful lookout with our fingers on\r\nthe trigger, and hiding under the branches; but his wife, in spite of\r\nour entreaties, rushed on, leaping like a tigress. She thought that she\r\nhad to avenge her husband, and had fixed the bayonet to her rifle, and\r\nwe lost sight of her at the moment that we heard the trumpet again; and,\r\na few moments later, we heard her calling out to us:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on! come on! He is alive! It is he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe hastened on, and saw the captain smoking his pipe at the entrance of\r\nthe village, but strangely enough, he was on horseback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to us, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see that there is something to be done\r\nhere. Here I am on horseback already; I knocked over an uhlan yonder,\r\nand took his horse; I suppose they were guarding the wood, but it was by\r\ndrinking and swilling in clover. One of them, the sentry at the door,\r\nhad not time to see me before I gave him a sugarplum in his stomach, and\r\nthen, before the others could come out, I jumped on the horse and was\r\noff like a shot. Eight or ten of them followed me, I think; but I took\r\nthe crossroads through the woods. I have got scratched and torn a bit,\r\nbut here I am, and now, my good fellows, attention, and take care! Those\r\nbrigands will not rest until they have caught us, and we must receive\r\nthem with rifle bullets. Come along; let us take up our posts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe set out. One of us took up his position a good way from the village\r\non the crossroads; I was posted at the entrance of the main street,\r\nwhere the road from the level country enters the village, while the two\r\nothers, the captain and his wife, were in the middle of the village,\r\nnear the church, whose tower served for an observatory and citadel.\r\n\r\nWe had not been in our places long before we heard a shot, followed by\r\nanother, and then two, then three. The first was evidently a chassepot\r\n\xe2\x80\x94one recognized it by the sharp report, which sounds like the crack of a\r\nwhip\xe2\x80\x94while the other three came from the lancers' carbines.\r\n\r\nThe captain was furious. He had given orders to the outpost to let the\r\nenemy pass and merely to follow them at a distance if they marched\r\ntoward the village, and to join me when they had gone well between the\r\nhouses. Then they were to appear suddenly, take the patrol between two\r\nfires, and not allow a single man to escape; for, posted as we were, the\r\nsix of us could have hemmed in ten Prussians, if needful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat confounded Piedelot has roused them,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\r\nwill not venture to come on blindfolded any longer. And then I am quite\r\nsure that he has managed to get a shot into himself somewhere or other,\r\nfor we hear nothing of him. It serves him right; why did he not obey\r\norders?\xe2\x80\x9d And then, after a moment, he grumbled in his beard: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all\r\nI am sorry for the poor fellow; he is so brave, and shoots so well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain was right in his conjectures. We waited until evening,\r\nwithout seeing the uhlans; they had retreated after the first attack;\r\nbut unfortunately we had not seen Piedelot, either. Was he dead or a\r\nprisoner? When night came, the captain proposed that we should go out\r\nand look for him, and so the three of us started. At the crossroads we\r\nfound a broken rifle and some blood, while the ground was trampled down;\r\nbut we did not find either a wounded man or a dead body, although we\r\nsearched every thicket, and at midnight we returned without having\r\ndiscovered anything of our unfortunate comrade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very strange,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain growled. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must have killed him\r\nand thrown him into the bushes somewhere; they cannot possibly have\r\ntaken him prisoner, as he would have called out for help. I cannot\r\nunderstand it at all.\xe2\x80\x9d Just as he said that, bright flames shot up in\r\nthe direction of the inn on the high road, which illuminated the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScoundrels! cowards!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cI will bet that they have set fire\r\nto the two houses on the marketplace, in order to have their revenge,\r\nand then they will scuttle off without saying a word. They will be\r\nsatisfied with having killed a man and set fire to two houses. All\r\nright. It shall not pass over like that. We must go for them; they will\r\nnot like to leave their illuminations in order to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a great stroke of luck if we could set Piedelot free at the\r\nsame time,\xe2\x80\x9d some one said.\r\n\r\nThe five of us set off, full of rage and hope. In twenty minutes we had\r\ngot to the bottom of the coulee, and had not yet seen any one when we\r\nwere within a hundred yards of the inn. The fire was behind the house,\r\nand all we saw of it was the reflection above the roof. However, we were\r\nwalking rather slowly, as we were afraid of an ambush, when suddenly we\r\nheard Piedelot's well-known voice. It had a strange sound, however; for\r\nit was at the same time\xe2\x80\x94dull and vibrating, stifled and clear, as if he\r\nwere calling out as loud as he could with a bit of rag stuffed into his\r\nmouth. He seemed to be hoarse and gasping, and the unlucky fellow kept\r\nexclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cHelp! Help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe sent all thoughts of prudence to the devil, and in two bounds we were\r\nat the back of the inn, where a terrible sight met our eyes.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPiedelot was being burned alive. He was writhing in the midst of a heap\r\nof fagots, tied to a stake, and the flames were licking him with their\r\nburning tongues. When he saw us, his tongue seemed to stick in his\r\nthroat; he drooped his head, and seemed as if he were going to die. It\r\nwas only the affair of a moment to upset the burning pile, to scatter\r\nthe embers, and to cut the ropes that fastened him.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! In what a terrible state we found him. The evening before\r\nhe had had his left arm broken, and it seemed as if he had been badly\r\nbeaten since then, for his whole body was covered with wounds, bruises\r\nand blood. The flames had also begun their work on him, and he had two\r\nlarge burns, one on his loins and the other on his right thigh, and his\r\nbeard and hair were scorched. Poor Piedelot!\r\n\r\nNo one knows the terrible rage we felt at this sight! We would have\r\nrushed headlong at a hundred thousand Prussians; our thirst for\r\nvengeance was intense. But the cowards had run away, leaving their crime\r\nbehind them. Where could we find them now? Meanwhile, however, the\r\ncaptain's wife was looking after Piedelot, and dressing his wounds as\r\nbest she could, while the captain himself shook hands with him\r\nexcitedly, and in a few minutes he came to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, captain; good-morning, all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! the\r\nscoundrels, the wretches! Why, twenty of them came to surprise us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty, do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; there was a whole band of them, and that is why I disobeyed\r\norders, captain, and fired on them, for they would have killed you all,\r\nand I preferred to stop them. That frightened them, and they did not\r\nventure to go farther than the crossroads. They were such cowards. Four\r\nof them shot at me at twenty yards, as if I had been a target, and then\r\nthey slashed me with their swords. My arm was broken, so that I could\r\nonly use my bayonet with one hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did you not call for help?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took good care not to do that, for you would all have come; and you\r\nwould neither have been able to defend me nor yourselves, being only\r\nfive against twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that we should not have allowed you to have been taken, poor\r\nold fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI preferred to die by myself, don't you see! I did not want to bring\r\nyou here, for it would have been a mere ambush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will not talk about it any more. Do you feel rather easier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am suffocating. I know that I cannot live much longer. The\r\nbrutes! They tied me to a tree, and beat me till I was half dead, and\r\nthen they shook my broken arm; but I did not make a sound. I would\r\nrather have bitten my tongue out than have called out before them. Now I\r\ncan tell what I am suffering and shed tears; it does one good. Thank\r\nyou, my kind friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Piedelot! But we will avenge you, you may be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; I want you to do that. There is, in particular, a woman among\r\nthem who passes as the wife of the lancer whom the captain killed\r\nyesterday. She is dressed like a lancer, and she tortured me the most\r\nyesterday, and suggested burning me; and it was she who set fire to the\r\nwood. Oh! the wretch, the brute! Ah! how I am suffering! My loins, my\r\narms!\xe2\x80\x9d and he fell back gasping and exhausted, writhing in his terrible\r\nagony, while the captain's wife wiped the perspiration from his\r\nforehead, and we all shed tears of grief and rage, as if we had been\r\nchildren. I will not describe the end to you; he died half an hour\r\nlater, previously telling us in what direction the enemy had gone. When\r\nhe was dead we gave ourselves time to bury him, and then we set out in\r\npursuit of them, with our hearts full of fury and hatred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will throw ourselves on the whole Prussian army, if it be\r\nnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we will avenge Piedelot. We must\r\ncatch those scoundrels. Let us swear to die, rather than not to find\r\nthem; and if I am killed first, these are my orders: All the prisoners\r\nthat you take are to be shot immediately, and as for the lancer's wife,\r\nshe is to be tortured before she is put to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must not be shot, because she is a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain's wife said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you survive, I am sure that you would not shoot a woman. Torturing\r\nher will be quite sufficient; but if you are killed in this pursuit, I\r\nwant one thing, and that is to fight with her; I will kill her with my\r\nown hands, and the others can do what they like with her if she kills\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will outrage her! We will burn her! We will tear her to pieces!\r\nPiedelot shall be avenged!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe next morning we unexpectedly fell on an outpost of uhlans four\r\nleagues away. Surprised by our sudden attack, they were not able to\r\nmount their horses, nor even to defend themselves; and in a few moments\r\nwe had five prisoner, corresponding to our own number. The captain\r\nquestioned them, and from their answers we felt certain that they were\r\nthe same whom we had encountered the previous day. Then a very curious\r\noperation took place. One of us was told off to ascertain their sex, and\r\nnothing can describe our joy when we discovered what we were seeking\r\namong them, the female executioner who had tortured our friend.\r\n\r\nThe four others were shot on the spot, with their backs to us and close\r\nto the muzzles of our rifles; and then we turned our attention to the\r\nwoman. What were we going to do with her? I must acknowledge that we\r\nwere all of us in favor of shooting her. Hatred, and the wish to avenge\r\nPiedelot, had extinguished all pity in us, and we had forgotten that we\r\nwere going to shoot a woman, but a woman reminded us of it, the\r\ncaptain's wife; at her entreaties, therefore, we determined to keep her\r\na prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe captain's poor wife was to be severely punished for this act of\r\nclemency.\r\n\r\nThe next day we heard that the armistice had been extended to the\r\neastern part of France, and we had to put an end to our little campaign.\r\nTwo of us, who belonged to the neighborhood, returned home, so there\r\nwere only four of us, all told: the captain, his wife, and two men. We\r\nbelonged to Besancon, which was still being besieged in spite of the\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us stop here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe that the war is\r\ngoing to end like this. The devil take it! Surely there are men still\r\nleft in France; and now is the time to prove what they are made of. The\r\nspring is coming on, and the armistice is only a trap laid for the\r\nPrussians. During the time that it lasts, a new army will be raised, and\r\nsome fine morning we shall fall upon them again. We shall be ready, and\r\nwe have a hostage\xe2\x80\x94let us remain here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe fixed our quarters there. It was terribly cold, and we did not go out\r\nmuch, and somebody had always to keep the female prisoner in sight.\r\n\r\nShe was sullen, and never said anything, or else spoke of her husband,\r\nwhom the captain had killed. She looked at him continually with fierce\r\neyes, and we felt that she was tortured by a wild longing for revenge.\r\nThat seemed to us to be the most suitable punishment for the terrible\r\ntorments that she had made Piedelot suffer, for impotent vengeance is\r\nsuch intense pain!\r\n\r\nAlas! we who knew how to avenge our comrade ought to have thought that\r\nthis woman would know how to avenge her husband, and have been on our\r\nguard. It is true that one of us kept watch every night, and that at\r\nfirst we tied her by a long rope to the great oak bench that was\r\nfastened to the wall. But, by and by, as she had never tried to escape,\r\nin spite of her hatred for us, we relaxed our extreme prudence, and\r\nallowed her to sleep somewhere else except on the bench, and without\r\nbeing tied. What had we to fear? She was at the end of the room, a man\r\nwas on guard at the door, and between her and the sentinel the captain's\r\nwife and two other men used to lie. She was alone and unarmed against\r\nfour, so there could be no danger.\r\n\r\nOne night when we were asleep, and the captain was on guard, the\r\nlancer's wife was lying more quietly in her corner than usual, and she\r\nhad even smiled for the first time since she had been our prisoner\r\nduring the evening. Suddenly, however, in the middle of the night, we\r\nwere all awakened by a terrible cry. We got up, groping about, and at\r\nonce stumbled over a furious couple who were rolling about and fighting\r\non the ground. It was the captain and the lancer's wife. We threw\r\nourselves on them, and separated them in a moment. She was shouting and\r\nlaughing, and he seemed to have the death rattle. All this took place in\r\nthe dark. Two of us held her, and when a light was struck a terrible\r\nsight met our eyes. The captain was lying on the floor in a pool of\r\nblood, with an enormous gash in his throat, and his sword bayonet, that\r\nhad been taken from his rifle, was sticking in the red, gaping wound. A\r\nfew minutes afterward he died, without having been able to utter a word.\r\n\r\nHis wife did not shed a tear. Her eyes were dry, her throat was\r\ncontracted, and she looked at the lancer's wife steadfastly, and with a\r\ncalm ferocity that inspired fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman belongs to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to us suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou swore to me\r\nnot a week ago to let me kill her as I chose, if she killed my husband;\r\nand you must keep your oath. You must fasten her securely to the\r\nfireplace, upright against the back of it, and then you can go where you\r\nlike, but far from here. I will take my revenge on her myself. Leave the\r\ncaptain's body, and we three, he, she and I, will remain here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe obeyed, and went away. She promised to write to us to Geneva, as we\r\nwere returning thither.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTwo days later I received the following letter, dated the day after we\r\nhad left, that had been written at an inn on the high road:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY FRIEND: I am writing to you, according to my promise. For the moment\r\nI am at the inn, where I have just handed my prisoner over to a Prussian\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you, my friend, that this poor woman has left two children\r\nin Germany. She had followed her husband, whom she adored, as she did\r\nnot wish him to be exposed to the risks of war by himself, and as her\r\nchildren were with their grandparents. I have learned all this since\r\nyesterday, and it has turned my ideas of vengeance into more humane\r\nfeelings. At the very moment when I felt pleasure in insulting this\r\nwoman, and in threatening her with the most fearful torments, in\r\nrecalling Piedelot, who had been burned alive, and in threatening her\r\nwith a similar death, she looked at me coldly, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What have you got to reproach me with, Frenchwoman? You think that you\r\nwill do right in avenging your husband's death, is not that so?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes,' I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Very well, then; in killing him, I did what you are going to do in\r\nburning me. I avenged my husband, for your husband killed him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well,' I replied, 'as you approve of this vengeance, prepare to endure\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I do not fear it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in fact she did not seem to have lost courage. Her face was calm,\r\nand she looked at me without trembling, while I brought wood and dried\r\nleaves together, and feverishly threw on to them the powder from some\r\ncartridges, which was to make her funeral pile the more cruel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hesitated in my thoughts of persecution for a moment. But the captain\r\nwas there, pale and covered with blood, and he seemed to be looking at\r\nme with his large, glassy eyes, and I applied myself to my work again\r\nafter kissing his pale lips. Suddenly, however, on raising my head, I\r\nsaw that she was crying, and I felt rather surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'So you are frightened?' I said to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, but when I saw you kiss your husband, I thought of mine, of all\r\nwhom I love.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe continued to sob, but stopping suddenly, she said to me in broken\r\nwords and in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Have you any children?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA shiver rare over me, for I guessed that this poor woman had some. She\r\nasked me to look in a pocketbook which was in her bosom, and in it I saw\r\ntwo photographs of quite young children, a boy and a girl, with those\r\nkind, gentle, chubby faces that German children have. In it there were\r\nalso two locks of light hair and a letter in a large, childish hand, and\r\nbeginning with German words which meant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My dear little mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I could not restrain my tears, my dear friend, and so I untied her,\r\nand without venturing to look at the face of my poor dead husband, who\r\nwas not to be avenged, I went with her as far as the inn. She is free; I\r\nhave just left her, and she kissed me with tears. I am going upstairs to\r\nmy husband; come as soon as possible, my dear friend, to look for our\r\ntwo bodies.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI set off with all speed, and when I arrived there was a Prussian patrol\r\nat the cottage; and when I asked what it all meant, I was told that\r\nthere was a captain of francs-tireurs and his wife inside, both dead. I\r\ngave their names; they saw that I knew them, and I begged to be allowed\r\nto arrange their funeral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody has already undertaken it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cGo in if you wish\r\nto, as you know them. You can settle about their funeral with their\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went in. The captain and his wife were lying side by side on a bed,\r\nand were covered by a sheet. I raised it, and saw that the woman had\r\ninflicted a similar wound in her throat to that from which her husband\r\nhad died.\r\n\r\nAt the side of the bed there sat, watching and weeping, the woman who\r\nhad been mentioned to me as their best friend. It was the lancer's wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONERS\r\n\r\nThere was not a sound in the forest save the indistinct, fluttering\r\nsound of the snow falling on the trees. It had been snowing since noon;\r\na little fine snow, that covered the branches as with frozen moss, and\r\nspread a silvery covering over the dead leaves in the ditches, and\r\ncovered the roads with a white, yielding carpet, and made still more\r\nintense the boundless silence of this ocean of trees.\r\n\r\nBefore the door of the forester's dwelling a young woman, her arms bare\r\nto the elbow, was chopping wood with a hatchet on a block of stone. She\r\nwas tall, slender, strong-a true girl of the woods, daughter and wife of\r\na forester.\r\n\r\nA voice called from within the house:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are alone to-night, Berthine; you must come in. It is getting dark,\r\nand there may be Prussians or wolves about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've just finished, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young woman, splitting as she\r\nspoke an immense log of wood with strong, deft blows, which expanded her\r\nchest each time she raised her arms to strike. \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am; there's no\r\nneed to be afraid; it's quite light still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she gathered up her sticks and logs, piled them in the chimney\r\ncorner, went back to close the great oaken shutters, and finally came\r\nin, drawing behind her the heavy bolts of the door.\r\n\r\nHer mother, a wrinkled old woman whom age had rendered timid, was\r\nspinning by the fireside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am uneasy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen your father's not here. Two women are not\r\nmuch good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger woman, \xe2\x80\x9cI'd cheerfully kill a wolf or a Prussian\r\nif it came to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she glanced at a heavy revolver hanging above the hearth.\r\n\r\nHer husband had been called upon to serve in the army at the beginning\r\nof the Prussian invasion, and the two women had remained alone with the\r\nold father, a keeper named Nicolas Pichon, sometimes called Long-legs,\r\nwho refused obstinately to leave his home and take refuge in the town.\r\n\r\nThis town was Rethel, an ancient stronghold built on a rock. Its\r\ninhabitants were patriotic, and had made up their minds to resist the\r\ninvaders, to fortify their native place, and, if need be, to stand a\r\nsiege as in the good old days. Twice already, under Henri IV and under\r\nLouis XIV, the people of Rethel had distinguished themselves by their\r\nheroic defence of their town. They would do as much now, by gad! or else\r\nbe slaughtered within their own walls.\r\n\r\nThey had, therefore, bought cannon and rifles, organized a militia, and\r\nformed themselves into battalions and companies, and now spent their\r\ntime drilling all day long in the square. All-bakers, grocers, butchers,\r\nlawyers, carpenters, booksellers, chemists-took their turn at military\r\ntraining at regular hours of the day, under the auspices of Monsieur\r\nLavigne, a former noncommissioned officer in the dragoons, now a draper,\r\nhaving married the daughter and inherited the business of Monsieur\r\nRavaudan, Senior.\r\n\r\nHe had taken the rank of commanding officer in Rethel, and, seeing that\r\nall the young men had gone off to the war, he had enlisted all the\r\nothers who were in favor of resisting an attack. Fat men now invariably\r\nwalked the streets at a rapid pace, to reduce their weight and improve\r\ntheir breathing, and weak men carried weights to strengthen their\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nAnd they awaited the Prussians. But the Prussians did not appear. They\r\nwere not far off, however, for twice already their scouts had penetrated\r\nas far as the forest dwelling of Nicolas Pichon, called Long-legs.\r\n\r\nThe old keeper, who could run like a fox, had come and warned the town.\r\nThe guns had been got ready, but the enemy had not shown themselves.\r\n\r\nLong-legs' dwelling served as an outpost in the Aveline forest. Twice a\r\nweek the old man went to the town for provisions and brought the\r\ncitizens news of the outlying district.\r\n\r\nOn this particular day he had gone to announce the fact that a small\r\ndetachment of German infantry had halted at his house the day before,\r\nabout two o'clock in the afternoon, and had left again almost\r\nimmediately. The noncommissioned officer in charge spoke French.\r\n\r\nWhen the old man set out like this he took with him his dogs\xe2\x80\x94two\r\npowerful animals with the jaws of lions-as a safeguard against the\r\nwolves, which were beginning to get fierce, and he left directions with\r\nthe two women to barricade themselves securely within their dwelling as\r\nsoon as night fell.\r\n\r\nThe younger feared nothing, but her mother was always apprehensive, and\r\nrepeated continually:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll come to grief one of these days. You see if we don't!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis evening she was, if possible, more nervous than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what time your father will be back?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not before eleven, for certain. When he dines with the commandant\r\nhe's always late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Berthine was hanging her pot over the fire to warm the soup when she\r\nsuddenly stood still, listening attentively to a sound that had reached\r\nher through the chimney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are people walking in the wood,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cseven or eight men at\r\nleast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe terrified old woman stopped her spinning wheel, and gasped:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! And your father not here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely finished speaking when a succession of violent blows\r\nshook the door.\r\n\r\nAs the woman made no reply, a loud, guttural voice shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a brief silence the same voice repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door or I'll break it down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerthine took the heavy revolver from its hook, slipped it into the\r\npocket of her skirt, and, putting her ear to the door, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the young woman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe detachment that came here the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy men and I have lost our way in the forest since morning. Open the\r\ndoor or I'll break it down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe forester's daughter had no choice; she shot back the heavy bolts,\r\nthrew open the ponderous shutter, and perceived in the wan light of the\r\nsnow six men, six Prussian soldiers, the same who had visited the house\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here at this time of night?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked dauntlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lost my bearings,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer; \xe2\x80\x9clost them completely. Then I\r\nrecognized this house. I've eaten nothing since morning, nor my men\r\neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I'm quite alone with my mother this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berthine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the soldier, who seemed a decent sort of fellow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won't do you any harm, but you must give us something to eat. We are\r\nnearly dead with hunger and fatigue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the girl moved aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in;\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThen entered, covered with snow, their helmets sprinkled with a creamy-\r\nlooking froth, which gave them the appearance of meringues. They seemed\r\nutterly worn out.\r\n\r\nThe young woman pointed to the wooden benches on either side of the\r\nlarge table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I'll make you some soup. You certainly look\r\ntired out, and no mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she bolted the door afresh.\r\n\r\nShe put more water in the pot, added butter and potatoes; then, taking\r\ndown a piece of bacon from a hook in the chimney earner, cut it in two\r\nand slipped half of it into the pot.\r\n\r\nThe six men watched her movements with hungry eyes. They had placed\r\ntheir rifles and helmets in a corner and waited for supper, as well\r\nbehaved as children on a school bench.\r\n\r\nThe old mother had resumed her spinning, casting from time to time a\r\nfurtive and uneasy glance at the soldiers. Nothing was to be heard save\r\nthe humming of the wheel, the crackling of the fire, and the singing of\r\nthe water in the pot.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a strange noise\xe2\x80\x94a sound like the harsh breathing of some\r\nwild animal sniffing under the door-startled the occupants of the room.\r\n\r\nThe German officer sprang toward the rifles. Berthine stopped him with a\r\ngesture, and said, smilingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's only the wolves. They are like you\xe2\x80\x94prowling hungry through the\r\nforest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe incredulous man wanted to see with his own eyes, and as soon as the\r\ndoor was opened he perceived two large grayish animals disappearing with\r\nlong, swinging trot into the darkness.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his seat, muttering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn't have believed it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he waited quietly till supper was ready.\r\n\r\nThe men devoured their meal voraciously, with mouths stretched to their\r\nears that they might swallow the more. Their round eyes opened at the\r\nsame time as their jaws, and as the soup coursed down their throats it\r\nmade a noise like the gurgling of water in a rainpipe.\r\n\r\nThe two women watched in silence the movements of the big red beards.\r\nThe potatoes seemed to be engulfed in these moving fleeces.\r\n\r\nBut, as they were thirsty, the forester's daughter went down to the\r\ncellar to draw them some cider. She was gone some time. The cellar was\r\nsmall, with an arched ceiling, and had served, so people said, both as\r\nprison and as hiding-place during the Revolution. It was approached by\r\nmeans of a narrow, winding staircase, closed by a trap-door at the\r\nfarther end of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhen Berthine returned she was smiling mysteriously to herself. She gave\r\nthe Germans her jug of cider.\r\n\r\nThen she and her mother supped apart, at the other end of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers had finished eating, and were all six falling asleep as\r\nthey sat round the table. Every now and then a forehead fell with a thud\r\non the board, and the man, awakened suddenly, sat upright again.\r\n\r\nBerthine said to the officer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and lie down, all of you, round the fire. There's lots of room for\r\nsix. I'm going up to my room with my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the two women went upstairs. They could be heard locking the door\r\nand walking about overhead for a time; then they were silent.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians lay down on the floor, with their feet to the fire and\r\ntheir heads resting on their rolled-up cloaks. Soon all six snored\r\nloudly and uninterruptedly in six different keys.\r\n\r\nThey had been sleeping for some time when a shot rang out so loudly that\r\nit seemed directed against the very walls of the house. The soldiers\r\nrose hastily. Two-then three-more shots were fired.\r\n\r\nThe door opened hastily, and Berthine appeared, barefooted and only half\r\ndressed, with her candle in her hand and a scared look on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are the French,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered; \xe2\x80\x9cat least two hundred of them. If\r\nthey find you here they'll burn the house down. For God's sake, hurry\r\ndown into the cellar, and don't make a sound, whatever you do. If you\r\nmake any noise we are lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll go, we'll go,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the terrified officer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman hurriedly raised the small, square trap-door, and the\r\nsix men disappeared one after another down the narrow, winding\r\nstaircase, feeling their way as they went.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the spike of the last helmet was out of sight Berthine\r\nlowered the heavy oaken lid\xe2\x80\x94thick as a wall, hard as steel, furnished\r\nwith the hinges and bolts of a prison cell\xe2\x80\x94shot the two heavy bolts, and\r\nbegan to laugh long and silently, possessed with a mad longing to dance\r\nabove the heads of her prisoners.\r\n\r\nThey made no sound, inclosed in the cellar as in a strong-box, obtaining\r\nair only from a small, iron-barred vent-hole.\r\n\r\nBerthine lighted her fire again, hung the pot over it, and prepared more\r\nsoup, saying to herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather will be tired to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she sat and waited. The heavy pendulum of the clock swung to and\r\nfro with a monotonous tick.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then the young woman cast an impatient glance at the dial-\r\na glance which seemed to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he'd be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut soon there was a sound of voices beneath her feet. Low, confused\r\nwords reached her through the masonry which roofed the cellar. The\r\nPrussians were beginning to suspect the trick she had played them, and\r\npresently the officer came up the narrow staircase, and knocked at the\r\ntrap-door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rising from her seat and approaching the\r\ncellarway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't do any such thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen it or I'll break it down!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the man angrily.\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHammer away, my good man! Hammer away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe struck with the butt-end of his gun at the closed oaken door. But it\r\nwould have resisted a battering-ram.\r\n\r\nThe forester's daughter heard him go down the stairs again. Then the\r\nsoldiers came one after another and tried their strength against the\r\ntrapdoor. But, finding their efforts useless, they all returned to the\r\ncellar and began to talk among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe young woman heard them for a short time, then she rose, opened the\r\ndoor of the house; looked out into the night, and listened.\r\n\r\nA sound of distant barking reached her ear. She whistled just as a\r\nhuntsman would, and almost immediately two great dogs emerged from the\r\ndarkness, and bounded to her side. She held them tight, and shouted at\r\nthe top of her voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA far-off voice replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Berthine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a few seconds, then repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice, nearer now, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Berthine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't go in front of the vent-hole!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted his daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\nPrussians in the cellar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man's tall figure could be seen to the left, standing\r\nbetween two tree trunks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrussians in the cellar?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are the same as were here yesterday. They lost their way, and I've\r\ngiven them free lodgings in the cellar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told the story of how she had alarmed them by firing the revolver,\r\nand had shut them up in the cellar.\r\n\r\nThe man, still serious, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what am I to do with them at this time of night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and fetch Monsieur Lavigne with his men,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHe'll take\r\nthem prisoners. He'll be delighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he will-delighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere's some soup for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said his daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cEat it quick, and then\r\nbe off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old keeper sat down at the table, and began to eat his soup, having\r\nfirst filled two plates and put them on the floor for the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians, hearing voices, were silent.\r\n\r\nLong-legs set off a quarter of an hour later, and Berthine, with her\r\nhead between her hands, waited.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners began to make themselves heard again. They shouted,\r\ncalled, and beat furiously with the butts of their muskets against the\r\nrigid trap-door of the cellar.\r\n\r\nThen they fired shots through the vent-hole, hoping, no doubt, to be\r\nheard by any German detachment which chanced to be passing that way.\r\n\r\nThe forester's daughter did not stir, but the noise irritated and\r\nunnerved her. Blind anger rose in her heart against the prisoners; she\r\nwould have been only too glad to kill them all, and so silence them.\r\n\r\nThen, as her impatience grew, she watched the clock, counting the\r\nminutes as they passed.\r\n\r\nHer father had been gone an hour and a half. He must have reached the\r\ntown by now. She conjured up a vision of him telling the story to\r\nMonsieur Lavigne, who grew pale with emotion, and rang for his servant\r\nto bring him his arms and uniform. She fancied she could bear the drum\r\nas it sounded the call to arms. Frightened faces appeared at the\r\nwindows. The citizen-soldiers emerged from their houses half dressed,\r\nout of breath, buckling on their belts, and hurrying to the commandant's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThen the troop of soldiers, with Long-legs at its head, set forth\r\nthrough the night and the snow toward the forest.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the clock. \xe2\x80\x9cThey may be here in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA nervous impatience possessed her. The minutes seemed interminable.\r\nWould the time never come?\r\n\r\nAt last the clock marked the moment she had fixed on for their arrival.\r\nAnd she opened the door to listen for their approach. She perceived a\r\nshadowy form creeping toward the house. She was afraid, and cried out.\r\nBut it was her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have sent me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto see if there is any change in the\r\nstate of affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he gave a shrill whistle. Soon a dark mass loomed up under the\r\ntrees; the advance guard, composed of ten men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't go in front of the vent-hole!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Long-legs at intervals.\r\n\r\nAnd the first arrivals pointed out the much-dreaded vent-hole to those\r\nwho came after.\r\n\r\nAt last the main body of the troop arrived, in all two hundred men, each\r\ncarrying two hundred cartridges.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lavigne, in a state of intense excitement, posted them in such\r\na fashion as to surround the whole house, save for a large space left\r\nvacant in front of the little hole on a level with the ground, through\r\nwhich the cellar derived its supply of air.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lavigne struck the trap-door a blow with his foot, and called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to speak to the Prussian officer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe German did not reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prussian officer!\xe2\x80\x9d again shouted the commandant.\r\n\r\nStill no response. For the space of twenty minutes Monsieur Lavigne\r\ncalled on this silent officer to surrender with bag and baggage,\r\npromising him that all lives should be spared, and that he and his men\r\nshould be accorded military honors. But he could extort no sign, either\r\nof consent or of defiance. The situation became a puzzling one.\r\n\r\nThe citizen-soldiers kicked their heels in the snow, slapping their arms\r\nacross their chest, as cabdrivers do, to warm themselves, and gazing at\r\nthe vent-hole with a growing and childish desire to pass in front of it.\r\n\r\nAt last one of them took the risk-a man named Potdevin, who was fleet of\r\nlimb. He ran like a deer across the zone of danger. The experiment\r\nsucceeded. The prisoners gave no sign of life.\r\n\r\nA voice cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no one there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd another soldier crossed the open space before the dangerous vent-\r\nhole. Then this hazardous sport developed into a game. Every minute a\r\nman ran swiftly from one side to the other, like a boy playing baseball,\r\nkicking up the snow behind him as he ran. They had lighted big fires of\r\ndead wood at which to warm themselves, and the figures of the runners\r\nwere illumined by the flames as they passed rapidly from the camp on the\r\nright to that on the left.\r\n\r\nSome one shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's your turn now, Maloison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaloison was a fat baker, whose corpulent person served to point many a\r\njoke among his comrades.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. They chaffed him. Then, nerving himself to the effort, he\r\nset off at a little, waddling gait, which shook his fat paunch and made\r\nthe whole detachment laugh till they cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, bravo, Maloison!\xe2\x80\x9d they shouted for his encouragement.\r\n\r\nHe had accomplished about two-thirds of his journey when a long, crimson\r\nflame shot forth from the vent-hole. A loud report followed, and the fat\r\nbaker fell face forward to the ground, uttering a frightful scream. No\r\none went to his assistance. Then he was seen to drag himself, groaning,\r\non all-fours through the snow until he was beyond danger, when he\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\nHe was shot in the upper part of the thigh.\r\n\r\nAfter the first surprise and fright were over they laughed at him again.\r\nBut Monsieur Lavigne appeared on the threshold of the forester's\r\ndwelling. He had formed his plan of attack. He called in a loud voice \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant Planchut, the plumber, and his workmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree men approached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the eavestroughs from the roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour they brought the commandant thirty yards of\r\npipes.\r\n\r\nNext, with infinite precaution, he had a small round hole drilled in the\r\ntrap-door; then, making a conduit with the troughs from the pump to this\r\nopening, he said, with an air of extreme satisfaction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we'll give these German gentlemen something to drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shout of frenzied admiration, mingled with uproarious laughter, burst\r\nfrom his followers. And the commandant organized relays of men, who were\r\nto relieve one another every five minutes. Then he commanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPump!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, the pump handle having been set in motion, a stream of water\r\ntrickled throughout the length of the piping, and flowed from step to\r\nstep down the cellar stairs with a gentle, gurgling sound.\r\n\r\nThey waited.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, then two, then three. The commandant, in a state of\r\nfeverish agitation, walked up and down the kitchen, putting his ear to\r\nthe ground every now and then to discover, if possible, what the enemy\r\nwere doing and whether they would soon capitulate.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was astir now. They could be heard moving the casks about,\r\ntalking, splashing through the water.\r\n\r\nThen, about eight o'clock in the morning, a voice came from the vent-\r\nhole \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to the French officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLavigne replied from the window, taking care not to put his head out too\r\nfar:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you surrender?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI surrender.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen put your rifles outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA rifle immediately protruded from the hole, and fell into the snow,\r\nthen another and another, until all were disposed of. And the voice\r\nwhich had spoken before said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more. Be quick! I am drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop pumping!\xe2\x80\x9d ordered the commandant.\r\n\r\nAnd the pump handle hung motionless.\r\n\r\nThen, having filled the kitchen with armed and waiting soldiers, he\r\nslowly raised the oaken trapdoor.\r\n\r\nFour heads appeared, soaking wet, four fair heads with long, sandy hair,\r\nand one after another the six Germans emerged\xe2\x80\x94scared, shivering and\r\ndripping from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThey were seized and bound. Then, as the French feared a surprise, they\r\nset off at once in two convoys, one in charge of the prisoners, and the\r\nother conducting Maloison on a mattress borne on poles.\r\n\r\nThey made a triumphal entry into Rethel.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lavigne was decorated as a reward for having captured a\r\nPrussian advance guard, and the fat baker received the military medal\r\nfor wounds received at the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO LITTLE SOLDIERS\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday, as soon as they were free, the little soldiers would go\r\nfor a walk. They turned to the right on leaving the barracks, crossed\r\nCourbevoie with rapid strides, as though on a forced march; then, as the\r\nhouses grew scarcer, they slowed down and followed the dusty road which\r\nleads to Bezons.\r\n\r\nThey were small and thin, lost in their ill-fitting capes, too large and\r\ntoo long, whose sleeves covered their hands; their ample red trousers\r\nfell in folds around their ankles. Under the high, stiff shako one could\r\njust barely perceive two thin, hollow-cheeked Breton faces, with their\r\ncalm, naive blue eyes. They never spoke during their journey, going\r\nstraight before them, the same idea in each one's mind taking the place\r\nof conversation. For at the entrance of the little forest of Champioux\r\nthey had found a spot which reminded them of home, and they did not feel\r\nhappy anywhere else.\r\n\r\nAt the crossing of the Colombes and Chatou roads, when they arrived\r\nunder the trees, they would take off their heavy, oppressive headgear\r\nand wipe their foreheads.\r\n\r\nThey always stopped for a while on the bridge at Bezons, and looked at\r\nthe Seine. They stood there several minutes, bending over the railing,\r\nwatching the white sails, which perhaps reminded them of their home, and\r\nof the fishing smacks leaving for the open.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had crossed the Seine, they would purchase provisions at\r\nthe delicatessen, the baker's, and the wine merchant's. A piece of\r\nbologna, four cents' worth of bread, and a quart of wine, made up the\r\nluncheon which they carried away, wrapped up in their handkerchiefs. But\r\nas soon as they were out of the village their gait would slacken and\r\nthey would begin to talk.\r\n\r\nBefore them was a plain with a few clumps of trees, which led to the\r\nwoods, a little forest which seemed to remind them of that other forest\r\nat Kermarivan. The wheat and oat fields bordered on the narrow path, and\r\nJean Kerderen said each time to Luc Le Ganidec:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's just like home, just like Plounivon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it's just like home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they went on, side by side, their minds full of dim memories of\r\nhome. They saw the fields, the hedges, the forests, and beaches.\r\n\r\nEach time they stopped near a large stone on the edge of the private\r\nestate, because it reminded them of the dolmen of Locneuven.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached the first clump of trees, Luc Le Ganidec would\r\ncut off a small stick, and, whittling it slowly, would walk on, thinking\r\nof the folks at home.\r\n\r\nJean Kerderen carried the provisions.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Luc would mention a name, or allude to some boyish\r\nprank which would give them food for plenty of thought. And the home\r\ncountry, so dear and so distant, would little by little gain possession\r\nof their minds, sending them back through space, to the well-known forms\r\nand noises, to the familiar scenery, with the fragrance of its green\r\nfields and sea air. They no longer noticed the smells of the city. And\r\nin their dreams they saw their friends leaving, perhaps forever, for the\r\ndangerous fishing grounds.\r\n\r\nThey were walking slowly, Luc Le Ganidec and Jean Kerderen, contented\r\nand sad, haunted by a sweet sorrow, the slow and penetrating sorrow of a\r\ncaptive animal which remembers the days of its freedom.\r\n\r\nAnd when Luc had finished whittling his stick, they came to a little\r\nnook, where every Sunday they took their meal. They found the two\r\nbricks, which they had hidden in a hedge, and they made a little fire of\r\ndry branches and roasted their sausages on the ends of their knives.\r\n\r\nWhen their last crumb of bread had been eaten and the last drop of wine\r\nhad been drunk, they stretched themselves out on the grass side by side,\r\nwithout speaking, their half-closed eyes looking away in the distance,\r\ntheir hands clasped as in prayer, their red-trousered legs mingling with\r\nthe bright colors of the wild flowers.\r\n\r\nTowards noon they glanced, from time to time, towards the village of\r\nBezons, for the dairy maid would soon be coming. Every Sunday she would\r\npass in front of them on the way to milk her cow, the only cow in the\r\nneighborhood which was sent out to pasture.\r\n\r\nSoon they would see the girl, coming through the fields, and it pleased\r\nthem to watch the sparkling sunbeams reflected from her shining pail.\r\nThey never spoke of her. They were just glad to see her, without\r\nunderstanding why.\r\n\r\nShe was a tall, strapping girl, freckled and tanned by the open air\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngirl typical of the Parisian suburbs.\r\n\r\nOnce, on noticing that they were always sitting in the same place, she\r\nsaid to them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you always come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLuc Le Ganidec, more daring than his friend, stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we come here for our rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was all. But the following Sunday, on seeing them, she smiled with\r\nthe kindly smile of a woman who understood their shyness, and she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here? Are you watching the grass grow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLuc, cheered up, smiled: \xe2\x80\x9cP'raps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's not growing fast, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered, still laughing: \xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on. But when she came back with her pail full of milk, she\r\nstopped before them and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant some? It will remind you of home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had, perhaps instinctively, guessed and touched the right spot.\r\n\r\nBoth were moved. Then not without difficulty, she poured some milk into\r\nthe bottle in which they had brought their wine. Luc started to drink,\r\ncarefully watching lest he should take more than his share. Then he\r\npassed the bottle to Jean. She stood before them, her hands on her hips,\r\nher pail at her feet, enjoying the pleasure that she was giving them.\r\nThen she went on, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, bye-bye until next Sunday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a long time they watched her tall form as it receded in the\r\ndistance, blending with the background, and finally disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe following week as they left the barracks, Jean said to Luc:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you think we ought to buy her something good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were sorely perplexed by the problem of choosing something to bring\r\nto the dairy maid. Luc was in favor of bringing her some chitterlings;\r\nbut Jean, who had a sweet tooth, thought that candy would be the best\r\nthing. He won, and so they went to a grocery to buy two sous' worth, of\r\nred and white candies.\r\n\r\nThis time they ate more quickly than usual, excited by anticipation.\r\n\r\nJean was the first one to notice her. \xe2\x80\x9cThere she is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and Luc\r\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled when she saw them, and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how are you to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both answered together:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right! How's everything with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she started to talk of simple things which might interest them; of\r\nthe weather, of the crops, of her masters.\r\n\r\nThey didn't dare to offer their candies, which were slowly melting in\r\nJean's pocket. Finally Luc, growing bolder, murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have brought you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked: \xe2\x80\x9cLet's see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Jean, blushing to the tips of his ears, reached in his pocket, and\r\ndrawing out the little paper bag, handed it to her.\r\n\r\nShe began to eat the little sweet dainties. The two soldiers sat in\r\nfront of her, moved and delighted.\r\n\r\nAt last she went to do her milking, and when she came back she again\r\ngave them some milk.\r\n\r\nThey thought of her all through the week and often spoke of her: The\r\nfollowing Sunday she sat beside them for a longer time.\r\n\r\nThe three of them sat there, side by side, their eyes looking far away\r\nin the distance, their hands clasped over their knees, and they told\r\neach other little incidents and little details of the villages where\r\nthey were born, while the cow, waiting to be milked, stretched her heavy\r\nhead toward the girl and mooed.\r\n\r\nSoon the girl consented to eat with them and to take a sip of wine.\r\nOften she brought them plums pocket for plums were now ripe. Her\r\npresence enlivened the little Breton soldiers, who chattered away like\r\ntwo birds.\r\n\r\nOne Tuesday something unusual happened to Luc Le Ganidec; he asked for\r\nleave and did not return until ten o'clock at night.\r\n\r\nJean, worried and racked his brain to account for his friend's having\r\nobtained leave.\r\n\r\nThe following Friday, Luc borrowed ten sons from one of his friends, and\r\nonce more asked and obtained leave for several hours.\r\n\r\nWhen he started out with Jean on Sunday he seemed queer, disturbed,\r\nchanged. Kerderen did not understand; he vaguely suspected something,\r\nbut he could not guess what it might be.\r\n\r\nThey went straight to the usual place, and lunched slowly. Neither was\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nSoon the girl appeared. They watched her approach as they always did.\r\nWhen she was near, Luc arose and went towards her. She placed her pail\r\non the ground and kissed him. She kissed him passionately, throwing her\r\narms around his neck, without paying attention to Jean, without even\r\nnoticing that he was there.\r\n\r\nPoor Jean was dazed, so dazed that he could not understand. His mind was\r\nupset and his heart broken, without his even realizing why.\r\n\r\nThen the girl sat down beside Luc, and they started to chat.\r\n\r\nJean was not looking at them. He understood now why his friend had gone\r\nout twice during the week. He felt the pain and the sting which\r\ntreachery and deceit leave in their wake.\r\n\r\nLuc and the girl went together to attend to the cow.\r\n\r\nJean followed them with his eyes. He saw them disappear side by side,\r\nthe red trousers of his friend making a scarlet spot against the white\r\nroad. It was Luc who sank the stake to which the cow was tethered. The\r\ngirl stooped down to milk the cow, while he absent-mindedly stroked the\r\nanimal's glossy neck. Then they left the pail in the grass and\r\ndisappeared in the woods.\r\n\r\nJean could no longer see anything but the wall of leaves through which\r\nthey had passed. He was unmanned so that he did not have strength to\r\nstand. He stayed there, motionless, bewildered and grieving-simple,\r\npassionate grief. He wanted to weep, to run away, to hide somewhere,\r\nnever to see anyone again.\r\n\r\nThen he saw them coming back again. They were walking slowly, hand in\r\nhand, as village lovers do. Luc was carrying the pail.\r\n\r\nAfter kissing him again, the girl went on, nodding carelessly to Jean.\r\nShe did not offer him any milk that day.\r\n\r\nThe two little soldiers sat side by side, motionless as always, silent\r\nand quiet, their calm faces in no way betraying the trouble in their\r\nhearts. The sun shone down on them. From time to time they could hear\r\nthe plaintive lowing of the cow. At the usual time they arose to return.\r\n\r\nLuc was whittling a stick. Jean carried the empty bottle. He left it at\r\nthe wine merchant's in Bezons. Then they stopped on the bridge, as they\r\ndid every Sunday, and watched the water flowing by.\r\n\r\nJean leaned over the railing, farther and farther, as though he had seen\r\nsomething in the stream which hypnotized him. Luc said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter? Do you want a drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had hardly said the last word when Jean's head carried away the rest\r\nof his body, and the little blue and red soldier fell like a shot and\r\ndisappeared in the water.\r\n\r\nLuc, paralyzed with horror, tried vainly to shout for help. In the\r\ndistance he saw something move; then his friend's head bobbed up out of\r\nthe water only to disappear again.\r\n\r\nFarther down he again noticed a hand, just one hand, which appeared and\r\nagain went out of sight. That was all.\r\n\r\nThe boatmen who had rushed to the scene found the body that day.\r\n\r\nLuc ran back to the barracks, crazed, and with eyes and voice full of\r\ntears, he related the accident: \xe2\x80\x9cHe leaned\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94he was leaning \xe2\x80\x94so far\r\nover\xe2\x80\x94that his head carried him away\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94fell \xe2\x80\x94he fell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmotion choked him so that he could say no more. If he had only known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER MILON\r\n\r\nFor a month the hot sun has been parching the fields. Nature is\r\nexpanding beneath its rays; the fields are green as far as the eye can\r\nsee. The big azure dome of the sky is unclouded. The farms of Normandy,\r\nscattered over the plains and surrounded by a belt of tall beeches,\r\nlook, from a distance, like little woods. On closer view, after lowering\r\nthe worm-eaten wooden bars, you imagine yourself in an immense garden,\r\nfor all the ancient apple-trees, as gnarled as the peasants themselves,\r\nare in bloom. The sweet scent of their blossoms mingles with the heavy\r\nsmell of the earth and the penetrating odor of the stables. It is noon.\r\nThe family is eating under the shade of a pear tree planted in front of\r\nthe door; father, mother, the four children, and the help\xe2\x80\x94two women and\r\nthree men are all there. All are silent. The soup is eaten and then a\r\ndish of potatoes fried with bacon is brought on.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time one of the women gets up and takes a pitcher down to\r\nthe cellar to fetch more cider.\r\n\r\nThe man, a big fellow about forty years old, is watching a grape vine,\r\nstill bare, which is winding and twisting like a snake along the side of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nAt last he says: \xe2\x80\x9cFather's vine is budding early this year. Perhaps we\r\nmay get something from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman then turns round and looks, without saying a word.\r\n\r\nThis vine is planted on the spot where their father had been shot.\r\n\r\nIt was during the war of 1870. The Prussians were occupying the whole\r\ncountry. General Faidherbe, with the Northern Division of the army, was\r\nopposing them.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians had established their headquarters at this farm. The old\r\nfarmer to whom it belonged, Father Pierre Milon, had received and\r\nquartered them to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\nFor a month the German vanguard had been in this village. The French\r\nremained motionless, ten leagues away; and yet, every night, some of the\r\nUhlans disappeared.\r\n\r\nOf all the isolated scouts, of all those who were sent to the outposts,\r\nin groups of not more than three, not one ever returned.\r\n\r\nThey were picked up the next morning in a field or in a ditch. Even\r\ntheir horses were found along the roads with their throats cut.\r\n\r\nThese murders seemed to be done by the same men, who could never be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe country was terrorized. Farmers were shot on suspicion, women were\r\nimprisoned; children were frightened in order to try and obtain\r\ninformation. Nothing could be ascertained.\r\n\r\nBut, one morning, Father Milon was found stretched out in the barn, with\r\na sword gash across his face.\r\n\r\nTwo Uhlans were found dead about a mile and a half from the farm. One of\r\nthem was still holding his bloody sword in his hand. He had fought,\r\ntried to defend himself. A court-martial was immediately held in the\r\nopen air, in front of the farm. The old man was brought before it.\r\n\r\nHe was sixty-eight years old, small, thin, bent, with two big hands\r\nresembling the claws of a crab. His colorless hair was sparse and thin,\r\nlike the down of a young duck, allowing patches of his scalp to be seen.\r\nThe brown and wrinkled skin of his neck showed big veins which\r\ndisappeared behind his jaws and came out again at the temples. He had\r\nthe reputation of being miserly and hard to deal with.\r\n\r\nThey stood him up between four soldiers, in front of the kitchen table,\r\nwhich had been dragged outside. Five officers and the colonel seated\r\nthemselves opposite him.\r\n\r\nThe colonel spoke in French:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Milon, since we have been here we have only had praise for you.\r\nYou have always been obliging and even attentive to us. But to-day a\r\nterrible accusation is hanging over you, and you must clear the matter\r\nup. How did you receive that wound on your face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant answered nothing.\r\n\r\nThe colonel continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour silence accuses you, Father Milon. But I want you to answer me! Do\r\nyou understand? Do you know who killed the two Uhlans who were found\r\nthis morning near Calvaire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man answered clearly\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel, surprised, was silent for a minute, looking straight at the\r\nprisoner. Father Milon stood impassive, with the stupid look of the\r\npeasant, his eyes lowered as though he were talking to the priest. Just\r\none thing betrayed an uneasy mind; he was continually swallowing his\r\nsaliva, with a visible effort, as though his throat were terribly\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\nThe man's family, his son Jean, his daughter-in-law and his two\r\ngrandchildren were standing a few feet behind him, bewildered and\r\naffrighted.\r\n\r\nThe colonel went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you also know who killed all the scouts who have been found dead,\r\nfor a month, throughout the country, every morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man answered with the same stupid look:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou killed them all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh huh! I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou alone? All alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh huh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me how you did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time the man seemed moved; the necessity for talking any length of\r\ntime annoyed him visibly. He stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dunno! I simply did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warn you that you will have to tell me everything. You might as well\r\nmake up your mind right away. How did you begin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man cast a troubled look toward his family, standing close behind\r\nhim. He hesitated a minute longer, and then suddenly made up his mind to\r\nobey the order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming home one night at about ten o'clock, the night after you\r\ngot here. You and your soldiers had taken more than fifty ecus worth of\r\nforage from me, as well as a cow and two sheep. I said to myself: 'As\r\nmuch as they take from you; just so much will you make them pay back.'\r\nAnd then I had other things on my mind which I will tell you. Just then\r\nI noticed one of your soldiers who was smoking his pipe by the ditch\r\nbehind the barn. I went and got my scythe and crept up slowly behind\r\nhim, so that he couldn't hear me. And I cut his head off with one single\r\nblow, just as I would a blade of grass, before he could say 'Booh!' If\r\nyou should look at the bottom of the pond, you will find him tied up in\r\na potato-sack, with a stone fastened to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got an idea. I took all his clothes, from his boots to his cap, and\r\nhid them away in the little wood behind the yard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man stopped. The officers remained speechless, looking at each\r\nother. The questioning began again, and this is what they learned.\r\n\r\nOnce this murder committed, the man had lived with this one thought:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill the Prussians!\xe2\x80\x9d He hated them with the blind, fierce hate of the\r\ngreedy yet patriotic peasant. He had his idea, as he said. He waited\r\nseveral days.\r\n\r\nHe was allowed to go and come as he pleased, because he had shown\r\nhimself so humble, submissive and obliging to the invaders. Each night\r\nhe saw the outposts leave. One night he followed them, having heard the\r\nname of the village to which the men were going, and having learned the\r\nfew words of German which he needed for his plan through associating\r\nwith the soldiers.\r\n\r\nHe left through the back yard, slipped into the woods, found the dead\r\nman's clothes and put them on. Then he began to crawl through the\r\nfields, following along the hedges in order to keep out of sight,\r\nlistening to the slightest noises, as wary as a poacher.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he thought the time ripe, he approached the road and hid\r\nbehind a bush. He waited for a while. Finally, toward midnight, he heard\r\nthe sound of a galloping horse. The man put his ear to the ground in\r\norder to make sure that only one horseman was approaching, then he got\r\nready.\r\n\r\nAn Uhlan came galloping along, carrying dispatches. As he went, he was\r\nall eyes and ears. When he was only a few feet away, Father Milon\r\ndragged himself across the road, moaning: \xe2\x80\x9cHilfe! Hilfe!\xe2\x80\x9d ( Help! Help!)\r\nThe horseman stopped, and recognizing a German, he thought he was\r\nwounded and dismounted, coming nearer without any suspicion, and just as\r\nhe was leaning over the unknown man, he received, in the pit of his\r\nstomach, a heavy thrust from the long curved blade of the sabre. He\r\ndropped without suffering pain, quivering only in the final throes. Then\r\nthe farmer, radiant with the silent joy of an old peasant, got up again,\r\nand, for his own pleasure, cut the dead man's throat. He then dragged\r\nthe body to the ditch and threw it in.\r\n\r\nThe horse quietly awaited its master. Father Milon mounted him and\r\nstarted galloping across the plains.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later he noticed two more Uhlans who were returning home,\r\nside by side. He rode straight for them, once more crying \xe2\x80\x9cHilfe!\r\nHilfe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prussians, recognizing the uniform, let him approach without\r\ndistrust. The old man passed between them like a cannon-ball, felling\r\nthem both, one with his sabre and the other with a revolver.\r\n\r\nThen he killed the horses, German horses! After that he quickly returned\r\nto the woods and hid one of the horses. He left his uniform there and\r\nagain put on his old clothes; then going back into bed, he slept until\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nFor four days he did not go out, waiting for the inquest to be\r\nterminated; but on the fifth day he went out again and killed two more\r\nsoldiers by the same stratagem. From that time on he did not stop. Each\r\nnight he wandered about in search of adventure, killing Prussians,\r\nsometimes here and sometimes there, galloping through deserted fields,\r\nin the moonlight, a lost Uhlan, a hunter of men. Then, his task\r\naccomplished, leaving behind him the bodies lying along the roads, the\r\nold farmer would return and hide his horse and uniform.\r\n\r\nHe went, toward noon, to carry oats and water quietly to his mount, and\r\nhe fed it well as he required from it a great amount of work.\r\n\r\nBut one of those whom he had attacked the night before, in defending\r\nhimself slashed the old peasant across the face with his sabre.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had killed them both. He had come back and hidden the horse\r\nand put on his ordinary clothes again; but as he reached home he began\r\nto feel faint, and had dragged himself as far as the stable, being\r\nunable to reach the house.\r\n\r\nThey had found him there, bleeding, on the straw.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his tale, he suddenly lifted up his head and looked\r\nproudly at the Prussian officers.\r\n\r\nThe colonel, who was gnawing at his mustache, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing else to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more; I have finished my task; I killed sixteen, not one more\r\nor less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that you are going to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven't asked for mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been a soldier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I served my time. And then, you had killed my father, who was a\r\nsoldier of the first Emperor. And last month you killed my youngest son,\r\nFrancois, near Evreux. I owed you one for that; I paid. We are quits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officers were looking at each other.\r\n\r\nThe old man continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight for my father, eight for the boy\xe2\x80\x94we are quits. I did not seek any\r\nquarrel with you. I don't know you. I don't even know where you come\r\nfrom. And here you are, ordering me about in my home as though it were\r\nyour own. I took my revenge upon the others. I'm not sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, straightening up his bent back, the old man folded his arms in the\r\nattitude of a modest hero.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians talked in a low tone for a long time. One of them, a\r\ncaptain, who had also lost his son the previous month, was defending the\r\npoor wretch. Then the colonel arose and, approaching Father Milon, said\r\nin a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, old man, there is perhaps a way of saving your life, it is to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the man was not listening, and, his eyes fixed on the hated officer,\r\nwhile the wind played with the downy hair on his head, he distorted his\r\nslashed face, giving it a truly terrible expression, and, swelling out\r\nhis chest, he spat, as hard as he could, right in the Prussian's face.\r\n\r\nThe colonel, furious, raised his hand, and for the second time the man\r\nspat in his face.\r\n\r\nAll the officers had jumped up and were shrieking orders at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn less than a minute the old man, still impassive, was pushed up\r\nagainst the wall and shot, looking smilingly the while toward Jean, his\r\neldest son, his daughter-in-law and his two grandchildren, who witnessed\r\nthis scene in dumb terror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COUP D'ETAT\r\n\r\nParis had just heard of the disaster at Sedan. A republic had been\r\ndeclared. All France was wavering on the brink of this madness which\r\nlasted until after the Commune. From one end of the country to the other\r\neverybody was playing soldier.\r\n\r\nCap-makers became colonels, fulfilling the duties of generals; revolvers\r\nand swords were displayed around big, peaceful stomachs wrapped in\r\nflaming red belts; little tradesmen became warriors commanding\r\nbattalions of brawling volunteers, and swearing like pirates in order to\r\ngive themselves some prestige.\r\n\r\nThe sole fact of handling firearms crazed these people, who up to that\r\ntime had only handled scales, and made them, without any reason,\r\ndangerous to all. Innocent people were shot to prove that they knew how\r\nto kill; in forests which had never seen a Prussian, stray dogs, grazing\r\ncows and browsing horses were killed.\r\n\r\nEach one thought himself called upon to play a great part in military\r\naffairs. The cafes of the smallest villages, full of uniformed\r\ntradesmen, looked like barracks or hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe town of Canneville was still in ignorance of the maddening news from\r\nthe army and the capital; nevertheless, great excitement had prevailed\r\nfor the last month, the opposing parties finding themselves face to\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe mayor, Viscount de Varnetot, a thin, little old man, a conservative,\r\nwho had recently, from ambition, gone over to the Empire, had seen a\r\ndetermined opponent arise in Dr. Massarel, a big, full-blooded man,\r\nleader of the Republican party of the neighborhood, a high official in\r\nthe local masonic lodge, president of the Agricultural Society and of\r\nthe firemen's banquet and the organizer of the rural militia which was\r\nto save the country.\r\n\r\nIn two weeks, he had managed to gather together sixty-three volunteers,\r\nfathers of families, prudent farmers and town merchants, and every\r\nmorning he would drill them in the square in front of the town-hall.\r\n\r\nWhen, perchance, the mayor would come to the municipal building,\r\nCommander Massarel, girt with pistols, would pass proudly in front of\r\nhis troop, his sword in his hand, and make all of them cry: \xe2\x80\x9cLong live\r\nthe Fatherland!\xe2\x80\x9d And it had been noticed that this cry excited the\r\nlittle viscount, who probably saw in it a menace, a threat, as well as\r\nthe odious memory of the great Revolution.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fifth of September, the doctor, in full uniform,\r\nhis revolver on the table, was giving a consultation to an old couple, a\r\nfarmer who had been suffering from varicose veins for the last seven\r\nyears and had waited until his wife had them also, before he would\r\nconsult the doctor, when the postman brought in the paper.\r\n\r\nM. Massarel opened it, grew pale, suddenly rose, and lifting his hands\r\nto heaven in a gesture of exaltation, began to shout at the top of his\r\nvoice before the two frightened country folks:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live the Republic! long live the Republic! long live the\r\nRepublic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he fell back in his chair, weak from emotion.\r\n\r\nAnd as the peasant resumed: \xe2\x80\x9cIt started with the ants, which began to\r\nrun up and down my legs\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Massarel exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up! I haven't got time to bother with your nonsense. The Republic\r\nhas been proclaimed, the emperor has been taken prisoner, France is\r\nsaved! Long live the Republic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRunning to the door, he howled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCeleste, quick, Celeste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant, affrighted, hastened in; he was trying to talk so rapidly,\r\nthat he could only stammer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boots, my sword, my cartridge-box and the Spanish dagger which is on\r\nmy night-table! Hasten!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the persistent peasant, taking advantage of a moment's silence,\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cI seemed to get big lumps which hurt me when I walk,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nphysician, exasperated, roared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up and get out! If you had washed your feet it would not have\r\nhappened!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, grabbing him by the collar, he yelled at him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't you understand that we are a republic, you brass-plated idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut professional sentiment soon calmed him, and he pushed the bewildered\r\ncouple out, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back to-morrow, come back to-morrow, my friends. I haven't any\r\ntime to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he equipped himself from head to foot, he gave a series of important\r\norders to his servant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun over to Lieutenant Picart and to Second Lieutenant Pommel, and tell\r\nthem that I am expecting them here immediately. Also send me Torchebeuf\r\nwith his drum. Quick! quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Celeste had gone out, he sat down and thought over the situation\r\nand the difficulties which he would have to surmount.\r\n\r\nThe three men arrived together in their working clothes. The commandant,\r\nwho expected to see them in uniform, felt a little shocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you people know anything? The emperor has been taken prisoner,\r\nthe Republic has been proclaimed. We must act. My position is delicate,\r\nI might even say dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reflected for a few moments before his bewildered subordinates, then\r\nhe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must act and not hesitate; minutes count as hours in times like\r\nthese. All depends on the promptness of our decision. You, Picart, go to\r\nthe cure and order him to ring the alarm-bell, in order to get together\r\nthe people, to whom I am going to announce the news. You, Torchebeuf\r\nbeat the tattoo throughout the whole neighborhood as far as the hamlets\r\nof Gerisaie and Salmare, in order to assemble the militia in the public\r\nsquare. You, Pommel, get your uniform on quickly, just the coat and cap.\r\nWe are going to the town-hall to demand Monsieur de Varnetot to\r\nsurrender his powers to me. Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow carry out those orders quickly. I will go over to your house with\r\nyou, Pommel, since we shall act together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, the commandant and his subordinates, armed to the\r\nteeth, appeared on the square, just as the little Viscount de Varnetot,\r\nhis legs encased in gaiters as for a hunting party, his gun on his\r\nshoulder, was coming down the other street at double-quick time,\r\nfollowed by his three green-coated guards, their swords at their sides\r\nand their guns swung over their shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhile the doctor stopped, bewildered, the four men entered the town-hall\r\nand closed the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have outstripped us,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the physician, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must now wait\r\nfor reenforcements. There is nothing to do for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLieutenant Picart now appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest refuses to obey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has even locked himself in\r\nthe church with the sexton and beadle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the square, opposite the white, tightly closed\r\ntown-hall, stood the church, silent and dark, with its massive oak door\r\nstudded with iron.\r\n\r\nBut just as the perplexed inhabitants were sticking their heads out of\r\nthe windows or coming out on their doorsteps, the drum suddenly began to\r\nbe heard, and Torchebeuf appeared, furiously beating the tattoo. He\r\ncrossed the square running, and disappeared along the road leading to\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nThe commandant drew his sword, and advanced alone to half way between\r\nthe two buildings behind which the enemy had intrenched itself, and,\r\nwaving his sword over his head, he roared with all his might:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live the Republic! Death to traitors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he returned to his officers.\r\n\r\nThe butcher, the baker and the druggist, much disturbed, were anxiously\r\npulling down their shades and closing their shops. The grocer alone kept\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nHowever, the militia were arriving by degrees, each man in a different\r\nuniform, but all wearing a black cap with gold braid, the cap being the\r\nprincipal part of the outfit. They were armed with old rusty guns, the\r\nold guns which had hung for thirty years on the kitchen wall; and they\r\nlooked a good deal like an army of tramps.\r\n\r\nWhen he had about thirty men about him, the commandant, in a few words,\r\noutlined the situation to them. Then, turning to his staff: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\nact,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe villagers were gathering together and talking the matter over.\r\n\r\nThe doctor quickly decided on a plan of campaign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Picart, you will advance under the windows of this town-hall\r\nand summon Monsieur de Varnetot, in the name of the Republic, to hand\r\nthe keys over to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the lieutenant, a master mason, refused:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're smart, you are. I don't care to get killed, thank you. Those\r\npeople in there shoot straight, don't you forget it. Do your errands\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commandant grew very red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI command you to go in the name of discipline!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant rebelled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm not going to have my beauty spoiled without knowing why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the notables, gathered in a group near by, began to laugh. One of\r\nthem cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Picart, this isn't the right time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor then muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCowards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, leaving his sword and his revolver in the hands of a soldier, he\r\nadvanced slowly, his eye fastened on the windows, expecting any minute\r\nto see a gun trained on him.\r\n\r\nWhen he was within a few feet of the building, the doors at both ends,\r\nleading into the two schools, opened and a flood of children ran out,\r\nboys from one side, girls from the ether, and began to play around the\r\ndoctor, in the big empty square, screeching and screaming, and making so\r\nmuch noise that he could not make himself heard.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last child was out of the building, the two doors closed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMost of the youngsters finally dispersed, and the commandant called in a\r\nloud voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Varnetot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA window on the first floor opened and M. de Varnetot appeared.\r\n\r\nThe commandant continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, you know that great events have just taken place which have\r\nchanged the entire aspect of the government. The one which you\r\nrepresented no longer exists. The one which I represent is taking\r\ncontrol. Under these painful, but decisive circumstances, I come, in the\r\nname of the new Republic, to ask you to turn over to me the office which\r\nyou held under the former government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Varnetot answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor, I am the mayor of Canneville, duly appointed, and I shall\r\nremain mayor of Canneville until I have been dismissed by a decree from\r\nmy superiors. As mayor, I am in my place in the townhall, and here I\r\nstay. Anyhow, just try to get me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe closed the window.\r\n\r\nThe commandant returned to his troop. But before giving any information,\r\neyeing Lieutenant Picart from head to foot, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're a great one, you are! You're a fine specimen of manhood! You're\r\na disgrace to the army! I degrade you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't give a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away and mingled with a group of townspeople.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor hesitated. What could he do? Attack? But would his men\r\nobey orders? And then, did he have the right to do so?\r\n\r\nAn idea struck him. He ran to the telegraph office, opposite the town-\r\nhall, and sent off three telegrams:\r\n\r\nTo the new republican government in Paris.\r\n\r\nTo the new prefect of the Seine-Inferieure, at Rouen.\r\n\r\nTo the new republican sub-prefect at Dieppe.\r\n\r\nHe explained the situation, pointed out the danger which the town would\r\nrun if it should remain in the hands of the royalist mayor; offered his\r\nfaithful services, asked for orders and signed, putting all his titles\r\nafter his name.\r\n\r\nThen he returned to his battalion, and, drawing ten francs from his\r\npocket, he cried: \xe2\x80\x9cHere, my friends, go eat and drink; only leave me a\r\ndetachment of ten men to guard against anybody's leaving the town-hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut ex-Lieutenant Picart, who had been talking with the watchmaker,\r\nheard him; he began to laugh, and exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, if they come out,\r\nit'll give you a chance to get in. Otherwise I can see you standing out\r\nthere for the rest of your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor did not reply, and he went to luncheon.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, he disposed his men about the town as though they were\r\nin immediate danger of an ambush.\r\n\r\nSeveral times he passed in front of the town-hall and of the church\r\nwithout noticing anything suspicious; the two buildings looked as though\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nThe butcher, the baker and the druggist once more opened up their\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nEverybody was talking about the affair. If the emperor were a prisoner,\r\nthere must have been some kind of treason. They did not know exactly\r\nwhich of the republics had returned to power.\r\n\r\nNight fell.\r\n\r\nToward nine o'clock, the doctor, alone, noiselessly approached the\r\nentrance of the public building, persuaded that the enemy must have gone\r\nto bed; and, as he was preparing to batter down the door with a pick-\r\naxe, the deep voice of a sentry suddenly called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd M. Massarel retreated as fast as his legs could carry him.\r\n\r\nDay broke without any change in the situation.\r\n\r\nArmed militia occupied the square. All the citizens had gathered around\r\nthis troop awaiting developments. Even neighboring villagers had come to\r\nlook on.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor, seeing that his reputation was at stake, resolved to\r\nput an end to the matter in one way or another; and he was about to take\r\nsome measures, undoubtedly energetic ones, when the door of the\r\ntelegraph station opened and the little servant of the postmistress\r\nappeared, holding in her hands two papers.\r\n\r\nFirst she went to the commandant and gave him one of the despatches;\r\nthen she crossed the empty square, confused at seeing the eyes of\r\neveryone on her, and lowering her head and running along with little\r\nquick steps, she went and knocked softly at the door of the barricaded\r\nhouse, as though ignorant of the fact that those behind it were armed.\r\n\r\nThe door opened wide enough to let a man's hand reach out and receive\r\nthe message; and the young girl returned blushing, ready to cry at being\r\nthus stared at by the whole countryside.\r\n\r\nIn a clear voice, the doctor cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the populace had quieted down, he continued proudly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the communication which I have received from the government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd lifting the telegram he read:\r\n\r\nFormer mayor dismissed. Inform him immediately, More orders following.\r\nFor the sub-prefect: SAPIN, Councillor.\r\n\r\nHe was-triumphant; his heart was throbbing with joy and his hands were\r\ntrembling; but Picart, his former subordinate, cried to him from a\r\nneighboring group:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's all right; but supposing the others don't come out, what good is\r\nthe telegram going to do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Massarel grew pale. He had not thought of that; if the others did not\r\ncome out, he would now have to take some decisive step. It was not only\r\nhis right, but his duty.\r\n\r\nHe looked anxiously at the town-hall, hoping to see the door open and\r\nhis adversary give in.\r\n\r\nThe door remained closed. What could he do? The crowd was growing and\r\nclosing around the militia. They were laughing.\r\n\r\nOne thought especially tortured the doctor. If he attacked, he would\r\nhave to march at the head of his men; and as, with him dead, all strife\r\nwould cease, it was at him and him only that M. de Varnetot and his\r\nthree guards would aim. And they were good shots, very good shots, as\r\nPicart had just said. But an idea struck him and, turning to Pommel, he\r\nordered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun quickly to the druggist and ask him to lend me a towel and a\r\nstick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant hastened.\r\n\r\nHe would make a flag of truce, a white flag, at the sight of which the\r\nroyalist heart of the mayor would perhaps rejoice.\r\n\r\nPommel returned with the cloth and a broom-stick. With some twine they\r\ncompleted the flag, and M. Massarel, grasping it in both hands and\r\nholding it in front of him, again advanced in the direction of the town-\r\nhall. When he was opposite the door, he once more called: \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de\r\nVarnetot!\xe2\x80\x9d The door suddenly opened and M. de Varnetot and his three\r\nguards appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\nInstinctively the doctor stepped back; then he bowed courteously to his\r\nenemy, and, choking with emotion, he announced: \xe2\x80\x9cI have come, monsieur,\r\nto make you acquainted with the orders which I have received.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nobleman, without returning the bow, answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI resign, monsieur,\r\nbut understand that it is neither through fear of, nor obedience to, the\r\nodious government which has usurped the power.\xe2\x80\x9d And, emphasizing every\r\nword, he declared: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to appear, for a single day, to serve\r\nthe Republic. That's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMassarel, stunned, answered nothing; and M. de Varnetot, walking\r\nquickly, disappeared around the corner of the square, still followed by\r\nhis escort.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, puffed up with pride, returned to the crowd. As soon as he\r\nwas near enough to make himself heard, he cried: \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah!\r\nVictory crowns the Republic everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no outburst of joy.\r\n\r\nThe doctor continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are free, you are free, independent! Be\r\nproud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe motionless villagers were looking at him without any signs of\r\ntriumph shining in their eyes.\r\n\r\nHe looked at them, indignant at their indifference, thinking of what he\r\ncould say or do in order to make an impression to electrify this calm\r\npeasantry, to fulfill his mission as a leader.\r\n\r\nHe had an inspiration and, turning to Pommel, he ordered: \xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant,\r\ngo get me the bust of the ex-emperor which is in the meeting room of the\r\nmunicipal council, and bring it here with a chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man presently reappeared, carrying on his right shoulder the plaster\r\nBonaparte, and holding in his left hand a cane-seated chair.\r\n\r\nM. Massarel went towards him, took the chair, placed the white bust on\r\nit, then stepping back a few steps, he addressed it in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTyrant, tyrant, you have fallen down in the mud. The dying fatherland\r\nwas in its death throes under your oppression. Vengeful Destiny has\r\nstruck you. Defeat and shame have pursued you; you fall conquered, a\r\nprisoner of the Prussians; and from the ruins of your crumbling empire,\r\nthe young and glorious Republic arises, lifting from the ground your\r\nbroken sword\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited for applause. Not a sound greeted his listening ear. The\r\npeasants, nonplussed, kept silent; and the white, placid, well-groomed\r\nstatue seemed to look at M. Massarel with its plaster smile,\r\nineffaceable and sarcastic.\r\n\r\nThus they stood, face to face, Napoleon on his chair, the physician\r\nstanding three feet away. Anger seized the commandant. What could he do\r\nto move this crowd and definitely to win over public opinion?\r\n\r\nHe happened to carry his hand to his stomach, and he felt, under his red\r\nbelt, the butt of his revolver.\r\n\r\nNot another inspiration, not another word cane to his mind. Then, he\r\ndrew his weapon, stepped back a few steps and shot the former monarch.\r\n\r\nThe bullet made a little black hole: like a spot, in his forehead. No\r\nsensation was created. M. Massarel shot a second time and made a second\r\nhole, then a third time, then, without stopping, he shot off the three\r\nremaining shots. Napoleon's forehead was blown away in a white powder,\r\nbut his eyes, nose and pointed mustache remained intact.\r\n\r\nThen in exasperation, the doctor kicked the chair over, and placing one\r\nfoot on what remained of the bust in the position of a conqueror, he\r\nturned to the amazed public and yelled: \xe2\x80\x9cThus may all traitors die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs no enthusiasm was, as yet, visible, the spectators appearing to be\r\ndumb with astonishment, the commandant cried to the militia: \xe2\x80\x9cYou may go\r\nhome now.\xe2\x80\x9d And he himself walked rapidly, almost ran, towards his house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he appeared, the servant told him that some patients had been\r\nwaiting in his office for over three hours. He hastened in. They were\r\nthe same two peasants as a few days before, who had returned at\r\ndaybreak, obstinate and patient.\r\n\r\nThe old man immediately began his explanation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt began with ants, which seemed to be crawling up and down my legs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT LARE'S MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the campaign Lieutenant Lare had taken two cannon\r\nfrom the Prussians. His general had said: \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhad given him the cross of honor.\r\n\r\nAs he was as cautious as he was brave, wary, inventive, wily and\r\nresourceful, he was entrusted with a hundred soldiers and he organized a\r\ncompany of scouts who saved the army on several occasions during a\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nBut the invading army entered by every frontier like a surging sea.\r\nGreat waves of men arrived one after the other, scattering all around\r\nthem a scum of freebooters. General Carrel's brigade, separated from its\r\ndivision, retreated continually, fighting each day, but remaining almost\r\nintact, thanks to the vigilance and agility of Lieutenant Lare, who\r\nseemed to be everywhere at the same moment, baffling all the enemy's\r\ncunning, frustrating their plans, misleading their Uhlans and killing\r\ntheir vanguards.\r\n\r\nOne morning the general sent for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a dispatch from General de Lacere, who\r\nwill be destroyed if we do not go to his aid by sunrise to-morrow. He is\r\nat Blainville, eight leagues from here. You will start at nightfall with\r\nthree hundred men, whom you will echelon along the road. I will follow\r\nyou two hours later. Study the road carefully; I fear we may meet a\r\ndivision of the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been freezing hard for a week. At two o'clock it began to snow,\r\nand by night the ground was covered and heavy white swirls concealed\r\nobjects hard by.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock the detachment set out.\r\n\r\nTwo men walked alone as scouts about three yards ahead. Then came a\r\nplatoon of ten men commanded by the lieutenant himself. The rest\r\nfollowed them in two long columns. To the right and left of the little\r\nband, at a distance of about three hundred feet on either side, some\r\nsoldiers marched in pairs.\r\n\r\nThe snow, which was still falling, covered them with a white powder in\r\nthe darkness, and as it did not melt on their uniforms, they were hardly\r\ndistinguishable in the night amid the dead whiteness of the landscape.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time they halted. One heard nothing but that indescribable,\r\nnameless flutter of falling snow\xe2\x80\x94a sensation rather than a sound, a\r\nvague, ominous murmur. A command was given in a low tone and when the\r\ntroop resumed its march it left in its wake a sort of white phantom\r\nstanding in the snow. It gradually grew fainter and finally disappeared.\r\nIt was the echelons who were to lead the army.\r\n\r\nThe scouts slackened their pace. Something was ahead of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn to the right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lieutenant; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the Ronfi wood; the\r\nchateau is more to the left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently the command \xe2\x80\x9cHalt\xe2\x80\x9d was passed along. The detachment stopped\r\nand waited for the lieutenant, who, accompanied by only ten men, had\r\nundertaken a reconnoitering expedition to the chateau.\r\n\r\nThey advanced, creeping under the trees. Suddenly they all remained\r\nmotionless. Around them was a dead silence. Then, quite near them, a\r\nlittle clear, musical young voice was heard amid the stillness of the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, we shall get lost in the snow. We shall never reach\r\nBlainville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deeper voice replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear, little daughter; I know the country as well as I know my\r\npocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant said a few words and four men moved away silently, like\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nAll at once a woman's shrill cry was heard through the darkness. Two\r\nprisoners were brought back, an old man and a young girl. The lieutenant\r\nquestioned them, still in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPierre Bernard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour profession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cButler to Comte de Ronfi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this your daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n'Yes!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is laundress at the chateau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are making our escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve Uhlans passed by this evening. They shot three keepers and\r\nhanged the gardener. I was alarmed on account of the little one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither are you bound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Blainville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there is a French army there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, follow us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey rejoined the column and resumed their march across country. The old\r\nman walked in silence beside the lieutenant, his daughter walking at his\r\nside. All at once she stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so tired I cannot go any farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she sat down. She was shaking with cold and seemed about to lose\r\nconsciousness. Her father wanted to carry her, but he was too old and\r\ntoo weak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sobbing, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall only impede your march. France\r\nbefore all. Leave us here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer had given a command. Some men had started off. They came\r\nback with branches they had cut, and in a minute a litter was ready. The\r\nwhole detachment had joined them by this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a woman dying of cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lieutenant. \xe2\x80\x9cWho will give his\r\ncape to cover her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo hundred capes were taken off. The young girl was wrapped up in these\r\nwarm soldiers' capes, gently laid in the litter, and then four' hardy\r\nshoulders lifted her up, and like an Eastern queen borne by her slaves\r\nshe was placed in the center of the detachment of soldiers, who resumed\r\ntheir march with more energy, more courage, more cheerfulness, animated\r\nby the presence of a woman, that sovereign inspiration that has stirred\r\nthe old French blood to so many deeds of valor.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour they halted again and every one lay down in the\r\nsnow. Over yonder on the level country a big, dark shadow was moving. It\r\nlooked like some weird monster stretching itself out like a serpent,\r\nthen suddenly coiling itself into a mass, darting forth again, then\r\nback, and then forward again without ceasing. Some whispered orders were\r\npassed around among the soldiers, and an occasional little, dry,\r\nmetallic click was heard. The moving object suddenly came nearer, and\r\ntwelve Uhlans were seen approaching at a gallop, one behind the other,\r\nhaving lost their way in the darkness. A brilliant flash suddenly\r\nrevealed to them two hundred men lying on the ground before them. A\r\nrapid fire was heard, which died away in the snowy silence, and all the\r\ntwelve fell to the ground, their horses with them.\r\n\r\nAfter a long rest the march was resumed. The old man whom they had\r\ncaptured acted as guide.\r\n\r\nPresently a voice far off in the distance cried out: \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother voice nearer by gave the countersign.\r\n\r\nThey made another halt; some conferences took place. It had stopped\r\nsnowing. A cold wind was driving the clouds, and innumerable stars were\r\nsparkling in the sky behind them, gradually paling in the rosy light of\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nA staff officer came forward to receive the detachment. But when he\r\nasked who was being carried in the litter, the form stirred; two little\r\nhands moved aside the big blue army capes and, rosy as the dawn, with\r\ntwo eyes that were brighter than the stars that had just faded from\r\nsight, and a smile as radiant as the morn, a dainty face appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, wild with delight, clapped their hands and bore the young\r\ngirl in triumph into the midst of the camp, that was just getting to\r\narms. Presently General Carrel arrived on the scene. At nine o'clock the\r\nPrussians made an attack. They beat a retreat at noon.\r\n\r\nThat evening, as Lieutenant Lare, overcome by fatigue, was sleeping on a\r\nbundle of straw, he was sent for by the general. He found the commanding\r\nofficer in his tent, chatting with the old man whom they had come across\r\nduring the night. As soon as he entered the tent the general took his\r\nhand, and addressing the stranger, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear comte, this is the young man of whom you were telling me just\r\nnow; he is one of my best officers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled, lowered his tone, and added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the astonished lieutenant, he presented \xe2\x80\x9cComte de\r\nRonfi-Quedissac.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man took both his hands, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lieutenant, you have saved my daughter's life. I have only one\r\nway of thanking you. You may come in a few months to tell me\xe2\x80\x94if you like\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne year later, on the very same day, Captain Lare and Miss Louise-\r\nHortense-Genevieve de Ronfi-Quedissac were married in the church of St.\r\nThomas Aquinas.\r\n\r\nShe brought a dowry of six thousand francs, and was said to be the\r\nprettiest bride that had been seen that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORRIBLE\r\n\r\nThe shadows of a balmy night were slowly falling. The women remained in\r\nthe drawing-room of the villa. The men, seated, or astride of garden\r\nchairs, were smoking outside the door of the house, around a table laden\r\nwith cups and liqueur glasses.\r\n\r\nTheir lighted cigars shone like eyes in the darkness, which was\r\ngradually becoming more dense. They had been talking about a frightful\r\naccident which had occurred the night before\xe2\x80\x94two men and three women\r\ndrowned in the river before the eyes of the guests.\r\n\r\nGeneral de G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, these things are affecting, but they are not horrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible, that well-known word, means much more than terrible. A\r\nfrightful accident like this affects, upsets, terrifies; it does not\r\nhorrify. In order that we should experience horror, something more is\r\nneeded than emotion, something more than the spectacle of a dreadful\r\ndeath; there must be a shuddering sense of mystery, or a sensation of\r\nabnormal terror, more than natural. A man who dies, even under the most\r\ntragic circumstances, does not excite horror; a field of battle is not\r\nhorrible; blood is not horrible; the vilest crimes are rarely horrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are two personal examples which have shown me what is the meaning\r\nof horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was during the war of 1870. We were retreating toward Pont-Audemer,\r\nafter having passed through Rouen. The army, consisting of about twenty\r\nthousand men, twenty thousand routed men, disbanded, demoralized,\r\nexhausted, were going to disband at Havre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe earth was covered with snow. The night was falling. They had not\r\neaten anything since the day before. They were fleeing rapidly, the\r\nPrussians not being far off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the Norman country, sombre, dotted with the shadows of the trees\r\nsurrounding the farms, stretched out beneath a black, heavy, threatening\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else could be heard in the wan twilight but the confused sound,\r\nundefined though rapid, of a marching throng, an endless tramping,\r\nmingled with the vague clink of tin bowls or swords. The men, bent,\r\nround-shouldered, dirty, in many cases even in rags, dragged themselves\r\nalong, hurried through the snow, with a long, broken-backed stride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe skin of their hands froze to the butt ends of their muskets, for it\r\nwas freezing hard that night. I frequently saw a little soldier take off\r\nhis shoes in order to walk barefoot, as his shoes hurt his weary feet;\r\nand at every step he left a track of blood. Then, after some time, he\r\nwould sit down in a field for a few minutes' rest, and he never got up\r\nagain. Every man who sat down was a dead man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould we have left behind us those poor, exhausted soldiers, who\r\nfondly counted on being able to start afresh as soon as they had\r\nsomewhat refreshed their stiffened legs? But scarcely had they ceased to\r\nmove, and to make their almost frozen blood circulate in their veins,\r\nthan an unconquerable torpor congealed them, nailed them to the ground,\r\nclosed their eyes, and paralyzed in one second this overworked human\r\nmechanism. And they gradually sank down, their foreheads on their knees,\r\nwithout, however, falling over, for their loins and their limbs became\r\nas hard and immovable as wood, impossible to bend or to stand upright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the rest of us, more robust, kept straggling on, chilled to the\r\nmarrow, advancing by a kind of inertia through the night, through the\r\nsnow, through that cold and deadly country, crushed by pain, by defeat,\r\nby despair, above all overcome by the abominable sensation of\r\nabandonment, of the end, of death, of nothingness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw two gendarmes holding by the arm a curious-looking little man,\r\nold, beardless, of truly surprising aspect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were looking for an officer, believing that they had caught a spy.\r\nThe word 'spy' at once spread through the midst of the stragglers, and\r\nthey gathered in a group round the prisoner. A voice exclaimed: 'He must\r\nbe shot!' And all these soldiers who were falling from utter\r\nprostration, only holding themselves on their feet by leaning on their\r\nguns, felt all of a sudden that thrill of furious and bestial anger\r\nwhich urges on a mob to massacre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to speak. I was at that time in command of a battalion; but\r\nthey no longer recognized the authority of their commanding officers;\r\nthey would even have shot me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the gendarmes said: 'He has been following us for the three last\r\ndays. He has been asking information from every one about the\r\nartillery.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took it on myself to question this person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing? What do you want? Why are you accompanying the\r\narmy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stammered out some words in some unintelligible dialect. He was,\r\nindeed, a strange being, with narrow shoulders, a sly look, and such an\r\nagitated air in my presence that I really no longer doubted that he was\r\na spy. He seemed very aged and feeble. He kept looking at me from under\r\nhis eyes with a humble, stupid, crafty air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men all round us exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'To the wall! To the wall!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to the gendarmes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Will you be responsible for the prisoner?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not ceased speaking when a terrible shove threw me on my back,\r\nand in a second I saw the man seized by the furious soldiers, thrown\r\ndown, struck, dragged along the side of the road, and flung against a\r\ntree. He fell in the snow, nearly dead already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd immediately they shot him. The soldiers fired at him, reloaded\r\ntheir guns, fired again with the desperate energy of brutes. They fought\r\nwith each other to have a shot at him, filed off in front of the corpse,\r\nand kept on firing at him, as people at a funeral keep sprinkling holy\r\nwater in front of a coffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suddenly a cry arose of 'The Prussians! the Prussians!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all along the horizon I heard the great noise of this panic-\r\nstricken army in full flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA panic, the result of these shots fired at this vagabond, had filled\r\nhis very executioners with terror; and, without realizing that they were\r\nthemselves the originators of the scare, they fled and disappeared in\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remained alone with the corpse, except for the two gendarmes whose\r\nduty compelled them to stay with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey lifted up the riddled mass of bruised and bleeding flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He must be searched,' I said. And I handed them a box of taper matches\r\nwhich I had in my pocket. One of the soldiers had another box. I was\r\nstanding between the two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gendarme who was examining the body announced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Clothed in a blue blouse, a white shirt, trousers, and a pair of\r\nshoes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first match went out; we lighted a second. The man continued, as he\r\nturned out his pockets:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A horn-handled pocketknife, check handkerchief, a snuffbox, a bit of\r\npack thread, a piece of bread.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second match went out; we lighted a third. The gendarme, after\r\nhaving felt the corpse for a long time, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That is all.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Strip him. We shall perhaps find something next his skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in order that the two soldiers might help each other in this task,\r\nI stood between them to hold the lighted match. By the rapid and\r\nspeedily extinguished flame of the match, I saw them take off the\r\ngarments one by one, and expose to view that bleeding bundle of flesh,\r\nstill warm, though lifeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd suddenly one of them exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Good God, general, it is a woman!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot describe to you the strange and poignant sensation of pain\r\nthat moved my heart. I could not believe it, and I knelt down in the\r\nsnow before this shapeless pulp of flesh to see for myself: it was a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two gendarmes, speechless and stunned, waited for me to give my\r\nopinion on the matter. But I did not know what to think, what theory to\r\nadopt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the brigadier slowly drawled out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Perhaps she came to look for a son of hers in the artillery, whom she\r\nhad not heard from.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other chimed in:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Perhaps, indeed, that is so.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, who had seen some very terrible things in my time, began to cry.\r\nAnd I felt, in the presence of this corpse, on that icy cold night, in\r\nthe midst of that gloomy plain; at the sight of this mystery, at the\r\nsight of this murdered stranger, the meaning of that word 'horror.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the same sensation last year, while interrogating one of the\r\nsurvivors of the Flatters Mission, an Algerian sharpshooter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the details of that atrocious drama. It is possible, however,\r\nthat you are unacquainted with one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe colonel travelled through the desert into the Soudan, and passed\r\nthrough the immense territory of the Touaregs, who, in that great ocean\r\nof sand which stretches from the Atlantic to Egypt and from the Soudan\r\nto Algeria, are a kind of pirates, resembling those who ravaged the seas\r\nin former days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe guides who accompanied the column belonged to the tribe of the\r\nChambaa, of Ouargla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, one day we encamped in the middle of the desert, and the Arabs\r\ndeclared that, as the spring was still some distance away, they would go\r\nwith all their camels to look for water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne man alone warned the colonel that he had been betrayed. Flatters\r\ndid not believe this, and accompanied the convoy with the engineers, the\r\ndoctors, and nearly all his officers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were massacred round the spring, and all the camels were captured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain of the Arab Intelligence Department at Ouargla, who had\r\nremained in the camp, took command of the survivors, spahis and\r\nsharpshooters, and they began to retreat, leaving behind them the\r\nbaggage and provisions, for want of camels to carry them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they started on their journey through this solitude without shade\r\nand boundless, beneath the devouring sun, which burned them from morning\r\ntill night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne tribe came to tender its submission and brought dates as a tribute.\r\nThe dates were poisoned. Nearly all the Frenchmen died, and, among them,\r\nthe last officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now only remained a few spahis with their quartermaster,\r\nPobeguin, and some native sharpshooters of the Chambaa tribe. They had\r\nstill two camels left. They disappeared one night, along with two,\r\nArabs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the survivors understood that they would be obliged to eat each\r\nother, and as soon as they discovered the flight of the two men with the\r\ntwo camels, those who remained separated, and proceeded to march, one by\r\none, through the soft sand, under the glare of a scorching sun, at a\r\ndistance of more than a gunshot from each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they went on all day, and when they reached a spring each of them\r\ncame to drink at it in turn, as soon as each solitary marcher had moved\r\nforward the number of yards arranged upon. And thus they continued\r\nmarching the whole day, raising everywhere they passed, in that level,\r\nburnt up expanse, those little columns of dust which, from a distance,\r\nindicate those who are trudging through the desert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut one morning one of the travellers suddenly turned round and\r\napproached the man behind him. And they all stopped to look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man toward whom the famished soldier drew near did not flee, but\r\nlay flat on the ground, and took aim at the one who was coming toward\r\nhim. When he believed he was within gunshot, he fired. The other was not\r\nhit, and he continued then to advance, and levelling his gun, in turn,\r\nhe killed his comrade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen from all directions the others rushed to seek their share. And he\r\nwho had killed the fallen man, cutting the corpse into pieces,\r\ndistributed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they once more placed themselves at fixed distances, these\r\nirreconcilable allies, preparing for the next murder which would bring\r\nthem together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor two days they lived on this human flesh which they divided between\r\nthem. Then, becoming famished again, he who had killed the first man\r\nbegan killing afresh. And again, like a butcher, he cut up the corpse\r\nand offered it to his comrades, keeping only his own portion of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so this retreat of cannibals continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last Frenchman, Pobeguin, was massacred at the side of a well, the\r\nvery night before the supplies arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand now what I mean by the horrible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the story told us a few nights ago by General de G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME PARISSE\r\n\r\nI was sitting on the pier of the small port of Obernon, near the village\r\nof Salis, looking at Antibes, bathed in the setting sun. I had never\r\nbefore seen anything so wonderful and so beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe small town, enclosed by its massive ramparts, built by Monsieur de\r\nVauban, extended into the open sea, in the middle of the immense Gulf of\r\nNice. The great waves, coming in from the ocean, broke at its feet,\r\nsurrounding it with a wreath of foam; and beyond the ramparts the houses\r\nclimbed up the hill, one after the other, as far as the two towers,\r\nwhich rose up into the sky, like the peaks of an ancient helmet. And\r\nthese two towers were outlined against the milky whiteness of the Alps,\r\nthat enormous distant wall of snow which enclosed the entire horizon.\r\n\r\nBetween the white foam at the foot of the walls and the white snow on\r\nthe sky-line the little city, dazzling against the bluish background of\r\nthe nearest mountain ranges, presented to the rays of the setting sun a\r\npyramid of red-roofed houses, whose facades were also white, but so\r\ndifferent one from another that they seemed to be of all tints.\r\n\r\nAnd the sky above the Alps was itself of a blue that was almost white,\r\nas if the snow had tinted it; some silvery clouds were floating just\r\nover the pale summits, and on the other side of the gulf Nice, lying\r\nclose to the water, stretched like a white thread between the sea and\r\nthe mountain. Two great sails, driven by a strong breeze, seemed to skim\r\nover the waves. I looked upon all this, astounded.\r\n\r\nThis view was one of those sweet, rare, delightful things that seem to\r\npermeate you and are unforgettable, like the memory of a great\r\nhappiness. One sees, thinks, suffers, is moved and loves with the eyes.\r\nHe who can feel with the eye experiences the same keen, exquisite and\r\ndeep pleasure in looking at men and things as the man with the delicate\r\nand sensitive ear, whose soul music overwhelms.\r\n\r\nI turned to my companion, M. Martini, a pureblooded Southerner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is certainly one of the rarest sights which it has been vouchsafed\r\nto me to admire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen Mont Saint-Michel, that monstrous granite jewel, rise out\r\nof the sand at sunrise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen, in the Sahara, Lake Raianechergui, fifty kilometers long,\r\nshining under a moon as brilliant as our sun and breathing up toward it\r\na white cloud, like a mist of milk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen, in the Lipari Islands, the weird sulphur crater of the\r\nVolcanello, a giant flower which smokes and burns, an enormous yellow\r\nflower, opening out in the midst of the sea, whose stem is a volcano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have seen nothing more wonderful than Antibes, standing against\r\nthe Alps in the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know not how it is that memories of antiquity haunt me; verses of\r\nHomer come into my mind; this is a city of the ancient East, a city of\r\nthe odyssey; this is Troy, although Troy was very far from the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Martini drew the Sarty guide-book out of his pocket and read: \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\ncity was originally a colony founded by the Phocians of Marseilles,\r\nabout 340 B.C. They gave it the Greek name of Antipolis, meaning\r\ncounter-city, city opposite another, because it is in fact opposite to\r\nNice, another colony from Marseilles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the Gauls were conquered, the Romans turned Antibes into a\r\nmunicipal city, its inhabitants receiving the rights of Roman\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know by an epigram of Martial that at this time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't care what she was. I tell you that I see down there a city of\r\nthe Odyssey. The coast of Asia and the coast of Europe resemble each\r\nother in their shores, and there is no city on the other coast of the\r\nMediterranean which awakens in me the memories of the heroic age as this\r\none does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA footstep caused me to turn my head; a woman, a large, dark woman, was\r\nwalking along the road which skirts the sea in going to the cape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Madame Parisse, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Monsieur Martini, dwelling\r\non the final syllable.\r\n\r\nNo, I did not know, but that name, mentioned carelessly, that name of\r\nthe Trojan shepherd, confirmed me in my dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, I asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWho is this Madame Parisse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed astonished that I did not know the story.\r\n\r\nI assured him that I did not know it, and I looked after the woman, who\r\npassed by without seeing us, dreaming, walking with steady and slow\r\nstep, as doubtless the ladies of old walked.\r\n\r\nShe was perhaps thirty-five years old and still very beautiful, though a\r\ntrifle stout.\r\n\r\nAnd Monsieur Martini told me the following story:\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Combelombe was married, one year before the war of 1870, to\r\nMonsieur Parisse, a government official. She was then a handsome young\r\ngirl, as slender and lively as she has now become stout and sad.\r\n\r\nUnwillingly she had accepted Monsieur Parisse, one of those little fat\r\nmen with short legs, who trip along, with trousers that are always too\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nAfter the war Antibes was garrisoned by a single battalion commanded by\r\nMonsieur Jean de Carmelin, a young officer decorated during the war, and\r\nwho had just received his four stripes.\r\n\r\nAs he found life exceedingly tedious in this fortress this stuffy mole-\r\nhole enclosed by its enormous double walls, he often strolled out to the\r\ncape, a kind of park or pine wood shaken by all the winds from the sea.\r\n\r\nThere he met Madame Parisse, who also came out in the summer evenings to\r\nget the fresh air under the trees. How did they come to love each other?\r\nWho knows? They met, they looked at each other, and when out of sight\r\nthey doubtless thought of each other. The image of the young woman with\r\nthe brown eyes, the black hair, the pale skin, this fresh, handsome\r\nSoutherner, who displayed her teeth in smiling, floated before the eyes\r\nof the officer as he continued his promenade, chewing his cigar instead\r\nof smoking it; and the image of the commanding officer, in his close-\r\nfitting coat, covered with gold lace, and his red trousers, and a little\r\nblond mustache, would pass before the eyes of Madame Parisse, when her\r\nhusband, half shaven and ill-clad, short-legged and big-bellied, came\r\nhome to supper in the evening.\r\n\r\nAs they met so often, they perhaps smiled at the next meeting; then,\r\nseeing each other again and again, they felt as if they knew each other.\r\nHe certainly bowed to her. And she, surprised, bowed in return, but\r\nvery, very slightly, just enough not to appear impolite. But after two\r\nweeks she returned his salutation from a distance, even before they were\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her. Of what? Doubtless of the setting sun. They admired it\r\ntogether, looking for it in each other's eyes more often than on the\r\nhorizon. And every evening for two weeks this was the commonplace and\r\npersistent pretext for a few minutes' chat.\r\n\r\nThen they ventured to take a few steps together, talking of anything\r\nthat came into their minds, but their eyes were already saying to each\r\nother a thousand more intimate things, those secret, charming things\r\nthat are reflected in the gentle emotion of the glance, and that cause\r\nthe heart to beat, for they are a better revelation of the soul than the\r\nspoken ward.\r\n\r\nAnd then he would take her hand, murmuring those words which the woman\r\ndivines, without seeming to hear them.\r\n\r\nAnd it was agreed between them that they would love each other without\r\nevidencing it by anything sensual or brutal.\r\n\r\nShe would have remained indefinitely at this stage of intimacy, but he\r\nwanted more. And every day he urged her more hotly to give in to his\r\nardent desire.\r\n\r\nShe resisted, would not hear of it, seemed determined not to give way.\r\n\r\nBut one evening she said to him casually: \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband has just gone to\r\nMarseilles. He will be away four days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJean de Carmelin threw himself at her feet, imploring her to open her\r\ndoor to him that very night at eleven o'clock. But she would not listen\r\nto him, and went home, appearing to be annoyed.\r\n\r\nThe commandant was in a bad humor all the evening, and the next morning\r\nat dawn he went out on the ramparts in a rage, going from one exercise\r\nfield to the other, dealing out punishment to the officers and men as\r\none might fling stones into a crowd,\r\n\r\nOn going in to breakfast he found an envelope under his napkin with\r\nthese four words: \xe2\x80\x9cTo-night at ten.\xe2\x80\x9d And he gave one hundred sous\r\nwithout any reason to the waiter.\r\n\r\nThe day seemed endless to him. He passed part of it in curling his hair\r\nand perfuming himself.\r\n\r\nAs he was sitting down to the dinner-table another envelope was handed\r\nto him, and in it he found the following telegram:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Love: Business completed. I return this evening on the nine o'clock\r\ntrain. PARISSE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commandant let loose such a vehement oath that the waiter dropped\r\nthe soup-tureen on the floor.\r\n\r\nWhat should he do? He certainly wanted her, that very, evening at\r\nwhatever cost; and he would have her. He would resort to any means, even\r\nto arresting and imprisoning the husband. Then a mad thought struck him.\r\nCalling for paper, he wrote the following note:\r\n\r\nMADAME: He will not come back this evening, I swear it to you,\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nshall be, you know where, at ten o'clock. Fear nothing. I will answer\r\nfor everything, on my honor as an officer. JEAN DE CARMELIN.\r\n\r\nAnd having sent off this letter, he quietly ate his dinner.\r\n\r\nToward eight o'clock he sent for Captain Gribois, the second in command,\r\nand said, rolling between his fingers the crumpled telegram of Monsieur\r\nParisse:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, I have just received a telegram of a very singular nature,\r\nwhich it is impossible for me to communicate to you. You will\r\nimmediately have all the gates of the city closed and guarded, so that\r\nno one, mind me, no one, will either enter or leave before six in the\r\nmorning. You will also have men patrol the streets, who will compel the\r\ninhabitants to retire to their houses at nine o'clock. Any one found\r\noutside beyond that time will be conducted to his home 'manu militari'.\r\nIf your men meet me this night they will at once go out of my way,\r\nappearing not to know me. You understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, commandant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hold you responsible for the execution of my orders, my dear\r\ncaptain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, commandant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to have a glass of chartreuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith great pleasure, commandant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey clinked glasses drank down the brown liquor and Captain Gribois\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nThe train from Marseilles arrived at the station at nine o'clock sharp,\r\nleft two passengers on the platform and went on toward Nice.\r\n\r\nOne of them, tall and thin, was Monsieur Saribe, the oil merchant, and\r\nthe other, short and fat, was Monsieur Parisse.\r\n\r\nTogether they set out, with their valises, to reach the city, one\r\nkilometer distant.\r\n\r\nBut on arriving at the gate of the port the guards crossed their\r\nbayonets, commanding them to retire.\r\n\r\nFrightened, surprised, cowed with astonishment, they retired to\r\ndeliberate; then, after having taken counsel one with the other, they\r\ncame back cautiously to parley, giving their names.\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers evidently had strict orders, for they threatened to\r\nshoot; and the two scared travellers ran off, throwing away their\r\nvalises, which impeded their flight.\r\n\r\nMaking the tour of the ramparts, they presented themselves at the gate\r\non the route to Cannes. This likewise was closed and guarded by a\r\nmenacing sentinel. Messrs. Saribe and Parisse, like the prudent men they\r\nwere, desisted from their efforts and went back to the station for\r\nshelter, since it was not safe to be near the fortifications after\r\nsundown.\r\n\r\nThe station agent, surprised and sleepy, permitted them to stay till\r\nmorning in the waiting-room.\r\n\r\nAnd they sat there side by side, in the dark, on the green velvet sofa,\r\ntoo scared to think of sleeping.\r\n\r\nIt was a long and weary night for them.\r\n\r\nAt half-past six in the morning they were informed that the gates were\r\nopen and that people could now enter Antibes.\r\n\r\nThey set out for the city, but failed to find their abandoned valises on\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nWhen they passed through the gates of the city, still somewhat anxious,\r\nthe Commandant de Carmelin, with sly glance and mustache curled up, came\r\nhimself to look at them and question them.\r\n\r\nThen he bowed to them politely, excusing himself for having caused them\r\na bad night. But he had to carry out orders.\r\n\r\nThe people of Antibes were scared to death. Some spoke of a surprise\r\nplanned by the Italians, others of the landing of the prince imperial\r\nand others again believed that there was an Orleanist conspiracy. The\r\ntruth was suspected only later, when it became known that the battalion\r\nof the commandant had been sent away, to a distance and that Monsieur de\r\nCarmelin had been severely punished.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Martini had finished his story. Madame Parisse returned, her\r\npromenade being ended. She passed gravely near me, with her eyes fixed\r\non the Alps, whose summits now gleamed rosy in the last rays of the\r\nsetting sun.\r\n\r\nI longed to speak to her, this poor, sad woman, who would ever be\r\nthinking of that night of love, now long past, and of the bold man who\r\nfor the sake of a kiss from her had dared to put a city into a state of\r\nsiege and to compromise his whole future.\r\n\r\nAnd to-day he had probably forgotten her, if he did not relate this\r\naudacious, comical and tender farce to his comrades over their cups.\r\n\r\nHad she seen him again? Did she still love him? And I thought: Here is\r\nan instance of modern love, grotesque and yet heroic. The Homer who\r\nshould sing of this new Helen and the adventure of her Menelaus must be\r\ngifted with the soul of a Paul de Kock. And yet the hero of this\r\ndeserted woman was brave, daring, handsome, strong as Achilles and more\r\ncunning than Ulysses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADEMOISELLE FIFI\r\n\r\nMajor Graf Von Farlsberg, the Prussian commandant, was reading his\r\nnewspaper as he lay back in a great easy-chair, with his booted feet on\r\nthe beautiful marble mantelpiece where his spurs had made two holes,\r\nwhich had grown deeper every day during the three months that he had\r\nbeen in the chateau of Uville.\r\n\r\nA cup of coffee was smoking on a small inlaid table, which was stained\r\nwith liqueur, burned by cigars, notched by the penknife of the\r\nvictorious officer, who occasionally would stop while sharpening a\r\npencil, to jot down figures, or to make a drawing on it, just as it took\r\nhis fancy.\r\n\r\nWhen he had read his letters and the German newspapers, which his\r\norderly had brought him, he got up, and after throwing three or four\r\nenormous pieces of green wood on the fire, for these gentlemen were\r\ngradually cutting down the park in order to keep themselves warm, he\r\nwent to the window. The rain was descending in torrents, a regular\r\nNormandy rain, which looked as if it were being poured out by some\r\nfurious person, a slanting rain, opaque as a curtain, which formed a\r\nkind of wall with diagonal stripes, and which deluged everything, a rain\r\nsuch as one frequently experiences in the neighborhood of Rouen, which\r\nis the watering-pot of France.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the officer looked at the sodden turf and at the swollen\r\nAndelle beyond it, which was overflowing its banks; he was drumming a\r\nwaltz with his fingers on the window-panes, when a noise made him turn\r\nround. It was his second in command, Captain Baron van Kelweinstein.\r\n\r\nThe major was a giant, with broad shoulders and a long, fan-like beard,\r\nwhich hung down like a curtain to his chest. His whole solemn person\r\nsuggested the idea of a military peacock, a peacock who was carrying his\r\ntail spread out on his breast. He had cold, gentle blue eyes, and a scar\r\nfrom a swordcut, which he had received in the war with Austria; he was\r\nsaid to be an honorable man, as well as a brave officer.\r\n\r\nThe captain, a short, red-faced man, was tightly belted in at the waist,\r\nhis red hair was cropped quite close to his head, and in certain lights\r\nhe almost looked as if he had been rubbed over with phosphorus. He had\r\nlost two front teeth one night, though he could not quite remember how,\r\nand this sometimes made him speak unintelligibly, and he had a bald\r\npatch on top of his head surrounded by a fringe of curly, bright golden\r\nhair, which made him look like a monk.\r\n\r\nThe commandant shook hands with him and drank his cup of coffee (the\r\nsixth that morning), while he listened to his subordinate's report of\r\nwhat had occurred; and then they both went to the window and declared\r\nthat it was a very unpleasant outlook. The major, who was a quiet man,\r\nwith a wife at home, could accommodate himself to everything; but the\r\ncaptain, who led a fast life, who was in the habit of frequenting low\r\nresorts, and enjoying women's society, was angry at having to be shut up\r\nfor three months in that wretched hole.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and when the commandant said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\none of the orderlies appeared, and by his mere presence announced that\r\nbreakfast was ready. In the dining-room they met three other officers of\r\nlower rank\xe2\x80\x94a lieutenant, Otto von Grossling, and two sub-lieutenants,\r\nFritz Scheuneberg and Baron von Eyrick, a very short, fair-haired man,\r\nwho was proud and brutal toward men, harsh toward prisoners and as\r\nexplosive as gunpowder.\r\n\r\nSince he had been in France his comrades had called him nothing but\r\nMademoiselle Fifi. They had given him that nickname on account of his\r\ndandified style and small waist, which looked as if he wore corsets; of\r\nhis pale face, on which his budding mustache scarcely showed, and on\r\naccount of the habit he had acquired of employing the French expression,\r\n'Fi, fi donc', which he pronounced with a slight whistle when he wished\r\nto express his sovereign contempt for persons or things.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room of the chateau was a magnificent long room, whose fine\r\nold mirrors, that were cracked by pistol bullets, and whose Flemish\r\ntapestry, which was cut to ribbons, and hanging in rags in places from\r\nsword-cuts, told too well what Mademoiselle Fifi's occupation was during\r\nhis spare time.\r\n\r\nThere were three family portraits on the walls a steel-clad knight, a\r\ncardinal and a judge, who were all smoking long porcelain pipes, which\r\nhad been inserted into holes in the canvas, while a lady in a long,\r\npointed waist proudly exhibited a pair of enormous mustaches, drawn with\r\ncharcoal. The officers ate their breakfast almost in silence in that\r\nmutilated room, which looked dull in the rain and melancholy in its\r\ndilapidated condition, although its old oak floor had become as solid as\r\nthe stone floor of an inn.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished eating and were smoking and drinking, they began,\r\nas usual, to berate the dull life they were leading. The bottles of\r\nbrandy and of liqueur passed from hand to hand, and all sat back in\r\ntheir chairs and took repeated sips from their glasses, scarcely\r\nremoving from their mouths the long, curved stems, which terminated in\r\nchina bowls, painted in a manner to delight a Hottentot.\r\n\r\nAs soon as their glasses were empty they filled them again, with a\r\ngesture of resigned weariness, but Mademoiselle Fifi emptied his every\r\nminute, and a soldier immediately gave him another. They were enveloped\r\nin a cloud of strong tobacco smoke, and seemed to be sunk in a state of\r\ndrowsy, stupid intoxication, that condition of stupid intoxication of\r\nmen who have nothing to do, when suddenly the baron sat up and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens! This cannot go on; we must think of something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d And on\r\nhearing this, Lieutenant Otto and Sub-lieutenant Fritz, who preeminently\r\npossessed the serious, heavy German countenance, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought for a few moments and then replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Why, we must get\r\nup some entertainment, if the commandant will allow us.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of\r\nan entertainment, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d the major asked, taking his pipe out of his\r\nmouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI will arrange all that, commandant,\xe2\x80\x9d the baron said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nsend Le Devoir to Rouen, and he will bring back some ladies. I know\r\nwhere they can be found, We will have supper here, as all the materials\r\nare at hand and; at least, we shall have a jolly evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGraf von Farlsberg shrugged his shoulders with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must surely\r\nbe mad, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut all the other officers had risen and surrounded their chief, saying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the captain have his way, commandant; it is terribly dull here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd the major ended by yielding. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and the baron\r\nimmediately sent for Le Devoir. He was an old non-commissioned officer,\r\nwho had never been seen to smile, but who carried out all the orders of\r\nhis superiors to the letter, no matter what they might be. He stood\r\nthere, with an impassive face, while he received the baron's\r\ninstructions, and then went out, and five minutes later a large military\r\nwagon, covered with tarpaulin, galloped off as fast as four horses could\r\ndraw it in the pouring rain. The officers all seemed to awaken from\r\ntheir lethargy, their looks brightened, and they began to talk.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was raining as hard as ever, the major declared that it was\r\nnot so dark, and Lieutenant von Grossling said with conviction that the\r\nsky was clearing up, while Mademoiselle Fifi did not seem to be able to\r\nkeep still. He got up and sat down again, and his bright eyes seemed to\r\nbe looking for something to destroy. Suddenly, looking at the lady with\r\nthe mustaches, the young fellow pulled out his revolver and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshall not see it.\xe2\x80\x9d And without leaving his seat he aimed, and with two\r\nsuccessive bullets cut out both the eyes of the portrait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us make a mine!\xe2\x80\x9d he then exclaimed, and the conversation was\r\nsuddenly interrupted, as if they had found some fresh and powerful\r\nsubject of interest. The mine was his invention, his method of\r\ndestruction, and his favorite amusement.\r\n\r\nWhen he left the chateau, the lawful owner, Comte Fernand d'Amoys\r\nd'Uville, had not had time to carry away or to hide anything except the\r\nplate, which had been stowed away in a hole made in one of the walls. As\r\nhe was very rich and had good taste, the large drawing-room, which\r\nopened into the dining-room, looked like a gallery in a museum, before\r\nhis precipitate flight.\r\n\r\nExpensive oil paintings, water colors and drawings hung against the\r\nwalls, while on the tables, on the hanging shelves and in elegant glass\r\ncupboards there were a thousand ornaments: small vases, statuettes,\r\ngroups of Dresden china and grotesque Chinese figures, old ivory and\r\nVenetian glass, which filled the large room with their costly and\r\nfantastic array.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything was left now; not that the things had been stolen, for\r\nthe major would not have allowed that, but Mademoiselle Fifi would every\r\nnow and then have a mine, and on those occasions all the officers\r\nthoroughly enjoyed themselves for five minutes. The little marquis went\r\ninto the drawing-room to get what he wanted, and he brought back a\r\nsmall, delicate china teapot, which he filled with gunpowder, and\r\ncarefully introduced a piece of punk through the spout. This he lighted\r\nand took his infernal machine into the next room, but he came back\r\nimmediately and shut the door. The Germans all stood expectant, their\r\nfaces full of childish, smiling curiosity, and as soon as the explosion\r\nhad shaken the chateau, they all rushed in at once.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Fifi, who got in first, clapped his hands in delight at the\r\nsight of a terra-cotta Venus, whose head had been blown off, and each\r\npicked up pieces of porcelain and wondered at the strange shape of the\r\nfragments, while the major was looking with a paternal eye at the large\r\ndrawing-room, which had been wrecked after the fashion of a Nero, and\r\nwas strewn with the fragments of works of art. He went out first and\r\nsaid with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a great success this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut there was such a cloud of smoke in the dining-room, mingled with the\r\ntobacco smoke, that they could not breathe, so the commandant opened the\r\nwindow, and all the officers, who had returned for a last glass of\r\ncognac, went up to it.\r\n\r\nThe moist air blew into the room, bringing with it a sort of powdery\r\nspray, which sprinkled their beards. They looked at the tall trees which\r\nwere dripping with rain, at the broad valley which was covered with\r\nmist, and at the church spire in the distance, which rose up like a gray\r\npoint in the beating rain.\r\n\r\nThe bells had not rung since their arrival. That was the only resistance\r\nwhich the invaders had met with in the neighborhood. The parish priest\r\nhad not refused to take in and to feed the Prussian soldiers; he had\r\nseveral times even drunk a bottle of beer or claret with the hostile\r\ncommandant, who often employed him as a benevolent intermediary; but it\r\nwas no use to ask him for a single stroke of the bells; he would sooner\r\nhave allowed himself to be shot. That was his way of protesting against\r\nthe invasion, a peaceful and silent protest, the only one, he said,\r\nwhich was suitable to a priest, who was a man of mildness, and not of\r\nblood; and every one, for twenty-five miles round, praised Abbe\r\nChantavoine's firmness and heroism in venturing to proclaim the public\r\nmourning by the obstinate silence of his church bells.\r\n\r\nThe whole village, enthusiastic at his resistance, was ready to back up\r\ntheir pastor and to risk anything, for they looked upon that silent\r\nprotest as the safeguard of the national honor. It seemed to the\r\npeasants that thus they deserved better of their country than Belfort\r\nand Strassburg, that they had set an equally valuable example, and that\r\nthe name of their little village would become immortalized by that; but,\r\nwith that exception, they refused their Prussian conquerors nothing.\r\n\r\nThe commandant and his officers laughed among themselves at this\r\ninoffensive courage, and as the people in the whole country round showed\r\nthemselves obliging and compliant toward them, they willingly tolerated\r\ntheir silent patriotism. Little Baron Wilhelm alone would have liked to\r\nhave forced them to ring the bells. He was very angry at his superior's\r\npolitic compliance with the priest's scruples, and every day begged the\r\ncommandant to allow him to sound \xe2\x80\x9cding-dong, ding-dong,\xe2\x80\x9d just once, only\r\njust once, just by way of a joke. And he asked it in the coaxing, tender\r\nvoice of some loved woman who is bent on obtaining her wish, but the\r\ncommandant would not yield, and to console himself, Mademoiselle Fifi\r\nmade a mine in the Chateau d'Uville.\r\n\r\nThe five men stood there together for five minutes, breathing in the\r\nmoist air, and at last Lieutenant Fritz said with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cThe ladies\r\nwill certainly not have fine weather for their drive.\xe2\x80\x9d Then they\r\nseparated, each to his duty, while the captain had plenty to do in\r\narranging for the dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen they met again toward evening they began to laugh at seeing each\r\nother as spick and span and smart as on the day of a grand review. The\r\ncommandant's hair did not look so gray as it was in the morning, and the\r\ncaptain had shaved, leaving only his mustache, which made him look as if\r\nhe had a streak of fire under his nose.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the rain, they left the window open, and one of them went to\r\nlisten from time to time; and at a quarter past six the baron said he\r\nheard a rumbling in the distance. They all rushed down, and presently\r\nthe wagon drove up at a gallop with its four horses steaming and\r\nblowing, and splashed with mud to their girths. Five women dismounted,\r\nfive handsome girls whom a comrade of the captain, to whom Le Devoir had\r\npresented his card, had selected with care.\r\n\r\nThey had not required much pressing, as they had got to know the\r\nPrussians in the three months during which they had had to do with them,\r\nand so they resigned themselves to the men as they did to the state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThey went at once into the dining-room, which looked still more dismal\r\nin its dilapidated condition when it was lighted up; while the table\r\ncovered with choice dishes, the beautiful china and glass, and the\r\nplate, which had been found in the hole in the wall where its owner had\r\nhidden it, gave it the appearance of a bandits' inn, where they were\r\nsupping after committing a robbery in the place. The captain was\r\nradiant, and put his arm round the women as if he were familiar with\r\nthem; and when the three young men wanted to appropriate one each, he\r\nopposed them authoritatively, reserving to himself the right to\r\napportion them justly, according to their several ranks, so as not to\r\noffend the higher powers. Therefore, to avoid all discussion, jarring,\r\nand suspicion of partiality, he placed them all in a row according to\r\nheight, and addressing the tallest, he said in a voice of command:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPamela,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, raising her voice. And then\r\nhe said: \xe2\x80\x9cNumber One, called Pamela, is adjudged to the commandant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen, having kissed Blondina, the second, as a sign of proprietorship,\r\nhe proffered stout Amanda to Lieutenant Otto; Eva, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Tomato,\xe2\x80\x9d to Sub-\r\nlieutenant Fritz, and Rachel, the shortest of them all, a very young,\r\ndark girl, with eyes as black as ink, a Jewess, whose snub nose proved\r\nthe rule which allots hooked noses to all her race, to the youngest\r\nofficer, frail Count Wilhelm d'Eyrick.\r\n\r\nThey were all pretty and plump, without any distinctive features, and\r\nall had a similarity of complexion and figure.\r\n\r\nThe three young men wished to carry off their prizes immediately, under\r\nthe pretext that they might wish to freshen their toilets; but the\r\ncaptain wisely opposed this, for he said they were quite fit to sit down\r\nto dinner, and his experience in such matters carried the day. There\r\nwere only many kisses, expectant kisses.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Rachel choked, and began to cough until the tears came into her\r\neyes, while smoke came through her nostrils. Under pretence of kissing\r\nher, the count had blown a whiff of tobacco into her mouth. She did not\r\nfly into a rage and did not say a word, but she looked at her tormentor\r\nwith latent hatred in her dark eyes.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to dinner. The commandant seemed delighted; he made Pamela\r\nsit on his right, and Blondina on his left, and said, as he unfolded his\r\ntable napkin: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a delightful idea of yours, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLieutenants Otto and Fritz, who were as polite as if they had been with\r\nfashionable ladies, rather intimidated their guests, but Baron von\r\nKelweinstein beamed, made obscene remarks and seemed on fire with his\r\ncrown of red hair. He paid the women compliments in French of the Rhine,\r\nand sputtered out gallant remarks, only fit for a low pothouse, from\r\nbetween his two broken teeth.\r\n\r\nThey did not understand him, however, and their intelligence did not\r\nseem to be awakened until he uttered foul words and broad expressions,\r\nwhich were mangled by his accent. Then they all began to laugh at once\r\nlike crazy women and fell against each other, repeating the words, which\r\nthe baron then began to say all wrong, in order that he might have the\r\npleasure of hearing them say dirty things. They gave him as much of that\r\nstuff as he wanted, for they were drunk after the first bottle of wine,\r\nand resuming their usual habits and manners, they kissed the officers to\r\nright and left of them, pinched their arms, uttered wild cries, drank\r\nout of every glass and sang French couplets and bits of German songs\r\nwhich they had picked up in their daily intercourse with the enemy.\r\n\r\nSoon the men themselves became very unrestrained, shouted and broke the\r\nplates and dishes, while the soldiers behind them waited on them\r\nstolidly. The commandant was the only one who kept any restraint upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Fifi had taken Rachel on his knee, and, getting excited, at\r\none moment he kissed the little black curls on her neck and at another\r\nhe pinched her furiously and made her scream, for he was seized by a\r\nspecies of ferocity, and tormented by his desire to hurt her. He often\r\nheld her close to him and pressed a long kiss on the Jewess' rosy mouth\r\nuntil she lost her breath, and at last he bit her until a stream of\r\nblood ran down her chin and on to her bodice.\r\n\r\nFor the second time she looked him full in the face, and as she bathed\r\nthe wound, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to pay for, that!\xe2\x80\x9d But he merely\r\nlaughed a hard laugh and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt dessert champagne was served, and the commandant rose, and in the\r\nsame voice in which he would have drunk to the health of the Empress\r\nAugusta, he drank: \xe2\x80\x9cTo our ladies!\xe2\x80\x9d And a series of toasts began, toasts\r\nworthy of the lowest soldiers and of drunkards, mingled with obscene\r\njokes, which were made still more brutal by their ignorance of the\r\nlanguage. They got up, one after the other, trying to say something\r\nwitty, forcing themselves to be funny, and the women, who were so drunk\r\nthat they almost fell off their chairs, with vacant looks and clammy\r\ntongues applauded madly each time.\r\n\r\nThe captain, who no doubt wished to impart an appearance of gallantry to\r\nthe orgy, raised his glass again and said: \xe2\x80\x9cTo our victories over\r\nhearts.\xe2\x80\x9d and, thereupon Lieutenant Otto, who was a species of bear from\r\nthe Black Forest, jumped up, inflamed and saturated with drink, and\r\nsuddenly seized by an access of alcoholic patriotism, he cried: \xe2\x80\x9cTo our\r\nvictories over France!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrunk as they were, the women were silent, but Rachel turned round,\r\ntrembling, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, I know some Frenchmen in whose presence\r\nyou would not dare say that.\xe2\x80\x9d But the little count, still holding her on\r\nhis knee, began to laugh, for the wine had made him very merry, and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha! I have never met any of them myself. As soon as we\r\nshow ourselves, they run away!\xe2\x80\x9d The girl, who was in a terrible rage,\r\nshouted into his face: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are lying, you dirty scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he looked at her steadily with his bright eyes upon her, as\r\nhe had looked at the portrait before he destroyed it with bullets from\r\nhis revolver, and then he began to laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, talk about them, my\r\ndear! Should we be here now if they were brave?\xe2\x80\x9d And, getting excited,\r\nhe exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the masters! France belongs to us!\xe2\x80\x9d She made one\r\nspring from his knee and threw herself into her chair, while he arose,\r\nheld out his glass over the table and repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cFrance and the French,\r\nthe woods, the fields and the houses of France belong to us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others, who were quite drunk, and who were suddenly seized by\r\nmilitary enthusiasm, the enthusiasm of brutes, seized their glasses, and\r\nshouting, \xe2\x80\x9cLong live Prussia!\xe2\x80\x9d they emptied them at a draught.\r\n\r\nThe girls did not protest, for they were reduced to silence and were\r\nafraid. Even Rachel did not say a word, as she had no reply to make.\r\nThen the little marquis put his champagne glass, which had just been\r\nrefilled, on the head of the Jewess and exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the women in\r\nFrance belong to us also!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that she got up so quickly that the glass upset, spilling the amber-\r\ncolored wine on her black hair as if to baptize her, and broke into a\r\nhundred fragments, as it fell to the floor. Her lips trembling, she\r\ndefied the looks of the officer, who was still laughing, and stammered\r\nout in a voice choked with rage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94is not true\xe2\x80\x94for you shall not have the women of France!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down again so as to laugh at his ease; and, trying to speak with\r\nthe Parisian accent, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is good, very good! Then why did you\r\ncome here, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d She was thunderstruck and made no reply for a\r\nmoment, for in her agitation she did not understand him at first, but as\r\nsoon as she grasped his meaning she said to him indignantly and\r\nvehemently: \xe2\x80\x9cI! I! I am not a woman, I am only a strumpet, and that is\r\nall that Prussians want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost before she had finished he slapped her full in the face; but as\r\nhe was raising his hand again, as if to strike her, she seized a small\r\ndessert knife with a silver blade from the table and, almost mad with\r\nrage, stabbed him right in the hollow of his neck. Something that he was\r\ngoing to say was cut short in his throat, and he sat there with his\r\nmouth half open and a terrible look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAll the officers shouted in horror and leaped up tumultuously; but,\r\nthrowing her chair between the legs of Lieutenant Otto, who fell down at\r\nfull length, she ran to the window, opened it before they could seize\r\nher and jumped out into the night and the pouring rain.\r\n\r\nIn two minutes Mademoiselle Fifi was dead, and Fritz and Otto drew their\r\nswords and wanted to kill the women, who threw themselves at their feet\r\nand clung to their knees. With some difficulty the major stopped the\r\nslaughter and had the four terrified girls locked up in a room under the\r\ncare of two soldiers, and then he organized the pursuit of the fugitive\r\nas carefully as if he were about to engage in a skirmish, feeling quite\r\nsure that she would be caught.\r\n\r\nThe table, which had been cleared immediately, now served as a bed on\r\nwhich to lay out the lieutenant, and the four officers stood at the\r\nwindows, rigid and sobered with the stern faces of soldiers on duty, and\r\ntried to pierce through the darkness of the night amid the steady\r\ntorrent of rain. Suddenly a shot was heard and then another, a long way\r\noff; and for four hours they heard from time to time near or distant\r\nreports and rallying cries, strange words of challenge, uttered in\r\nguttural voices.\r\n\r\nIn the morning they all returned. Two soldiers had been killed and three\r\nothers wounded by their comrades in the ardor of that chase and in the\r\nconfusion of that nocturnal pursuit, but they had not caught Rachel.\r\n\r\nThen the inhabitants of the district were terrorized, the houses were\r\nturned topsy-turvy, the country was scoured and beaten up, over and over\r\nagain, but the Jewess did not seem to have left a single trace of her\r\npassage behind her.\r\n\r\nWhen the general was told of it he gave orders to hush up the affair, so\r\nas not to set a bad example to the army, but he severely censured the\r\ncommandant, who in turn punished his inferiors. The general had said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne does not go to war in order to amuse one's self and to caress\r\nprostitutes.\xe2\x80\x9d Graf von Farlsberg, in his exasperation, made up his mind\r\nto have his revenge on the district, but as he required a pretext for\r\nshowing severity, he sent for the priest and ordered him to have the\r\nbell tolled at the funeral of Baron von Eyrick.\r\n\r\nContrary to all expectation, the priest showed himself humble and most\r\nrespectful, and when Mademoiselle Fifi's body left the Chateau d'Uville\r\non its way to the cemetery, carried by soldiers, preceded, surrounded\r\nand followed by soldiers who marched with loaded rifles, for the first\r\ntime the bell sounded its funeral knell in a lively manner, as if a\r\nfriendly hand were caressing it. At night it rang again, and the next\r\nday, and every day; it rang as much as any one could desire. Sometimes\r\neven it would start at night and sound gently through the darkness,\r\nseized with a strange joy, awakened one could not tell why. All the\r\npeasants in the neighborhood declared that it was bewitched, and nobody\r\nexcept the priest and the sacristan would now go near the church tower.\r\nAnd they went because a poor girl was living there in grief and solitude\r\nand provided for secretly by those two men.\r\n\r\nShe remained there until the German troops departed, and then one\r\nevening the priest borrowed the baker's cart and himself drove his\r\nprisoner to Rouen. When they got there he embraced her, and she quickly\r\nwent back on foot to the establishment from which she had come, where\r\nthe proprietress, who thought that she was dead, was very glad to see\r\nher.\r\n\r\nA short time afterward a patriot who had no prejudices, and who liked\r\nher because of her bold deed, and who afterward loved her for herself,\r\nmarried her and made her a lady quite as good as many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DUEL\r\n\r\nThe war was over. The Germans occupied France. The whole country was\r\npulsating like a conquered wrestler beneath the knee of his victorious\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nThe first trains from Paris, distracted, starving, despairing Paris,\r\nwere making their way to the new frontiers, slowly passing through the\r\ncountry districts and the villages. The passengers gazed through the\r\nwindows at the ravaged fields and burned hamlets. Prussian soldiers, in\r\ntheir black helmets with brass spikes, were smoking their pipes astride\r\ntheir chairs in front of the houses which were still left standing.\r\nOthers were working or talking just as if they were members of the\r\nfamilies. As you passed through the different towns you saw entire\r\nregiments drilling in the squares, and, in spite of the rumble of the\r\ncarriage-wheels, you could every moment hear the hoarse words of\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nM. Dubuis, who during the entire siege had served as one of the National\r\nGuard in Paris, was going to join his wife and daughter, whom he had\r\nprudently sent away to Switzerland before the invasion.\r\n\r\nFamine and hardship had not diminished his big paunch so characteristic\r\nof the rich, peace-loving merchant. He had gone through the terrible\r\nevents of the past year with sorrowful resignation and bitter complaints\r\nat the savagery of men. Now that he was journeying to the frontier at\r\nthe close of the war, he saw the Prussians for the first time, although\r\nhe had done his duty on the ramparts and mounted guard on many a cold\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHe stared with mingled fear and anger at those bearded armed men,\r\ninstalled all over French soil as if they were at home, and he felt in\r\nhis soul a kind of fever of impotent patriotism, at the same time also\r\nthe great need of that new instinct of prudence which since then has,\r\nnever left us. In the same railway carriage were two Englishmen, who had\r\ncome to the country as sightseers and were gazing about them with looks\r\nof quiet curiosity. They were both also stout, and kept chatting in\r\ntheir own language, sometimes referring to their guidebook, and reading\r\naloud the names of the places indicated.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the train stopped at a little village station, and a Prussian\r\nofficer jumped up with a great clatter of his sabre on the double\r\nfootboard of the railway carriage. He was tall, wore a tight-fitting\r\nuniform, and had whiskers up to his eyes. His red hair seemed to be on\r\nfire, and his long mustache, of a paler hue, stuck out on both sides of\r\nhis face, which it seemed to cut in two.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen at once began staring at him, with smiles of newly\r\nawakened interest, while M. Dubuis made a show of reading a newspaper.\r\nHe sat concealed in his corner like a thief in presence of a gendarme.\r\n\r\nThe train started again. The Englishmen went on chatting and looking out\r\nfor the exact scene of different battles; and all of a sudden, as one of\r\nthem stretched out his arm toward the horizon as he pointed out a\r\nvillage, the Prussian officer remarked in French, extending his long\r\nlegs and lolling backward:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI killed a dozen Frenchmen in that village and took more than a hundred\r\nprisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen, quite interested, immediately asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! and what is the name of this village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prussian replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPharsbourg.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe caught those French scoundrels by the ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he glanced toward M. Dubuis, laughing conceitedly into his mustache.\r\n\r\nThe train rolled on, still passing through hamlets occupied by the\r\nvictorious army. German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the\r\nedges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes.\r\nThey covered the soil like African locusts.\r\n\r\nThe officer said, with a wave of his hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been in command, I'd have taken Paris, burned everything,\r\nkilled everybody. No more France!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, through politeness, replied simply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia is\r\nmore than a match for all of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen, getting uneasy, no longer replied. Their faces, which\r\nhad become impassive, seemed made of wax behind their long whiskers.\r\nThen the Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he\r\nbegan to sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the\r\nprostrate enemy; he sneered at Austria, which had been recently\r\nconquered; he sneered at the valiant but fruitless defence of the\r\ndepartments; he sneered at the Garde Mobile and at the useless\r\nartillery. He announced that Bismarck was going to build a city of iron\r\nwith the captured cannon. And suddenly he placed his boots against the\r\nthigh of M. Dubuis, who turned away his eyes, reddening to the roots of\r\nhis hair.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen seemed to have become indifferent to all that was going\r\non, as if they were suddenly shut up in their own island, far from the\r\ndin of the world.\r\n\r\nThe officer took out his pipe, and looking fixedly at the Frenchman,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven't any tobacco\xe2\x80\x94have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Dubuis replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe German resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might go and buy some for me when the train stops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he began laughing afresh as he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll give you the price of a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train whistled, and slackened its pace. They passed a station that\r\nhad been burned down; and then they stopped altogether.\r\n\r\nThe German opened the carriage door, and, catching M. Dubuis by the arm,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and do what I told you\xe2\x80\x94quick, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA Prussian detachment occupied the station. Other soldiers were standing\r\nbehind wooden gratings, looking on. The engine was getting up steam\r\nbefore starting off again. Then M. Dubuis hurriedly jumped on the\r\nplatform, and, in spite of the warnings of the station master, dashed\r\ninto the adjoining compartment.\r\n\r\nHe was alone! He tore open his waistcoat, his heart was beating so\r\nrapidly, and, gasping for breath, he wiped the perspiration from his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nThe train drew up at another station. And suddenly the officer appeared\r\nat the carriage door and jumped in, followed close behind by the two\r\nEnglishmen, who were impelled by curiosity. The German sat facing the\r\nFrenchman, and, laughing still, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not want to do what I asked you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Dubuis replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train had just left the station.\r\n\r\nThe officer said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll cut off your mustache to fill my pipe with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he put out his hand toward the Frenchman's face.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen stared at them, retaining their previous impassive\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe German had already pulled out a few hairs, and was still tugging at\r\nthe mustache, when M. Dubuis, with a back stroke of his hand, flung\r\naside the officer's arm, and, seizing him by the collar, threw him down\r\non the seat. Then, excited to a pitch of fury, his temples swollen and\r\nhis eyes glaring, he kept throttling the officer with one hand, while\r\nwith the other clenched he began to strike him violent blows in the\r\nface. The Prussian struggled, tried to draw his sword, to clinch with\r\nhis adversary, who was on top of him. But M. Dubuis crushed him with his\r\nenormous weight and kept punching him without taking breath or knowing\r\nwhere his blows fell. Blood flowed down the face of the German, who,\r\nchoking and with a rattling in his throat, spat out his broken teeth and\r\nvainly strove to shake off this infuriated man who was killing him.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen had got on their feet and came closer in order to see\r\nbetter. They remained standing, full of mirth and curiosity, ready to\r\nbet for, or against, either combatant.\r\n\r\nSuddenly M. Dubuis, exhausted by his violent efforts, rose and resumed\r\nhis seat without uttering a word.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian did not attack him, for the savage assault had terrified\r\nand astonished the officer as well as causing him suffering. When he was\r\nable to breathe freely, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless you give me satisfaction with pistols I will kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Dubuis replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you like. I'm quite ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe German said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the town of Strasbourg. I'll get two officers to be my seconds,\r\nand there will be time before the train leaves the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Dubuis, who was puffing as hard as the engine, said to the\r\nEnglishmen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be my seconds?\xe2\x80\x9d They both answered together:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the train stopped.\r\n\r\nIn a minute the Prussian had found two comrades, who brought pistols,\r\nand they made their way toward the ramparts.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen were continually looking at their watches, shuffling\r\ntheir feet and hurrying on with the preparations, uneasy lest they\r\nshould be too late for the train.\r\n\r\nM. Dubuis had never fired a pistol in his life.\r\n\r\nThey made him stand twenty paces away from his enemy. He was asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was answering, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he noticed that one of the\r\nEnglishmen had opened his umbrella in order to keep off the rays of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nA voice gave the signal:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Dubuis fired at random without delay, and he was amazed to see the\r\nPrussian opposite him stagger, lift up his arms and fall forward, dead.\r\nHe had killed the officer.\r\n\r\nOne of the Englishmen exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d He was quivering with delight,\r\nwith satisfied curiosity and joyous impatience. The other, who still\r\nkept his watch in his hand, seized M. Dubuis' arm and hurried him in\r\ndouble-quick time toward the station, his fellow-countryman marking time\r\nas he ran beside them, with closed fists, his elbows at his sides, \xe2\x80\x9cOne,\r\ntwo; one, two!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd all three, running abreast rapidly, made their way to the station\r\nlike three grotesque figures in a comic newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe train was on the point of starting. They sprang into their carriage.\r\nThen the Englishmen, taking off their travelling caps, waved them three\r\ntimes over their heads, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHip! hip! hip! hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd gravely, one after the other, they extended their right hands to M.\r\nDubuis and then went back and sat down in their own corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 2.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M.

QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONEL'S IDEAS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colonel Laporte, \xe2\x80\x9calthough I am old and gouty, my\r\nlegs as stiff as two pieces of wood, yet if a pretty woman were to tell\r\nme to go through the eye of a needle, I believe I should take a jump at\r\nit, like a clown through a hoop. I shall die like that; it is in the\r\nblood. I am an old beau, one of the old school, and the sight of a\r\nwoman, a pretty woman, stirs me to the tips of my toes. There!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all very much alike in France in this respect; we still remain\r\nknights, knights of love and fortune, since God has been abolished whose\r\nbodyguard we really were. But nobody can ever get woman out of our\r\nhearts; there she is, and there she will remain, and we love her, and\r\nshall continue to love her, and go on committing all kinds of follies on\r\nher account as long as there is a France on the map of Europe; and even\r\nif France were to be wiped off the map, there would always be Frenchmen\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am in the presence of a woman, of a pretty woman, I feel capable\r\nof anything. By Jove! when I feel her looks penetrating me, her\r\nconfounded looks which set your blood on fire, I should like to do I\r\ndon't know what; to fight a duel, to have a row, to smash the furniture,\r\nin order to show that I am the strongest, the bravest, the most daring\r\nand the most devoted of men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not the only one, certainly not; the whole French army is like\r\nme, I swear to you. From the common soldier to the general, we all start\r\nout, from the van to the rear guard, when there is a woman in the case,\r\na pretty woman. Do you remember what Joan of Arc made us do formerly?\r\nCome. I will make a bet that if a pretty woman had taken command of the\r\narmy on the eve of Sedan, when Marshal MacMahon was wounded, we should\r\nhave broken through the Prussian lines, by Jove! and had a drink out of\r\ntheir guns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a Trochu, but a Sainte-Genevieve, who was needed in Paris;\r\nand I remember a little anecdote of the war which proves that we are\r\ncapable of everything in presence of a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a captain, a simple captain, at the time, and I was in command of\r\na detachment of scouts, who were retreating through a district which\r\nswarmed with Prussians. We were surrounded, pursued, tired out and half\r\ndead with fatigue and hunger, but we were bound to reach Bar-sur-Tain\r\nbefore the morrow, otherwise we should be shot, cut down, massacred. I\r\ndo not know how we managed to escape so far. However, we had ten leagues\r\nto go during the night, ten leagues through the night, ten leagues\r\nthrough the snow, and with empty stomachs, and I thought to myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is all over; my poor devils of fellows will never be able to do\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had eaten nothing since the day before, and the whole day long we\r\nremained hidden in a barn, huddled close together, so as not to feel the\r\ncold so much, unable to speak or even move, and sleeping by fits and\r\nstarts, as one does when worn out with fatigue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was dark by five o'clock, that wan darkness of the snow, and I shook\r\nmy men. Some of them would not get up; they were almost incapable of\r\nmoving or of standing upright; their joints were stiff from cold and\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore us there was a large expanse of flat, bare country; the snow was\r\nstill falling like a curtain, in large, white flakes, which concealed\r\neverything under a thick, frozen coverlet, a coverlet of frozen wool One\r\nmight have thought that it was the end of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come, my lads, let us start.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey looked at the thick white flakes that were coming down, and they\r\nseemed to think: 'We have had enough of this; we may just as well die\r\nhere!' Then I took out my revolver and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I will shoot the first man who flinches.' And so they set off, but\r\nvery slowly, like men whose legs were of very little use to them, and I\r\nsent four of them three hundred yards ahead to scout, and the others\r\nfollowed pell-mell, walking at random and without any order. I put the\r\nstrongest in the rear, with orders to quicken the pace of the sluggards\r\nwith the points of their bayonets in the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe snow seemed as if it were going to bury us alive; it powdered our\r\nkepis and cloaks without melting, and made phantoms of us, a kind of\r\nspectres of dead, weary soldiers. I said to myself: 'We shall never get\r\nout of this except by a miracle.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes we had to stop for a few minutes, on account of those who\r\ncould not follow us, and then we heard nothing except the falling snow,\r\nthat vague, almost undiscernible sound made by the falling flakes. Some\r\nof the men shook themselves, others did not move, and so I gave the\r\norder to set off again. They shouldered their rifles, and with weary\r\nfeet we resumed our march, when suddenly the scouts fell back. Something\r\nhad alarmed them; they had heard voices in front of them. I sent forward\r\nsix men and a sergeant and waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll at once a shrill cry, a woman's cry, pierced through the heavy\r\nsilence of the snow, and in a few minutes they brought back two\r\nprisoners, an old man and a girl, whom I questioned in a low voice. They\r\nwere escaping from the Prussians, who had occupied their house during\r\nthe evening and had got drunk. The father was alarmed on his daughter's\r\naccount, and, without even telling their servants, they had made their\r\nescape in the darkness. I saw immediately that they belonged to the\r\nbetter class. I invited them to accompany us, and we started off again,\r\nthe old man who knew the road acting as our guide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had ceased snowing, the stars appeared and the cold became intense.\r\nThe girl, who was leaning on her father's arm, walked unsteadily as\r\nthough in pain, and several times she murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have no feeling at all in my feet'; and I suffered more than she did\r\nto see that poor little woman dragging herself like that through the\r\nsnow. But suddenly she stopped and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Father, I am so tired that I cannot go any further.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old man wanted to carry her, but he could not even lift her up, and\r\nshe sank to the ground with a deep sigh. We all gathered round her, and,\r\nas for me, I stamped my foot in perplexity, not knowing what to do, and\r\nbeing unwilling to abandon that man and girl like that, when suddenly\r\none of the soldiers, a Parisian whom they had nicknamed Pratique, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come, comrades, we must carry the young lady, otherwise we shall not\r\nshow ourselves Frenchmen, confound it!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really believe that I swore with pleasure. 'That is very good of you,\r\nmy children,' I said; 'and I will take my share of the burden.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could indistinctly see, through the darkness, the trees of a little\r\nwood on the left. Several of the men went into it, and soon came back\r\nwith a bundle of branches made into a litter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Who will lend his cape? It is for a pretty girl, comrades,' Pratique\r\nsaid, and ten cloaks were thrown to him. In a moment the girl was lying,\r\nwarm and comfortable, among them, and was raised upon six shoulders. I\r\nplaced myself at their head, on the right, well pleased with my\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe started off much more briskly, as if we had had a drink of wine, and\r\nI even heard some jokes. A woman is quite enough to electrify Frenchmen,\r\nyou see. The soldiers, who had become cheerful and warm, had almost\r\nreformed their ranks, and an old 'franc-tireur' who was following the\r\nlitter, waiting for his turn to replace the first of his comrades who\r\nmight give out, said to one of his neighbors, loud enough for me to\r\nhear: \xe2\x80\x9c'I am not a young man now, but by\xe2\x80\x94-, there is nothing like the\r\nwomen to put courage into you!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went on, almost without stopping, until three o'clock in the\r\nmorning, when suddenly our scouts fell back once more, and soon the\r\nwhole detachment showed nothing but a vague shadow on the ground, as the\r\nmen lay on the snow. I gave my orders in a low voice, and heard the\r\nharsh, metallic sound of the cocking, of rifles. For there, in the\r\nmiddle of the plain, some strange object was moving about. It looked\r\nlike some enormous animal running about, now stretching out like a\r\nserpent, now coiling itself into a ball, darting to the right, then to\r\nthe left, then stopping, and presently starting off again. But presently\r\nthat wandering shape came nearer, and I saw a dozen lancers at full\r\ngallop, one behind the other. They had lost their way and were trying to\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were so near by that time that I could hear the loud breathing of\r\ntheir horses, the clinking of their swords and the creaking of their\r\nsaddles, and cried: 'Fire!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty rifle shots broke the stillness of the night, then there were\r\nfour or five reports, and at last one single shot was heard, and when\r\nthe smoke had cleared away, we saw that the twelve men and nine horses\r\nhad fallen. Three of the animals were galloping away at a furious pace,\r\nand one of them was dragging the dead body of its rider, which rebounded\r\nviolently from the ground; his foot had caught in the stirrup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the soldiers behind me gave a terrible laugh and said: 'There\r\nwill be some widows there!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he was married. A third added: 'It did not take long!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA head emerged from the litter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What is the matter?' she asked; 'are you fighting?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is nothing, mademoiselle,' I replied; 'we have got rid of a dozen\r\nPrussians!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Poor fellows!' she said. But as she was cold, she quickly disappeared\r\nbeneath the cloaks again, and we started off once more. We marched on\r\nfor a long time, and at last the sky began to grow lighter. The snow\r\nbecame quite clear, luminous and glistening, and a rosy tint appeared in\r\nthe east. Suddenly a voice in the distance cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Who goes there?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole detachment halted, and I advanced to give the countersign. We\r\nhad reached the French lines, and, as my men defiled before the outpost,\r\na commandant on horseback, whom I had informed of what had taken place,\r\nasked in a sonorous voice, as he saw the litter pass him: 'What have you\r\nin there?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd immediately a small head covered with light hair appeared,\r\ndishevelled and smiling, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is I, monsieur.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this the men raised a hearty laugh, and we felt quite light-hearted,\r\nwhile Pratique, who was walking by the side of the litter, waved his\r\nkepi and shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Vive la France!' And I felt really affected. I do not know why, except\r\nthat I thought it a pretty and gallant thing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to me as if we had just saved the whole of France and had\r\ndone something that other men could not have done, something simple and\r\nreally patriotic. I shall never forget that little face, you may be\r\nsure; and if I had to give my opinion about abolishing drums, trumpets\r\nand bugles, I should propose to replace them in every regiment by a\r\npretty girl, and that would be even better than playing the\r\n'Marseillaise: By Jove! it would put some spirit into a trooper to have\r\na Madonna like that, a live Madonna, by the colonel's side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a few moments and then continued, with an air of\r\nconviction, and nodding his head:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, we are very fond of women, we Frenchmen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER SAUVAGE\r\n\r\nFifteen years had passed since I was at Virelogne. I returned there in\r\nthe autumn to shoot with my friend Serval, who had at last rebuilt his\r\nchateau, which the Prussians had destroyed.\r\n\r\nI loved that district. It is one of those delightful spots which have a\r\nsensuous charm for the eyes. You love it with a physical love. We, whom\r\nthe country enchants, keep tender memories of certain springs, certain\r\nwoods, certain pools, certain hills seen very often which have stirred\r\nus like joyful events. Sometimes our thoughts turn back to a corner in a\r\nforest, or the end of a bank, or an orchard filled with flowers, seen\r\nbut a single time on some bright day, yet remaining in our hearts like\r\nthe image of certain women met in the street on a spring morning in\r\ntheir light, gauzy dresses, leaving in soul and body an unsatisfied\r\ndesire which is not to be forgotten, a feeling that you have just passed\r\nby happiness.\r\n\r\nAt Virelogne I loved the whole countryside, dotted with little woods and\r\ncrossed by brooks which sparkled in the sun and looked like veins\r\ncarrying blood to the earth. You fished in them for crawfish, trout and\r\neels. Divine happiness! You could bathe in places and you often found\r\nsnipe among the high grass which grew along the borders of these small\r\nwater courses.\r\n\r\nI was stepping along light as a goat, watching my two dogs running ahead\r\nof me, Serval, a hundred metres to my right, was beating a field of\r\nlucerne. I turned round by the thicket which forms the boundary of the\r\nwood of Sandres and I saw a cottage in ruins.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I remembered it as I had seen it the last time, in 1869, neat,\r\ncovered with vines, with chickens before the door. What is sadder than a\r\ndead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?\r\n\r\nI also recalled that inside its doors, after a very tiring day, the good\r\nwoman had given me a glass of wine to drink and that Serval had told me\r\nthe history of its people. The father, an old poacher, had been killed\r\nby the gendarmes. The son, whom I had once seen, was a tall, dry fellow\r\nwho also passed for a fierce slayer of game. People called them \xe2\x80\x9cLes\r\nSauvage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas that a name or a nickname?\r\n\r\nI called to Serval. He came up with his long strides like a crane.\r\n\r\nI asked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's become of those people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was his story:\r\n\r\nWhen war was declared the son Sauvage, who was then thirty-three years\r\nold, enlisted, leaving his mother alone in the house. People did not\r\npity the old woman very much because she had money; they knew it.\r\n\r\nShe remained entirely alone in that isolated dwelling, so far from the\r\nvillage, on the edge of the wood. She was not afraid, however, being of\r\nthe same strain as the men folk\xe2\x80\x94a hardy old woman, tall and thin, who\r\nseldom laughed and with whom one never jested. The women of the fields\r\nlaugh but little in any case, that is men's business. But they\r\nthemselves have sad and narrowed hearts, leading a melancholy, gloomy\r\nlife. The peasants imbibe a little noisy merriment at the tavern, but\r\ntheir helpmates always have grave, stern countenances. The muscles of\r\ntheir faces have never learned the motions of laughter.\r\n\r\nMother Sauvage continued her ordinary existence in her cottage, which\r\nwas soon covered by the snows. She came to the village once a week to\r\nget bread and a little meat. Then she returned to her house. As there\r\nwas talk of wolves, she went out with a gun upon her shoulder\xe2\x80\x94her son's\r\ngun, rusty and with the butt worn by the rubbing of the hand\xe2\x80\x94and she was\r\na strange sight, the tall \xe2\x80\x9cSauvage,\xe2\x80\x9d a little bent, going with slow\r\nstrides over the snow, the muzzle of the piece extending beyond the\r\nblack headdress, which confined her head and imprisoned her white hair,\r\nwhich no one had ever seen.\r\n\r\nOne day a Prussian force arrived. It was billeted upon the inhabitants,\r\naccording to the property and resources of each. Four were allotted to\r\nthe old woman, who was known to be rich.\r\n\r\nThey were four great fellows with fair complexion, blond beards and blue\r\neyes, who had not grown thin in spite of the fatigue which they had\r\nendured already and who also, though in a conquered country, had\r\nremained kind and gentle. Alone with this aged woman, they showed\r\nthemselves full of consideration, sparing her, as much as they could,\r\nall expense and fatigue. They could be seen, all four of them, making\r\ntheir toilet at the well in their shirt-sleeves in the gray dawn,\r\nsplashing with great swishes of water their pink-white northern skin,\r\nwhile La Mere Sauvage went and came, preparing their soup. They would be\r\nseen cleaning the kitchen, rubbing the tiles, splitting wood, peeling\r\npotatoes, doing up all the housework like four good sons around their\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nBut the old woman thought always of her own son, so tall and thin, with\r\nhis hooked nose and his brown eyes and his heavy mustache which made a\r\nroll of black hair upon his lip. She asked every day of each of the\r\nsoldiers who were installed beside her hearth: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where the\r\nFrench marching regiment, No. 23, was sent? My boy is in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey invariably answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we don't know, don't know a thing at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d And, understanding her pain and her uneasiness\xe2\x80\x94they who had\r\nmothers, too, there at home\xe2\x80\x94they rendered her a thousand little\r\nservices. She loved them well, moreover, her four enemies, since the\r\npeasantry have no patriotic hatred; that belongs to the upper class\r\nalone. The humble, those who pay the most because they are poor and\r\nbecause every new burden crushes them down; those who are killed in\r\nmasses, who make the true cannon's prey because they are so many; those,\r\nin fine, who suffer most cruelly the atrocious miseries of war because\r\nthey are the feeblest and offer least resistance\xe2\x80\x94they hardly understand\r\nat all those bellicose ardors, that excitable sense of honor or those\r\npretended political combinations which in six months exhaust two\r\nnations, the conqueror with the conquered.\r\n\r\nThey said in the district, in speaking of the Germans of La Mere\r\nSauvage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are four who have found a soft place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, one morning, when the old woman was alone in the house, she\r\nobserved, far off on the plain, a man coming toward her dwelling. Soon\r\nshe recognized him; it was the postman to distribute the letters. He\r\ngave her a folded paper and she drew out of her case the spectacles\r\nwhich she used for sewing. Then she read:\r\n\r\nMADAME SAUVAGE: This letter is to tell you sad news. Your boy Victor was\r\nkilled yesterday by a shell which almost cut him in two. I was near by,\r\nas we stood next each other in the company, and he told me about you and\r\nasked me to let you know on the same day if anything happened to him.\r\n\r\nI took his watch, which was in his pocket, to bring it back to you when\r\nthe war is done. CESAIRE RIVOT,\r\n\r\nSoldier of the 2d class, March. Reg. No. 23.\r\n\r\nThe letter was dated three weeks back.\r\n\r\nShe did not cry at all. She remained motionless, so overcome and\r\nstupefied that she did not even suffer as yet. She thought: \xe2\x80\x9cThere's\r\nVictor killed now.\xe2\x80\x9d Then little by little the tears came to her eyes and\r\nthe sorrow filled her heart. Her thoughts came, one by one, dreadful,\r\ntorturing. She would never kiss him again, her child, her big boy, never\r\nagain! The gendarmes had killed the father, the Prussians had killed the\r\nson. He had been cut in two by a cannon-ball. She seemed to see the\r\nthing, the horrible thing: the head falling, the eyes open, while he\r\nchewed the corner of his big mustache as he always did in moments of\r\nanger.\r\n\r\nWhat had they done with his body afterward? If they had only let her\r\nhave her boy back as they had brought back her husband\xe2\x80\x94with the bullet\r\nin the middle of the forehead!\r\n\r\nBut she heard a noise of voices. It was the Prussians returning from the\r\nvillage. She hid her letter very quickly in her pocket, and she received\r\nthem quietly, with her ordinary face, having had time to wipe her eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were laughing, all four, delighted, for they brought with them a\r\nfine rabbit\xe2\x80\x94stolen, doubtless\xe2\x80\x94and they made signs to the old woman that\r\nthere was to be something good to east.\r\n\r\nShe set herself to work at once to prepare breakfast, but when it came\r\nto killing the rabbit, her heart failed her. And yet it was not the\r\nfirst. One of the soldiers struck it down with a blow of his fist behind\r\nthe ears.\r\n\r\nThe beast once dead, she skinned the red body, but the sight of the\r\nblood which she was touching, and which covered her hands, and which she\r\nfelt cooling and coagulating, made her tremble from head to foot, and\r\nshe kept seeing her big boy cut in two, bloody, like this still\r\npalpitating animal.\r\n\r\nShe sat down at table with the Prussians, but she could not eat, not\r\neven a mouthful. They devoured the rabbit without bothering themselves\r\nabout her. She looked at them sideways, without speaking, her face so\r\nimpassive that they perceived nothing.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don't even know your names, and here's a\r\nwhole month that we've been together.\xe2\x80\x9d They understood, not without\r\ndifficulty, what she wanted, and told their names.\r\n\r\nThat was not sufficient; she had them written for her on a paper, with\r\nthe addresses of their families, and, resting her spectacles on her\r\ngreat nose, she contemplated that strange handwriting, then folded the\r\nsheet and put it in her pocket, on top of the letter which told her of\r\nthe death of her son.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was ended she said to the men:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to work for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she began to carry up hay into the loft where they slept.\r\n\r\nThey were astonished at her taking all this trouble; she explained to\r\nthem that thus they would not be so cold; and they helped her. They\r\nheaped the stacks of hay as high as the straw roof, and in that manner\r\nthey made a sort of great chamber with four walls of fodder, warm and\r\nperfumed, where they should sleep splendidly.\r\n\r\nAt dinner one of them was worried to see that La Mere Sauvage still ate\r\nnothing. She told him that she had pains in her stomach. Then she\r\nkindled a good fire to warm herself, and the four Germans ascended to\r\ntheir lodging-place by the ladder which served them every night for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they closed the trapdoor the old woman removed the ladder,\r\nthen opened the outside door noiselessly and went back to look for more\r\nbundles of straw, with which she filled her kitchen. She went barefoot\r\nin the snow, so softly that no sound was heard. From time to time she\r\nlistened to the sonorous and unequal snoring of the four soldiers who\r\nwere fast asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she judged her preparations to be sufficient, she threw one of the\r\nbundles into the fireplace, and when it was alight she scattered it over\r\nall the others. Then she went outside again and looked.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the whole interior of the cottage was illumined with a\r\nbrilliant light and became a frightful brasier, a gigantic fiery\r\nfurnace, whose glare streamed out of the narrow window and threw a\r\nglittering beam upon the snow.\r\n\r\nThen a great cry issued from the top of the house; it was a clamor of\r\nmen shouting heartrending calls of anguish and of terror. Finally the\r\ntrapdoor having given way, a whirlwind of fire shot up into the loft,\r\npierced the straw roof, rose to the sky like the immense flame of a\r\ntorch, and all the cottage flared.\r\n\r\nNothing more was heard therein but the crackling of the fire, the\r\ncracking of the walls, the falling of the rafters. Suddenly the roof\r\nfell in and the burning carcass of the dwelling hurled a great plume of\r\nsparks into the air, amid a cloud of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe country, all white, lit up by the fire, shone like a cloth of silver\r\ntinted with red.\r\n\r\nA bell, far off, began to toll.\r\n\r\nThe old \xe2\x80\x9cSauvage\xe2\x80\x9d stood before her ruined dwelling, armed with her gun,\r\nher son's gun, for fear one of those men might escape.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw that it was ended, she threw her weapon into the brasier. A\r\nloud report followed.\r\n\r\nPeople were coming, the peasants, the Prussians.\r\n\r\nThey found the woman seated on the trunk of a tree, calm and satisfied.\r\n\r\nA German officer, but speaking French like a son of France, demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are your soldiers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reached her bony arm toward the red heap of fire which was almost\r\nout and answered with a strong voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey crowded round her. The Prussian asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did it take fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was I who set it on fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not believe her, they thought that the sudden disaster had made\r\nher crazy. While all pressed round and listened, she told the story from\r\nbeginning to end, from the arrival of the letter to the last shriek of\r\nthe men who were burned with her house, and never omitted a detail.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished, she drew two pieces of paper from her pocket,\r\nand, in order to distinguish them by the last gleams of the fire, she\r\nagain adjusted her spectacles. Then she said, showing one:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, that is the death of Victor.\xe2\x80\x9d Showing the other, she added,\r\nindicating the red ruins with a bend of the head: \xe2\x80\x9cHere are their names,\r\nso that you can write home.\xe2\x80\x9d She quietly held a sheet of paper out to\r\nthe officer, who held her by the shoulders, and she continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must write how it happened, and you must say to their mothers that\r\nit was I who did that, Victoire Simon, la Sauvage! Do not forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer shouted some orders in German. They seized her, they threw\r\nher against the walls of her house, still hot. Then twelve men drew\r\nquickly up before her, at twenty paces. She did not move. She had\r\nunderstood; she waited.\r\n\r\nAn order rang out, followed instantly by a long report. A belated shot\r\nwent off by itself, after the others.\r\n\r\nThe old woman did not fall. She sank as though they had cut off her\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian officer approached. She was almost cut in two, and in her\r\nwithered hand she held her letter bathed with blood.\r\n\r\nMy friend Serval added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was by way of reprisal that the Germans destroyed the chateau of the\r\ndistrict, which belonged to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought of the mothers of those four fine fellows burned in that house\r\nand of the horrible heroism of that other mother shot against the wall.\r\n\r\nAnd I picked up a little stone, still blackened by the flames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIPHANY\r\n\r\nI should say I did remember that Epiphany supper during the war!\r\nexclaimed Count de Garens, an army captain.\r\n\r\nI was quartermaster of cavalry at the time, and for a fortnight had been\r\nscouting in front of the German advance guard. The evening before we had\r\ncut down a few Uhlans and had lost three men, one of whom was that poor\r\nlittle Raudeville. You remember Joseph de Raudeville, of course.\r\n\r\nWell, on that day my commanding officer ordered me to take six troopers\r\nand to go and occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five\r\nskirmishes in three weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not\r\ntwenty houses left standing, not a dozen houses in that wasps' nest. So\r\nI took ten troopers and set out about four o'clock, and at five o'clock,\r\nwhile it was still pitch dark, we reached the first houses of Porterin.\r\nI halted and ordered Marchas\xe2\x80\x94you know Pierre de Marchas, who afterward\r\nmarried little Martel-Auvelin, the daughter of the Marquis de Martel-\r\nAuvelin\xe2\x80\x94to go alone into the village, and to report to me what he saw.\r\n\r\nI had selected nothing but volunteers, all men of good family. It is\r\npleasant when on duty not to be forced to be on intimate terms with\r\nunpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as smart as possible, cunning as a\r\nfox and supple as a serpent. He could scent the Prussians as a dog can\r\nscent a hare, could discover food where we should have died of hunger\r\nwithout him, and obtained information from everybody, and information\r\nwhich was always reliable, with incredible cleverness.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthere have been no\r\nPrussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is this village.\r\nI have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is caring for four or five\r\nwounded men in an abandoned convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI ordered them to ride on, and we entered the principal street. On the\r\nright and left we could vaguely see roofless walls, which were hardly\r\nvisible in the profound darkness. Here and there a light was burning in\r\na room; some family had remained to keep its house standing as well as\r\nthey were able; a family of brave or of poor people. The rain began to\r\nfall, a fine, icy cold rain, which froze as it fell on our cloaks. The\r\nhorses stumbled against stones, against beams, against furniture.\r\nMarchas guided us, going before us on foot, and leading his horse by the\r\nbridle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you taking us to?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him. And he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\nplace for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.\xe2\x80\x9d And we presently stopped\r\nbefore a small house, evidently belonging to some proprietor of the\r\nmiddle class. It stood on the street, was quite inclosed, and had a\r\ngarden in the rear.\r\n\r\nMarchas forced open the lock by means of a big stone which he picked up\r\nnear the garden gate; then he mounted the steps, smashed in the front\r\ndoor with his feet and shoulders, lit a bit of wax candle, which he was\r\nnever without, and went before us into the comfortable apartments of\r\nsome rich private individual, guiding us with admirable assurance, as if\r\nhe lived in this house which he now saw for the first time.\r\n\r\nTwo troopers remained outside to take care of our horses, and Marchas\r\nsaid to stout Ponderel, who followed him: \xe2\x80\x9cThe stables must be on the\r\nleft; I saw that as we came in; go and put the animals up there, for we\r\ndo not need them\xe2\x80\x9d; and then, turning to me, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cGive your orders,\r\nconfound it all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis fellow always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\npost my sentinels at the country approaches and will return to you\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many men are you going to take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive. The others will relieve them at five o'clock in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Leave me four to look after provisions, to do the cooking\r\nand to set the table. I will go and find out where the wine is hidden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went off, to reconnoitre the deserted streets until they ended in the\r\nopen country, so as to post my sentries there.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later I was back, and found Marchas lounging in a great\r\neasy-chair, the covering of which he had taken off, from love of luxury,\r\nas he said. He was warming his feet at the fire and smoking an excellent\r\ncigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was alone, his elbows resting\r\non the arms of the chair, his head sunk between his shoulders, his\r\ncheeks flushed, his eyes bright, and looking delighted.\r\n\r\nI heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and Marchas\r\nsaid * to me, smiling in a contented manner: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is famous; I found\r\nthe champagne under the flight of steps outside, the brandy\xe2\x80\x94fifty\r\nbottles of the very finest in the kitchen garden under a pear tree,\r\nwhich did not seem to me to be quite straight when I looked at it by the\r\nlight of my lantern. As for solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck,\r\nand three pigeons. They are being cooked at this moment. It is a\r\ndelightful district.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sat down opposite him, and the fire in the grate was burning my nose\r\nand cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you find this wood?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cSplendid wood,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cThe owner's carriage. It is the paint which is causing all\r\nthis flame, an essence of punch and varnish. A capital house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed, for I saw the creature was funny, and he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cFancy this\r\nbeing the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the goose dressing; but\r\nthere is no queen; it is really very annoying!\xe2\x80\x9d And I repeated like an\r\necho: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is annoying, but what do you want me to do in the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nfind some, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSome women. Women?\xe2\x80\x94you must be mad?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI managed\r\nto find the brandy under the pear tree, and the champagne under the\r\nsteps; and yet there was nothing to guide me, while as for you, a\r\npetticoat is a sure bait. Go and look, old fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether he was\r\njoking or not, and so I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Marchas, are you having a\r\njoke with me?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI never joke on duty.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut where the devil do you\r\nexpect me to find any women?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere you like; there must be two or\r\nthree remaining in the neighborhood, so ferret them out and bring them\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got up, for it was too hot in front of the fire, and Marchas went off:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want an idea?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGo and see the priest.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe priest? What\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAsk him to supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\npriest! A woman! Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not laughing; go\r\nand find the priest and tell him how we are situated, and, as he must be\r\nhorribly dull, he will come. But tell him that we want one woman at\r\nleast, a lady, of course, since we, are all men of the world. He is sure\r\nto know his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if there\r\nis one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will suggest her to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Garens, you\r\ncan do this quite well. It will even be very funny. We are well bred, by\r\nJove! and we will put on our most distinguished manners and our grandest\r\nstyle. Tell the abbe who we are, make him laugh, soften his heart, coax\r\nhim and persuade him!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my special weakness, the\r\nscamp continued: \xe2\x80\x9cJust think what a swaggering thing it will be to do\r\nand how amusing to tell about; the whole army will talk about it, and it\r\nwill give you a famous reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me, and he persisted:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my little Garens. You are the head of this detachment, and you\r\nalone can go and call on the head of the church in this neighborhood. I\r\nbeg of you to go, and I promise you that after the war I will relate the\r\nwhole affair in verse in the Revue de Deux Mondes. You owe this much to\r\nyour men, for you have made them march enough during the last month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got up at last and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the priest's house?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTake the\r\nsecond turning at the end of the street, you will see an avenue, and at\r\nthe end of the avenue you will find the church. The parsonage is beside\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d As I went out, he called out: \xe2\x80\x9cTell him the bill of fare, to make\r\nhim hungry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI discovered the ecclesiastic's little house without any difficulty; it\r\nwas by the side of a large, ugly brick church. I knocked at the door\r\nwith my fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker, and a loud voice\r\nfrom inside asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWho is there?\xe2\x80\x9d To which I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cA quartermaster\r\nof hussars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and found myself\r\nface to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest of a\r\nprizefighter, formidable hands projecting from turned-up sleeves, a red\r\nface, and the look of a kind man. I gave him a military salute and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, Monsieur le Cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had feared a surprise, some marauders' ambush, and he smiled as he\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, my friend; come in.\xe2\x80\x9d I followed him into a small\r\nroom with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very\r\ndifferent to Marchas' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ncan I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, allow me first of all to introduce\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x9d; and I gave him my card, which he took and read half aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cLe\r\nComte de Garens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are eleven of us here, Monsieur l'Abbe, five on\r\npicket duty, and six installed at the house of an unknown inhabitant.\r\nThe names of the six are: Garens, myself; Pierre de Marchas, Ludovic de\r\nPonderel, Baron d'Streillis, Karl Massouligny, the painter's son, and\r\nJoseph Herbon, a young musician. I have come to ask you, in their name\r\nand my own, to do us the honor of supping with us. It is an Epiphany\r\nsupper, Monsieur le Cure, and we should like to make it a little\r\ncheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest smiled and murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me to be hardly a suitable\r\noccasion for amusing one's self.\xe2\x80\x9d And I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are fighting during\r\nthe day, monsieur. Fourteen of our comrades have been killed in a month,\r\nand three fell as late as yesterday. It is war time. We stake our life\r\nat every moment; have we not, therefore, the right to amuse ourselves\r\nfreely? We are Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh everywhere.\r\nOur fathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should like to\r\ncheer ourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like soldiers; you\r\nunderstand me, I hope. Are we wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, my friend, and I accept your\r\ninvitation with great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he called out: \xe2\x80\x9cHermance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn old bent, wrinkled, horrible peasant woman appeared and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndo you want?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not dine at home, my daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you\r\ngoing to dine then?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWith some gentlemen, the hussars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt inclined to say: \xe2\x80\x9cBring your servant with you,\xe2\x80\x9d just to see\r\nMarchas' face, but I did not venture, and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know any\r\none among your parishioners, male or female, whom I could invite as\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated, reflected, and then said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not know\r\nanybody!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI persisted: \xe2\x80\x9cNobody! Come, monsieur, think; it would be very nice to\r\nhave some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I know nothing\r\nabout your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the grocer,\r\nthe\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94watchmaker\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94shoemaker\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94the druggist with Mrs.\r\nDruggist. We have a good spread and plenty of wine, and we should be\r\nenchanted to leave pleasant recollections of ourselves with the people\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest thought again for a long time, and then said resolutely: \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nthere is nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d I began to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Monsieur le Cure, it is\r\nvery annoying not to have an Epiphany queen, for we have the bean. Come,\r\nthink. Is there not a married mayor, or a married deputy mayor, or a\r\nmarried municipal councillor or a schoolmaster?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, all the ladies\r\nhave gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, is there not in the whole place some good\r\ntradesman's wife with her good tradesman, to whom we might give this\r\npleasure, for it would be a pleasure to them, a great pleasure under\r\npresent circumstances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, suddenly, the cure began to laugh, and laughed so violently that he\r\nfairly shook, and presently exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha! I have got what you\r\nwant, yes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha! ha! We will laugh and enjoy\r\nourselves, my children; we will have some fun. How pleased the ladies\r\nwill be, I say, how delighted they will be! Ha! ha! Where are you\r\nstaying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI described the house, and he understood where it was. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt belongs to Monsieur Bertin-Lavaille. I will be there in half\r\nan hour, with four ladies! Ha! ha! ha! four ladies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\r\ncapital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille's house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cCovers\r\nfor how many?\xe2\x80\x9d Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me. \xe2\x80\x9cEleven. There are\r\nsix of us hussars, besides the priest and four ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d He was\r\nthunderstruck, and I was triumphant. He repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cFour ladies! Did you\r\nsay, four ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI said four women.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cReal women?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cReal women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, accept my compliments!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI will, for I deserve them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got out of his armchair, opened the door, and I saw a beautiful white\r\ntablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue aprons\r\nwere setting out the plates and glasses. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some women coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMarchas cried. And the three men began to dance and to cheer with all\r\ntheir might.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly an hour,\r\nwhile a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the whole house. At\r\nlast, however, a knock against the shutters made us all jump up at the\r\nsame moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the door, and in less than a\r\nminute a little Sister of Mercy appeared in the doorway. She was thin,\r\nwrinkled and timid, and successively greeted the four bewildered hussars\r\nwho saw her enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled\r\nfloor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the drawing-\r\nroom, I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other one by\r\none, who came in, swaying with different movements, one inclining to the\r\nright, while the other inclined to the left. And three worthy women\r\nappeared, limping, dragging their legs behind them, crippled by illness\r\nand deformed through old age, three infirm old women, past service, the\r\nonly three pensioners who were able to walk in the home presided over by\r\nSister Saint-Benedict.\r\n\r\nShe had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them, and\r\nthen, seeing my quartermaster's stripes, she said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cI am much\r\nobliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have very little\r\npleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving them a great treat\r\nand doing them a great honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw the priest, who had remained in the dark hallway, and was laughing\r\nheartily, and I began to laugh in my turn, especially when I saw\r\nMarchas' face. Then, motioning the nun to the seats, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, sister; we are very proud and very happy that you have\r\naccepted our unpretentious invitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them before the\r\nfire, led her three old women to them, settled them on them, took their\r\nsticks and shawls, which she put into a corner, and then, pointing to\r\nthe first, a thin woman with an enormous stomach, who was evidently\r\nsuffering from the dropsy, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Mother Paumelle; whose\r\nhusband was killed by falling from a roof, and whose son died in Africa;\r\nshe is sixty years old.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she pointed to another, a tall woman,\r\nwhose head trembled unceasingly: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Mother Jean-Jean, who is\r\nsixty-seven. She is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a\r\nfire, and her right leg was half burned off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding, round,\r\nstupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all directions, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is La\r\nPutois, an idiot. She is only forty-four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed to the three women as if I were being presented to some royal\r\nhighnesses, and turning to the priest, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are an excellent\r\nman, Monsieur l'Abbe, to whom all of us here owe a debt of gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed furious, and\r\njust then Karl Massouligny cried: \xe2\x80\x9cSister Saint-Benedict, supper is on\r\nthe table!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother Paumelle,\r\nwhose arm I took and dragged her into the next room, which was no easy\r\ntask, for she seemed heavier than a lump of iron.\r\n\r\nStout Ponderel gave his arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned her\r\ncrutch, and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, La Putois, to the\r\ndining-room, which was filled with the odor of the viands.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were opposite our plates, the sister clapped her hands\r\nthree times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting arms, the\r\nwomen made a rapid sign of the cross, and then the priest slowly\r\nrepeated the Benedictus in Latin. Then we sat down, and the two fowls\r\nappeared, brought in by Marchas, who chose to wait at table, rather than\r\nto sit down as a guest to this ridiculous repast.\r\n\r\nBut I cried: \xe2\x80\x9cBring the champagne at once!\xe2\x80\x9d and a cork flew out with the\r\nnoise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the priest and of\r\nthe kind sister, the three hussars, sitting by the side of the three\r\ninvalids, emptied their three full glasses down their throats by force.\r\n\r\nMassouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at home, and of\r\nbeing on good terms with every one, wherever he was, made love to Mother\r\nPaumelle in the drollest manner. The dropsical woman, who had retained\r\nher cheerfulness in spite of her misfortunes, answered him banteringly\r\nin a high falsetto voice which appeared as if it were put on, and she\r\nlaughed so heartily at her neighbor's jokes that it was quite alarming.\r\nLittle Herbon had seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot\r\ndrunk, and Baron d'Streillis, whose wits were not always particularly\r\nsharp, was questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the\r\nrules of the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe nun said to Massouligny in consternation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! you will make her ill; pray do not make her laugh like that,\r\nmonsieur. Oh! monsieur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Then she got up and rushed at Herbon to take\r\nfrom him a full glass which he was hastily emptying down La Putois'\r\nthroat, while the priest shook with laughter, and said to the sister:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; just this once, it will not hurt them. Do leave them\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the three\r\npigeons and the blackbird, and then the goose appeared, smoking, golden-\r\nbrown, and diffusing a warm odor of hot, browned roast meat. La\r\nPaumelle, who was getting lively, clapped her hands; La Jean-Jean left\r\noff answering the baron's numerous questions, and La Putois uttered\r\ngrunts of pleasure, half cries and half sighs, as little children do\r\nwhen one shows them candy. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to take charge of this animal,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ncure said. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand these sort of operations better than most\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Monsieur l'Abbe,\xe2\x80\x9d and the sister said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow would\r\nit be to open the window a little? They are too warm, and I am afraid\r\nthey will be ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned to Marchas: \xe2\x80\x9cOpen the window for a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d He did so; the cold\r\nouter air as it came in made the candles flare, and the steam from the\r\ngoose, which the cure was scientifically carving, with a table napkin\r\nround his neck, whirl about. We watched him doing it, without speaking\r\nnow, for we were interested in his attractive handiwork, and seized with\r\nrenewed appetite at the sight of that enormous golden-brown bird, whose\r\nlimbs fell one after another into the brown gravy at the bottom of the\r\ndish. At that moment, in the midst of that greedy silence which kept us\r\nall attentive, the distant report of a shot came in at the open window.\r\n\r\nI started to my feet so quickly that my chair fell down behind me, and I\r\nshouted: \xe2\x80\x9cTo saddle, all of you! You, Marchas, take two men and go and\r\nsee what it is. I shall expect you back here in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d And while\r\nthe three riders went off at full gallop through the night, I got into\r\nthe saddle with my three remaining hussars, in front of the steps of the\r\nvilla, while the cure, the sister and the three old women showed their\r\nfrightened faces at the window.\r\n\r\nWe heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the distance. The\r\nrain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold, and soon I heard the gallop\r\nof a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It was Marchas, and I called\r\nout to him: \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing; Francois has wounded an old peasant\r\nwho refused to answer his challenge: 'Who goes there?' and who continued\r\nto advance in spite of the order to keep off; but they are bringing him\r\nhere, and we shall see what is the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave orders for the horses to be put back in the stable, and I sent my\r\ntwo soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the house. Then the\r\ncure, Marchas, and I took a mattress into the room to lay the wounded\r\nman on; the sister tore up a table napkin in order to make lint, while\r\nthe three frightened women remained huddled up in a corner.\r\n\r\nSoon I heard the rattle of sabres on the road, and I took a candle to\r\nshow a light to the men who were returning; and they soon appeared,\r\ncarrying that inert, soft, long, sinister object which a human body\r\nbecomes when life no longer sustains it.\r\n\r\nThey put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared for him,\r\nand I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had the death rattle\r\nand was spitting up blood, which ran out of the corners of his mouth at\r\nevery gasp. The man was covered with blood! His cheeks, his beard, his\r\nhair, his neck and his clothes seemed to have been soaked, to have been\r\ndipped in a red tub; and that blood stuck to him, and had become a dull\r\ncolor which was horrible to look at.\r\n\r\nThe wounded man, wrapped up in a large shepherd's cloak, occasionally\r\nopened his dull, vacant eyes, which seemed stupid with astonishment,\r\nlike those of animals wounded by a sportsman, which fall at his feet,\r\nmore than half dead already, stupefied with terror and surprise.\r\n\r\nThe cure exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, it is old Placide, the shepherd from Les\r\nMoulins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh, God! they have\r\nkilled the unhappy man!\xe2\x80\x9d The sister had opened his blouse and shirt, and\r\nwas looking at a little blue hole in his chest, which was not bleeding\r\nany more. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with every last\r\nbreath, and in his throat, to the very depth of his lungs, they could\r\nhear an ominous and continued gurgling. The cure, standing in front of\r\nhim, raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross, and in a slow\r\nand solemn voice pronounced the Latin words which purify men's souls,\r\nbut before they were finished, the old man's body trembled violently, as\r\nif something had given way inside him, and he ceased to breathe. He was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned round, I saw a sight which was even more horrible than the\r\ndeath struggle of this unfortunate man; the three old women were\r\nstanding up huddled close together, hideous, and grimacing with fear and\r\nhorror. I went up to them, and they began to utter shrill screams, while\r\nLa Jean-Jean, whose burned leg could no longer support her, fell to the\r\nground at full length.\r\n\r\nSister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm old women,\r\nand without a word or a look for me, wrapped their shawls round them,\r\ngave them their crutches, pushed them to the door, made them go out, and\r\ndisappeared with them into the dark night.\r\n\r\nI saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the mere\r\nrattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear.\r\n\r\nThe cure was still looking at the dead man; but at last he turned round\r\nto me and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! What a horrible thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSTACHE\r\n\r\nCHATEAU DE SOLLES, July 30, 1883.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Lucy:\r\n\r\nI have no news. We live in the drawing-room, looking out at the rain. We\r\ncannot go out in this frightful weather, so we have theatricals. How\r\nstupid they are, my dear, these drawing entertainments in the repertory\r\nof real life! All is forced, coarse, heavy. The jokes are like cannon\r\nballs, smashing everything in their passage. No wit, nothing natural, no\r\nsprightliness, no elegance. These literary men, in truth, know nothing\r\nof society. They are perfectly ignorant of how people think and talk in\r\nour set. I do not mind if they despise our customs, our\r\nconventionalities, but I do not forgive them for not knowing them. When\r\nthey want to be humorous they make puns that would do for a barrack;\r\nwhen they try to be jolly, they give us jokes that they must have picked\r\nup on the outer boulevard in those beer houses artists are supposed to\r\nfrequent, where one has heard the same students' jokes for fifty years.\r\n\r\nSo we have taken to Theatricals. As we are only two women, my husband\r\ntakes the part of a soubrette, and, in order to do that, he has shaved\r\noff his mustache. You cannot imagine, my dear Lucy, how it changes him!\r\nI no longer recognize him-by day or at night. If he did not let it grow\r\nagain I think I should no longer love him; he looks so horrid like this.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a man without a mustache is no longer a man. I do not care much\r\nfor a beard; it almost always makes a man look untidy. But a mustache,\r\noh, a mustache is indispensable to a manly face. No, you would never\r\nbelieve how these little hair bristles on the upper lip are a relief to\r\nthe eye and good in other ways. I have thought over the matter a great\r\ndeal but hardly dare to write my thoughts. Words look so different on\r\npaper and the subject is so difficult, so delicate, so dangerous that it\r\nrequires infinite skill to tackle it.\r\n\r\nWell, when my husband appeared, shaven, I understood at once that I\r\nnever could fall in love with a strolling actor nor a preacher, even if\r\nit were Father Didon, the most charming of all! Later when I was alone\r\nwith him (my husband) it was worse still. Oh, my dear Lucy, never let\r\nyourself be kissed by a man without a mustache; their kisses have no\r\nflavor, none whatever! They no longer have the charm, the mellowness and\r\nthe snap \xe2\x80\x94yes, the snap\xe2\x80\x94of a real kiss. The mustache is the spice.\r\n\r\nImagine placing to your lips a piece of dry\xe2\x80\x94or moist\xe2\x80\x94parchment. That is\r\nthe kiss of the man without a mustache. It is not worth while.\r\n\r\nWhence comes this charm of the mustache, will you tell me? Do I know\r\nmyself? It tickles your face, you feel it approaching your mouth and it\r\nsends a little shiver through you down to the tips of your toes.\r\n\r\nAnd on your neck! Have you ever felt a mustache on your neck? It\r\nintoxicates you, makes you feel creepy, goes to the tips of your\r\nfingers. You wriggle, shake your shoulders, toss back your head. You\r\nwish to get away and at the same time to remain there; it is delightful,\r\nbut irritating. But how good it is!\r\n\r\nA lip without a mustache is like a body without clothing; and one must\r\nwear clothes, very few, if you like, but still some clothing.\r\n\r\nI recall a sentence (uttered by a politician) which has been running in\r\nmy mind for three months. My husband, who keeps up with the newspapers,\r\nread me one evening a very singular speech by our Minister of\r\nAgriculture, who was called M. Meline. He may have been superseded by\r\nthis time. I do not know.\r\n\r\nI was paying no attention, but the name Meline struck me. It recalled, I\r\ndo not exactly know why, the 'Scenes de la vie de boheme'. I thought it\r\nwas about some grisette. That shows how scraps of the speech entered my\r\nmind. This M. Meline was making this statement to the people of Amiens,\r\nI believe, and I have ever since been trying to understand what he\r\nmeant: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no patriotism without agriculture!\xe2\x80\x9d Well, I have just\r\ndiscovered his meaning, and I affirm in my turn that there is no love\r\nwithout a mustache. When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nThere is no love without a mustache!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no patriotism without agriculture,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Meline, and he was\r\nright, that minister; I now understand why.\r\n\r\nFrom a very different point of view the mustache is essential. It gives\r\ncharacter to the face. It makes a man look gentle, tender, violent, a\r\nmonster, a rake, enterprising! The hairy man, who does not shave off his\r\nwhiskers, never has a refined look, for his features are concealed; and\r\nthe shape of the jaw and the chin betrays a great deal to those who\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe man with a mustache retains his own peculiar expression and his\r\nrefinement at the same time.\r\n\r\nAnd how many different varieties of mustaches there are! Sometimes they\r\nare twisted, curled, coquettish. Those seem to be chiefly devoted to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are pointed, sharp as needles, and threatening. That kind\r\nprefers wine, horses and war.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are enormous, overhanging, frightful. These big ones\r\ngenerally conceal a fine disposition, a kindliness that borders on\r\nweakness and a gentleness that savors of timidity.\r\n\r\nBut what I adore above all in the mustache is that it is French,\r\naltogether French. It came from our ancestors, the Gauls, and has\r\nremained the insignia of our national character.\r\n\r\nIt is boastful, gallant and brave. It sips wine gracefully and knows how\r\nto laugh with refinement, while the broad-bearded jaws are clumsy in\r\neverything they do.\r\n\r\nI recall something that made me weep all my tears and also\xe2\x80\x94I see it\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94made me love a mustache on a man's face.\r\n\r\nIt was during the war, when I was living with my father. I was a young\r\ngirl then. One day there was a skirmish near the chateau. I had heard\r\nthe firing of the cannon and of the artillery all the morning, and that\r\nevening a German colonel came and took up his abode in our house. He\r\nleft the following day.\r\n\r\nMy father was informed that there were a number of dead bodies in the\r\nfields. He had them brought to our place so that they might be buried\r\ntogether. They were laid all along the great avenue of pines as fast as\r\nthey brought them in, on both sides of the avenue, and as they began to\r\nsmell unpleasant, their bodies were covered with earth until the deep\r\ntrench could be dug. Thus one saw only their heads which seemed to\r\nprotrude from the clayey earth and were almost as yellow, with their\r\nclosed eyes.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see them. But when I saw those two rows of frightful faces,\r\nI thought I should faint. However, I began to look at them, one by one,\r\ntrying to guess what kind of men these had been.\r\n\r\nThe uniforms were concealed beneath the earth, and yet immediately, yes,\r\nimmediately, my dear, I recognized the Frenchmen by their mustache!\r\n\r\nSome of them had shaved on the very day of the battle, as though they\r\nwished to be elegant up to the last; others seemed to have a week's\r\ngrowth, but all wore the French mustache, very plain, the proud mustache\r\nthat seems to say: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not take me for my bearded friend, little one; I\r\nam a brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I cried, oh, I cried a great deal more than I should if I had not\r\nrecognized them, the poor dead fellows.\r\n\r\nIt was wrong of me to tell you this. Now I am sad and cannot chatter any\r\nlonger. Well, good-by, dear Lucy. I send you a hearty kiss. Long live\r\nthe mustache! JEANNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME BAPTISTE\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did was to look at the clock as I entered the waiting-\r\nroom of the station at Loubain, and I found that I had to wait two hours\r\nand ten minutes for the Paris express.\r\n\r\nI had walked twenty miles and felt suddenly tired. Not seeing anything\r\non the station walls to amuse me, I went outside and stood there racking\r\nmy brains to think of something to do. The street was a kind of\r\nboulevard, planted with acacias, and on either side a row of houses of\r\nvarying shape and different styles of architecture, houses such as one\r\nonly sees in a small town, and ascended a slight hill, at the extreme\r\nend of which there were some trees, as though it ended in a park.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a cat crossed the street and jumped over the gutters\r\ncarefully. A cur sniffed at every tree and hunted for scraps from the\r\nkitchens, but I did not see a single human being, and I felt listless\r\nand disheartened. What could I do with myself? I was already thinking of\r\nthe inevitable and interminable visit to the small cafe at the railway\r\nstation, where I should have to sit over a glass of undrinkable beer and\r\nthe illegible newspaper, when I saw a funeral procession coming out of a\r\nside street into the one in which I was, and the sight of the hearse was\r\na relief to me. It would, at any rate, give me something to do for ten\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, my curiosity was aroused. The hearse was followed by\r\neight gentlemen, one of whom was weeping, while the others were chatting\r\ntogether, but there was no priest, and I thought to myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a non-religious funeral,\xe2\x80\x9d and then I reflected that a town like\r\nLoubain must contain at least a hundred freethinkers, who would have\r\nmade a point of making a manifestation. What could it be, then? The\r\nrapid pace of the procession clearly proved that the body was to be\r\nburied without ceremony, and, consequently, without the intervention of\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nMy idle curiosity framed the most complicated surmises, and as the\r\nhearse passed me, a strange idea struck me, which was to follow it, with\r\nthe eight gentlemen. That would take up my time for an hour, at least,\r\nand I accordingly walked with the others, with a sad look on my face,\r\nand, on seeing this, the two last turned round in surprise, and then\r\nspoke to each other in a low voice.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they were asking each other whether I belonged to the town, and\r\nthen they consulted the two in front of them, who stared at me in turn.\r\nThis close scrutiny annoyed me, and to put an end to it I went up to\r\nthem, and, after bowing, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, gentlemen, for interrupting your conversation, but,\r\nseeing a civil funeral, I have followed it, although I did not know the\r\ndeceased gentleman whom you are accompanying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them said.\r\n\r\nI was much surprised at hearing this, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is a civil funeral, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other gentleman, who evidently wished to tell me all about it, then\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cYes and no. The clergy have refused to allow us the use of the\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this I uttered a prolonged \xe2\x80\x9cA-h!\xe2\x80\x9d of astonishment. I could\r\nnot understand it at all, but my obliging neighbor continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is rather a long story. This young woman committed suicide, and that\r\nis the reason why she cannot be buried with any religious ceremony. The\r\ngentleman who is walking first, and who is crying, is her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied with some hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise and interest me very much, monsieur. Shall I be indiscreet\r\nif I ask you to tell me the facts of the case? If I am troubling you,\r\nforget that I have said anything about the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman took my arm familiarly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, not at all. Let us linger a little behind the others, and I\r\nwill tell it you, although it is a very sad story. We have plenty of\r\ntime before getting to the cemetery, the trees of which you see up\r\nyonder, for it is a stiff pull up this hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis young woman, Madame Paul Hamot, was the daughter of a wealthy\r\nmerchant in the neighborhood, Monsieur Fontanelle. When she was a mere\r\nchild of eleven, she had a shocking adventure; a footman attacked her\r\nand she nearly died. A terrible criminal case was the result, and the\r\nman was sentenced to penal servitude for life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little girl grew up, stigmatized by disgrace, isolated, without any\r\ncompanions; and grown-up people would scarcely kiss her, for they\r\nthought that they would soil their lips if they touched her forehead,\r\nand she became a sort of monster, a phenomenon to all the town. People\r\nsaid to each other in a whisper: 'You know, little Fontanelle,' and\r\neverybody turned away in the streets when she passed. Her parents could\r\nnot even get a nurse to take her out for a walk, as the other servants\r\nheld aloof from her, as if contact with her would poison everybody who\r\ncame near her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was pitiable to see the poor child go and play every afternoon. She\r\nremained quite by herself, standing by her maid and looking at the other\r\nchildren amusing themselves. Sometimes, yielding to an irresistible\r\ndesire to mix with the other children, she advanced timidly, with\r\nnervous gestures, and mingled with a group, with furtive steps, as if\r\nconscious of her own disgrace. And immediately the mothers, aunts and\r\nnurses would come running from every seat and take the children\r\nentrusted to their care by the hand and drag them brutally away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Fontanelle remained isolated, wretched, without understanding\r\nwhat it meant, and then she began to cry, nearly heartbroken with grief,\r\nand then she used to run and hide her head in her nurse's lap, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs she grew up, it was worse still. They kept the girls from her, as if\r\nshe were stricken with the plague. Remember that she had nothing to\r\nlearn, nothing; that she no longer had the right to the symbolical\r\nwreath of orange-flowers; that almost before she could read she had\r\npenetrated that redoubtable mystery which mothers scarcely allow their\r\ndaughters to guess at, trembling as they enlighten them on the night of\r\ntheir marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she went through the streets, always accompanied by her governess,\r\nas if, her parents feared some fresh, terrible adventure, with her eyes\r\ncast down under the load of that mysterious disgrace which she felt was\r\nalways weighing upon her, the other girls, who were not nearly so\r\ninnocent as people thought, whispered and giggled as they looked at her\r\nknowingly, and immediately turned their heads absently, if she happened\r\nto look at them. People scarcely greeted her; only a few men bowed to\r\nher, and the mothers pretended not to see her, while some young\r\nblackguards called her Madame Baptiste, after the name of the footman\r\nwho had attacked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knew the secret torture of her mind, for she hardly ever spoke,\r\nand never laughed, and her parents themselves appeared uncomfortable in\r\nher presence, as if they bore her a constant grudge for some irreparable\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn honest man would not willingly give his hand to a liberated convict,\r\nwould he, even if that convict were his own son? And Monsieur and Madame\r\nFontanelle looked on their daughter as they would have done on a son who\r\nhad just been released from the hulks. She was pretty and pale, tall,\r\nslender, distinguished-looking, and she would have pleased me very much,\r\nmonsieur, but for that unfortunate affair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when a new sub-prefect was appointed here, eighteen months ago,\r\nhe brought his private secretary with him. He was a queer sort of\r\nfellow, who had lived in the Latin Quarter, it appears. He saw\r\nMademoiselle Fontanelle and fell in love with her, and when told of what\r\noccurred, he merely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Bah! That is just a guarantee for the future, and I would rather it\r\nshould have happened before I married her than afterward. I shall live\r\ntranquilly with that woman.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe paid his addresses to her, asked for her hand and married her, and\r\nthen, not being deficient in assurance, he paid wedding calls, as if\r\nnothing had happened. Some people returned them, others did not; but, at\r\nlast, the affair began to be forgotten, and she took her proper place in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe adored her husband as if he had been a god; for, you must remember,\r\nhe had restored her to honor and to social life, had braved public\r\nopinion, faced insults, and, in a word, performed such a courageous act\r\nas few men would undertake, and she felt the most exalted and tender\r\nlove for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she became enceinte, and it was known, the most particular people\r\nand the greatest sticklers opened their doors to her, as if she had been\r\ndefinitely purified by maternity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is strange, but so it is, and thus everything was going on as well\r\nas possible until the other day, which was the feast of the patron saint\r\nof our town. The prefect, surrounded by his staff and the authorities,\r\npresided at the musical competition, and when he had finished his speech\r\nthe distribution of medals began, which Paul Hamot, his private\r\nsecretary, handed to those who were entitled to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you know, there are always jealousies and rivalries, which make\r\npeople forget all propriety. All the ladies of the town were there on\r\nthe platform, and, in his turn, the bandmaster from the village of\r\nMourmillon came up. This band was only to receive a second-class medal,\r\nfor one cannot give first-class medals to everybody, can one? But when\r\nthe private secretary handed him his badge, the man threw it in his face\r\nand exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You may keep your medal for Baptiste. You owe him a first-class one,\r\nalso, just as you do me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were a number of people there who began to laugh. The common herd\r\nare neither charitable nor refined, and every eye was turned toward that\r\npoor lady. Have you ever seen a woman going mad, monsieur? Well, we were\r\npresent at the sight! She got up and fell back on her chair three times\r\nin succession, as if she wished to make her escape, but saw that she\r\ncould not make her way through the crowd, and then another voice in the\r\ncrowd exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! Oh! Madame Baptiste!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a great uproar, partly of laughter and partly of indignation,\r\narose. The word was repeated over and over again; people stood on tiptoe\r\nto see the unhappy woman's face; husbands lifted their wives up in their\r\narms, so that they might see her, and people asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Which is she? The one in blue?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boys crowed like cocks, and laughter was heard all over the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not move now on her state chair, but sat just as if she had\r\nbeen put there for the crowd to look at. She could not move, nor conceal\r\nherself, nor hide her face. Her eyelids blinked quickly, as if a vivid\r\nlight were shining on them, and she breathed heavily, like a horse that\r\nis going up a steep hill, so that it almost broke one's heart to see\r\nher. Meanwhile, however, Monsieur Hamot had seized the ruffian by the\r\nthroat, and they were rolling on the ground together, amid a scene of\r\nindescribable confusion, and the ceremony was interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour later, as the Hamots were returning home, the young woman, who\r\nhad not uttered a word since the insult, but who was trembling as if all\r\nher nerves had been set in motion by springs, suddenly sprang over the\r\nparapet of the bridge and threw herself into the river before her\r\nhusband could prevent her. The water is very deep under the arches, and\r\nit was two hours before her body was recovered. Of course, she was\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe narrator stopped and then added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was, perhaps, the best thing she could do under the circumstances.\r\nThere are some things which cannot be wiped out, and now you understand\r\nwhy the clergy refused to have her taken into church. Ah! If it had been\r\na religious funeral the whole town would have been present, but you can\r\nunderstand that her suicide added to the other affair and made families\r\nabstain from attending her funeral; and then, it is not an easy matter\r\nhere to attend a funeral which is performed without religious rites.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe passed through the cemetery gates and I waited, much moved by what I\r\nhad heard, until the coffin had been lowered into the grave, before I\r\nwent up to the poor fellow who was sobbing violently, to press his hand\r\nwarmly. He looked at me in surprise through his tears and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d And I was not sorry that I had followed the\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF LATIN\r\n\r\nThis subject of Latin that has been dinned into our ears for some time\r\npast recalls to my mind a story\xe2\x80\x94a story of my youth.\r\n\r\nI was finishing my studies with a teacher, in a big central town, at the\r\nInstitution Robineau, celebrated through the entire province for the\r\nspecial attention paid there to the study of Latin.\r\n\r\nFor the past ten years, the Robineau Institute beat the imperial lycee\r\nof the town at every competitive examination, and all the colleges of\r\nthe subprefecture, and these constant successes were due, they said, to\r\nan usher, a simple usher, M. Piquedent, or rather Pere Piquedent.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those middle-aged men quite gray, whose real age it is\r\nimpossible to tell, and whose history we can guess at first glance.\r\nHaving entered as an usher at twenty into the first institution that\r\npresented itself so that he could proceed to take first his degree of\r\nMaster of Arts and afterward the degree of Doctor of Laws, he found\r\nhimself so enmeshed in this routine that he remained an usher all his\r\nlife. But his love for Latin did not leave him and harassed him like an\r\nunhealthy passion. He continued to read the poets, the prose writers,\r\nthe historians, to interpret them and penetrate their meaning, to\r\ncomment on them with a perseverance bordering on madness.\r\n\r\nOne day, the idea came into his head to oblige all the students in his\r\nclass to answer him in Latin only; and he persisted in this resolution\r\nuntil at last they were capable of sustaining an entire conversation\r\nwith him just as they would in their mother tongue. He listened to them,\r\nas a leader of an orchestra listens to his musicians rehearsing, and\r\nstriking his desk every moment with his ruler, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Lefrere, Monsieur Lefrere, you are committing a solecism! You\r\nforget the rule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Plantel, your way of expressing yourself is altogether French\r\nand in no way Latin. You must understand the genius of a language. Look\r\nhere, listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, it came to pass that the pupils of the Institution Robineau carried\r\noff, at the end of the year, all the prizes for composition,\r\ntranslation, and Latin conversation.\r\n\r\nNext year, the principal, a little man, as cunning as an ape, whom he\r\nresembled in his grinning and grotesque appearance, had had printed on\r\nhis programmes, on his advertisements, and painted on the door of his\r\ninstitution:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLatin Studies a Specialty. Five first prizes carried off in the five\r\nclasses of the lycee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo honor prizes at the general examinations in competition with all\r\nthe lycees and colleges of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor ten years the Institution Robineau triumphed in the same fashion.\r\nNow my father, allured by these successes, sent me as a day pupil to\r\nRobineau's\xe2\x80\x94or, as we called it, Robinetto or Robinettino's\xe2\x80\x94and made me\r\ntake special private lessons from Pere Piquedent at the rate of five\r\nfrancs per hour, out of which the usher got two francs and the principal\r\nthree francs. I was then eighteen, and was in the philosophy class.\r\n\r\nThese private lessons were given in a little room looking out on the\r\nstreet. It so happened that Pere Piquedent, instead of talking Latin to\r\nme, as he did when teaching publicly in the institution, kept telling me\r\nhis troubles in French. Without relations, without friends, the poor man\r\nconceived an attachment to me, and poured out his misery to me.\r\n\r\nHe had never for the last ten or fifteen years chatted confidentially\r\nwith any one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am like an oak in a desert,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c'sicut quercus in solitudine'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other ushers disgusted him. He knew nobody in the town, since he had\r\nno time to devote to making acquaintances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even the nights, my friend, and that is the hardest thing on me.\r\nThe dream of my life is to have a room with my own furniture, my own\r\nbooks, little things that belong to myself and which others may not\r\ntouch. And I have nothing of my own, nothing except my trousers and my\r\nfrock-coat, nothing, not even my mattress and my pillow! I have not four\r\nwalls to shut myself up in, except when I come to give a lesson in this\r\nroom. Do you see what this means\xe2\x80\x94a man forced to spend his life without\r\never having the right, without ever finding the time, to shut himself up\r\nall alone, no matter where, to think, to reflect, to work, to dream? Ah!\r\nmy dear boy, a key, the key of a door which one can lock\xe2\x80\x94this is\r\nhappiness, mark you, the only happiness!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, all day long, teaching all those restless rogues, and during the\r\nnight the dormitory with the same restless rogues snoring. And I have to\r\nsleep in the bed at the end of two rows of beds occupied by these\r\nyoungsters whom I must look after. I can never be alone, never! If I go\r\nout I find the streets full of people, and, when I am tired of walking,\r\nI go into some cafe crowded with smokers and billiard players. I tell\r\nyou what, it is the life of a galley slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not take up some other line, Monsieur Piquedent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my little friend? I am not a shoemaker, or a joiner, or a hatter,\r\nor a baker, or a hairdresser. I only know Latin, and I have no diploma\r\nwhich would enable me to sell my knowledge at a high price. If I were a\r\ndoctor I would sell for a hundred francs what I now sell for a hundred\r\nsous; and I would supply it probably of an inferior quality, for my\r\ntitle would be enough to sustain my reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes he would say to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no rest in life except in the hours spent with you. Don't be\r\nafraid! you'll lose nothing by that. I'll make it up to you in the\r\nclass-room by making you speak twice as much Latin as the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne day, I grew bolder, and offered him a cigarette. He stared at me in\r\nastonishment at first, then he gave a glance toward the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf any one were to come in, my dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us smoke at the window,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nAnd we went and leaned our elbows on the windowsill looking on the\r\nstreet, holding concealed in our hands the little rolls of tobacco. Just\r\nopposite to us was a laundry. Four women in loose white waists were\r\npassing hot, heavy irons over the linen spread out before them, from\r\nwhich a warm steam arose.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, another, a fifth, carrying on her arm a large basket which\r\nmade her stoop, came out to take the customers their shirts, their\r\nhandkerchiefs, and their sheets. She stopped on the threshold as if she\r\nwere already fatigued; then, she raised her eyes, smiled as she saw us\r\nsmoking, flung at us, with her left hand, which was free, the sly kiss\r\ncharacteristic of a free-and-easy working-woman, and went away at a slow\r\nplace, dragging her feet as she went.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of about twenty, small, rather thin, pale, rather\r\npretty, with a roguish air and laughing eyes beneath her ill-combed fair\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nPere Piquedent, affected, began murmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an occupation for a woman! Really a trade only fit for a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he spoke with emotion about the misery of the people. He had a heart\r\nwhich swelled with lofty democratic sentiment, and he referred to the\r\nfatiguing pursuits of the working class with phrases borrowed from Jean-\r\nJacques Rousseau, and with sobs in his throat.\r\n\r\nNext day, as we were leaning our elbows on the same window sill, the\r\nsame woman perceived us and cried out to us:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, scholars!\xe2\x80\x9d in a comical sort of tone, while she made a\r\ncontemptuous gesture with her hands.\r\n\r\nI flung her a cigarette, which she immediately began to smoke. And the\r\nfour other ironers rushed out to the door with outstretched hands to get\r\ncigarettes also.\r\n\r\nAnd each day a friendly intercourse was established between the working-\r\nwomen of the pavement and the idlers of the boarding school.\r\n\r\nPere Piquedent was really a comical sight. He trembled at being noticed,\r\nfor he might lose his position; and he made timid and ridiculous\r\ngestures, quite a theatrical display of love signals, to which the women\r\nresponded with a regular fusillade of kisses.\r\n\r\nA perfidious idea came into my mind. One day, on entering our room, I\r\nsaid to the old usher in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not believe it, Monsieur Piquedent, I met the little\r\nwasherwoman! You know the one I mean, the woman who had the basket, and\r\nI spoke to her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe asked, rather worried at my manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she say to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said to me\xe2\x80\x94why, she said she thought you were very nice. The fact\r\nof the matter is, I believe, I believe, that she is a little in love\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d I saw that he was growing pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is laughing at me, of course. These things don't happen at my age,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe replied.\r\n\r\nI said gravely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that? You are all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I felt that my trick had produced its effect on him, I did not press\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nBut every day I pretended that I had met the little laundress and that I\r\nhad spoken to her about him, so that in the end he believed me, and sent\r\nher ardent and earnest kisses.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that one morning, on my way to the boarding school, I\r\nreally came across her. I accosted her without hesitation, as if I had\r\nknown her for the last ten years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, mademoiselle. Are you quite well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, monsieur, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have a cigarette?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! not in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can smoke it at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you, mademoiselle, there's something you don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old gentleman\xe2\x80\x94my old professor, I mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPere Piquedent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pere Piquedent. So you know his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, I do! What of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is in love with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe burst out laughing wildly, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are only fooling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, I am not fooling! He keeps talking of you all through the\r\nlesson. I bet that he'll marry you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ceased laughing. The idea of marriage makes every girl serious. Then\r\nshe repeated, with an incredulous air:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is humbug!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you, it's true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe picked up her basket which she had laid down at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we'll see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. And she went away.\r\n\r\nPresently when I had reached the boarding school, I took Pere Piquedent\r\naside, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must write to her; she is infatuated with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he wrote a long letter, tenderly affectionate, full of phrases and\r\ncircumlocutions, metaphors and similes, philosophy and academic\r\ngallantry; and I took on myself the responsibility of delivering it to\r\nthe young woman.\r\n\r\nShe read it with gravity, with emotion; then she murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow well he writes! It is easy to see he has got education! Does he\r\nreally mean to marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied intrepidly: \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, he has lost his head about you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he must invite me to dinner on Sunday at the Ile des Fleurs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI promised that she should be invited.\r\n\r\nPere Piquedent was much touched by everything I told him about her.\r\n\r\nI added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe loves you, Monsieur Piquedent, and I believe her to be a decent\r\ngirl. It is not right to lead her on and then abandon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied in a firm tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I, too, am a decent man, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI confess I had at the time no plan. I was playing a practical joke a\r\nschoolboy joke, nothing more. I had been aware of the simplicity of the\r\nold usher, his innocence and his weakness. I amused myself without\r\nasking myself how it would turn out. I was eighteen, and I had been for\r\na long time looked upon at the lycee as a sly practical joker.\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed that Pere Piquedent and I should set out in a hack for\r\nthe ferry of Queue de Vache, that we should there pick up Angele, and\r\nthat I should take them into my boat, for in those days I was fond of\r\nboating. I would then bring them to the Ile des Fleurs, where the three\r\nof us would dine. I had inflicted myself on them, the better to enjoy my\r\ntriumph, and the usher, consenting to my arrangement, proved clearly\r\nthat he was losing his head by thus risking the loss of his position.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the ferry, where my boat had been moored since\r\nmorning, I saw in the grass, or rather above the tall weeds of the bank,\r\nan enormous red parasol, resembling a monstrous wild poppy. Beneath the\r\nparasol was the little laundress in her Sunday clothes. I was surprised.\r\nShe was really pretty, though pale; and graceful, though with a rather\r\nsuburban grace.\r\n\r\nPere Piquedent raised his hat and bowed. She put out her hand toward\r\nhim, and they stared at one another without uttering a word. Then they\r\nstepped into my boat, and I took the oars. They were seated side by side\r\nnear the stern.\r\n\r\nThe usher was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is nice weather for a row in a boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dipped her hand into the water, skimming the surface, making a thin,\r\ntransparent film like a sheet of glass, which made a soft plashing along\r\nthe side of the boat.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the restaurant, she took it on herself to speak, and\r\nordered dinner, fried fish, a chicken, and salad; then she led us on\r\ntoward the isle, which she knew perfectly.\r\n\r\nAfter this, she was gay, romping, and even rather tantalizing.\r\n\r\nUntil dessert, no question of love arose. I had treated them to\r\nchampagne, and Pere Piquedent was tipsy. Herself slightly the worse, she\r\ncalled out to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Piquenez.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle, Monsieur Raoul has communicated my sentiments to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe became as serious as a judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your reply?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never reply to these questions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe puffed with emotion, and went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, will the day ever come that you will like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou big stupid! You are very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, mademoiselle, do you think that, later on, we might\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a second; then in a trembling voice she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to marry me when you say that? For on no other condition,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mademoiselle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that's all right, Monsieur Piquedent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was thus that these two silly creatures promised marriage to each\r\nother through the trick of a young scamp. But I did not believe that it\r\nwas serious, nor, indeed, did they, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I have nothing, not four sous,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe stammered, for he was as drunk as Silenus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have saved five thousand francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed triumphantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we can set up in business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe became restless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I know? We shall see. With five thousand francs we could do\r\nmany things. You don't want me to go and live in your boarding school,\r\ndo you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not looked forward so far as this, and he stammered in great\r\nperplexity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business could we set up in? That would not do, for all I know is\r\nLatin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reflected in her turn, passing in review all her business ambitions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could not be a doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have no diploma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr a chemist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more than the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uttered a cry of joy. She had discovered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we'll buy a grocer's shop! Oh! what luck! we'll buy a grocer's\r\nshop. Not on a big scale, of course; with five thousand francs one does\r\nnot go far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was shocked at the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can't be a grocer. I am\xe2\x80\x94I am\xe2\x80\x94too well known: I only know Latin,\r\nthat is all I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she poured a glass of champagne down his throat. He drank it and was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nWe got back into the boat. The night was dark, very dark. I saw clearly,\r\nhowever, that he had caught her by the waist, and that they were hugging\r\neach other again and again.\r\n\r\nIt was a frightful catastrophe. Our escapade was discovered, with the\r\nresult that Pere Piquedent was dismissed. And my father, in a fit of\r\nanger, sent me to finish my course of philosophy at Ribaudet's school.\r\n\r\nSix months later I took my degree of Bachelor of Arts. Then I went to\r\nstudy law in Paris, and did not return to my native town till two years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Rue de Serpent a shop caught my eye. Over the door\r\nwere the words: \xe2\x80\x9cColonial Products\xe2\x80\x94Piquedent\xe2\x80\x9d; then underneath, so as to\r\nenlighten the most ignorant: \xe2\x80\x9cGrocery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Quantum mutatus ab illo!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiquedent raised his head, left his female customer, and rushed toward\r\nme with outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my young friend, my young friend, here you are! What luck! what\r\nluck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA beautiful woman, very plump, abruptly left the cashier's desk and\r\nflung herself on my breast. I had some difficulty in recognizing her,\r\nshe had grown so stout.\r\n\r\nI asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then you're doing well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPiquedent had gone back to weigh the groceries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! very well, very well, very well. I have made three thousand francs\r\nclear this year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about Latin, Monsieur Piquedent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good heavens! Latin, Latin, Latin\xe2\x80\x94you see it does not keep the pot\r\nboiling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MEETING\r\n\r\nIt was nothing but an accident, an accident pure and simple. On that\r\nparticular evening the princess' rooms were open, and as they appeared\r\ndark after the brilliantly lighted parlors, Baron d'Etraille, who was\r\ntired of standing, inadvertently wandered into an empty bedroom.\r\n\r\nHe looked round for a chair in which to have a doze, as he was sure his\r\nwife would not leave before daylight. As soon as he became accustomed to\r\nthe light of the room he distinguished the big bed with its azure-and-\r\ngold hangings, in the middle of the great room, looking like a\r\ncatafalque in which love was buried, for the princess was no longer\r\nyoung. Behind it, a large bright surface looked like a lake seen at a\r\ndistance. It was a large mirror, discreetly covered with dark drapery,\r\nthat was very rarely let down, and seemed to look at the bed, which was\r\nits accomplice. One might almost fancy that it had reminiscences, and\r\nthat one might see in it charming female forms and the gentle movement\r\nof loving arms.\r\n\r\nThe baron stood still for a moment, smiling, almost experiencing an\r\nemotion on the threshold of this chamber dedicated to love. But suddenly\r\nsomething appeared in the looking-glass, as if the phantoms which he had\r\nevoked had risen up before him. A man and a woman who had been sitting\r\non a low couch concealed in the shadow had arisen, and the polished\r\nsurface, reflecting their figures, showed that they were kissing each\r\nother before separating.\r\n\r\nBaron d'Etraille recognized his wife and the Marquis de Cervigne. He\r\nturned and went away like a man who is fully master of himself, and\r\nwaited till it was day before taking away the baroness; but he had no\r\nlonger any thoughts of sleeping.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, I saw you just now in Princesse de Raynes' room; I need say no\r\nmore, and I am not fond either of reproaches, acts of violence, or of\r\nridicule. As I wish to avoid all such things, we shall separate without\r\nany scandal. Our lawyers will settle your position according to my\r\norders. You will be free to live as you please when you are no longer\r\nunder my roof; but, as you will continue to bear my name, I must warn\r\nyou that should any scandal arise I shall show myself inflexible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to speak, but he stopped her, bowed, and left the room.\r\n\r\nHe was more astonished and sad than unhappy. He had loved her dearly\r\nduring the first period of their married life; but his ardor had cooled,\r\nand now he often amused himself elsewhere, either in a theatre or in\r\nsociety, though he always preserved a certain liking for the baroness.\r\n\r\nShe was very young, hardly four-and-twenty, small, slight\xe2\x80\x94too slight\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nvery fair. She was a true Parisian doll: clever, spoiled, elegant,\r\ncoquettish, witty, with more charm than real beauty. He used to say\r\nfamiliarly to his brother, when speaking of her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife is charming, attractive, but\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing to lay hold of.\r\nShe is like a glass of champagne that is all froth; when you get to the\r\nwine it is very good, but there is too little of it, unfortunately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down the room in great agitation, thinking of a\r\nthousand things. At one moment he was furious, and felt inclined to give\r\nthe marquis a good thrashing, or to slap his face publicly, in the club.\r\nBut he decided that would not do, it would not be good form; he would be\r\nlaughed at, and not his rival, and this thought wounded his vanity. So\r\nhe went to bed, but could not sleep. Paris knew in a few days that the\r\nBaron and Baroness d'Etraille had agreed to an amicable separation on\r\naccount of incompatibility of temper. No one suspected anything, no one\r\nlaughed, and no one was astonished.\r\n\r\nThe baron, however, to avoid meeting his wife, travelled for a year,\r\nthen spent the summer at the seaside, and the autumn in shooting,\r\nreturning to Paris for the winter. He did not meet the baroness once.\r\n\r\nHe did not even know what people said about her. In any case, she took\r\ncare to respect appearances, and that was all he asked for.\r\n\r\nHe became dreadfully bored, travelled again, restored his old castle of\r\nVillebosc, which took him two years; then for over a year he entertained\r\nfriends there, till at last, tired of all these so-called pleasures, he\r\nreturned to his mansion in the Rue de Lille, just six years after the\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nHe was now forty-five, with a good crop of gray hair, rather stout, and\r\nwith that melancholy look characteristic of those who have been\r\nhandsome, sought after, and liked, but who are deteriorating, daily.\r\n\r\nA month after his return to Paris, he took cold on coming out of his\r\nclub, and had such a bad cough that his medical man ordered him to Nice\r\nfor the rest of the winter.\r\n\r\nHe reached the station only a few minutes before the departure of the\r\ntrain on Monday evening, and had barely time to get into a carriage,\r\nwith only one other occupant, who was sitting in a corner so wrapped in\r\nfurs and cloaks that he could not even make out whether it was a man or\r\na woman, as nothing of the figure could be seen. When he perceived that\r\nhe could not find out, he put on his travelling cap, rolled himself up\r\nin his rugs, and stretched out comfortably to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe did not wake until the day was breaking, and looked at once at his\r\nfellow-traveller, who had not stirred all night, and seemed still to be\r\nsound asleep.\r\n\r\nM. d'Etraille made use of the opportunity to brush his hair and his\r\nbeard, and to try to freshen himself up a little generally, for a\r\nnight's travel does not improve one's appearance when one has attained a\r\ncertain age.\r\n\r\nA great poet has said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we are young, our mornings are triumphant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen we wake up with a cool skin, a bright eye, and glossy hair.\r\n\r\nAs one grows older one wakes up in a very different condition. Dull\r\neyes, red, swollen cheeks, dry lips, hair and beard disarranged, impart\r\nan old, fatigued, worn-out look to the face.\r\n\r\nThe baron opened his travelling case, and improved his looks as much as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe engine whistled, the train stopped, and his neighbor moved. No doubt\r\nhe was awake. They started off again, and then a slanting ray of\r\nsunlight shone into the carriage and on the sleeper, who moved again,\r\nshook himself, and then his face could be seen.\r\n\r\nIt was a young, fair, pretty, plump woman, and the baron looked at her\r\nin amazement. He did not know what to think. He could really have sworn\r\nthat it was his wife, but wonderfully changed for the better: stouter\r\n\xe2\x80\x94why she had grown as stout as he was, only it suited her much better\r\nthan it did him.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him calmly, did not seem to recognize him, and then slowly\r\nlaid aside her wraps. She had that quiet assurance of a woman who is\r\nsure of herself, who feels that on awaking she is in her full beauty and\r\nfreshness.\r\n\r\nThe baron was really bewildered. Was it his wife, or else as like her as\r\nany sister could be? Not having seen her for six years, he might be\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nShe yawned, and this gesture betrayed her. She turned and looked at him\r\nagain, calmly, indifferently, as if she scarcely saw him, and then\r\nlooked out of the window again.\r\n\r\nHe was upset and dreadfully perplexed, and kept looking at her sideways.\r\n\r\nYes; it was surely his wife. How could he possibly have doubted it?\r\nThere could certainly not be two noses like that, and a thousand\r\nrecollections flashed through his mind. He felt the old feeling of the\r\nintoxication of love stealing over him, and he called to mind the sweet\r\nodor of her skin, her smile when she put her arms on to his shoulders,\r\nthe soft intonations of her voice, all her graceful, coaxing ways.\r\n\r\nBut how she had changed and improved! It was she and yet not she. She\r\nseemed riper, more developed, more of a woman, more seductive, more\r\ndesirable, adorably desirable.\r\n\r\nAnd this strange, unknown woman, whom he had accidentally met in a\r\nrailway carriage, belonged to him; he had only to say to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI insist upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had formerly slept in her arms, existed only in her love, and now he\r\nhad found her again certainly, but so changed that he scarcely knew her.\r\nIt was another, and yet it was she herself. It was some one who had been\r\nborn and had formed and grown since he had left her. It was she, indeed;\r\nshe whom he had loved, but who was now altered, with a more assured\r\nsmile and greater self-possession. There were two women in one, mingling\r\na great part of what was new and unknown with many sweet recollections\r\nof the past. There was something singular, disturbing, exciting about it\r\n\xe2\x80\x94a kind of mystery of love in which there floated a delicious confusion.\r\nIt was his wife in a new body and in new flesh which lips had never\r\npressed.\r\n\r\nAnd he thought that in a few years nearly every thing changes in us;\r\nonly the outline can be recognized, and sometimes even that disappears.\r\n\r\nThe blood, the hair, the skin, all changes and is renewed, and when\r\npeople have not seen each other for a long time, when they meet they\r\nfind each other totally different beings, although they are the same and\r\nbear the same name.\r\n\r\nAnd the heart also can change. Ideas may be modified and renewed, so\r\nthat in forty years of life we may, by gradual and constant\r\ntransformations, become four or five totally new and different beings.\r\n\r\nHe dwelt on this thought till it troubled him; it had first taken\r\npossession of him when he surprised her in the princess' room. He was\r\nnot the least angry; it was not the same woman that he was looking at\r\n\xe2\x80\x94that thin, excitable little doll of those days.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do? How should he address her? and what could he say to\r\nher? Had she recognized him?\r\n\r\nThe train stopped again. He got up, bowed, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cBertha, do you\r\nwant anything I could bring you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him from head to foot, and answered, without showing the\r\nslightest surprise, or confusion, or anger, but with the most perfect\r\nindifference:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not want anything\xe2\x80\x94-thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got out and walked up and down the platform a little in order to\r\nrecover himself, and, as it were, to recover his senses after a fall.\r\nWhat should he do now? If he got into another carriage it would look as\r\nif he were running away. Should he be polite or importunate? That would\r\nlook as if he were asking for forgiveness. Should he speak as if he were\r\nher master? He would look like a fool, and, besides, he really had no\r\nright to do so.\r\n\r\nHe got in again and took his place.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence she had hastily arranged her dress and hair, and was\r\nnow lying stretched out on the seat, radiant, and without showing any\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nHe turned to her, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Bertha, since this singular chance\r\nhas brought up together after a separation of six years\xe2\x80\x94a quite friendly\r\nseparation\xe2\x80\x94are we to continue to look upon each other as irreconcilable\r\nenemies? We are shut up together, tete-a-tete, which is so much the\r\nbetter or so much the worse. I am not going to get into another\r\ncarriage, so don't you think it is preferable to talk as friends till\r\nthe end of our journey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered, quite calmly again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly stopped, really not knowing what to say; but as he had\r\nplenty of assurance, he sat down on the middle seat, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I see I must pay my court to you; so much the better. It is,\r\nhowever, really a pleasure, for you are charming. You cannot imagine how\r\nyou have improved in the last six years. I do not know any woman who\r\ncould give me that delightful sensation which I experienced just now\r\nwhen you emerged from your wraps. I really could not have thought such a\r\nchange possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout moving her head or looking at him, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say the\r\nsame with regard to you; you have certainly deteriorated a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got red and confused, and then, with a smile of resignation, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rather hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d was her reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only stating facts. I don't suppose you\r\nintend to offer me your love? It must, therefore, be a matter of perfect\r\nindifference to you what I think about you. But I see it is a painful\r\nsubject, so let us talk of something else. What have you been doing\r\nsince I last saw you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt rather out of countenance, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I have travelled, done some shooting, and grown old, as you see. And\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said, quite calmly: \xe2\x80\x9cI have taken care of appearances, as you\r\nordered me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very nearly saying something brutal, but he checked himself; and\r\nkissed his wife's hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe was surprised. He was indeed diplomatic, and always master of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe went on: \xe2\x80\x9cAs you have acceded to my first request, shall we now talk\r\nwithout any bitterness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a little movement of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBitterness? I don't feel any; you are a complete stranger to me; I am\r\nonly trying to keep up a difficult conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still looking at her, fascinated in spite of her harshness, and\r\nhe felt seized with a brutal Beside, the desire of the master.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that she had hurt his feelings, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you now? I thought you were younger than you look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am forty-five\xe2\x80\x9d; and then he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to ask after Princesse\r\nde Raynes. Are you still intimate with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him as if she hated him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I certainly am. She is very well, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey remained sitting side by side, agitated and irritated. Suddenly he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Bertha, I have changed my mind. You are my wife, and I expect\r\nyou to come with me to-day. You have, I think, improved both morally and\r\nphysically, and I am going to take you back again. I am your husband,\r\nand it is my right to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was stupefied, and looked at him, trying to divine his thoughts; but\r\nhis face was resolute and impenetrable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have made other engagements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the worse for you,\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply. \xe2\x80\x9cThe law gives me the power,\r\nand I mean to use it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were nearing Marseilles, and the train whistled and slackened\r\nspeed. The baroness rose, carefully rolled up her wraps, and then,\r\nturning to her husband, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Raymond, do not make a bad use of this tete-a tete which I had\r\ncarefully prepared. I wished to take precautions, according to your\r\nadvice, so that I might have nothing to fear from you or from other\r\npeople, whatever might happen. You are going to Nice, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go wherever you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; just listen to me, and I am sure that you will leave me in\r\npeace. In a few moments, when we get to the station, you will see the\r\nPrincesse de Raynes and Comtesse Henriot waiting for me with their\r\nhusbands. I wished them to see as, and to know that we had spent the\r\nnight together in the railway carriage. Don't be alarmed; they will tell\r\nit everywhere as a most surprising fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you just now that I had most carefully followed your advice and\r\nsaved appearances. Anything else does not matter, does it? Well, in\r\norder to do so, I wished to be seen with you. You told me carefully to\r\navoid any scandal, and I am avoiding it, for, I am afraid\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited till the train had quite stopped, and as her friends ran up\r\nto open the carriage door, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94hesitating\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat there is another reason\xe2\x80\x94je suis\r\nenceinte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe princess stretched out her arms to embrace her,\xe2\x80\x94and the baroness\r\nsaid, painting to the baron, who was dumb with astonishment, and was\r\ntrying to get at the truth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not recognize Raymond? He has certainly changed a good deal, and\r\nhe agreed to come with me so that I might not travel alone. We take\r\nlittle trips like this occasionally, like good friends who cannot live\r\ntogether. We are going to separate here; he has had enough of me\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand, which he took mechanically, and then she jumped\r\nout on to the platform among her friends, who were waiting for her.\r\n\r\nThe baron hastily shut the carriage door, for he was too much disturbed\r\nto say a word or come to any determination. He heard his wife's voice\r\nand their merry laughter as they went away.\r\n\r\nHe never saw her again, nor did he ever discover whether she had told\r\nhim a lie or was speaking the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLIND MAN\r\n\r\nHow is it that the sunlight gives us such joy? Why does this radiance\r\nwhen it falls on the earth fill us with the joy of living? The whole sky\r\nis blue, the fields are green, the houses all white, and our enchanted\r\neyes drink in those bright colors which bring delight to our souls. And\r\nthen there springs up in our hearts a desire to dance, to run, to sing,\r\na happy lightness of thought, a sort of enlarged tenderness; we feel a\r\nlonging to embrace the sun.\r\n\r\nThe blind, as they sit in the doorways, impassive in their eternal\r\ndarkness, remain as calm as ever in the midst of this fresh gaiety, and,\r\nnot understanding what is taking place around them, they continually\r\ncheck their dogs as they attempt to play.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the close of the day, they are returning home on the arm of a\r\nyoung brother or a little sister, if the child says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very fine\r\nday!\xe2\x80\x9d the other answers: \xe2\x80\x9cI could notice that it was fine. Loulou\r\nwouldn't keep quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew one of these men whose life was one of the most cruel martyrdoms\r\nthat could possibly be conceived.\r\n\r\nHe was a peasant, the son of a Norman farmer. As long as his father and\r\nmother lived, he was more or less taken care of; he suffered little save\r\nfrom his horrible infirmity; but as soon as the old people were gone, an\r\natrocious life of misery commenced for him. Dependent on a sister of\r\nhis, everybody in the farmhouse treated him as a beggar who is eating\r\nthe bread of strangers. At every meal the very food he swallowed was\r\nmade a subject of reproach against him; he was called a drone, a clown,\r\nand although his brother-in-law had taken possession of his portion of\r\nthe inheritance, he was helped grudgingly to soup, getting just enough\r\nto save him from starving.\r\n\r\nHis face was very pale and his two big white eyes looked like wafers. He\r\nremained unmoved at all the insults hurled at him, so reserved that one\r\ncould not tell whether he felt them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he had never known any tenderness, his mother having always\r\ntreated him unkindly and caring very little for him; for in country\r\nplaces useless persons are considered a nuisance, and the peasants would\r\nbe glad to kill the infirm of their species, as poultry do.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he finished his soup he went and sat outside the door in\r\nsummer and in winter beside the fireside, and did not stir again all the\r\nevening. He made no gesture, no movement; only his eyelids, quivering\r\nfrom some nervous affection, fell down sometimes over his white,\r\nsightless orbs. Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any\r\nconsciousness of his own existence? Nobody cared to inquire.\r\n\r\nFor some years things went on in this fashion. But his incapacity for\r\nwork as well as his impassiveness eventually exasperated his relatives,\r\nand he became a laughingstock, a sort of butt for merriment, a prey to\r\nthe inborn ferocity, to the savage gaiety of the brutes who surrounded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine all the cruel practical jokes inspired by his\r\nblindness. And, in order to have some fun in return for feeding him,\r\nthey now converted his meals into hours of pleasure for the neighbors\r\nand of punishment for the helpless creature himself.\r\n\r\nThe peasants from the nearest houses came to this entertainment; it was\r\ntalked about from door to door, and every day the kitchen of the\r\nfarmhouse was full of people. Sometimes they placed before his plate,\r\nwhen he was beginning to eat his soup, some cat or dog. The animal\r\ninstinctively perceived the man's infirmity, and, softly approaching,\r\ncommenced eating noiselessly, lapping up the soup daintily; and, when\r\nthey lapped the food rather noisily, rousing the poor fellow's\r\nattention, they would prudently scamper away to avoid the blow of the\r\nspoon directed at random by the blind man!\r\n\r\nThen the spectators ranged along the wall would burst out laughing,\r\nnudge each other and stamp their feet on the floor. And he, without ever\r\nuttering a word, would continue eating with his right hand, while\r\nstretching out his left to protect his plate.\r\n\r\nAnother time they made him chew corks, bits of wood, leaves or even\r\nfilth, which he was unable to distinguish.\r\n\r\nAfter this they got tired even of these practical jokes, and the\r\nbrother-in-law, angry at having to support him always, struck him,\r\ncuffed him incessantly, laughing at his futile efforts to ward off or\r\nreturn the blows. Then came a new pleasure\xe2\x80\x94the pleasure of smacking his\r\nface. And the plough-men, the servant girls and even every passing\r\nvagabond were every moment giving him cuffs, which caused his eyelashes\r\nto twitch spasmodically. He did not know where to hide himself and\r\nremained with his arms always held out to guard against people coming\r\ntoo close to him.\r\n\r\nAt last he was forced to beg.\r\n\r\nHe was placed somewhere on the high-road on market-days, and as soon as\r\nhe heard the sound of footsteps or the rolling of a vehicle, he reached\r\nout his hat, stammering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharity, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the peasant is not lavish, and for whole weeks he did not bring back\r\na sou.\r\n\r\nThen he became the victim of furious, pitiless hatred. And this is how\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nOne winter the ground was covered with snow, and it was freezing hard.\r\nHis brother-in-law led him one morning a great distance along the high\r\nroad in order that he might solicit alms. The blind man was left there\r\nall day; and when night came on, the brother-in-law told the people of\r\nhis house that he could find no trace of the mendicant. Then he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! best not bother about him! He was cold and got someone to take\r\nhim away. Never fear! he's not lost. He'll turn up soon enough tomorrow\r\nto eat the soup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext day he did not come back.\r\n\r\nAfter long hours of waiting, stiffened with the cold, feeling that he\r\nwas dying, the blind man began to walk. Being unable to find his way\r\nalong the road, owing to its thick coating of ice, he went on at random,\r\nfalling into ditches, getting up again, without uttering a sound, his\r\nsole object being to find some house where he could take shelter.\r\n\r\nBut, by degrees, the descending snow made a numbness steal over him, and\r\nhis feeble limbs being incapable of carrying him farther, he sat down in\r\nthe middle of an open field. He did not get up again.\r\n\r\nThe white flakes which fell continuously buried him, so that his body,\r\nquite stiff and stark, disappeared under the incessant accumulation of\r\ntheir rapidly thickening mass, and nothing was left to indicate the\r\nplace where he lay.\r\n\r\nHis relatives made a pretence of inquiring about him and searching for\r\nhim for about a week. They even made a show of weeping.\r\n\r\nThe winter was severe, and the thaw did not set in quickly. Now, one\r\nSunday, on their way to mass, the farmers noticed a great flight of\r\ncrows, who were whirling incessantly above the open field, and then\r\ndescending like a shower of black rain at the same spot, ever going and\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nThe following week these gloomy birds were still there. There was a\r\ncrowd of them up in the air, as if they had gathered from all corners of\r\nthe horizon, and they swooped down with a great cawing into the shining\r\nsnow, which they covered like black patches, and in which they kept\r\npecking obstinately. A young fellow went to see what they were doing and\r\ndiscovered the body of the blind man, already half devoured, mangled.\r\nHis wan eyes had disappeared, pecked out by the long, voracious beaks.\r\n\r\nAnd I can never feel the glad radiance of sunlit days without sadly\r\nremembering and pondering over the fate of the beggar who was such an\r\noutcast in life that his horrible death was a relief to all who had\r\nknown him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDISCRETION\r\n\r\nThey had loved each other before marriage with a pure and lofty love.\r\nThey had first met on the sea-shore. He had thought this young girl\r\ncharming, as she passed by with her light-colored parasol and her dainty\r\ndress amid the marine landscape against the horizon. He had loved her,\r\nblond and slender, in these surroundings of blue ocean and spacious sky.\r\nHe could not distinguish the tenderness which this budding woman awoke\r\nin him from the vague and powerful emotion which the fresh salt air and\r\nthe grand scenery of surf and sunshine and waves aroused in his soul.\r\n\r\nShe, on the other hand, had loved him because he courted her, because he\r\nwas young, rich, kind, and attentive. She had loved him because it is\r\nnatural for young girls to love men who whisper sweet nothings to them.\r\n\r\nSo, for three months, they had lived side by side, and hand in hand. The\r\ngreeting which they exchanged in the morning before the bath, in the\r\nfreshness of the morning, or in the evening on the sand, under the\r\nstars, in the warmth of a calm night, whispered low, very low, already\r\nhad the flavor of kisses, though their lips had never met.\r\n\r\nEach dreamed of the other at night, each thought of the other on\r\nawaking, * and, without yet having voiced their sentiments, each longing\r\nfor the other, body and soul.\r\n\r\nAfter marriage their love descended to earth. It was at first a\r\ntireless, sensuous passion, then exalted tenderness composed of tangible\r\npoetry, more refined caresses, and new and foolish inventions. Every\r\nglance and gesture was an expression of passion.\r\n\r\nBut, little by little, without even noticing it, they began to get tired\r\nof each other. Love was still strong, but they had nothing more to\r\nreveal to each other, nothing more to learn from each other, no new tale\r\nof endearment, no unexpected outburst, no new way of expressing the\r\nwell-known, oft-repeated verb.\r\n\r\nThey tried, however, to rekindle the dwindling flame of the first love.\r\nEvery day they tried some new trick or desperate attempt to bring back\r\nto their hearts the uncooled ardor of their first days of married life.\r\nThey tried moonlight walks under the trees, in the sweet warmth of the\r\nsummer evenings: the poetry of mist-covered beaches; the excitement of\r\npublic festivals.\r\n\r\nOne morning Henriette said to Paul:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take me to a cafe for dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, dearie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo some well-known cafe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a questioning glance, seeing that she was thinking\r\nof something which she did not wish to tell.\r\n\r\nShe went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, one of those cafes\xe2\x80\x94oh, how can I explain myself?\xe2\x80\x94a sporty\r\ncafe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I understand\xe2\x80\x94you mean in one of the cafes which\r\nare commonly called bohemian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that's it. But take me to one of the big places, one where you are\r\nknown, one where you have already supped\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94dined\xe2\x80\x94well, you know\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94oh!\r\nI will never dare say it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead, dearie. Little secrets should no longer exist between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I dare not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on; don't be prudish. Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I want to be taken for your sweetheart\xe2\x80\x94there! and I want the\r\nboys, who do not know that you are married, to take me for such; and you\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94I want you to think that I am your sweetheart for one hour, in that\r\nplace which must hold so many memories for you. There! And I will play\r\nthat I am your sweetheart. It's awful, I know\xe2\x80\x94I am abominably ashamed, I\r\nam as red as a peony. Don't look at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed, greatly amused, and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, we will go to-night to a very swell place where I am well\r\nknown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToward seven o'clock they went up the stairs of one of the big cafes on\r\nthe Boulevard, he, smiling, with the look of a conqueror, she, timid,\r\nveiled, delighted. They were immediately shown to one of the luxurious\r\nprivate dining-rooms, furnished with four large arm-chairs and a red\r\nplush couch. The head waiter entered and brought them the menu. Paul\r\nhanded it to his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't care; order whatever is good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter handing his coat to the waiter, he ordered dinner and champagne.\r\nThe waiter looked at the young woman and smiled. He took the order and\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Monsieur Paul have his champagne sweet or dry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDry, very dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenriette was pleased to hear that this man knew her husband's name.\r\nThey sat on the couch, side by side, and began to eat.\r\n\r\nTen candles lighted the room and were reflected in the mirrors all\r\naround them, which seemed to increase the brilliancy a thousand-fold.\r\nHenriette drank glass after glass in order to keep up her courage,\r\nalthough she felt dizzy after the first few glasses. Paul, excited by\r\nthe memories which returned to him, kept kissing his wife's hands. His\r\neyes were sparkling.\r\n\r\nShe was feeling strangely excited in this new place, restless, pleased,\r\na little guilty, but full of life. Two waiters, serious, silent,\r\naccustomed to seeing and forgetting everything, to entering the room\r\nonly when it was necessary and to leaving it when they felt they were\r\nintruding, were silently flitting hither and thither.\r\n\r\nToward the middle of the dinner, Henriette was well under the influence\r\nof champagne. She was prattling along fearlessly, her cheeks flushed,\r\nher eyes glistening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Paul; tell me everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, sweetheart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't dare tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you loved many women before me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, a little perplexed, not knowing whether he should hide his\r\nadventures or boast of them.\r\n\r\nShe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! please tell me. How many have you loved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know. How do you expect me to know such things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven't you counted them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must have loved a good many!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout how many? Just tell me about how many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don't know, dearest. Some years a good many, and some years only\r\na few.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many a year, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes twenty or thirty, sometimes only four or five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that makes more than a hundred in all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I think that is dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy dreadful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it's dreadful when you think of it\xe2\x80\x94all those women\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nalways\xe2\x80\x94always the same thing. Oh! it's dreadful, just the same\xe2\x80\x94more than\r\na hundred women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was surprised that she should think that dreadful, and answered, with\r\nthe air of superiority which men take with women when they wish to make\r\nthem understand that they have said something foolish:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's funny! If it is dreadful to have a hundred women, it's dreadful\r\nto have one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, not at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause with one woman you have a real bond of love which attaches you\r\nto her, while with a hundred women it's not the same at all. There is no\r\nreal love. I don't understand how a man can associate with such women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they can't be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop; you disgust me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, why did you ask me how many sweethearts I had had?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's no reason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were they-actresses, little shop-girls, or society women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few of each.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been rather monotonous toward the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; it's amusing to change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained thoughtful, staring at her champagne glass. It was full\r\n\xe2\x80\x94she drank it in one gulp; then putting it back on the table, she threw\r\nher arms around her husband's neck and murmured in his ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how I love you, sweetheart! how I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw his arms around her in a passionate embrace. A waiter, who was\r\njust entering, backed out, closing the door discreetly. In about five\r\nminutes the head waiter came back, solemn and dignified, bringing the\r\nfruit for dessert. She was once more holding between her fingers a full\r\nglass, and gazing into the amber liquid as though seeking unknown\r\nthings. She murmured in a dreamy voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it must be fun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAMILY AFFAIR\r\n\r\nThe small engine attached to the Neuilly steam-tram whistled as it\r\npassed the Porte Maillot to warn all obstacles to get out of its way and\r\npuffed like a person out of breath as it sent out its steam, its pistons\r\nmoving rapidly with a noise as of iron legs running. The train was going\r\nalong the broad avenue that ends at the Seine. The sultry heat at the\r\nclose of a July day lay over the whole city, and from the road, although\r\nthere was not a breath of wind stirring, there arose a white, chalky,\r\nsuffocating, warm dust, which adhered to the moist skin, filled the eyes\r\nand got into the lungs. People stood in the doorways of their houses to\r\ntry and get a breath of air.\r\n\r\nThe windows of the steam-tram were open and the curtains fluttered in\r\nthe wind. There were very few passengers inside, because on warm days\r\npeople preferred the outside or the platforms. They consisted of stout\r\nwomen in peculiar costumes, of those shopkeepers' wives from the\r\nsuburbs, who made up for the distinguished looks which they did not\r\npossess by ill-assumed dignity; of men tired from office-work, with\r\nyellow faces, stooped shoulders, and with one shoulder higher than the\r\nother, in consequence of, their long hours of writing at a desk. Their\r\nuneasy and melancholy faces also spoke of domestic troubles, of constant\r\nwant of money, disappointed hopes, for they all belonged to the army of\r\npoor, threadbare devils who vegetate economically in cheap, plastered\r\nhouses with a tiny piece of neglected garden on the outskirts of Paris,\r\nin the midst of those fields where night soil is deposited.\r\n\r\nA short, corpulent man, with a puffy face, dressed all in black and\r\nwearing a decoration in his buttonhole, was talking to a tall, thin man,\r\ndressed in a dirty, white linen suit, the coat all unbuttoned, with a\r\nwhite Panama hat on his head. The former spoke so slowly and\r\nhesitatingly that it occasionally almost seemed as if he stammered; he\r\nwas Monsieur Caravan, chief clerk in the Admiralty. The other, who had\r\nformerly been surgeon on board a merchant ship, had set up in practice\r\nin Courbevoie, where he applied the vague remnants of medical knowledge\r\nwhich he had retained after an adventurous life, to the wretched\r\npopulation of that district. His name was Chenet, and strange rumors\r\nwere current as to his morality.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Caravan had always led the normal life of a man in a Government\r\noffice. For the last thirty years he had invariably gone the same way to\r\nhis office every morning, and had met the same men going to business at\r\nthe same time, and nearly on the same spot, and he returned home every\r\nevening by the same road, and again met the same faces which he had seen\r\ngrowing old. Every morning, after buying his penny paper at the corner\r\nof the Faubourg Saint Honore, he bought two rolls, and then went to his\r\noffice, like a culprit who is giving himself up to justice, and got to\r\nhis desk as quickly as possible, always feeling uneasy; as though he\r\nwere expecting a rebuke for some neglect of duty of which he might have\r\nbeen guilty.\r\n\r\nNothing had ever occurred to change the monotonous order of his\r\nexistence, for no event affected him except the work of his office,\r\nperquisites, gratuities, and promotion. He never spoke of anything but\r\nof his duties, either at the office, or at home\xe2\x80\x94he had married the\r\nportionless daughter of one of his colleagues. His mind, which was in a\r\nstate of atrophy from his depressing daily work, had no other thoughts,\r\nhopes or dreams than such as related to the office, and there was a\r\nconstant source of bitterness that spoilt every pleasure that he might\r\nhave had, and that was the employment of so many naval officials,\r\ntinsmiths, as they were called because of their silver-lace as first-\r\nclass clerks; and every evening at dinner he discussed the matter hotly\r\nwith his wife, who shared his angry feelings, and proved to their own\r\nsatisfaction that it was in every way unjust to give places in Paris to\r\nmen who ought properly to have been employed in the navy.\r\n\r\nHe was old now, and had scarcely noticed how his life was passing, for\r\nschool had merely been exchanged for the office without any intermediate\r\ntransition, and the ushers, at whom he had formerly trembled, were\r\nreplaced by his chiefs, of whom he was terribly afraid. When he had to\r\ngo into the rooms of these official despots, it made him tremble from\r\nhead to foot, and that constant fear had given him a very awkward manner\r\nin their presence, a humble demeanor, and a kind of nervous stammering.\r\n\r\nHe knew nothing more about Paris than a blind man might know who was led\r\nto the same spot by his dog every day; and if he read the account of any\r\nuncommon events or scandals in his penny paper, they appeared to him\r\nlike fantastic tales, which some pressman had made up out of his own\r\nhead, in order to amuse the inferior employees. He did not read the\r\npolitical news, which his paper frequently altered as the cause which\r\nsubsidized it might require, for he was not fond of innovations, and\r\nwhen he went through the Avenue of the Champs-Elysees every evening, he\r\nlooked at the surging crowd of pedestrians, and at the stream of\r\ncarriages, as a traveller might who has lost his way in a strange\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs he had completed his thirty years of obligatory service that year, on\r\nthe first of January, he had had the cross of the Legion of Honor\r\nbestowed upon him, which, in the semi-military public offices, is a\r\nrecompense for the miserable slavery\xe2\x80\x94the official phrase is, loyal\r\nservices\xe2\x80\x94of unfortunate convicts who are riveted to their desk. That\r\nunexpected dignity gave him a high and new idea of his own capacities,\r\nand altogether changed him. He immediately left off wearing light\r\ntrousers and fancy waistcoats, and wore black trousers and long coats,\r\non which his ribbon, which was very broad, showed off better. He got\r\nshaved every morning, manicured his nails more carefully, changed his\r\nlinen every two days, from a legitimate sense of what was proper, and\r\nout of respect for the national Order, of which he formed a part, and\r\nfrom that day he was another Caravan, scrupulously clean, majestic and\r\ncondescending.\r\n\r\nAt home, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy cross,\xe2\x80\x9d at every moment, and he had become so\r\nproud of it, that he could not bear to see men wearing any other ribbon\r\nin their button-holes. He became especially angry on seeing strange\r\norders: \xe2\x80\x9cWhich nobody ought to be allowed to wear in France,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nbore Chenet a particular grudge, as he met him on a tram-car every\r\nevening, wearing a decoration of one kind or another, white, blue,\r\norange, or green.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the two men, from the Arc de Triomphe to Neuilly,\r\nwas always the same, and on that day they discussed, first of all,\r\nvarious local abuses which disgusted them both, and the Mayor of Neuilly\r\nreceived his full share of their censure. Then, as invariably happens in\r\nthe company of medical men, Caravan began to enlarge on the chapter of\r\nillness, as in that manner, he hoped to obtain a little gratuitous\r\nadvice, if he was careful not to show his hand. His mother had been\r\ncausing him no little anxiety for some time; she had frequent and\r\nprolonged fainting fits, and, although she was ninety, she would not\r\ntake care of herself.\r\n\r\nCaravan grew quite tender-hearted when he mentioned her great age, and\r\nmore than once asked Doctor Chenet, emphasizing the word doctor\xe2\x80\x94although\r\nhe was not fully qualified, being only an Offcier de Sante\xe2\x80\x94whether he\r\nhad often met anyone as old as that. And he rubbed his hands with\r\npleasure; not, perhaps, that he cared very much about seeing the good\r\nwoman last forever here on earth, but because the long duration of his\r\nmother's life was, as it were an earnest of old age for himself, and he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my family, we last long, and I am sure that, unless I meet with an\r\naccident, I shall not die until I am very old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at him with pity, and glanced for a moment at his\r\nneighbor's red face, his short, thick neck, his \xe2\x80\x9ccorporation,\xe2\x80\x9d as Chenet\r\ncalled it to himself, his two fat, flabby legs, and the apoplectic\r\nrotundity of the old official; and raising the white Panama hat from his\r\nhead, he said with a snigger:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure of that, old fellow; your mother is as tough as nails,\r\nand I should say that your life is not a very good one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis rather upset Caravan, who did not speak again until the tram put\r\nthem down at their destination, where the two friends got out, and\r\nChenet asked his friend to have a glass of vermouth at the Cafe du\r\nGlobe, opposite, which both of them were in the habit of frequenting.\r\nThe proprietor, who was a friend of theirs, held out to them two\r\nfingers, which they shook across the bottles of the counter; and then\r\nthey joined three of their friends, who were playing dominoes, and who\r\nhad been there since midday. They exchanged cordial greetings, with the\r\nusual question: \xe2\x80\x9cAnything new?\xe2\x80\x9d And then the three players continued\r\ntheir game, and held out their hands without looking up, when the others\r\nwished them \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d and then they both went home to dinner.\r\n\r\nCaravan lived in a small two-story house in Courbevaie, near where the\r\nroads meet; the ground floor was occupied by a hair-dresser. Two bed\r\nrooms, a dining-room and a kitchen, formed the whole of their\r\napartments, and Madame Caravan spent nearly her whole time in cleaning\r\nthem up, while her daughter, Marie-Louise, who was twelve, and her son,\r\nPhillip-Auguste, were running about with all the little, dirty,\r\nmischievous brats of the neighborhood, and playing in the gutter.\r\n\r\nCaravan had installed his mother, whose avarice was notorious in the\r\nneighborhood, and who was terribly thin, in the room above them. She was\r\nalways cross, and she never passed a day without quarreling and flying\r\ninto furious tempers. She would apostrophize the neighbors, who were\r\nstanding at their own doors, the coster-mongers, the street-sweepers,\r\nand the street-boys, in the most violent language; and the latter, to\r\nhave their revenge, used to follow her at a distance when she went out,\r\nand call out rude things after her.\r\n\r\nA little servant from Normandy, who was incredibly giddy and\r\nthoughtless, performed the household work, and slept on the second floor\r\nin the same room as the old woman, for fear of anything happening to her\r\nin the night.\r\n\r\nWhen Caravan got in, his wife, who suffered from a chronic passion for\r\ncleaning, was polishing up the mahogany chairs that were scattered about\r\nthe room with a piece of flannel. She always wore cotton gloves, and\r\nadorned her head with a cap ornamented with many colored ribbons, which\r\nwas always tilted over one ear; and whenever anyone caught her\r\npolishing, sweeping, or washing, she used to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not rich; everything is very simple in my house, but cleanliness\r\nis my luxury, and that is worth quite as much as any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she was gifted with sound, obstinate, practical common sense, she led\r\nher husband in everything. Every evening during dinner, and afterwards\r\nwhen they were in their room, they talked over the business of the\r\noffice for a long time, and although she was twenty years younger than\r\nhe was, he confided everything to her as if she took the lead, and\r\nfollowed her advice in every matter.\r\n\r\nShe had never been pretty, and now she had grown ugly; in addition to\r\nthat, she was short and thin, while her careless and tasteless way of\r\ndressing herself concealed her few small feminine attractions, which\r\nmight have been brought out if she had possessed any taste in dress. Her\r\nskirts were always awry, and she frequently scratched herself, no matter\r\non what part of her person, totally indifferent as to who might see her,\r\nand so persistently, that anyone who saw her might think that she was\r\nsuffering from something like the itch. The only adornments that she\r\nallowed herself were silk ribbons, which she had in great profusion, and\r\nof various colors mixed together, in the pretentious caps which she wore\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw her husband she rose and said, as she kissed his\r\nwhiskers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you remember Potin, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fell into a chair, in consternation, for that was the fourth time on\r\nwhich he had forgotten a commission that he had promised to do for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fatality,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit is no good for me to think of it all\r\nday long, for I am sure to forget it in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as he seemed really so very sorry, she merely said, quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will think of it to-morrow, I dare say. Anything new at the\r\noffice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a great piece of news; another tinsmith has been appointed second\r\nchief clerk.\xe2\x80\x9d She became very serious, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he succeeds Ramon; this was the very post that I wanted you to have.\r\nAnd what about Ramon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe retires on his pension.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe became furious, her cap slid down on her shoulder, and she\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more to be done in that shop now. And what is the name\r\nof the new commissioner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonassot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up the Naval Year Book, which she always kept close at hand,\r\nand looked him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Bonassot-Toulon. Born in 1851. Student Commissioner in 1871. Sub-\r\nCommissioner in 1875.' Has he been to sea?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. At that\r\nquestion Caravan's looks cleared up, and he laughed until his sides\r\nshook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as Balin\xe2\x80\x94as much as Baffin, his chief.\xe2\x80\x9d And he added an old\r\noffice joke, and laughed more than ever:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not even do to send them by water to inspect the Point-du-\r\nJour, for they would be sick on the penny steamboats on the Seine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she remained as serious as if she had not heard him, and then she\r\nsaid in a low voice, as she scratched her chin:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we only had a Deputy to fall back upon. When the Chamber hears\r\neverything that is going on at the Admiralty, the Minister will be\r\nturned out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted by a terrible noise on the stairs. Marie-Louise and\r\nPhilippe-Auguste, who had just come in from the gutter, were slapping\r\neach other all the way upstairs. Their mother rushed at them furiously,\r\nand taking each of them by an arm she dragged them into the room,\r\nshaking them vigorously; but as soon as they saw their father, they\r\nrushed up to him, and he kissed them affectionately, and taking one of\r\nthem on each knee, began to talk to them.\r\n\r\nPhilippe-Auguste was an ugly, ill-kempt little brat, dirty from head to\r\nfoot, with the face of an idiot, and Marie-Louise was already like her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94spoke like her, repeated her words, and even imitated her\r\nmovements. She also asked him whether there was anything fresh at the\r\noffice, and he replied merrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend, Ramon, who comes and dines here every Sunday, is going to\r\nleave us, little one. There is a new second head-clerk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at her father, and with a precocious child's pity, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother man has been put over your head again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped laughing, and did not reply, and in order to create a\r\ndiversion, he said, addressing his wife, who was cleaning the windows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is mamma, upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Caravan left off rubbing, turned round pulled her cap up, as it\r\nhad fallen quite on to her back, and said with trembling lips:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes; let us talk about your mother, for she has made a pretty\r\nscene. Just imagine: a short time ago Madame Lebaudin, the hairdresser's\r\nwife, came upstairs to borrow a packet of starch of me, and, as I was\r\nnot at home, your mother chased her out as though she were a beggar; but\r\nI gave it to the old woman. She pretended not to hear, as she always\r\ndoes when one tells her unpleasant truths, but she is no more deaf than\r\nI am, as you know. It is all a sham, and the proof of it is, that she\r\nwent up to her own room immediately, without saying a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan, embarrassed, did not utter a word, and at that moment the\r\nlittle servant came in to announce dinner. In order to let his mother\r\nknow, he took a broom-handle, which always stood in a corner, and rapped\r\nloudly on the ceiling three times, and then they went into the dining-\r\nroom. Madame Caravan, junior, helped the soup, and waited for the old\r\nwoman, but she did not come, and as the soup was getting cold, they\r\nbegan to eat slowly, and when their plates were empty, they waited\r\nagain, and Madame Caravan, who was furious, attacked her husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does it on purpose, you know that as well as I do. But you always\r\nuphold her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot knowing which side to take, he sent Marie-Louise to fetch her\r\ngrandmother, and he sat motionless, with his eyes cast down, while his\r\nwife tapped her glass angrily with her knife. In about a minute, the\r\ndoor flew open suddenly, and the child came in again, out of breath and\r\nvery pale, and said hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandmamma has fallen on the floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan jumped up, threw his table-napkin down, and rushed upstairs,\r\nwhile his wife, who thought it was some trick of her mother-in-law's,\r\nfollowed more slowly, shrugging her shoulders, as if to express her\r\ndoubt. When they got upstairs, however, they found the old woman lying\r\nat full length in the middle of the room; and when they turned her over,\r\nthey saw that she was insensible and motionless, while her skin looked\r\nmore wrinkled and yellow than usual, her eyes were closed, her teeth\r\nclenched, and her thin body was stiff.\r\n\r\nCaravan knelt down by her, and began to moan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor mother! my poor mother!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. But the other Madame Caravan\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! She has only fainted again, that is all, and she has done it to\r\nprevent us from dining comfortably, you may be sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey put her on the bed, undressed her completely, and Caravan, his\r\nwife, and the servant began to rub her; but, in spite of their efforts,\r\nshe did not recover consciousness, so they sent Rosalie, the servant, to\r\nfetch Doctor Chenet. He lived a long way off, on the quay, going towards\r\nSuresnes, and so it was a considerable time before he arrived. He came\r\nat last, however, and, after having looked at the old woman, felt her\r\npulse, and listened for a heart beat, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan threw himself on the body, sobbing violently; he kissed his\r\nmother's rigid face, and wept so that great tears fell on the dead\r\nwoman's face like drops of water, and, naturally, Madame Caravan,\r\njunior, showed a decorous amount of grief, and uttered feeble moans as\r\nshe stood behind her husband, while she rubbed her eyes vigorously.\r\n\r\nBut, suddenly, Caravan raised himself up, with his thin hair in\r\ndisorder, and, looking very ugly in his grief, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94are you sure, doctor? Are you quite sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor stooped over the body, and, handling it with professional\r\ndexterity, as a shopkeeper might do, when showing off his goods, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, my dear friend, look at her eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised the eyelid, and the old woman's eye appeared altogether\r\nunaltered, unless, perhaps, the pupil was rather larger, and Caravan\r\nfelt a severe shock at the sight. Then Monsieur Chenet took her thin\r\narm, forced the fingers open, and said, angrily, as if he had been\r\ncontradicted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at her hand; I never make a mistake, you may be quite sure of\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan fell on the bed, and almost bellowed, while his wife, still\r\nwhimpering, did what was necessary.\r\n\r\nShe brought the night-table, on which she spread a towel and placed four\r\nwax candles on it, which she lighted; then she took a sprig of box,\r\nwhich was hanging over the chimney glass, and put it between the four\r\ncandles, in a plate, which she filled with clean water, as she had no\r\nholy water. But, after a moment's rapid reflection, she threw a pinch of\r\nsalt into the water, no doubt thinking she was performing some sort of\r\nact of consecration by doing that, and when she had finished, she\r\nremained standing motionless, and the doctor, who had been helping her,\r\nwhispered to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must take Caravan away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded assent, and, going up to her husband, who was still on his\r\nknees, sobbing, she raised him up by one arm, while Chenet took him by\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThey put him into a chair, and his wife kissed his forehead, and then\r\nbegan to lecture him. Chenet enforced her words and preached firmness,\r\ncourage, and resignation\xe2\x80\x94the very things which are always wanting in\r\nsuch overwhelming misfortunes\xe2\x80\x94and then both of them took him by the arms\r\nagain and led him out.\r\n\r\nHe was crying like a great child, with convulsive sobs; his arms hanging\r\ndown, and his legs weak, and he went downstairs without knowing what he\r\nwas doing, and moving his feet mechanically. They put him into the chair\r\nwhich he always occupied at dinner, in front of his empty soup plate.\r\nAnd there he sat, without moving, his eyes fixed on his glass, and so\r\nstupefied with grief, that he could not even think.\r\n\r\nIn a corner, Madame Caravan was talking with the doctor and asking what\r\nthe necessary formalities were, as she wanted to obtain practical\r\ninformation. At last, Monsieur Chenet, who appeared to be waiting for\r\nsomething, took up his hat and prepared to go, saying that he had not\r\ndined yet; whereupon she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you have not dined? Why, stay here, doctor; don't go. You shall\r\nhave whatever we have, for, of course, you understand that we do not\r\nfare sumptuously.\xe2\x80\x9d He made excuses and refused, but she persisted, and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cYou really must stay; at times like this, people like to have\r\nfriends near them, and, besides that, perhaps you will be able to\r\npersuade my husband to take some nourishment; he must keep up his\r\nstrength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor bowed, and, putting down his hat, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, I will accept your invitation, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave Rosalie, who seemed to have lost her head, some orders, and\r\nthen sat down, \xe2\x80\x9cto pretend to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep the doctor\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soup was brought in again, and Monsieur Chenet took two helpings.\r\nThen there came a dish of tripe, which exhaled a smell of onions, and\r\nwhich Madame Caravan made up her mind to taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is excellent,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor said, at which she smiled, and, turning to\r\nher husband, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo take a little, my poor Alfred, only just to put something in your\r\nstomach. Remember that you have got to pass the night watching by her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held out his plate, docilely, just as he would have gone to bed, if\r\nhe had been told to, obeying her in everything, without resistance and\r\nwithout reflection, and he ate; the doctor helped himself three times,\r\nwhile Madame Caravan, from time to time, fished out a large piece at the\r\nend of her fork, and swallowed it with a sort of studied indifference.\r\n\r\nWhen a salad bowl full of macaroni was brought in, the doctor said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! That is what I am very fond of.\xe2\x80\x9d And this time, Madame Caravan\r\nhelped everybody. She even filled the saucers that were being scraped by\r\nthe children, who, being left to themselves, had been drinking wine\r\nwithout any water, and were now kicking each other under the table.\r\n\r\nChenet remembered that Rossini, the composer, had been very fond of that\r\nItalian dish, and suddenly he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! that rhymes, and one could begin some lines like this:\r\n\r\nThe Maestro Rossini Was fond of macaroni.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nNobody listened to him, however. Madame Caravan, who had suddenly grown\r\nthoughtful, was thinking of all the probable consequences of the event,\r\nwhile her husband made bread pellets, which he put on the table-cloth,\r\nand looked at with a fixed, idiotic stare. As he was devoured by thirst,\r\nhe was continually raising his glass full of wine to his lips, and the\r\nconsequence was that his mind, which had been upset by the shock and\r\ngrief, seemed to become vague, and his ideas danced about as digestion\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who, meanwhile, had been drinking away steadily, was getting\r\nvisibly drunk, and Madame Caravan herself felt the reaction which\r\nfollows all nervous shocks, and was agitated and excited, and, although\r\nshe had drunk nothing but water, her head felt rather confused.\r\n\r\nPresently, Chenet began to relate stories of death that appeared comical\r\nto him. For in that suburb of Paris, that is full of people from the\r\nprovinces, one finds that indifference towards death which all peasants\r\nshow, were it even their own father or mother; that want of respect,\r\nthat unconscious brutality which is so common in the country, and so\r\nrare in Paris, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I was sent for last week to the Rue du Puteaux, and when I went, I\r\nfound the patient dead and the whole family calmly sitting beside the\r\nbed finishing a bottle of aniseed cordial, which had been bought the\r\nnight before to satisfy the dying man's fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Madame Caravan was not listening; she was continually thinking of\r\nthe inheritance, and Caravan was incapable of understanding anything\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nCoffee was presently served, and it had been made very strong to give\r\nthem courage. As every cup was well flavored with cognac, it made all\r\ntheir faces red, and confused their ideas still more. To make matters\r\nstill worse, Chenet suddenly seized the brandy bottle and poured out \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ndrop for each of them just to wash their mouths out with,\xe2\x80\x9d as he termed\r\nit, and then, without speaking any more, overcome in spite of\r\nthemselves, by that feeling of animal comfort which alcohol affords\r\nafter dinner, they slowly sipped the sweet cognac, which formed a\r\nyellowish syrup at the bottom of their cups.\r\n\r\nThe children had fallen asleep, and Rosalie carried them off to bed.\r\nCaravan, mechanically obeying that wish to forget oneself which\r\npossesses all unhappy persons, helped himself to brandy again several\r\ntimes, and his dull eyes grew bright. At last the doctor rose to go, and\r\nseizing his friend's arm, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me; a little fresh air will do you good. When one is in\r\ntrouble, one must not remain in one spot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other obeyed mechanically, put on his hat, took his stick, and went\r\nout, and both of them walked arm-in-arm towards the Seine, in the\r\nstarlight night.\r\n\r\nThe air was warm and sweet, for all the gardens in the neighborhood were\r\nfull of flowers at this season of the year, and their fragrance, which\r\nis scarcely perceptible during the day, seemed to awaken at the approach\r\nof night, and mingled with the light breezes which blew upon them in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe broad avenue with its two rows of gas lamps, that extended as far as\r\nthe Arc de Triomphe, was deserted and silent, but there was the distant\r\nroar of Paris, which seemed to have a reddish vapor hanging over it. It\r\nwas a kind of continual rumbling, which was at times answered by the\r\nwhistle of a train in the distance, travelling at full speed to the\r\nocean, through the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe fresh air on the faces of the two men rather overcame them at first,\r\nmade the doctor lose his equilibrium a little, and increased Caravan's\r\ngiddiness, from which he had suffered since dinner. He walked as if he\r\nwere in a dream; his thoughts were paralyzed, although he felt no great\r\ngrief, for he was in a state of mental torpor that prevented him from\r\nsuffering, and he even felt a sense of relief which was increased by the\r\nmildness of the night.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the bridge, they turned to the right, and got the\r\nfresh breeze from the river, which rolled along, calm and melancholy,\r\nbordered by tall poplar trees, while the stars looked as if they were\r\nfloating on the water and were moving with the current. A slight white\r\nmist that floated over the opposite banks, filled their lungs with a\r\nsensation of cold, and Caravan stopped suddenly, for he was struck by\r\nthat smell from the water which brought back old memories to his mind.\r\nFor, in his mind, he suddenly saw his mother again, in Picardy, as he\r\nhad seen her years before, kneeling in front of their door, and washing\r\nthe heaps of linen at her side in the stream that ran through their\r\ngarden. He almost fancied that he could hear the sound of the wooden\r\npaddle with which she beat the linen in the calm silence of the country,\r\nand her voice, as she called out to him: \xe2\x80\x9cAlfred, bring me some soap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he smelled that odor of running water, of the mist rising from the\r\nwet ground, that marshy smell, which he should never forget, and which\r\ncame back to him on this very evening on which his mother had died.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, seized with a feeling of despair. A sudden flash seemed to\r\nreveal to him the extent of his calamity, and that breath from the river\r\nplunged him into an abyss of hopeless grief. His life seemed cut in\r\nhalf, his youth disappeared, swallowed up by that death. All the former\r\ndays were over and done with, all the recollections of his youth had\r\nbeen swept away; for the future, there would be nobody to talk to him of\r\nwhat had happened in days gone by, of the people he had known of old, of\r\nhis own part of the country, and of his past life; that was a part of\r\nhis existence which existed no longer, and the rest might as well end\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw \xe2\x80\x9cthe mother\xe2\x80\x9d as she was when young, wearing well-worn\r\ndresses, which he remembered for such a long time that they seemed\r\ninseparable from her; he recollected her movements, the different tones\r\nof her voice, her habits, her predilections, her fits of anger, the\r\nwrinkles on her face, the movements of her thin fingers, and all her\r\nwell-known attitudes, which she would never have again, and clutching\r\nhold of the doctor, he began to moan and weep. His thin legs began to\r\ntremble, his whole stout body was shaken by his sobs, all he could say\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother, my poor mother, my poor mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his companion, who was still drunk, and who intended to finish the\r\nevening in certain places of bad repute that he frequented secretly,\r\nmade him sit down on the grass by the riverside, and left him almost\r\nimmediately, under the pretext that he had to see a patient.\r\n\r\nCaravan went on crying for some time, and when he had got to the end of\r\nhis tears, when his grief had, so to say, run out, he again felt relief,\r\nrepose and sudden tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe moon had risen, and bathed the horizon in its soft light.\r\n\r\nThe tall poplar trees had a silvery sheen on them, and the mist on the\r\nplain looked like drifting snow; the river, in which the stars were\r\nreflected, and which had a sheen as of mother-of-pearl, was gently\r\nrippled by the wind. The air was soft and sweet, and Caravan inhaled it\r\nalmost greedily, and thought that he could perceive a feeling of\r\nfreshness, of calm and of superhuman consolation pervading him.\r\n\r\nHe actually resisted that feeling of comfort and relief, and kept on\r\nsaying to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor mother, my poor mother!\xe2\x80\x9d and tried to make\r\nhimself cry, from a kind of conscientious feeling; but he could not\r\nsucceed in doing so any longer, and those sad thoughts, which had made\r\nhim sob so bitterly a shore time before, had almost passed away. In a\r\nfew moments, he rose to go home, and returned slowly, under the\r\ninfluence of that serene night, and with a heart soothed in spite of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the bridge, he saw that the last tramcar was ready to\r\nstart, and behind it were the brightly lighted windows of the Cafe du\r\nGlobe. He felt a longing to tell somebody of his loss, to excite pity,\r\nto make himself interesting. He put on a woeful face, pushed open the\r\ndoor, and went up to the counter, where the landlord still was. He had\r\ncounted on creating a sensation, and had hoped that everybody would get\r\nup and come to him with outstretched hands, and say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what is the\r\nmatter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d But nobody noticed his disconsolate face, so he rested\r\nhis two elbows on the counter, and, burying his face in his hands, he\r\nmurmured: \xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu! Mon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord looked at him and said: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill, Monsieur Caravan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut my mother has just died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d the other exclaimed, and as a customer at the other end of the\r\nestablishment asked for a glass of Bavarian beer, he went to attend to\r\nhim, leaving Caravan dumfounded at his want of sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe three domino players were sitting at the same table which they had\r\noccupied before dinner, totally absorbed in their game, and Caravan went\r\nup to them, in search of pity, but as none of them appeared to notice\r\nhim he made up his mind to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great misfortune has happened to me since I was here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAll three slightly raised their heads at the same instant, but keeping\r\ntheir eyes fixed on the pieces which they held in their hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother has just died\xe2\x80\x9d; whereupon one of them said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d with that false air of sorrow which indifferent people\r\nassume. Another, who could not find anything to say, emitted a sort of\r\nsympathetic whistle, shaking his head at the same time, and the third\r\nturned to the game again, as if he were saying to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIs that\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan had expected some of these expressions that are said to \xe2\x80\x9ccome\r\nfrom the heart,\xe2\x80\x9d and when he saw how his news was received, he left the\r\ntable, indignant at their calmness at their friend's sorrow, although\r\nthis sorrow had stupefied him so that he scarcely felt it any longer.\r\nWhen he got home his wife was waiting for him in her nightgown, and\r\nsitting in a low chair by the open window, still thinking of the\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndress yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe can go on talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his head, and looking at the ceiling, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94there is nobody upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Rosalie is with her, and you can go and take her\r\nplace at three o'clock in the morning, when you have had some sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only partially undressed, however, so as to be ready for anything\r\nthat might happen, and after tying a silk handkerchief round his head,\r\nhe lay down to rest, and for some time neither of them spoke. Madame\r\nCaravan was thinking.\r\n\r\nHer nightcap was adorned with a red bow, and was pushed rather to one\r\nside, as was the way with all the caps she wore, and presently she\r\nturned towards him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know whether your mother made a will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I do not think so. No, I am sure that she did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife looked at him, and she said, in a low, angry tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call that infamous; here we have been wearing ourselves out for ten\r\nyears in looking after her, and have boarded and lodged her! Your sister\r\nwould not have done so much for her, nor I either, if I had known how I\r\nwas to be rewarded! Yes, it is a disgrace to her memory! I dare say that\r\nyou will tell me that she paid us, but one cannot pay one's children in\r\nready money for what they do; that obligation is recognized after death;\r\nat any rate, that is how honorable people act. So I have had all my\r\nworry and trouble for nothing! Oh, that is nice! that is very nice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Caravan, who was almost distracted, kept on repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, my dear, please, please be quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe grew calmer by degrees, and, resuming her usual voice and manner,\r\nshe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must let your sister know to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we must; I had forgotten all about it; I will send her a\r\ntelegram the first thing in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, like a woman who had foreseen everything; \xe2\x80\x9cno, do not\r\nsend it before ten or eleven o'clock, so that we may have time to turn\r\nround before she comes. It does not take more than two hours to get here\r\nfrom Charenton, and we can say that you lost your head from grief. If we\r\nlet her know in the course of the day, that will be soon enough, and\r\nwill give us time to look round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan put his hand to his forehead, and, in the came timid voice in\r\nwhich he always spoke of his chief, the very thought of whom made him\r\ntremble, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must let them know at the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cOn occasions like this, it is always excusable to\r\nforget. Take my advice, and don't let him know; your chief will not be\r\nable to say anything to you, and you will put him in a nice fix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, that I shall, and he will be in a terrible rage, too, when he\r\nnotices my absence. Yes, you are right; it is a capital idea, and when I\r\ntell him that my mother is dead, he will be obliged to hold his tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he rubbed his hands in delight at the joke, when he thought of his\r\nchief's face; while upstairs lay the body of the dead old woman, with\r\nthe servant asleep beside it.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Caravan grew thoughtful, as if she were preoccupied by\r\nsomething which she did not care to mention, and at last she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother had given you her clock, had she not\xe2\x80\x94the girl playing at\r\ncup and ball?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought for a moment, and then replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; she said to me (but it was a long time ago, when she first\r\ncame here): 'I shall leave the clock to you, if you look after me\r\nwell.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Caravan was reassured, and regained her serenity, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you must go and fetch it out of her room, for if we get\r\nyour sister here, she will prevent us from taking it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat made her angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly think so; once it is in our possession, she will know\r\nnothing at all about where it came from; it belongs to us. It is just\r\nthe same with the chest of drawers with the marble top, that is in her\r\nroom; she gave it me one day when she was in a good temper. We will\r\nbring it down at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan, however, seemed incredulous, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, it is a great responsibility!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned on him furiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Indeed! Will you never change? You would let your children die of\r\nhunger, rather than make a move. Does not that chest of drawers belong\r\nto us, as she gave it to me? And if your sister is not satisfied, let\r\nher tell me so, me! I don't care a straw for your sister. Come, get up,\r\nand we will bring down what your mother gave us, immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrembling and vanquished, he got out of bed and began to put on his\r\ntrousers, but she stopped him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worth while to dress yourself; your underwear is quite\r\nenough. I mean to go as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both left the room in their night clothes, went upstairs quite\r\nnoiselessly, opened the door and went into the room, where the four\r\nlighted tapers and the plate with the sprig of box alone seemed to be\r\nwatching the old woman in her rigid repose, for Rosalie, who was lying\r\nback in the easy chair with her legs stretched out, her hands folded in\r\nher lap, and her head on one side, was also quite motionless, and was\r\nsnoring with her mouth wide open.\r\n\r\nCaravan took the clock, which was one of those grotesque objects that\r\nwere produced so plentifully under the Empire. A girl in gilt bronze was\r\nholding a cup and ball, and the ball formed the pendulum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive that to me,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife said, \xe2\x80\x9cand take the marble slab off the\r\nchest of drawers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put the marble slab on his shoulder with considerable effort, and\r\nthey left the room. Caravan had to stoop in the doorway, and trembled as\r\nhe went downstairs, while his wife walked backwards, so as to light him,\r\nand held the candlestick in one hand, carrying the clock under the other\r\narm.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in their own room, she heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have got over the worst part of the job,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cso now let us\r\ngo and fetch the other things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the bureau drawers were full of the old woman's wearing apparel,\r\nwhich they must manage to hide somewhere, and Madame Caravan soon\r\nthought of a plan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and get that wooden packing case in the vestibule; it is hardly\r\nworth anything, and we may just as well put it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when he had brought it upstairs they began to fill it. One by one\r\nthey took out all the collars, cuffs, chemises, caps, all the well-worn\r\nthings that had belonged to the poor woman lying there behind them, and\r\narranged them methodically in the wooden box in such a manner as to\r\ndeceive Madame Braux, the deceased woman's other child, who would be\r\ncoming the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished, they first of all carried the bureau drawers\r\ndownstairs, and the remaining portion afterwards, each of them holding\r\nan end, and it was some time before they could make up their minds where\r\nit would stand best; but at last they decided upon their own room,\r\nopposite the bed, between the two windows, and as soon as it was in its\r\nplace Madame Caravan filled it with her own things. The clock was placed\r\non the chimney-piece in the dining-room, and they looked to see what the\r\neffect was, and were both delighted with it and agreed that nothing\r\ncould be better. Then they retired, she blew out the candle, and soon\r\neverybody in the house was asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight when. Caravan opened his eyes again. His mind was\r\nrather confused when he woke up, and he did not clearly remember what\r\nhad happened for a few minutes; when he did, he felt a weight at his\r\nheart, and jumped out of bed, almost ready to cry again.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to the room overhead, where Rosalie was still sleeping in\r\nthe same position as the night before, not having awakened once. He sent\r\nher to do her work, put fresh tapers in the place of those that had\r\nburnt out, and then he looked at his mother, revolving in his brain\r\nthose apparently profound thoughts, those religious and philosophical\r\ncommonplaces which trouble people of mediocre intelligence in the\r\npresence of death.\r\n\r\nBut, as his wife was calling him, he went downstairs. She had written\r\nout a list of what had to be done during the morning, and he was\r\nhorrified when he saw the memorandum:\r\n\r\n1. Report the death at the mayor's office. 2. See the doctor who had\r\nattended her. 3. Order the coffin. 4. Give notice at the church. 5. Go\r\nto the undertaker. 6. Order the notices of her death at the printer's.\r\n7. Go to the lawyer. 8. Telegraph the news to all the family.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, there were a number of small commissions; so he took\r\nhis hat and went out. As the news had spread abroad, Madame Caravan's\r\nfemale friends and neighbors soon began to come in and begged to be\r\nallowed to see the body. There had been a scene between husband and wife\r\nat the hairdresser's on the ground floor about the matter, while a\r\ncustomer was being shaved. The wife, who was knitting steadily, said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there is one less, and as great a miser as one ever meets with. I\r\ncertainly did not care for her; but, nevertheless, I must go and have a\r\nlook at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe husband, while lathering his patient's chin, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is another\r\nqueer fancy! Nobody but a woman would think of such a thing. It is not\r\nenough for them to worry you during life, but they cannot even leave you\r\nat peace when you are dead:\xe2\x80\x9d But his wife, without being in the least\r\ndisconcerted, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThe feeling is stronger than I am, and I must\r\ngo. It has been on me since the morning. If I were not to see her, I\r\nshould think about it all my life; but when I have had a good look at\r\nher, I shall be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knight of the razor shrugged his shoulders and remarked in a low\r\nvoice to the gentleman whose cheek he was scraping: \xe2\x80\x9cI just ask you,\r\nwhat sort of ideas do you think these confounded females have? I should\r\nnot amuse myself by going to see a corpse!\xe2\x80\x9d But his wife had heard him\r\nand replied very quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is so, it is so.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, putting\r\nher knitting on the counter, she went upstairs to the first floor, where\r\nshe met two other neighbors, who had just come, and who were discussing\r\nthe event with Madame Caravan, who was giving them the details, and they\r\nall went together to the death chamber. The four women went in softly,\r\nand, one after the other, sprinkled the bed clothes with the salt water,\r\nknelt down, made the sign of the cross while they mumbled a prayer. Then\r\nthey rose from their knees and looked for some time at the corpse with\r\nround, wide-open eyes and mouths partly open, while the daughter-in-law\r\nof the dead woman, with her handkerchief to her face, pretended to be\r\nsobbing piteously.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned about to walk away whom should she perceive standing\r\nclose to the door but Marie-Louise and Philippe-Auguste, who were\r\ncuriously taking stock of all that was going on. Then, forgetting her\r\npretended grief, she threw herself upon them with uplifted hands, crying\r\nout in a furious voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you get out of this, you horrid brats!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, going upstairs again with another contingent of\r\nneighbors, she prayed, wept profusely, performed all her duties, and\r\nfound once more her two children, who had followed her upstairs. She\r\nagain boxed their ears soundly, but the next time she paid no heed to\r\nthem, and at each fresh arrival of visitors the two urchins always\r\nfollowed in the wake, kneeling down in a corner and imitating slavishly\r\neverything they saw their mother do.\r\n\r\nWhen the afternoon came the crowds of inquisitive people began to\r\ndiminish, and soon there were no more visitors. Madame Caravan,\r\nreturning to her own apartments, began to make the necessary\r\npreparations for the funeral ceremony, and the deceased was left alone.\r\n\r\nThe window of the room was open. A torrid heat entered, along with\r\nclouds of dust; the flames of the four candles were flickering beside\r\nthe immobile corpse, and upon the cloth which covered the face, the\r\nclosed eyes, the two stretched-out hands, small flies alighted, came,\r\nwent and careered up and down incessantly, being the only companions of\r\nthe old woman for the time being.\r\n\r\nMarie-Louise and Philippe-Auguste, however, had now left the house and\r\nwere running up and down the street. They were soon surrounded by their\r\nplaymates, by little girls especially, who were older and who were much\r\nmore interested in all the mysteries of life, asking questions as if\r\nthey were grown people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your grandmother is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, she died yesterday evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does a dead person look like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Marie began to explain, telling all about the candles, the sprig of\r\nbox and the face of the corpse. It was not long before great curiosity\r\nwas aroused in the minds of all the children, and they asked to be\r\nallowed to go upstairs to look at the departed.\r\n\r\nMarie-Louise at once organized a first expedition, consisting of five\r\ngirls and two boys\xe2\x80\x94the biggest and the most courageous. She made them\r\ntake off their shoes so that they might not be discovered. The troupe\r\nfiled into the house and mounted the stairs as stealthily as an army of\r\nmice.\r\n\r\nOnce in the chamber, the little girl, imitating her mother, regulated\r\nthe ceremony. She solemnly walked in advance of her comrades, went down\r\non her knees, made the sign of the cross, moved her lips as in prayer,\r\nrose, sprinkled the bed, and while the children, all crowded together,\r\nwere approaching\xe2\x80\x94frightened and curious and eager to look at the face\r\nand hands of the deceased\xe2\x80\x94she began suddenly to simulate sobbing and to\r\nbury her eyes in her little handkerchief. Then, becoming instantly\r\nconsoled, on thinking of the other children who were downstairs waiting\r\nat the door, she ran downstairs followed by the rest, returning in a\r\nminute with another group, then a third; for all the little ragamuffins\r\nof the countryside, even to the little beggars in rags, had congregated\r\nin order to participate in this new pleasure; and each time she repeated\r\nher mother's grimaces with absolute perfection.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, she became tired. Some game or other drew the\r\nchildren away from the house, and the old grandmother was left alone,\r\nforgotten suddenly by everybody.\r\n\r\nThe room was growing dark, and upon the dry and rigid features of the\r\ncorpse the fitful flames of the candles cast patches of light.\r\n\r\nTowards 8 o'clock Caravan ascended to the chamber of death, closed the\r\nwindows and renewed the candles. He was now quite composed on entering\r\nthe room, accustomed already to regard the corpse as though it had been\r\nthere for months. He even went the length of declaring that, as yet,\r\nthere were no signs of decomposition, making this remark just at the\r\nmoment when he and his wife were about to sit down at table. \xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe responded, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is now stark and stiff; she will keep for a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soup was eaten in silence. The children, who had been left to\r\nthemselves all day, now worn out by fatigue, were sleeping soundly on\r\ntheir chairs, and nobody ventured to break the silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the flame of the lamp went down. Madame Caravan immediately\r\nturned up the wick, a hollow sound ensued, and the light went out. They\r\nhad forgotten to buy oil. To send for it now to the grocer's would keep\r\nback the dinner, and they began to look for candles, but none were to be\r\nfound except the tapers which had been placed upon the table upstairs in\r\nthe death chamber.\r\n\r\nMadame Caravan, always prompt in her decisions, quickly despatched\r\nMarie-Louise to fetch two, and her return was awaited in total darkness.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps of the girl who had ascended the stairs were distinctly\r\nheard. There was silence for a few seconds and then the child descended\r\nprecipitately. She threw open the door and in a choking voice murmured:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! papa, grandmamma is dressing herself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan bounded to his feet with such precipitance that his chair fell\r\nover against the wall. He stammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cYou say? . . . . What are you\r\nsaying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Marie-Louise, gasping with emotion, repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cGrand\xe2\x80\x94grand\r\n\xe2\x80\x94grandmamma is putting on her clothes, she is coming downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaravan rushed boldly up the staircase, followed by his wife,\r\ndumfounded; but he came to a standstill before the door of the second\r\nfloor, overcome with terror, not daring to enter. What was he going to\r\nsee? Madame Caravan, more courageous, turned the handle of the door and\r\nstepped forward into the room.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was standing up. In awakening from her lethargic sleep,\r\nbefore even regaining full consciousness, in turning upon her side and\r\nraising herself on her elbow, she had extinguished three of the candles\r\nwhich burned near the bed. Then, gaining strength, she got off the bed\r\nand began to look for her clothes. The absence of her chest of drawers\r\nhad at first worried her, but, after a little, she had succeeded in\r\nfinding her things at the bottom of the wooden box, and was now quietly\r\ndressing. She emptied the plateful of water, replaced the sprig of box\r\nbehind the looking-glass, and arranged the chairs in their places, and\r\nwas ready to go downstairs when there appeared before her her son and\r\ndaughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nCaravan rushed forward, seized her by the hands, embraced her with tears\r\nin his eyes, while his wife, who was behind him, repeated in a\r\nhypocritical tone of voice: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a blessing! oh, what a blessing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the old woman, without being at all moved, without even appearing to\r\nunderstand, rigid as a statue, and with glazed eyes, simply asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\ndinner soon be ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stammered out, not knowing what he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, mother, we have been waiting for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with an alacrity unusual in him, he took her arm, while Madame\r\nCaravan, the younger, seized the candle and lighted them downstairs,\r\nwalking backwards in front of them, step by step, just as she had done\r\nthe previous night for her husband, who was carrying the marble.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the first floor, she almost ran against people who were\r\nascending the stairs. It was the Charenton family, Madame Braux,\r\nfollowed by her husband.\r\n\r\nThe wife, tall and stout, with a prominent stomach, opened wide her\r\nterrified eyes and was ready to make her escape. The husband, a\r\nsocialist shoemaker, a little hairy man, the perfect image of a monkey,\r\nmurmured quite unconcerned: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what next? Is she resurrected?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as Madame Caravan recognized them, she made frantic gestures to\r\nthem; then, speaking aloud, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here you are! What a\r\npleasant surprise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Madame Braux, dumfounded, understood nothing. She responded in a low\r\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was your telegram that brought us; we thought that all was\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer husband, who was behind her, pinched her to make her keep silent. He\r\nadded with a sly laugh, which his thick beard concealed: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very\r\nkind of you to invite us here. We set out post haste,\xe2\x80\x9d which remark\r\nshowed the hostility which had for a long time reigned between the\r\nhouseholds. Then, just as the old woman reached the last steps, he\r\npushed forward quickly and rubbed his hairy face against her cheeks,\r\nshouting in her ear, on account of her deafness: \xe2\x80\x9cHow well you look,\r\nmother; sturdy as usual, hey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Braux, in her stupefaction at seeing the old woman alive, whom\r\nthey all believed to be dead, dared not even embrace her; and her\r\nenormous bulk blocked up the passageway and hindered the others from\r\nadvancing. The old woman, uneasy and suspicious, but without speaking,\r\nlooked at everyone around her; and her little gray eyes, piercing and\r\nhard, fixed themselves now on one and now on the other, and they were so\r\nfull of meaning that the children became frightened.\r\n\r\nCaravan, to explain matters, said: \xe2\x80\x9cShe has been somewhat ill, but she\r\nis better now; quite well, indeed, are you not, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the good woman, continuing to walk, replied in a husky voice, as\r\nthough it came from a distance: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was syncope. I heard you all the\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn embarrassing silence followed. They entered the dining-room, and in a\r\nfew minutes all sat down to an improvised dinner.\r\n\r\nOnly M. Braux had retained his self-possession. His gorilla features\r\ngrinned wickedly, while he let fall some words of double meaning which\r\npainfully disconcerted everyone.\r\n\r\nBut the door bell kept ringing every second, and Rosalie, distracted,\r\ncame to call Caravan, who rushed out, throwing down his napkin. His\r\nbrother-in-law even asked him whether it was not one of his reception\r\ndays, to which he stammered out in answer: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, only a few packages;\r\nnothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA parcel was brought in, which he began to open carelessly, and the\r\nmourning announcements with black borders appeared unexpectedly.\r\nReddening up to the very eyes, he closed the package hurriedly and\r\npushed it under his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nHis mother had not seen it! She was looking intently at her clock which\r\nstood on the mantelpiece, and the embarrassment increased in midst of a\r\ndead silence. Turning her wrinkled face towards her daughter, the old\r\nwoman, in whose eyes gleamed malice, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOn Monday you must take me\r\naway from here, so that I can see your little girl. I want so much to\r\nsee her.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Braux, her features all beaming, exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nmother, that I will,\xe2\x80\x9d while Madame Caravan, the younger, who had turned\r\npale, was ready to faint with annoyance. The two men, however, gradually\r\ndrifted into conversation and soon became embroiled in a political\r\ndiscussion. Braux maintained the most revolutionary and communistic\r\ndoctrines, his eyes glowing, and gesticulating and throwing about his\r\narms. \xe2\x80\x9cProperty, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis a robbery perpetrated on the working\r\nclasses; the land is the common property of every man; hereditary rights\r\nare an infamy and a disgrace.\xe2\x80\x9d But here he suddenly stopped, looking as\r\nif he had just said something foolish, then added in softer tones: \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthis is not the proper moment to discuss such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was opened and Dr. Chenet appeared. For a moment he seemed\r\nbewildered, but regaining his usual smirking expression of countenance,\r\nhe jauntily approached the old woman and said: \xe2\x80\x9cAha! mamma; you are\r\nbetter to-day. Oh! I never had any doubt but you would come round again;\r\nin fact, I said to myself as I was mounting the staircase, 'I have an\r\nidea that I shall find the old lady on her feet once more';\xe2\x80\x9d and as he\r\npatted her gently on the back: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! she is as solid as the Pont-Neuf,\r\nshe will bury us all; see if she does not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down, accepted the coffee that was offered him, and soon began to\r\njoin in the conversation of the two men, backing up Braux, for he\r\nhimself had been mixed up in the Commune.\r\n\r\nThe old woman, now feeling herself fatigued, wished to retire. Caravan\r\nrushed forward. She looked him steadily in the eye and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou, you\r\nmust carry my clock and chest of drawers upstairs again without a\r\nmoment's delay.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, gasping; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, I will do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe old woman then took the arm of her daughter and withdrew from the\r\nroom. The two Caravans remained astounded, silent, plunged in the\r\ndeepest despair, while Braux rubbed his hands and sipped his coffee\r\ngleefully.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Madame Caravan, consumed with rage, rushed at him, exclaiming:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a thief, a footpad, a cur! I would spit in your face! I\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n\xe2\x80\x94would\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She could find nothing further to say, suffocating as she was\r\nwith rage, while he went on sipping his coffee with a smile.\r\n\r\nHis wife returning just then, Madame Caravan attacked her sister-in-law,\r\nand the two women\xe2\x80\x94the one with her enormous bulk, the other epileptic\r\nand spare, with changed voices and trembling hands flew at one another\r\nwith words of abuse.\r\n\r\nChenet and Braux now interposed, and the latter, taking his better half\r\nby the shoulders, pushed her out of the door before him, shouting: \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\non, you slut; you talk too much\xe2\x80\x9d; and the two were heard in the street\r\nquarrelling until they disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nM. Chenet also took his departure, leaving the Caravans alone, face to\r\nface. The husband fell back on his chair, and with the cold sweat\r\nstanding out in beads on his temples, murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say to my\r\nchief to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBESIDE SCHOPENHAUER'S CORPSE\r\n\r\nHe was slowly dying, as consumptives die. I saw him each day, about two\r\no'clock, sitting beneath the hotel windows on a bench in the promenade,\r\nlooking out on the calm sea. He remained for some time without moving,\r\nin the heat of the sun, gazing mournfully at the Mediterranean. Every\r\nnow and then, he cast a glance at the lofty mountains with beclouded\r\nsummits that shut in Mentone; then, with a very slow movement, he would\r\ncross his long legs, so thin that they seemed like two bones, around\r\nwhich fluttered the cloth of his trousers, and he would open a book,\r\nalways the same book. And then he did not stir any more, but read on,\r\nread on with his eye and his mind; all his wasting body seemed to read,\r\nall his soul plunged, lost, disappeared, in this book, up to the hour\r\nwhen the cool air made him cough a little. Then, he got up and reentered\r\nthe hotel.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall German, with fair beard, who breakfasted and dined in his\r\nown room, and spoke to nobody.\r\n\r\nA vague, curiosity attracted me to him. One day, I sat down by his side,\r\nhaving taken up a book, too, to keep up appearances, a volume of\r\nMusset's poems.\r\n\r\nAnd I began to look through \xe2\x80\x9cRolla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, my neighbor said to me, in good French:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know German, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for that. Since chance has thrown us side by side, I could\r\nhave lent you, I could have shown you, an inestimable thing\xe2\x80\x94this book\r\nwhich I hold in my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a copy of my master, Schopenhauer, annotated with his own hand.\r\nAll the margins, as you may see, are covered with his handwriting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took the book from him reverently, and I gazed at these forms\r\nincomprehensible to me, but which revealed the immortal thoughts of the\r\ngreatest shatterer of dreams who had ever dwelt on earth.\r\n\r\nAnd Musset's verses arose in my memory:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou found out, Voltaire, that it is bliss to die, And does thy\r\nhideous smile over thy bleached bones fly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd involuntarily I compared the childish sarcasm, the religious sarcasm\r\nof Voltaire with the irresistible irony of the German philosopher whose\r\ninfluence is henceforth ineffaceable.\r\n\r\nLet us protest and let us be angry, let us be indignant, or let us be\r\nenthusiastic, Schopenhauer has marked humanity with the seal of his\r\ndisdain and of his disenchantment.\r\n\r\nA disabused pleasure-seeker, he overthrew beliefs, hopes, poetic ideals\r\nand chimeras, destroyed the aspirations, ravaged the confidence of\r\nsouls, killed love, dragged down the chivalrous worship of women,\r\ncrushed the illusions of hearts, and accomplished the most gigantic task\r\never attempted by scepticism. He spared nothing with his mocking spirit,\r\nand exhausted everything. And even to-day those who execrate him seem to\r\ncarry in their own souls particles of his thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, then, you were intimately acquainted with Schopenhauer?\xe2\x80\x9d I said to\r\nthe German.\r\n\r\nHe smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp to the time of his death, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he spoke to me about the philosopher and told me about the almost\r\nsupernatural impression which this strange being made on all who came\r\nnear him.\r\n\r\nHe gave me an account of the interview of the old iconoclast with a\r\nFrench politician, a doctrinaire Republican, who wanted to get a glimpse\r\nof this man, and found him in a noisy tavern, seated in the midst of his\r\ndisciples, dry, wrinkled, laughing with an unforgettable laugh,\r\nattacking and tearing to pieces ideas and beliefs with a single word, as\r\na dog tears with one bite of his teeth the tissues with which he plays.\r\n\r\nHe repeated for me the comment of this Frenchman as he went away,\r\nastonished and terrified: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had spent an hour with the\r\ndevil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had, indeed, monsieur, a frightful smile, which terrified us even\r\nafter his death. I can tell you an anecdote about it that is not\r\ngenerally known, if it would interest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he began, in a languid voice, interrupted by frequent fits of\r\ncoughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchopenhauer had just died, and it was arranged that we should watch,\r\nin turn, two by two, till morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was lying in a large apartment, very simple, vast and gloomy. Two\r\nwax candles were burning on the stand by the bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was midnight when I went on watch, together with one of our\r\ncomrades. The two friends whom we replaced had left the apartment, and\r\nwe came and sat down at the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe face was not changed. It was laughing. That pucker which we knew so\r\nwell lingered still around the corners of the lips, and it seemed to us\r\nthat he was about to open his eyes, to move and to speak. His thought,\r\nor rather his thoughts, enveloped us. We felt ourselves more than ever\r\nin the atmosphere of his genius, absorbed, possessed by him. His\r\ndomination seemed to be even more sovereign now that he was dead. A\r\nfeeling of mystery was blended with the power of this incomparable\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bodies of these men disappear, but they themselves remain; and in\r\nthe night which follows the cessation of their heart's pulsation I\r\nassure you, monsieur, they are terrifying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in hushed tones we talked about him, recalling to mind certain\r\nsayings, certain formulas of his, those startling maxims which are like\r\njets of flame flung, in a few words, into the darkness of the Unknown\r\nLife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It seems to me that he is going to speak,' said my comrade. And we\r\nstared with uneasiness bordering on fear at the motionless face, with\r\nits eternal laugh. Gradually, we began to feel ill at ease, oppressed,\r\non the point of fainting. I faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I don't know what is the matter with me, but, I assure you I am not\r\nwell.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at that moment we noticed that there was an unpleasant odor from\r\nthe corpse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, my comrade suggested that we should go into the adjoining room,\r\nand leave the door open; and I assented to his proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took one of the wax candles which burned on the stand, and I left the\r\nsecond behind. Then we went and sat down at the other end of the\r\nadjoining apartment, in such a position that we could see the bed and\r\nthe corpse, clearly revealed by the light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he still held possession of us. One would have said that his\r\nimmaterial essence, liberated, free, all-powerful and dominating, was\r\nflitting around us. And sometimes, too, the dreadful odor of the\r\ndecomposed body came toward us and penetrated us, sickening and\r\nindefinable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly a shiver passed through our bones: a sound, a slight sound,\r\ncame from the death-chamber. Immediately we fixed our glances on him,\r\nand we saw, yes, monsieur, we saw distinctly, both of us, something\r\nwhite pass across the bed, fall on the carpet, and vanish under an\r\narmchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were on our feet before we had time to think of anything, distracted\r\nby stupefying terror, ready to run away. Then we stared at each other.\r\nWe were horribly pale. Our hearts throbbed fiercely enough to have\r\nraised the clothing on our chests. I was the first to speak:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Did you see?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, I saw.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Can it be that he is not dead?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why, when the body is putrefying?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What are we to do?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy companion said in a hesitating tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'We must go and look.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took our wax candle and entered first, glancing into all the dark\r\ncorners in the large apartment. Nothing was moving now, and I approached\r\nthe bed. But I stood transfixed with stupor and fright:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchopenhauer was no longer laughing! He was grinning in a horrible\r\nfashion, with his lips pressed together and deep hollows in his cheeks.\r\nI stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He is not dead!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the terrible odor ascended to my nose and stifled me. And I no\r\nlonger moved, but kept staring fixedly at him, terrified as if in the\r\npresence of an apparition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my companion, having seized the other wax candle, bent forward.\r\nNext, he touched my arm without uttering a word. I followed his glance,\r\nand saw on the ground, under the armchair by the side of the bed,\r\nstanding out white on the dark carpet, and open as if to bite,\r\nSchopenhauer's set of artificial teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work of decomposition, loosening the jaws, had made it jump out of\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was really frightened that day, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as the sun was sinking toward the glittering sea, the consumptive\r\nGerman rose from his seat, gave me a parting bow, and retired into the\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 3.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS HARRIET\r\n\r\nThere were seven of us on a drag, four women and three men; one of the\r\nlatter sat on the box seat beside the coachman. We were ascending, at a\r\nsnail's pace, the winding road up the steep cliff along the coast.\r\n\r\nSetting out from Etretat at break of day in order to visit the ruins of\r\nTancarville, we were still half asleep, benumbed by the fresh air of the\r\nmorning. The women especially, who were little accustomed to these early\r\nexcursions, half opened and closed their eyes every moment, nodding\r\ntheir heads or yawning, quite insensible to the beauties of the dawn.\r\n\r\nIt was autumn. On both sides of the road stretched the bare fields,\r\nyellowed by the stubble of wheat and oats which covered the soil like a\r\nbeard that had been badly shaved. The moist earth seemed to steam. Larks\r\nwere singing high up in the air, while other birds piped in the bushes.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose at length in front of us, bright red on the plane of the\r\nhorizon, and in proportion as it ascended, growing clearer from minute\r\nto minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake itself like a\r\nyoung girl leaving her bed in her white robe of vapor. The Comte\r\nd'Etraille, who was seated on the box, cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! look! a hare!\xe2\x80\x9d and he extended his arm toward the left, pointing\r\nto a patch of clover. The animal scurried along, almost hidden by the\r\nclover, only its large ears showing. Then it swerved across a furrow,\r\nstopped, started off again at full speed, changed its course, stopped\r\nanew, uneasy, spying out every danger, uncertain what route to take,\r\nwhen suddenly it began to run with great bounds, disappearing finally in\r\na large patch of beet-root. All the men had waked up to watch the course\r\nof the animal.\r\n\r\nRene Lamanoir exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not at all gallant this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d and; regarding his neighbor,\r\nthe little Baroness de Serennes, who struggled against sleep, he said to\r\nher in a low tone: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are thinking of your husband, baroness. Reassure\r\nyourself; he will not return before Saturday, so you have still four\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered with a sleepy smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, shaking off her torpor, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, let\r\nsomebody say something to make us laugh. You, Monsieur Chenal, who have\r\nthe reputation of having had more love affairs than the Duc de\r\nRichelieu, tell us a love story in which you have played a part;\r\nanything you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeon Chenal, an old painter, who had once been very handsome, very\r\nstrong, very proud of his physique and very popular with women, took his\r\nlong white beard in his hand and smiled. Then, after a few moments'\r\nreflection, he suddenly became serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies, it will not be an amusing tale, for I am going to relate to you\r\nthe saddest love affair of my life, and I sincerely hope that none of my\r\nfriends may ever pass through a similar experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was twenty-five years of age and was pillaging along the coast of\r\nNormandy. I call 'pillaging' wandering about, with a knapsack on one's\r\nback, from inn to inn, under the pretext of making studies and sketching\r\nlandscapes. I knew nothing more enjoyable than that happy-go-lucky\r\nwandering life, in which one is perfectly free, without shackles of any\r\nkind, without care, without preoccupation, without thinking even of the\r\nmorrow. One goes in any direction one pleases, without any guide save\r\nhis fancy, without any counsellor save his eyes. One stops because a\r\nrunning brook attracts one, because the smell of potatoes frying tickles\r\none's olfactories on passing an inn. Sometimes it is the perfume of\r\nclematis which decides one in his choice or the roguish glance of the\r\nservant at an inn. Do not despise me for my affection for these rustics.\r\nThese girls have a soul as well as senses, not to mention firm cheeks\r\nand fresh lips; while their hearty and willing kisses have the flavor of\r\nwild fruit. Love is always love, come whence it may. A heart that beats\r\nat your approach, an eye that weeps when you go away are things so rare,\r\nso sweet, so precious that they must never be despised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had rendezvous in ditches full of primroses, behind the cow\r\nstable and in barns among the straw, still warm from the heat of the\r\nday. I have recollections of coarse gray cloth covering supple peasant\r\nskin and regrets for simple, frank kisses, more delicate in their\r\nunaffected sincerity than the subtle favors of charming and\r\ndistinguished women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what one loves most amid all these varied adventures is the\r\ncountry, the woods, the rising of the sun, the twilight, the moonlight.\r\nThese are, for the painter, honeymoon trips with Nature. One is alone\r\nwith her in that long and quiet association. You go to sleep in the\r\nfields, amid marguerites and poppies, and when you open your eyes in the\r\nfull glare of the sunlight you descry in the distance the little village\r\nwith its pointed clock tower which sounds the hour of noon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sit down by the side of a spring which gushes out at the foot of an\r\noak, amid a growth of tall, slender weeds, glistening with life. You go\r\ndown on your knees, bend forward and drink that cold, pellucid water\r\nwhich wets your mustache and nose; you drink it with a physical\r\npleasure, as though you kissed the spring, lip to lip. Sometimes, when\r\nyou find a deep hole along the course of these tiny brooks, you plunge\r\nin quite naked, and you feel on your skin, from head to foot, as it\r\nwere, an icy and delicious caress, the light and gentle quivering of the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are gay on the hills, melancholy on the edge of ponds, inspired\r\nwhen the sun is setting in an ocean of blood-red clouds and casts red\r\nreflections or the river. And at night, under the moon, which passes\r\nacross the vault of heaven, you think of a thousand strange things which\r\nwould never have occurred to your mind under the brilliant light of day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, in wandering through the same country where we, are this year, I\r\ncame to the little village of Benouville, on the cliff between Yport and\r\nEtretat. I came from Fecamp, following the coast, a high coast as\r\nstraight as a wall, with its projecting chalk cliffs descending\r\nperpendicularly into the sea. I had walked since early morning on the\r\nshort grass, smooth and yielding as a carpet, that grows on the edge of\r\nthe cliff. And, singing lustily, I walked with long strides, looking\r\nsometimes at the slow circling flight of a gull with its white curved\r\nwings outlined on the blue sky, sometimes at the brown sails of a\r\nfishing bark on the green sea. In short, I had passed a happy day, a day\r\nof liberty and of freedom from care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little farmhouse where travellers were lodged was pointed out to me,\r\na kind of inn, kept by a peasant woman, which stood in the centre of a\r\nNorman courtyard surrounded by a double row of beeches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving the coast, I reached the hamlet, which was hemmed in by great\r\ntrees, and I presented myself at the house of Mother Lecacheur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was an old, wrinkled and stern peasant woman, who seemed always to\r\nreceive customers under protest, with a kind of defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the month of May. The spreading apple trees covered the court\r\nwith a shower of blossoms which rained unceasingly both upon people and\r\nupon the grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said: 'Well, Madame Lecacheur, have you a room for me?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonished to find that I knew her name, she answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That depends; everything is let, but all the same I can find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn five minutes we had come to an agreement, and I deposited my bag\r\nupon the earthen floor of a rustic room, furnished with a bed, two\r\nchairs, a table and a washbowl. The room looked into the large, smoky\r\nkitchen, where the lodgers took their meals with the people of the farm\r\nand the landlady, who was a widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI washed my hands, after which I went out. The old woman was making a\r\nchicken fricassee for dinner in the large fireplace in which hung the\r\niron pot, black with smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You have travellers, then, at the present time?' said I to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe answered in an offended tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have a lady, an English lady, who has reached years of maturity. She\r\noccupies the other room.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI obtained, by means of an extra five sous a day, the privilege of\r\ndining alone out in the yard when the weather was fine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy place was set outside the door, and I was beginning to gnaw the lean\r\nlimbs of the Normandy chicken, to drink the clear cider and to munch the\r\nhunk of white bread, which was four days old but excellent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly the wooden gate which gave on the highway was opened, and a\r\nstrange lady directed her steps toward the house. She was very thin,\r\nvery tall, so tightly enveloped in a red Scotch plaid shawl that one\r\nmight have supposed she had no arms, if one had not seen a long hand\r\nappear just above the hips, holding a white tourist umbrella. Her face\r\nwas like that of a mummy, surrounded with curls of gray hair, which\r\ntossed about at every step she took and made me think, I know not why,\r\nof a pickled herring in curl papers. Lowering her eyes, she passed\r\nquickly in front of me and entered the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat singular apparition cheered me. She undoubtedly was my neighbor,\r\nthe English lady of mature age of whom our hostess had spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not see her again that day. The next day, when I had settled\r\nmyself to commence painting at the end of that beautiful valley which\r\nyou know and which extends as far as Etretat, I perceived, on lifting my\r\neyes suddenly, something singular standing on the crest of the cliff,\r\none might have said a pole decked out with flags. It was she. On seeing\r\nme, she suddenly disappeared. I reentered the house at midday for lunch\r\nand took my seat at the general table, so as to make the acquaintance of\r\nthis odd character. But she did not respond to my polite advances, was\r\ninsensible even to my little attentions. I poured out water for her\r\npersistently, I passed her the dishes with great eagerness. A slight,\r\nalmost imperceptible, movement of the head and an English word, murmured\r\nso low that I did not understand it, were her only acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ceased occupying myself with her, although she had disturbed my\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of three days I knew as much about her as did Madame\r\nLecacheur herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was called Miss Harriet. Seeking out a secluded village in which to\r\npass the summer, she had been attracted to Benouville some six months\r\nbefore and did not seem disposed to leave it. She never spoke at table,\r\nate rapidly, reading all the while a small book of the Protestant\r\npropaganda. She gave a copy of it to everybody. The cure himself had\r\nreceived no less than four copies, conveyed by an urchin to whom she had\r\npaid two sous commission. She said sometimes to our hostess abruptly,\r\nwithout preparing her in the least for the declaration:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I love the Saviour more than all. I admire him in all creation; I\r\nadore him in all nature; I carry him always in my heart.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she would immediately present the old woman with one of her tracts\r\nwhich were destined to convert the universe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn, the village she was not liked. In fact, the schoolmaster having\r\npronounced her an atheist, a kind of stigma attached to her. The cure,\r\nwho had been consulted by Madame Lecacheur, responded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'She is a heretic, but God does not wish the death of the sinner, and I\r\nbelieve her to be a person of pure morals.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese words, 'atheist,' 'heretic,' words which no one can precisely\r\ndefine, threw doubts into some minds. It was asserted, however, that\r\nthis English woman was rich and that she had passed her life in\r\ntravelling through every country in the world because her family had\r\ncast her off. Why had her family cast her off? Because of her impiety,\r\nof course!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was, in fact, one of those people of exalted principles; one of\r\nthose opinionated puritans, of which England produces so many; one of\r\nthose good and insupportable old maids who haunt the tables d'hote of\r\nevery hotel in Europe, who spoil Italy, poison Switzerland, render the\r\ncharming cities of the Mediterranean uninhabitable, carry everywhere\r\ntheir fantastic manias their manners of petrified vestals, their\r\nindescribable toilets and a certain odor of india-rubber which makes one\r\nbelieve that at night they are slipped into a rubber casing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I caught sight of one of these individuals in a hotel I fled\r\nlike the birds who see a scarecrow in a field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman, however, appeared so very singular that she did not\r\ndisplease me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Lecacheur, hostile by instinct to everything that was not\r\nrustic, felt in her narrow soul a kind of hatred for the ecstatic\r\ndeclarations of the old maid. She had found a phrase by which to\r\ndescribe her, a term of contempt that rose to her lips, called forth by\r\nI know not what confused and mysterious mental ratiocination. She said:\r\n'That woman is a demoniac.' This epithet, applied to that austere and\r\nsentimental creature, seemed to me irresistibly droll. I myself never\r\ncalled her anything now but 'the demoniac,' experiencing a singular\r\npleasure in pronouncing aloud this word on perceiving her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day I asked Mother Lecacheur: 'Well, what is our demoniac about to-\r\nday?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo which my rustic friend replied with a shocked air:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What do you think, sir? She picked up a toad which had had its paw\r\ncrushed and carried it to her room and has put it in her washbasin and\r\nbandaged it as if it were a man. If that is not profanation I should\r\nlike to know what is!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn another occasion, when walking along the shore she bought a large\r\nfish which had just been caught, simply to throw it back into the sea\r\nagain. The sailor from whom she had bought it, although she paid him\r\nhandsomely, now began to swear, more exasperated, indeed, than if she\r\nhad put her hand into his pocket and taken his money. For more than a\r\nmonth he could not speak of the circumstance without becoming furious\r\nand denouncing it as an outrage. Oh, yes! She was indeed a demoniac,\r\nthis Miss Harriet, and Mother Lecacheur must have had an inspiration in\r\nthus christening her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stable boy, who was called Sapeur, because he had served in Africa\r\nin his youth, entertained other opinions. He said with a roguish air:\r\n'She is an old hag who has seen life.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the poor woman had but known!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little kind-hearted Celeste did not wait upon her willingly, but I\r\nwas never able to understand why. Probably her only reason was that she\r\nwas a stranger, of another race; of a different tongue and of another\r\nreligion. She was, in fact, a demoniac!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe passed her time wandering about the country, adoring and seeking\r\nGod in nature. I found her one evening on her knees in a cluster of\r\nbushes. Having discovered something red through the leaves, I brushed\r\naside the branches, and Miss Harriet at once rose to her feet, confused\r\nat having been found thus, fixing on me terrified eyes like those of an\r\nowl surprised in open day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, when I was working among the rocks, I would suddenly descry\r\nher on the edge of the cliff like a lighthouse signal. She would be\r\ngazing in rapture at the vast sea glittering in the sunlight and the\r\nboundless sky with its golden tints. Sometimes I would distinguish her\r\nat the end of the valley, walking quickly with her elastic English step,\r\nand I would go toward her, attracted by I know not what, simply to see\r\nher illuminated visage, her dried-up, ineffable features, which seemed\r\nto glow with inward and profound happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would often encounter her also in the corner of a field, sitting on\r\nthe grass under the shadow of an apple tree, with her little religious\r\nbooklet lying open on her knee while she gazed out at the distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not tear myself away from that quiet country neighborhood, to\r\nwhich I was attached by a thousand links of love for its wide and\r\npeaceful landscape. I was happy in this sequestered farm, far removed\r\nfrom everything, but in touch with the earth, the good, beautiful, green\r\nearth. And\xe2\x80\x94must I avow it?\xe2\x80\x94there was, besides, a little curiosity which\r\nretained me at the residence of Mother Lecacheur. I wished to become\r\nacquainted a little with this strange Miss Harriet and to know what\r\ntranspires in the solitary souls of those wandering old English women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe became acquainted in a rather singular manner. I had just finished a\r\nstudy which appeared to me to be worth something, and so it was, as it\r\nsold for ten thousand francs fifteen years later. It was as simple,\r\nhowever, as two and two make four and was not according to academic\r\nrules. The whole right side of my canvas represented a rock, an enormous\r\nrock, covered with sea-wrack, brown, yellow and red, across which the\r\nsun poured like a stream of oil. The light fell upon the rock as though\r\nit were aflame without the sun, which was at my back, being visible.\r\nThat was all. A first bewildering study of blazing, gorgeous light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored sea, but a\r\nsea of jade, greenish, milky and solid beneath the deep-colored sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so pleased with my work that I danced from sheer delight as I\r\ncarried it back to the inn. I would have liked the whole world to see it\r\nat once. I can remember that I showed it to a cow that was browsing by\r\nthe wayside, exclaiming as I did so: 'Look at that, my old beauty; you\r\nwill not often see its like again.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had reached the house I immediately called out to Mother\r\nLecacheur, shouting with all my might:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Hullo, there! Mrs. Landlady, come here and look at this.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rustic approached and looked at my work with her stupid eyes which\r\ndistinguished nothing and could not even tell whether the picture\r\nrepresented an ox or a house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Harriet just then came home, and she passed behind me just as I\r\nwas holding out my canvas at arm's length, exhibiting it to our\r\nlandlady. The demoniac could not help but see it, for I took care to\r\nexhibit the thing in such a way that it could not escape her notice. She\r\nstopped abruptly and stood motionless, astonished. It was her rock which\r\nwas depicted, the one which she climbed to dream away her time\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe uttered a British 'Aoh,' which was at once so accentuated and so\r\nflattering that I turned round to her, smiling, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This is my latest study, mademoiselle.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe murmured rapturously, comically and tenderly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! monsieur, you understand nature as a living thing.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI colored and was more touched by that compliment than if it had come\r\nfrom a queen. I was captured, conquered, vanquished. I could have\r\nembraced her, upon my honor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took my seat at table beside her as usual. For the first time she\r\nspoke, thinking aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! I do love nature.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI passed her some bread, some water, some wine. She now accepted these\r\nwith a little smile of a mummy. I then began to talk about the scenery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the meal we rose from the table together and walked leisurely\r\nacross the courtyard; then, attracted doubtless by the fiery glow which\r\nthe setting sun cast over the surface of the sea, I opened the gate\r\nwhich led to the cliff, and we walked along side by side, as contented\r\nas two persons might be who have just learned to understand and\r\npenetrate each other's motives and feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was one of those warm, soft evenings which impart a sense of ease to\r\nflesh and spirit alike. All is enjoyment, everything charms. The balmy\r\nair, laden with the perfume of grasses and the smell of seaweed, soothes\r\nthe olfactory sense with its wild fragrance, soothes the palate with its\r\nsea savor, soothes the mind with its pervading sweetness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were now walking along the edge of the cliff, high above the\r\nboundless sea which rolled its little waves below us at a distance of a\r\nhundred metres. And we drank in with open mouth and expanded chest that\r\nfresh breeze, briny from kissing the waves, that came from the ocean and\r\npassed across our faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrapped in her plaid shawl, with a look of inspiration as she faced the\r\nbreeze, the English woman gazed fixedly at the great sun ball as it\r\ndescended toward the horizon. Far off in the distance a three-master in\r\nfull sail was outlined on the blood-red sky and a steamship, somewhat\r\nnearer, passed along, leaving behind it a trail of smoke on the horizon.\r\nThe red sun globe sank slowly lower and lower and presently touched the\r\nwater just behind the motionless vessel, which, in its dazzling\r\neffulgence, looked as though framed in a flame of fire. We saw it\r\nplunge, grow smaller and disappear, swallowed up by the ocean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Harriet gazed in rapture at the last gleams of the dying day. She\r\nseemed longing to embrace the sky, the sea, the whole landscape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe murmured: 'Aoh! I love\xe2\x80\x94I love' I saw a tear in her eye. She\r\ncontinued: 'I wish I were a little bird, so that I could mount up into\r\nthe firmament.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on the\r\ncliff, her face as red as her shawl. I should have liked to have\r\nsketched her in my album. It would have been a caricature of ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned away so as not to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI then spoke to her of painting as I would have done to a fellow\r\nartist, using the technical terms common among the devotees of the\r\nprofession. She listened attentively, eagerly seeking to divine the\r\nmeaning of the terms, so as to understand my thoughts. From time to time\r\nshe would exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! I understand, I understand. It is very interesting.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe returned home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day, on seeing me, she approached me, cordially holding out\r\nher hand; and we at once became firm friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a good creature who had a kind of soul on springs, which became\r\nenthusiastic at a bound. She lacked equilibrium like all women who are\r\nspinsters at the age of fifty. She seemed to be preserved in a pickle of\r\ninnocence, but her heart still retained something very youthful and\r\ninflammable. She loved both nature and animals with a fervor, a love\r\nlike old wine fermented through age, with a sensuous love that she had\r\nnever bestowed on men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing is certain, that the sight of a bitch nursing her puppies, a\r\nmare roaming in a meadow with a foal at its side, a bird's nest full of\r\nyoung ones, screaming, with their open mouths and their enormous heads,\r\naffected her perceptibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor, solitary, sad, wandering beings! I love you ever since I became\r\nacquainted with Miss Harriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI soon discovered that she had something she would like to tell me, but\r\ndare not, and I was amused at her timidity. When I started out in the\r\nmorning with my knapsack on my back, she would accompany me in silence\r\nas far as the end of the village, evidently struggling to find words\r\nwith which to begin a conversation. Then she would leave me abruptly and\r\nwalk away quickly with her springy step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day, however, she plucked up courage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to see how you paint pictures. Are you willing? I have\r\nbeen very curious.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she blushed as if she had said something very audacious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conducted her to the bottom of the Petit-Val, where I had begun a\r\nlarge picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe remained standing behind me, following all my gestures with\r\nconcentrated attention. Then, suddenly, fearing perhaps that she was\r\ndisturbing me, she said: 'Thank you,' and walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she soon became more friendly, and accompanied me every day, her\r\ncountenance exhibiting visible pleasure. She carried her camp stool\r\nunder her arm, not permitting me to carry it. She would remain there for\r\nhours, silent and motionless, following with her eyes the point of my\r\nbrush, in its every movement. When I obtained unexpectedly just the\r\neffect I wanted by a dash of color put on with the palette knife, she\r\ninvoluntarily uttered a little 'Ah!' of astonishment, of joy, of\r\nadmiration. She had the most tender respect for my canvases, an almost\r\nreligious respect for that human reproduction of a part of nature's work\r\ndivine. My studies appeared to her a kind of religious pictures, and\r\nsometimes she spoke to me of God, with the idea of converting me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he was a queer, good-natured being, this God of hers! He was a sort\r\nof village philosopher without any great resources and without great\r\npower, for she always figured him to herself as inconsolable over\r\ninjustices committed under his eyes, as though he were powerless to\r\nprevent them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was, however, on excellent terms with him, affecting even to be the\r\nconfidante of his secrets and of his troubles. She would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'God wills' or 'God does not will,' just like a sergeant announcing to\r\na recruit: 'The colonel has commanded.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the bottom of her heart she deplored my ignorance of the intentions\r\nof the Eternal, which she endeavored to impart to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost every day I found in my pockets, in my hat when I lifted it from\r\nthe ground, in my paintbox, in my polished shoes, standing in front of\r\nmy door in the morning, those little pious tracts which she no doubt,\r\nreceived directly from Paradise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI treated her as one would an old friend, with unaffected cordiality.\r\nBut I soon perceived that she had changed somewhat in her manner,\r\nthough, for a while, I paid little attention to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was painting, whether in my valley or in some country lane, I\r\nwould see her suddenly appear with her rapid, springy walk. She would\r\nthen sit down abruptly, out of breath, as though she had been running or\r\nwere overcome by some profound emotion. Her face would be red, that\r\nEnglish red which is denied to the people of all other countries; then,\r\nwithout any reason, she would turn ashy pale and seem about to faint\r\naway. Gradually, however, her natural color would return and she would\r\nbegin to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, without warning, she would break off in the middle of a sentence,\r\nspring up from her seat and walk away so rapidly and so strangely that I\r\nwas at my wits' ends to discover whether I had done or said anything to\r\ndisplease or wound her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI finally came to the conclusion that those were her normal manners,\r\nsomewhat modified no doubt in my honor during the first days of our\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she returned to the farm, after walking for hours on the windy\r\ncoast, her long curls often hung straight down, as if their springs had\r\nbeen broken. This had hitherto seldom given her any concern, and she\r\nwould come to dinner without embarrassment all dishevelled by her\r\nsister, the breeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now she would go to her room and arrange the untidy locks, and when\r\nI would say, with familiar gallantry, which, however, always offended\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are as beautiful as a star to-day, Miss Harriet,' a blush would\r\nimmediately rise to her cheeks, the blush of a young girl, of a girl of\r\nfifteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she would suddenly become quite reserved and cease coming to watch\r\nme paint. I thought, 'This is only a fit of temper; it will blow over.'\r\nBut it did not always blow over, and when I spoke to her she would\r\nanswer me either with affected indifference or with sullen annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe became by turns rude, impatient and nervous. I never saw her now\r\nexcept at meals, and we spoke but little. I concluded at length that I\r\nmust have offended her in some way, and, accordingly, I said to her one\r\nevening:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Miss Harriet, why is it that you do not act toward me as formerly?\r\nWhat have I done to displease you? You are causing me much pain!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe replied in a most comical tone of anger:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am just the same with you as formerly. It is not true, not true,'\r\nand she ran upstairs and shut herself up in her room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOccasionally she would look at me in a peculiar manner. I have often\r\nsaid to myself since then that those who are condemned to death must\r\nlook thus when they are informed that their last day has come. In her\r\neye there lurked a species of insanity, an insanity at once mystical and\r\nviolent; and even more, a fever, an aggravated longing, impatient and\r\nimpotent, for the unattained and unattainable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, it seemed to me there was also going on within her a struggle in\r\nwhich her heart wrestled with an unknown force that she sought to\r\nmaster, and even, perhaps, something else. But what do I know? What do I\r\nknow?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was indeed a singular revelation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor some time I had commenced to work, as soon as daylight appeared, on\r\na picture the subject of which was as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA deep ravine, enclosed, surmounted by two thickets of trees and vines,\r\nextended into the distance and was lost, submerged in that milky vapor,\r\nin that cloud like cotton down that sometimes floats over valleys at\r\ndaybreak. And at the extreme end of that heavy, transparent fog one saw,\r\nor, rather, surmised, that a couple of human beings were approaching, a\r\nhuman couple, a youth and a maiden, their arms interlaced, embracing\r\neach other, their heads inclined toward each other, their lips meeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA first ray of the sun, glistening through the branches, pierced that\r\nfog of the dawn, illuminated it with a rosy reflection just behind the\r\nrustic lovers, framing their vague shadows in a silvery background. It\r\nwas well done; yes, indeed, well done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was working on the declivity which led to the Valley of Etretat. On\r\nthis particular morning I had, by chance, the sort of floating vapor\r\nwhich I needed. Suddenly something rose up in front of me like a\r\nphantom; it was Miss Harriet. On seeing me she was about to flee. But I\r\ncalled after her, saying: 'Come here, come here, mademoiselle. I have a\r\nnice little picture for you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her my\r\nsketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time, motionless, looking\r\nat it, and suddenly she burst into tears. She wept spasmodically, like\r\nmen who have striven hard to restrain their tears, but who can do so no\r\nlonger and abandon themselves to grief, though still resisting. I sprang\r\nto my feet, moved at the sight of a sorrow I did not comprehend, and I\r\ntook her by the hand with an impulse of brusque affection, a true French\r\nimpulse which acts before it reflects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt them\r\nquiver as if all her nerves were being wrenched. Then she withdrew her\r\nhands abruptly, or, rather, snatched them away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recognized that tremor, for I had felt it, and I could not be\r\ndeceived. Ah! the love tremor of a woman, whether she be fifteen or\r\nfifty years of age, whether she be of the people or of society, goes so\r\nstraight to my heart that I never have any hesitation in understanding\r\nit!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer whole frail being had trembled, vibrated, been overcome. I knew it.\r\nShe walked away before I had time to say a word, leaving me as surprised\r\nas if I had witnessed a miracle and as troubled as if I had committed a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not go in to breakfast. I went to take a turn on the edge of the\r\ncliff, feeling that I would just as lief weep as laugh, looking on the\r\nadventure as both comic and deplorable and my position as ridiculous,\r\nbelieving her unhappy enough to go insane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked myself what I ought to do. It seemed best for me to leave the\r\nplace, and I immediately resolved to do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time and\r\nentered the farmhouse just when the soup had been served up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat down at the table as usual. Miss Harriet was there, eating away\r\nsolemnly, without speaking to any one, without even lifting her eyes.\r\nHer manner and expression were, however, the same as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited patiently till the meal had been finished, when, turning\r\ntoward the landlady, I said: 'Well, Madame Lecacheur, it will not be\r\nlong now before I shall have to take my leave of you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in her drawling\r\nvoice: 'My dear sir, what is it you say? You are going to leave us after\r\nI have become so accustomed to you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI glanced at Miss Harriet out of the corner of my eye. Her countenance\r\ndid not change in the least. But Celeste, the little servant, looked up\r\nat me. She was a fat girl, of about eighteen years of age, rosy, fresh,\r\nas strong as a horse, and possessing the rare attribute of cleanliness.\r\nI had kissed her at odd times in out-of-the-way corners, after the\r\nmanner of travellers\xe2\x80\x94nothing more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dinner being at length over, I went to smoke my pipe under the\r\napple trees, walking up and down from one end of the enclosure to the\r\nother. All the reflections which I had made during the day, the strange\r\ndiscovery of the morning, that passionate and grotesque attachment for\r\nme, the recollections which that revelation had suddenly called up,\r\nrecollections at once charming and perplexing, perhaps also that look\r\nwhich the servant had cast on me at the announcement of my departure\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese things, mixed up and combined, put me now in a reckless humor,\r\ngave me a tickling sensation of kisses on the lips and in my veins a\r\nsomething which urged me on to commit some folly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNight was coming on, casting its dark shadows under the trees, when I\r\ndescried Celeste, who had gone to fasten up the poultry yard at the\r\nother end of the enclosure. I darted toward her, running so noiselessly\r\nthat she heard nothing, and as she got up from closing the small\r\ntrapdoor by which the chickens got in and out, I clasped her in my arms\r\nand rained on her coarse, fat face a shower of kisses. She struggled,\r\nlaughing all the time, as she was accustomed to do in such\r\ncircumstances. Why did I suddenly loose my grip of her? Why did I at\r\nonce experience a shock? What was it that I heard behind me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Miss Harriet, who had come upon us, who had seen us and who\r\nstood in front of us motionless as a spectre. Then she disappeared in\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was ashamed, embarrassed, more desperate at having been thus\r\nsurprised by her than if she had caught me committing some criminal act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slept badly that night. I was completely unnerved and haunted by sad\r\nthoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping, but in this I was no doubt\r\ndeceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard some one\r\nwalking up and down in the house and opening the hall door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward morning I was overcome by fatigue and fell asleep. I got up late\r\nand did not go downstairs until the late breakfast, being still in a\r\nbewildered state, not knowing what kind of expression to put on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but she did\r\nnot appear. At length Mother Lecacheur went to her room. The English\r\nwoman had gone out. She must have set out at break of day, as she was\r\nwont to do, in order to see the sun rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody seemed surprised at this, and we began to eat in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe weather was hot, very hot, one of those broiling, heavy days when\r\nnot a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors, under an apple\r\ntree, and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the cellar to draw a jug\r\nof cider, everybody was so thirsty. Celeste brought the dishes from the\r\nkitchen, a ragout of mutton with potatoes, a cold rabbit and a salad.\r\nAfterward she placed before us a dish of strawberries, the first of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I wished to wash and freshen these, I begged the servant to go and\r\ndraw me a pitcher of cold water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was dry.\r\nShe had lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord and had\r\ntouched the bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again it was empty.\r\nMother Lecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for herself, went and\r\nlooked down the hole. She returned, announcing that one could see\r\nclearly something in the well, something altogether unusual. But this no\r\ndoubt was bundles of straw, which a neighbor had thrown in out of spite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to look down the well also, hoping I might be able to clear up\r\nthe mystery, and I perched myself close to the brink. I perceived\r\nindistinctly a white object. What could it be? I then conceived the idea\r\nof lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did so the yellow\r\nflame danced on the layers of stone and gradually became clearer. All\r\nfour of us were leaning over the opening, Sapeur and Celeste having now\r\njoined us. The lantern rested on a black-and-white indistinct mass,\r\nsingular, incomprehensible. Sapeur exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have got out of the meadow\r\nduring the night and fallen in headlong.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suddenly a cold shiver froze me to the marrow. I first recognized a\r\nfoot, then a leg sticking up; the whole body and the other leg were\r\ncompletely under water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stammered out in a loud voice, trembling so violently that the\r\nlantern danced hither and thither over the slipper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is a woman! Who-who-can it be? It is Miss Harriet!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSapeur alone did not manifest horror. He had witnessed many such scenes\r\nin Africa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother Lecacheur and Celeste began to utter piercing screams and ran\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead woman. I\r\nattached the young man securely by the waist to the end of the pulley\r\nrope and lowered him very slowly, watching him disappear in the\r\ndarkness. In one hand he held the lantern and a rope in the other. Soon\r\nI recognized his voice, which seemed to come from the centre of the\r\nearth, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Stop!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other leg.\r\nHe then bound the two feet together and shouted anew:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Haul up!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to wind up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch, and I\r\nwas in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom. When his\r\nhead appeared at the brink I asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well?' as if I expected he had a message from the drowned woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe both got on the stone slab at the edge of the well and from opposite\r\nsides we began to haul up the body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother Lecacheur and Celeste watched us from a distance, concealed from\r\nview behind the wall of the house. When they saw issuing from the hole\r\nthe black slippers and white stockings of the drowned person they\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSapeur seized the ankles, and we drew up the body of the poor woman.\r\nThe head was shocking to look at, being bruised and lacerated, and the\r\nlong gray hair, out of curl forevermore, hanging down tangled and\r\ndisordered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'In the name of all that is holy! how lean she is,' exclaimed Sapeur in\r\na contemptuous tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an\r\nappearance I, with the assistance of the stable lad, dressed the corpse\r\nfor burial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI washed her disfigured face. Under the touch of my finger an eye was\r\nslightly opened and regarded me with that pale, cold look, that terrible\r\nlook of a corpse which seems to come from the beyond. I braided as well\r\nas I could her dishevelled hair and with my clumsy hands arranged on her\r\nhead a novel and singular coiffure. Then I took off her dripping wet\r\ngarments, baring, not without a feeling of shame, as though I had been\r\nguilty of some profanation, her shoulders and her chest and her long\r\narms, as slim as the twigs of a tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI next went to fetch some flowers, poppies, bluets, marguerites and\r\nfresh, sweet-smelling grass with which to strew her funeral couch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI then had to go through the usual formalities, as I was alone to\r\nattend to everything. A letter found in her pocket, written at the last\r\nmoment, requested that her body be buried in the village in which she\r\nhad passed the last days of her life. A sad suspicion weighed on my\r\nheart. Was it not on my account that she wished to be laid to rest in\r\nthis place?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward evening all the female gossips of the locality came to view the\r\nremains of the defunct, but I would not allow a single person to enter.\r\nI wanted to be alone, and I watched beside her all night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at the corpse by the flickering light of the candles, at this\r\nunhappy woman, unknown to us all, who had died in such a lamentable\r\nmanner and so far away from home. Had she left no friends, no relations\r\nbehind her? What had her infancy been? What had been her life? Whence\r\nhad she come thither alone, a wanderer, lost like a dog driven from\r\nhome? What secrets of sufferings and of despair were sealed up in that\r\nunprepossessing body, in that poor body whose outward appearance had\r\ndriven from her all affection, all love?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many unhappy beings there are! I felt that there weighed upon that\r\nhuman creature the eternal injustice of implacable nature! It was all\r\nover with her, without her ever having experienced, perhaps, that which\r\nsustains the greatest outcasts to wit, the hope of being loved once!\r\nOtherwise why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from the face\r\nof others? Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately,\r\neverything living that was not a man?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recognized the fact that she believed in a God, and that she hoped to\r\nreceive compensation from the latter for all the miseries she had\r\nendured. She would now disintegrate and become, in turn, a plant. She\r\nwould blossom in the sun, the cattle would browse on her leaves, the\r\nbirds would bear away the seeds, and through these changes she would\r\nbecome again human flesh. But that which is called the soul had been\r\nextinguished at the bottom of the dark well. She suffered no longer. She\r\nhad given her life for that of others yet to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHours passed away in this silent and sinister communion with the dead.\r\nA pale light at length announced the dawn of a new day; then a red ray\r\nstreamed in on the bed, making a bar of light across the coverlet and\r\nacross her hands. This was the hour she had so much loved. The awakened\r\nbirds began to sing in the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI opened the window to its fullest extent and drew back the curtains\r\nthat the whole heavens might look in upon us, and, bending over the icy\r\ncorpse, I took in my hands the mutilated head and slowly, without terror\r\nor disgust, I imprinted a kiss, a long kiss, upon those lips which had\r\nnever before been kissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeon Chenal remained silent. The women wept. We heard on the box seat\r\nthe Count d'Atraille blowing his nose from time to time. The coachman\r\nalone had gone to sleep. The horses, who no longer felt the sting of the\r\nwhip, had slackened their pace and moved along slowly. The drag, hardly\r\nadvancing at all, seemed suddenly torpid, as if it had been freighted\r\nwith sorrow.\r\n\r\n[Miss Harriet appeared in Le Gaulois, July 9, 1883, under the title of\r\nMiss Hastings. The story was later revised, enlarged; and partly\r\nreconstructed. This is what De Maupassant wrote to Editor Havard March\r\n15, 1884, in an unedited letter, in regard to the title of the story\r\nthat was to give its name to the volume:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe that Hastings is a bad name, inasmuch as it is known\r\nall over the world, and recalls the greatest facts in English history.\r\nBesides, Hastings is as much a name as Duval is with us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name Cherbuliez selected, Miss Revel, is no more like an English\r\nname than like a Turkish name. But here is another name as English as\r\nHastings, and more euphonious; it is Miss Harriet. I will ask you\r\ntherefore to substitute Harriet for Hastings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in regard to this very tittle that De Maupassant had a\r\ndisagreement with Audran and Boucheron director of the Bouffes Parisiens\r\nin October, 1890. They had given this title to an operetta about to be\r\nplayed at the Bouffes. It ended however, by their ceding to De\r\nMaupassant, and the title of the operetta was changed to Miss Helyett.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE LOUISE ROQUE\r\n\r\nThe former soldier, Mederic Rompel, familiarly called Mederic by the\r\ncountry folks, left the post office of Roily-le-Tors at the usual hour.\r\nAfter passing through the village with his long stride, he cut across\r\nthe meadows of Villaume and reached the bank of the Brindille, following\r\nthe path along the water's edge to the village of Carvelin, where he\r\ncommenced to deliver his letters. He walked quickly, following the\r\ncourse of the narrow river, which frothed, murmured and boiled in its\r\ngrassy bed beneath an arch of willows.\r\n\r\nMederic went on without stopping, with only this thought in his mind:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first letter is for the Poivron family, then I have one for Monsieur\r\nRenardet; so I must cross the wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis blue blouse, fastened round his waist by a black leather belt, moved\r\nin a quick, regular fashion above the green hedge of willow trees, and\r\nhis stout stick of holly kept time with his steady tread.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the Brindille on a bridge consisting of a tree trunk, with a\r\nhandrail of rope, fastened at either end to a stake driven into the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe wood, which belonged to Monsieur Renardet, the mayor of Carvelin and\r\nthe largest landowner in the district, consisted of huge old trees,\r\nstraight as pillars and extending for about half a league along the left\r\nbank of the stream which served as a boundary to this immense dome of\r\nfoliage. Alongside the water large shrubs had grown up in the sunlight,\r\nbut under the trees one found nothing but moss, thick, soft and\r\nyielding, from which arose, in the still air, an odor of dampness and of\r\ndead wood.\r\n\r\nMederic slackened his pace, took off his black cap adorned with red lace\r\nand wiped his forehead, for it was by this time hot in the meadows,\r\nthough it was not yet eight o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nHe had just recovered from the effects of the heat and resumed his quick\r\npace when he noticed at the foot of a tree a knife, a child's small\r\nknife. When he picked it up he discovered a thimble and also a\r\nneedlecase not far away.\r\n\r\nHaving taken up these objects, he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cI'll entrust them to the\r\nmayor,\xe2\x80\x9d and he resumed his journey, but now he kept his eyes open,\r\nexpecting to find something else.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden he stopped short, as if he had struck against a wooden\r\nbarrier. Ten paces in front of him lay stretched on her back on the moss\r\na little girl, perfectly nude, her face covered with a handkerchief. She\r\nwas about twelve years old.\r\n\r\nMeredic advanced on tiptoe, as if he apprehended some danger, and he\r\nglanced toward the spot uneasily.\r\n\r\nWhat was this? No doubt she was asleep. Then he reflected that a person\r\ndoes not go to sleep naked at half-past seven in the morning under the\r\ncool trees. So, then, she must be dead, and he must be face to face with\r\na crime. At this thought a cold shiver ran through his frame, although\r\nhe was an old soldier. And then a murder was such a rare thing in the\r\ncountry, and, above all, the murder of a child, that he could not\r\nbelieve his eyes. But she had no wound-nothing save a spot of blood on\r\nher leg. How, then, had she been killed?\r\n\r\nHe stopped close to her and gazed at her, while he leaned on his stick.\r\nCertainly he must know her, for he knew all the inhabitants of the\r\ndistrict; but, not being able to get a look at her face, he could not\r\nguess her name. He stooped forward in order to take off the handkerchief\r\nwhich covered her face, then paused, with outstretched hand, restrained\r\nby an idea that occurred to him.\r\n\r\nHad he the right to disarrange anything in the condition of the corpse\r\nbefore the official investigation? He pictured justice to himself as a\r\nkind of general whom nothing escapes and who attaches as much importance\r\nto a lost button as to the stab of a knife in the stomach. Perhaps under\r\nthis handkerchief evidence could be found to sustain a charge of murder;\r\nin fact, if such proof were there it might lose its value if touched by\r\nan awkward hand.\r\n\r\nThen he raised himself with the intention of hastening toward the\r\nmayor's residence, but again another thought held him back. If the\r\nlittle girl were still alive, by any chance, he could not leave her\r\nlying there in this way. He sank on his knees very gently, a little\r\ndistance from her, through precaution, and extended his hand toward her\r\nfoot. It was icy cold, with the terrible coldness of death which leaves\r\nus no longer in doubt. The letter carrier, as he touched her, felt his\r\nheart in his mouth, as he said himself afterward, and his mouth parched.\r\nRising up abruptly, he rushed off under the trees toward Monsieur\r\nRenardet's house.\r\n\r\nHe walked on faster than ever, with his stick under his arm, his hands\r\nclenched and his head thrust forward, while his leathern bag, filled\r\nwith letters and newspapers, kept flapping at his side.\r\n\r\nThe mayor's residence was at the end of the wood which served as a park,\r\nand one side of it was washed by the Brindille.\r\n\r\nIt was a big square house of gray stone, very old, and had stood many a\r\nsiege in former days, and at the end of it was a huge tower, twenty\r\nmetres high, rising out of the water.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of this fortress one could formerly see all the surrounding\r\ncountry. It was called the Fox's tower, without any one knowing exactly\r\nwhy; and from this appellation, no doubt, had come the name Renardet,\r\nborne by the owners of this fief, which had remained in the same family,\r\nit was said, for more than two hundred years. For the Renardets formed\r\npart of the upper middle class, all but noble, to be met with so often\r\nin the province before the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe postman dashed into the kitchen, where the servants were taking\r\nbreakfast, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the mayor up? I want to speak to him at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMederic was recognized as a man of standing and authority, and they\r\nunderstood that something serious had happened.\r\n\r\nAs soon as word was brought to Monsieur Renardet, he ordered the postman\r\nto be sent up to him. Pale and out of breath, with his cap in his hand,\r\nMederic found the mayor seated at a long table covered with scattered\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nHe was a large, tall man, heavy and red-faced, strong as an ox, and was\r\ngreatly liked in the district, although of an excessively violent\r\ndisposition. Almost forty years old and a widower for the past six\r\nmonths, he lived on his estate like a country gentleman. His choleric\r\ntemperament had often brought him into trouble from which the\r\nmagistrates of Roily-le-Tors, like indulgent and prudent friends, had\r\nextricated him. Had he not one day thrown the conductor of the diligence\r\nfrom the top of his seat because he came near running over his\r\nretriever, Micmac? Had he not broken the ribs of a gamekeeper who abused\r\nhim for having, gun in hand, passed through a neighbor's property? Had\r\nhe not even caught by the collar the sub-prefect, who stopped over in\r\nthe village during an administrative circuit, called by Monsieur\r\nRenardet an electioneering circuit, for he was opposed to the\r\ngovernment, in accordance with family traditions.\r\n\r\nThe mayor asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter now, Mederic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found a little girl dead in your wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenardet rose to his feet, his face the color of brick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say\xe2\x80\x94a little girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, m'sieu, a little girl, quite naked, on her back, with blood on\r\nher, dead\xe2\x80\x94quite dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor gave vent to an oath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, I'd make a bet it is little Louise Roque! I have just learned\r\nthat she did not go home to her mother last night. Where did you find\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe postman described the spot, gave full details and offered to conduct\r\nthe mayor to the place.\r\n\r\nBut Renardet became brusque:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't need you. Send the watchman, the mayor's secretary and the\r\ndoctor to me at once, and resume your rounds. Quick, quick, go and tell\r\nthem to meet me in the wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter carrier, a man used to discipline, obeyed and withdrew, angry\r\nand grieved at not being able to be present at the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe mayor, in his turn, prepared to go out, took his big soft hat and\r\npaused for a few seconds on the threshold of his abode. In front of him\r\nstretched a wide sward, in which were three large beds of flowers in\r\nfull bloom, one facing the house and the others at either side of it.\r\nFarther on the outlying trees of the wood rose skyward, while at the\r\nleft, beyond the Brindille, which at that spot widened into a pond,\r\ncould be seen long meadows, an entirely green flat sweep of country,\r\nintersected by trenches and hedges of pollard willows.\r\n\r\nTo the right, behind the stables, the outhouses and all the buildings\r\nconnected with the property, might be seen the village, which was\r\nwealthy, being mainly inhabited by cattle breeders.\r\n\r\nRenardet slowly descended the steps in front of his house, and, turning\r\nto the left, gained the water's edge, which he followed at a slow pace,\r\nhis hand behind his back. He walked on, with bent head, and from time to\r\ntime glanced round in search of the persons he had sent for.\r\n\r\nWhen he stood beneath the trees he stopped, took off his hat and wiped\r\nhis forehead as Mederic had done, for the burning sun was darting its\r\nfiery rays on the earth. Then the mayor resumed his journey, stopped\r\nonce more and retraced his steps. Suddenly, stooping down, he steeped\r\nhis handkerchief in the stream that glided along at his feet and spread\r\nit over his head, under his hat. Drops of water flowed down his temples\r\nover his ears, which were always purple, over his strong red neck, and\r\nmade their way, one after the other, under his white shirt collar.\r\n\r\nAs nobody had appeared, he began tapping with his foot, then he called\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello! Hello!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA voice at his right answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello! Hello!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor appeared under the trees. He was a thin little man, an\r\nex-military surgeon, who passed in the neighborhood for a very skillful\r\npractitioner. He limped, having been wounded while in the service, and\r\nhad to use a stick to assist him in walking.\r\n\r\nNext came the watchman and the mayor's secretary, who, having been sent\r\nfor at the same time, arrived together. They looked scared, and hurried\r\nforward, out of breath, walking and running alternately to hasten their\r\nprogress, and moving their arms up and down so vigorously that they\r\nseemed to do more work with them than with their legs.\r\n\r\nRenardet said to the doctor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what the trouble is about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a child found dead in the wood by Mederic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's quite correct. Come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked along, side by side, followed by the two men.\r\n\r\nTheir steps made no sound on the moss. Their eyes were gazing ahead in\r\nfront of them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the doctor, extending his arm, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, there she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFar ahead of them under the trees they saw something white on which the\r\nsun gleamed down through the branches. As they approached they gradually\r\ndistinguished a human form lying there, its head toward the river, the\r\nface covered and the arms extended as though on a crucifix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am fearfully warm,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mayor, and stooping down, he again\r\nsoaked his handkerchief in the water and placed it round his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe doctor hastened his steps, interested by the discovery. As soon as\r\nthey were near the corpse, he bent down to examine it without touching\r\nit. He had put on his pince-nez, as one does in examining some curious\r\nobject, and turned round very quietly.\r\n\r\nHe said, without rising:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cViolated and murdered, as we shall prove presently. This little girl,\r\nmoreover, is almost a woman\xe2\x80\x94look at her throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor lightly drew away the handkerchief which covered her face,\r\nwhich looked black, frightful, the tongue protruding, the eyes\r\nbloodshot. He went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens! She was strangled the moment the deed was done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrangled with the hands without leaving any special trace, neither the\r\nmark of the nails nor the imprint of the fingers. Quite right. It is\r\nlittle Louise Roque, sure enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe carefully replaced the handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's nothing for me to do. She's been dead for the last hour at\r\nleast. We must give notice of the matter to the authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenardet, standing up, with his hands behind his back, kept staring with\r\na stony look at the little body exposed to view on the grass. He\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a wretch! We must find the clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor felt the hands, the arms, the legs. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had been bathing no doubt. They ought to be at the water's edge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor thereupon gave directions:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Principe\xe2\x80\x9d (this was his secretary), \xe2\x80\x9cgo and find those clothes\r\nfor me along the stream. You, Maxime\xe2\x80\x9d (this was the watchman), \xe2\x80\x9churry on\r\ntoward Rouy-le-Tors and bring with you the magistrate with the\r\ngendarmes. They must be here within an hour. You understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men started at once, and Renardet said to the doctor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat miscreant could have done such a deed in this part of the\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows? Any one is capable of that. Every one in particular and\r\nnobody in general. No matter, it must be some prowler, some workman out\r\nof employment. Since we have become a Republic we meet only this kind of\r\nperson along the roads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth of them were Bonapartists.\r\n\r\nThe mayor went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it can only be a stranger, a passer-by, a vagabond without hearth\r\nor home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor added, with the shadow of a smile on his face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd without a wife. Having neither a good supper nor a good bed, he\r\nbecame reckless. You can't tell how many men there may be in the world\r\ncapable of a crime at a given moment. Did you know that this little girl\r\nhad disappeared?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with the end of his stick he touched one after the other the\r\nstiffened fingers of the corpse, resting on them as on the keys of a\r\npiano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the mother came last night to look for me about nine o'clock, the\r\nchild not having come home at seven to supper. We looked for her along\r\nthe roads up to midnight, but we did not think of the wood. However, we\r\nneeded daylight to carry out a thorough search.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have a cigar?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, I don't care to smoke. This thing affects me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey remained standing beside the corpse of the young girl, so pale on\r\nthe dark moss. A big blue fly was walking over the body with his lively,\r\njerky movements. The two men kept watching this wandering speck.\r\n\r\nThe doctor said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow pretty it is, a fly on the skin! The ladies of the last century had\r\ngood reason to paste them on their faces. Why has this fashion gone\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor seemed not to hear, plunged as he was in deep thought.\r\n\r\nBut, all of a sudden, he turned round, surprised by a shrill noise. A\r\nwoman in a cap and blue apron was running toward them under the trees.\r\nIt was the mother, La Roque. As soon as she saw Renardet she began to\r\nshriek:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little girl! Where's my little girl?\xe2\x80\x9d so distractedly that she did\r\nnot glance down at the ground. Suddenly she saw the corpse, stopped\r\nshort, clasped her hands and raised both her arms while she uttered a\r\nsharp, heartrending cry\xe2\x80\x94the cry of a wounded animal. Then she rushed\r\ntoward the body, fell on her knees and snatched away the handkerchief\r\nthat covered the face. When she saw that frightful countenance, black\r\nand distorted, she rose to her feet with a shudder, then sinking to the\r\nground, face downward, she pressed her face against the ground and\r\nuttered frightful, continuous screams on the thick moss.\r\n\r\nHer tall, thin frame, with its close-clinging dress, was palpitating,\r\nshaken with spasms. One could see her bony ankles and her dried-up\r\ncalves covered with coarse blue stockings shaking horribly. She was\r\ndigging the soil with her crooked fingers, as though she were trying to\r\nmake a hole in which to hide herself.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, much affected, said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor old woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenardet felt a strange sensation. Then he gave vent to a sort of loud\r\nsneeze, and, drawing his handkerchief from his pocket, he began to weep\r\ninternally, coughing, sobbing and blowing his nose noisily.\r\n\r\nHe stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn\xe2\x80\x94damn\xe2\x80\x94damned pig to do this! I would like to see him guillotined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrincipe reappeared with his hands empty. He murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found nothing, M'sieu le Maire, nothing at all anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor, alarmed, replied in a thick voice, drowned in tears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that you could not find?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little girl's clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94look again, and find them\xe2\x80\x94or you 'll have to answer to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man, knowing that the mayor would not brook opposition, set forth\r\nagain with hesitating steps, casting a timid side glance at the corpse.\r\n\r\nDistant voices were heard under the trees, a confused sound, the noise\r\nof an approaching crowd, for Mederic had, in the course of his rounds,\r\ncarried the news from door to door. The people of the neighborhood,\r\ndazed at first, had gossiped about it in the street, from one threshold\r\nto another. Then they gathered together. They talked over, discussed and\r\ncommented on the event for some minutes and had now come to see for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThey arrived in groups, a little faltering and uneasy through fear of\r\nthe first impression of such a scene on their minds. When they saw the\r\nbody they stopped, not daring to advance, and speaking low. Then they\r\ngrew bolder, went on a few steps, stopped again, advanced once more, and\r\npresently formed around the dead girl, her mother, the doctor and\r\nRenardet a close circle, restless and noisy, which crowded forward at\r\nthe sudden impact of newcomers. And now they touched the corpse. Some of\r\nthem even bent down to feel it with their fingers. The doctor kept them\r\nback. But the mayor, waking abruptly out of his torpor, flew into a\r\nrage, and seizing Dr. Labarbe's stick, flung himself on his townspeople,\r\nstammering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear out\xe2\x80\x94clear out\xe2\x80\x94you pack of brutes\xe2\x80\x94clear out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in a second the crowd of sightseers had fallen back two hundred\r\npaces.\r\n\r\nMother La Roque had risen to a sitting posture and now remained weeping,\r\nwith her hands clasped over her face.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was discussing the affair, and young lads' eager eyes\r\ncuriously scrutinized this nude young form. Renardet perceived this,\r\nand, abruptly taking off his coat, he flung it over the little girl, who\r\nwas entirely hidden from view beneath the large garment.\r\n\r\nThe secretary drew near quietly. The wood was filled with people, and a\r\ncontinuous hum of voices rose up under the tangled foliage of the tall\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe mayor, in his shirt sleeves, remained standing, with his stick in\r\nhis hands, in a fighting attitude. He seemed exasperated by this\r\ncuriosity on the part of the people and kept repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf one of you come nearer I'll break his head just as I would a dog's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasants were greatly afraid of him. They held back. Dr. Labarbe,\r\nwho was smoking, sat down beside La Roque and spoke to her in order to\r\ndistract her attention. The old woman at once removed her hands from her\r\nface and replied with a flood of tearful words, emptying her grief in\r\ncopious talk. She told the whole story of her life, her marriage, the\r\ndeath of her man, a cattle drover, who had been gored to death, the\r\ninfancy of her daughter, her wretched existence as a widow without\r\nresources and with a child to support. She had only this one, her little\r\nLouise, and the child had been killed\xe2\x80\x94killed in this wood. Then she felt\r\nanxious to see her again, and, dragging herself on her knees toward the\r\ncorpse, she raised up one corner of the garment that covered her; then\r\nshe let it fall again and began wailing once more. The crowd remained\r\nsilent, eagerly watching all the mother's gestures.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there was a great commotion at the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cThe gendarmes!\r\nthe gendarmes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo gendarmes appeared in the distance, advancing at a rapid trot,\r\nescorting their captain and a little gentleman with red whiskers, who\r\nwas bobbing up and down like a monkey on a big white mare.\r\n\r\nThe watchman had just found Monsieur Putoin, the magistrate, at the\r\nmoment when he was mounting his horse to take his daily ride, for he\r\nposed as a good horseman, to the great amusement of the officers.\r\n\r\nHe dismounted, along with the captain, and pressed the hands of the\r\nmayor and the doctor, casting a ferret-like glance on the linen coat\r\nbeneath which lay the corpse.\r\n\r\nWhen he was made acquainted with all the facts, he first gave orders to\r\ndisperse the crowd, whom the gendarmes drove out of the wood, but who\r\nsoon reappeared in the meadow and formed a hedge, a big hedge of excited\r\nand moving heads, on the other side of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, in his turn, gave explanations, which Renardet noted down in\r\nhis memorandum book. All the evidence was given, taken down and\r\ncommented on without leading to any discovery. Maxime, too, came back\r\nwithout having found any trace of the clothes.\r\n\r\nThis disappearance surprised everybody; no one could explain it except\r\non the theory of theft, and as her rags were not worth twenty sous, even\r\nthis theory was inadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, the mayor, the captain and the doctor set to work\r\nsearching in pairs, putting aside the smallest branch along the water.\r\n\r\nRenardet said to the judge:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does it happen that this wretch has concealed or carried away the\r\nclothes, and has thus left the body exposed, in sight of every one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, crafty and sagacious, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! Perhaps a dodge? This crime has been committed either by a\r\nbrute or by a sly scoundrel. In any case, we'll easily succeed in\r\nfinding him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe noise of wheels made them turn their heads round. It was the deputy\r\nmagistrate, the doctor and the registrar of the court who had arrived in\r\ntheir turn. They resumed their search, all chatting in an animated\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nRenardet said suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that you are to take luncheon with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery one smilingly accepted the invitation, and the magistrate,\r\nthinking that the case of little Louise Roque had occupied enough\r\nattention for one day, turned toward the mayor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can have the body brought to your house, can I not? You have a room\r\nin which you can keep it for me till this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other became confused and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94no. To tell the truth, I prefer that it should not come into my\r\nhouse on account of\xe2\x80\x94on account of my servants, who are already talking\r\nabout ghosts in\xe2\x80\x94in my tower, in the Fox's tower. You know\xe2\x80\x94I could no\r\nlonger keep a single one. No\xe2\x80\x94I prefer not to have it in my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate began to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! I will have it taken at once to Roily for the legal examination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd, turning to his deputy, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make use of your trap, can I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all came back to the place where the corpse lay. Mother La Roque,\r\nnow seated beside her daughter, was holding her hand and was staring\r\nright before her with a wandering, listless eye.\r\n\r\nThe two doctors endeavored to lead her away, so that she might not\r\nwitness the dead girl's removal, but she understood at once what they\r\nwanted to do, and, flinging herself on the body, she threw both arms\r\nround it. Lying on top of the corpse, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not have it\xe2\x80\x94it's mine\xe2\x80\x94it's mine now. They have killed her for\r\nme, and I want to keep her\xe2\x80\x94you shall not have her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the men, affected and not knowing how to act, remained standing\r\naround her. Renardet fell on his knees and said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, La Roque, it is necessary, in order to find out who killed her.\r\nWithout this, we could not find out. We must make a search for the man\r\nin order to punish him. When we have found him we'll give her up to you.\r\nI promise you this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis explanation bewildered the woman, and a feeling of hatred\r\nmanifested itself in her distracted glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then they'll arrest him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I promise you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose up, deciding to let them do as they liked, but when the captain\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is surprising that her clothes were not found,\xe2\x80\x9d a new idea, which\r\nshe had not previously thought of, abruptly entered her mind, and she\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are her clothes? They're mine. I want them. Where have they been\r\nput?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey explained to her that they had not been found. Then she demanded\r\nthem persistently, crying and moaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey're mine\xe2\x80\x94I want them. Where are they? I want them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe more they tried to calm her the more she sobbed and persisted in her\r\ndemands. She no longer wanted the body, she insisted on having the\r\nclothes, as much perhaps through the unconscious cupidity of a wretched\r\nbeing to whom a piece of silver represents a fortune as through maternal\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\nAnd when the little body, rolled up in blankets which had been brought\r\nout from Renardet's house, had disappeared in the vehicle, the old woman\r\nstanding under the trees, sustained by the mayor and the captain,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing, nothing, nothing in the world, not even her little cap\r\n\xe2\x80\x94her little cap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cure, a young priest, had just arrived. He took it on himself to\r\naccompany the mother, and they went away together toward the village.\r\nThe mother's grief was modified by the sugary words of the clergyman,\r\nwho promised her a thousand compensations. But she kept repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nhad only her little cap.\xe2\x80\x9d This idea now dominated every other.\r\n\r\nRenardet called from the distance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will lunch with us, Monsieur l'Abbe\xe2\x80\x94in an hour's time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest turned his head round and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure, Monsieur le Maire. I'll be with you at twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they all directed their steps toward the house, whose gray front,\r\nwith the large tower built on the edge of the Brindille, could be seen\r\nthrough the branches.\r\n\r\nThe meal lasted a long time. They talked about the crime. Everybody was\r\nof the same opinion. It had been committed by some tramp passing there\r\nby mere chance while the little girl was bathing.\r\n\r\nThen the magistrates returned to Rouy, announcing that they would return\r\nnext day at an early hour. The doctor and the cure went to their\r\nrespective homes, while Renardet, after a long walk through the meadows,\r\nreturned to the wood, where he remained walking till nightfall with slow\r\nsteps, his hands behind his back.\r\n\r\nHe went to bed early and was still asleep next morning when the\r\nmagistrate entered his room. He was rubbing his hands together with a\r\nself-satisfied air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! You are still sleeping! Well, my dear fellow, we have news this\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor sat up in his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Something strange. You remember well how the mother clamored\r\nyesterday for some memento of her daughter, especially her little cap?\r\nWell, on opening her door this morning she found on the threshold her\r\nchild's two little wooden shoes. This proves that the crime was\r\nperpetrated by some one from the district, some one who felt pity for\r\nher. Besides, the postman, Mederic, brought me the thimble, the knife\r\nand the needle case of the dead girl. So, then, the man in carrying off\r\nthe clothes to hide them must have let fall the articles which were in\r\nthe pocket. As for me, I attach special importance to the wooden shoes,\r\nas they indicate a certain moral culture and a faculty for tenderness on\r\nthe part of the assassin. We will, therefore, if you have no objection,\r\ngo over together the principal inhabitants of your district.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor got up. He rang for his shaving water and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure, but it will take some time, and we may begin at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Putoin sat astride a chair.\r\n\r\nRenardet covered his chin with a white lather while he looked at himself\r\nin the glass. Then he sharpened his razor on the strop and continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe principal inhabitant of Carvelin bears the name of Joseph Renardet,\r\nmayor, a rich landowner, a rough man who beats guards and coachmen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe examining magistrate burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's enough. Let us pass on to the next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second in importance is Pelledent, his deputy, a cattle breeder, an\r\nequally rich landowner, a crafty peasant, very sly, very close-fisted on\r\nevery question of money, but incapable in my opinion of having\r\nperpetrated such a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContinue,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Putoin.\r\n\r\nRenardet, while proceeding with his toilet, reviewed the characters of\r\nall the inhabitants of Carvelin. After two hours' discussion their\r\nsuspicions were fixed on three individuals who had hitherto borne a\r\nshady reputation\xe2\x80\x94a poacher named Cavalle, a fisherman named Paquet, who\r\ncaught trout and crabs, and a cattle drover named Clovis. II\r\n\r\nThe search for the perpetrator of the crime lasted all summer, but he\r\nwas not discovered. Those who were suspected and arrested easily proved\r\ntheir innocence, and the authorities were compelled to abandon the\r\nattempt to capture the criminal.\r\n\r\nBut this murder seemed to have moved the entire country in a singular\r\nmanner. There remained in every one's mind a disquietude, a vague fear,\r\na sensation of mysterious terror, springing not merely from the\r\nimpossibility of discovering any trace of the assassin, but also and\r\nabove all from that strange finding of the wooden shoes in front of La\r\nRoque's door the day after the crime. The certainty that the murderer\r\nhad assisted at the investigation, that he was still, doubtless, living\r\nin the village, possessed all minds and seemed to brood over the\r\nneighborhood like a constant menace.\r\n\r\nThe wood had also become a dreaded spot, a place to be avoided and\r\nsupposed to be haunted.\r\n\r\nFormerly the inhabitants went there to spend every Sunday afternoon.\r\nThey used to sit down on the moss at the feet of the huge tall trees or\r\nwalk along the water's edge watching the trout gliding among the weeds.\r\nThe boy's used to play bowls, hide-and-seek and other games where the\r\nground had been cleared and levelled, and the girls, in rows of four or\r\nfive, would trip along, holding one another by the arms and screaming\r\nsongs with their shrill voices. Now nobody ventured there for fear of\r\nfinding some corpse lying on the ground.\r\n\r\nAutumn arrived, the leaves began to fall from the tall trees, whirling\r\nround and round to the ground, and the sky could be seen through the\r\nbare branches. Sometimes, when a gust of wind swept over the tree tops,\r\nthe slow, continuous rain suddenly grew heavier and became a rough storm\r\nthat covered the moss with a thick yellow carpet that made a kind of\r\ncreaking sound beneath one's feet.\r\n\r\nAnd the sound of the falling leaves seemed like a wail and the leaves\r\nthemselves like tears shed by these great, sorrowful trees, that wept in\r\nthe silence of the bare and empty wood, this dreaded and deserted wood\r\nwhere wandered lonely the soul, the little soul of little Louise Roque.\r\n\r\nThe Brindille, swollen by the storms, rushed on more quickly, yellow and\r\nangry, between its dry banks, bordered by two thin, bare, willow hedges.\r\n\r\nAnd here was Renardet suddenly resuming his walks under the trees. Every\r\nday, at sunset, he came out of his house, descended the front steps\r\nslowly and entered the wood in a dreamy fashion, with his hands in his\r\npockets, and paced over the damp soft moss, while a legion of rooks from\r\nall the neighboring haunts came thither to rest in the tall trees and\r\nthen flew off like a black cloud uttering loud, discordant cries.\r\n\r\nNight came on, and Renardet was still strolling slowly under the trees;\r\nthen, when the darkness prevented him from walking any longer, he would\r\ngo back to the house and sink into his armchair in front of the glowing\r\nhearth, stretching his damp feet toward the fire.\r\n\r\nOne morning an important bit of news was circulated through the\r\ndistrict; the mayor was having his wood cut down.\r\n\r\nTwenty woodcutters were already at work. They had commenced at the\r\ncorner nearest to the house and worked rapidly in the master's presence.\r\n\r\nAnd each day the wood grew thinner, losing its trees, which fell down\r\none by one, as an army loses its soldiers.\r\n\r\nRenardet no longer walked up, and down. He remained from morning till\r\nnight, contemplating, motionless, with his hands behind his back, the\r\nslow destruction of his wood. When a tree fell he placed his foot on it\r\nas if it were a corpse. Then he raised his eyes to the next with a kind\r\nof secret, calm impatience, as if he expected, hoped for something at\r\nthe end of this slaughter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they were approaching the place where little Louise Roque had\r\nbeen found. They came to it one evening in the twilight.\r\n\r\nAs it was dark, the sky being overcast, the woodcutters wanted to stop\r\ntheir work, putting off till next day the fall of an enormous beech\r\ntree, but the mayor objected to this and insisted that they should at\r\nonce lop and cut down this giant, which had sheltered the crime.\r\n\r\nWhen the lopper had laid it bare and the woodcutters had sapped its\r\nbase, five men commenced hauling at the rope attached to the top.\r\n\r\nThe tree resisted; its powerful trunk, although notched to the centre,\r\nwas as rigid as iron. The workmen, all together, with a sort of\r\nsimultaneous motion, strained at the rope, bending backward and uttering\r\na cry which timed and regulated their efforts.\r\n\r\nTwo woodcutters standing close to the giant remained with axes in their\r\ngrip, like two executioners ready to strike once more, and Renardet,\r\nmotionless, with his hand on the trunk, awaited the fall with an uneasy,\r\nnervous feeling.\r\n\r\nOne of the men said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too near, Monsieur le Maire. When it falls it may hurt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not reply and did not move away. He seemed ready to catch the\r\nbeech tree in his open arms and to cast it on the ground like a\r\nwrestler.\r\n\r\nAll at once, at the base of the tall column of wood there was a rent\r\nwhich seemed to run to the top, like a painful shock; it bent slightly,\r\nready to fall, but still resisting. The men, in a state of excitement,\r\nstiffened their arms, renewed their efforts with greater vigor, and,\r\njust as the tree came crashing down, Renardet suddenly made a forward\r\nstep, then stopped, his shoulders raised to receive the irresistible\r\nshock, the mortal shock which would crush him to the earth.\r\n\r\nBut the beech tree, having deviated a little, only rubbed against his\r\nloins, throwing him on his face, five metres away.\r\n\r\nThe workmen dashed forward to lift him up. He had already arisen to his\r\nknees, stupefied, with bewildered eyes and passing his hand across his\r\nforehead, as if he were awaking from an attack of madness.\r\n\r\nWhen he had got to his feet once more the men, astonished, questioned\r\nhim, not being able to understand what he had done. He replied in\r\nfaltering tones that he had been dazed for a moment, or, rather, he had\r\nbeen thinking of his childhood days; that he thought he would have time\r\nto run under the tree, just as street boys rush in front of vehicles\r\ndriving rapidly past; that he had played at danger; that for the past\r\neight days he felt this desire growing stronger within him, asking\r\nhimself each time a tree began to fall whether he could pass beneath it\r\nwithout being touched. It was a piece of stupidity, he confessed, but\r\nevery one has these moments of insanity and these temptations to boyish\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nHe made this explanation in a slow tone, searching for his words, and\r\nspeaking in a colorless tone.\r\n\r\nThen he went off, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill to-morrow, my friends-till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got back to his room he sat down at his table which his\r\nlamp lighted up brightly, and, burying his head in his hands, he began\r\nto cry.\r\n\r\nHe remained thus for a long time, then wiped his eyes, raised his head\r\nand looked at the clock. It was not yet six o'clock.\r\n\r\nHe thought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have time before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went to the door and locked it. He then came back, and, sitting\r\ndown at his table, pulled out the middle drawer. Taking from it a\r\nrevolver, he laid it down on his papers in full view. The barrel of the\r\nfirearm glittered, giving out gleams of light.\r\n\r\nRenardet gazed at it for some time with the uneasy glance of a drunken\r\nman. Then he rose and began to pace up and down the room.\r\n\r\nHe walked from one end of the apartment to the other, stopping from time\r\nto time, only to pace up and down again a moment afterward. Suddenly he\r\nopened the door of his dressing-room, steeped a towel in the water\r\npitcher and moistened his forehead, as he had done on the morning of the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nThen he, began walking up and down again. Each time he passed the table\r\nthe gleaming revolver attracted his glance, tempted his hand, but he\r\nkept watching the clock and reflected:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have still time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck half-past six. Then he took up the revolver, opened his mouth\r\nwide with a frightful grimace and stuck the barrel into it as if he\r\nwanted to swallow it. He remained in this position for some seconds\r\nwithout moving, his finger on the trigger. Then, suddenly seized with a\r\nshudder of horror, he dropped the pistol on the carpet.\r\n\r\nHe fell back on his armchair, sobbing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot. I dare not! My God! my God! How can I have the courage to\r\nkill myself?'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. He rose up, bewildered. A servant said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur's dinner is ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I'm coming down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he picked up the revolver, locked it up again in the drawer and\r\nlooked at himself in the mirror over the mantelpiece to see whether his\r\nface did not look too much troubled. It was as red as usual, a little\r\nredder perhaps. That was all. He went down and seated himself at table.\r\n\r\nHe ate slowly, like a man who wants to prolong the meal, who does not\r\nwant to be alone.\r\n\r\nThen he smoked several pipes in the hall while the table was being\r\ncleared. After that he went back to his room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had locked himself in he looked, under the bed, opened all\r\nthe closets, explored every corner, rummaged through all the furniture.\r\nThen he lighted the candles on the mantelpiece, and, turning round\r\nseveral times, ran his eye all over the apartment with an anguish of\r\nterror that distorted his face, for he knew well that he would see her,\r\nas he did every night\xe2\x80\x94little Louise Roque, the little girl he had\r\nattacked and afterward strangled.\r\n\r\nEvery night the odious vision came back again. First he seemed to hear a\r\nkind of roaring sound, such as is made by a threshing machine or the\r\ndistant passage of a train over a bridge. Then he commenced to gasp, to\r\nsuffocate, and he had to unbutton his collar and his belt. He moved\r\nabout to make his blood circulate, he tried to read, he attempted to\r\nsing. It was in vain. His thoughts, in spite of himself, went back to\r\nthe day of the murder and made him begin it all over again in all its\r\nmost secret details, with all the violent emotions he had experienced\r\nfrom the first minute to the last.\r\n\r\nHe had felt on rising that morning, the morning of the horrible day, a\r\nlittle dizziness and headache, which he attributed to the heat, so that\r\nhe remained in his room until breakfast time.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal he had taken a siesta, then, toward the close of the\r\nafternoon, he had gone out to breathe the fresh, soothing breeze under\r\nthe trees in the wood.\r\n\r\nBut, as soon as he was outside, the heavy, scorching air of the plain\r\noppressed him still more. The sun, still high in the heavens, poured\r\ndown on the parched soil waves of burning light. Not a breath of wind\r\nstirred the leaves. Every beast and bird, even the grasshoppers, were\r\nsilent. Renardet reached the tall trees and began to walk over the moss\r\nwhere the Brindille produced a slight freshness of the air beneath the\r\nimmense roof of branches. But he felt ill at ease. It seemed to him that\r\nan unknown, invisible hand was strangling him, and he scarcely thought\r\nof anything, having usually few ideas in his head. For the last three\r\nmonths only one thought haunted him, the thought of marrying again. He\r\nsuffered from living alone, suffered from it morally and physically.\r\nAccustomed for ten years past to feeling a woman near him, habituated to\r\nher presence every moment, he had need, an imperious and perplexing need\r\nof such association. Since Madame Renardet's death he had suffered\r\ncontinually without knowing why, he had suffered at not feeling her\r\ndress brushing past him, and, above all, from no longer being able to\r\ncalm and rest himself in her arms. He had been scarcely six months a\r\nwidower and he was already looking about in the district for some young\r\ngirl or some widow he might marry when his period of mourning was at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nHe had a chaste soul, but it was lodged in a powerful, herculean body,\r\nand carnal imaginings began to disturb his sleep and his vigils. He\r\ndrove them away; they came back again; and he murmured from time to\r\ntime, smiling at himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, like St. Anthony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving this special morning had several of these visions, the desire\r\nsuddenly came into his breast to bathe in the Brindille in order to\r\nrefresh himself and cool his blood.\r\n\r\nHe knew of a large deep pool, a little farther down, where the people of\r\nthe neighborhood came sometimes to take a dip in summer. He went there.\r\n\r\nThick willow trees hid this clear body of water where the current rested\r\nand went to sleep for a while before starting on its way again.\r\nRenardet, as he appeared, thought he heard a light sound, a faint\r\nplashing which was not that of the stream on the banks. He softly put\r\naside the leaves and looked. A little girl, quite naked in the\r\ntransparent water, was beating the water with both hands, dancing about\r\nin it and dipping herself with pretty movements. She was not a child nor\r\nwas she yet a woman. She was plump and developed, while preserving an\r\nair of youthful precocity, as of one who had grown rapidly. He no longer\r\nmoved, overcome with surprise, with desire, holding his breath with a\r\nstrange, poignant emotion. He remained there, his heart beating as if\r\none of his sensuous dreams had just been realized, as if an impure fairy\r\nhad conjured up before him this young creature, this little rustic\r\nVenus, rising from the eddies of the stream as the real Venus rose from\r\nthe waves of the sea.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the little girl came out of the water, and, without seeing him,\r\ncame over to where he stood, looking for her clothes in order to dress\r\nherself. As she approached gingerly, on account of the sharp-pointed\r\nstones, he felt himself pushed toward her by an irresistible force, by a\r\nbestial transport of passion, which stirred his flesh, bewildered his\r\nmind and made him tremble from head to foot.\r\n\r\nShe remained standing some seconds behind the willow tree which\r\nconcealed him from view. Then, losing his reason entirely, he pushed\r\naside the branches, rushed on her and seized her in his arms. She fell,\r\ntoo terrified to offer any resistance, too terror-stricken to cry out.\r\nHe seemed possessed, not understanding what he was doing.\r\n\r\nHe woke from his crime as one wakes from a nightmare. The child burst\r\nout weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue! Hold your tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI'll give you money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she did not hear him and went on sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, hold your tongue! Do hold your tongue! Keep quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nShe kept shrieking as she tried to free herself. He suddenly realized\r\nthat he was ruined, and he caught her by the neck to stop her mouth from\r\nuttering these heartrending, dreadful screams. As she continued to\r\nstruggle with the desperate strength of a being who is seeking to fly\r\nfrom death, he pressed his enormous hands on the little throat swollen\r\nwith screaming, and in a few seconds he had strangled her, so furiously\r\ndid he grip her. He had not intended to kill her, but only to make her\r\nkeep quiet.\r\n\r\nThen he stood up, overwhelmed with horror.\r\n\r\nShe lay before him, her face bleeding and blackned. He was about to rush\r\naway when there sprang up in his agitated soul the mysterious and\r\nundefined instinct that guides all beings in the hour of danger.\r\n\r\nHe was going to throw the body into the water, but another impulse drove\r\nhim toward the clothes, which he made into a small package. Then, as he\r\nhad a piece of twine in his pocket, he tied it up and hid it in a deep\r\nportion of the stream, beneath the trunk of a tree that overhung the\r\nBrindille.\r\n\r\nThen he went off at a rapid pace, reached the meadows, took a wide turn\r\nin order to show himself to some peasants who dwelt some distance away\r\nat the opposite side of the district, and came back to dine at the usual\r\nhour, telling his servants all that was supposed to have happened during\r\nhis walk.\r\n\r\nHe slept, however, that night; he slept with a heavy, brutish sleep like\r\nthe sleep of certain persons condemned to death. He did not open his\r\neyes until the first glimmer of dawn, and he waited till his usual hour\r\nfor riding, so as to excite no suspicion.\r\n\r\nThen he had to be present at the inquiry as to the cause of death. He\r\ndid so like a somnambulist, in a kind of vision which showed him men and\r\nthings as in a dream, in a cloud of intoxication, with that sense of\r\nunreality which perplexes the mind at the time of the greatest\r\ncatastrophes.\r\n\r\nBut the agonized cry of Mother Roque pierced his heart. At that moment\r\nhe had felt inclined to cast himself at the old woman's feet and to\r\nexclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the guilty one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had restrained himself. He went back, however, during the night\r\nto fish up the dead girl's wooden shoes, in order to place them on her\r\nmother's threshold.\r\n\r\nAs long as the inquiry lasted, as long as it was necessary to lead\r\njustice astray he was calm, master of himself, crafty and smiling. He\r\ndiscussed quietly with the magistrates all the suppositions that passed\r\nthrough their minds, combated their opinions and demolished their\r\narguments. He even took a keen and mournful pleasure in disturbing their\r\ninvestigations, in embroiling their ideas, in showing the innocence of\r\nthose whom they suspected.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the inquiry was abandoned he became gradually nervous,\r\nmore excitable than he had been before, although he mastered his\r\nirritability. Sudden noises made him start with fear; he shuddered at\r\nthe slightest thing and trembled sometimes from head to foot when a fly\r\nalighted on his forehead. Then he was seized with an imperious desire\r\nfor motion, which impelled him to take long walks and to remain up whole\r\nnights pacing up and down his room.\r\n\r\nIt was not that he was goaded by remorse. His brutal nature did not lend\r\nitself to any shade of sentiment or of moral terror. A man of energy and\r\neven of violence, born to make war, to ravage conquered countries and to\r\nmassacre the vanquished, full of the savage instincts of the hunter and\r\nthe fighter, he scarcely took count of human life. Though he respected\r\nthe Church outwardly, from policy, he believed neither in God nor the\r\ndevil, expecting neither chastisement nor recompense for his acts in\r\nanother life. His sole belief was a vague philosophy drawn from all the\r\nideas of the encyclopedists of the last century, and he regarded\r\nreligion as a moral sanction of the law, the one and the other having\r\nbeen invented by men to regulate social relations. To kill any one in a\r\nduel, or in war, or in a quarrel, or by accident, or for the sake of\r\nrevenge, or even through bravado would have seemed to him an amusing and\r\nclever thing and would not have left more impression on his mind than a\r\nshot fired at a hare; but he had experienced a profound emotion at the\r\nmurder of this child. He had, in the first place, perpetrated it in the\r\nheat of an irresistible gust of passion, in a sort of tempest of the\r\nsenses that had overpowered his reason. And he had cherished in his\r\nheart, in his flesh, on his lips, even to the very tips of his murderous\r\nfingers a kind of bestial love, as well as a feeling of terrified\r\nhorror, toward this little girl surprised by him and basely killed.\r\nEvery moment his thoughts returned to that horrible scene, and, though\r\nhe endeavored to drive this picture from his mind, though he put it\r\naside with terror, with disgust, he felt it surging through his soul,\r\nmoving about in him, waiting incessantly for the moment to reappear.\r\n\r\nThen, as evening approached, he was afraid of the shadow falling around\r\nhim. He did not yet know why the darkness seemed frightful to him, but\r\nhe instinctively feared it, he felt that it was peopled with terrors.\r\nThe bright daylight did not lend itself to fears. Things and beings were\r\nvisible then, and only natural things and beings could exhibit\r\nthemselves in the light of day. But the night, the impenetrable night,\r\nthicker than walls and empty; the infinite night, so black, so vast, in\r\nwhich one might brush against frightful things; the night, when one\r\nfeels that a mysterious terror is wandering, prowling about, appeared to\r\nhim to conceal an unknown threatening danger, close beside him.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\nHe knew ere long. As he sat in his armchair, rather late one evening\r\nwhen he could not sleep, he thought he saw the curtain of his window\r\nmove. He waited, uneasily, with beating heart. The drapery did not stir;\r\nthen, all of a sudden, it moved once more. He did not venture to rise;\r\nhe no longer ventured to breathe, and yet he was brave. He had often\r\nfought, and he would have liked to catch thieves in his house.\r\n\r\nWas it true that this curtain did move? he asked himself, fearing that\r\nhis eyes had deceived him. It was, moreover, such a slight thing, a\r\ngentle flutter of drapery, a kind of trembling in its folds, less than\r\nan undulation caused by the wind.\r\n\r\nRenardet sat still, with staring eyes and outstretched neck. He sprang\r\nto his feet abruptly, ashamed of his fear, took four steps, seized the\r\ndrapery with both hands and pulled it wide apart. At first he saw\r\nnothing but darkened glass, resembling plates of glittering ink. The\r\nnight, the vast, impenetrable night, stretched beyond as far as the\r\ninvisible horizon. He remained standing in front of this illimitable\r\nshadow, and suddenly he perceived a light, a moving light, which seemed\r\nsome distance away.\r\n\r\nThen he put his face close to the window pane, thinking that a person\r\nlooking for crabs might be poaching in the Brindille, for it was past\r\nmidnight, and this light rose up at the edge of the stream, under the\r\ntrees. As he was not yet able to see clearly, Renardet placed his hands\r\nover his eyes, and suddenly this light became an illumination, and he\r\nbeheld little Louise Roque naked and bleeding on the moss. He recoiled,\r\nfrozen with horror, knocked over his chair and fell over on his back. He\r\nremained there some minutes in anguish of mind; then he sat up and began\r\nto reflect. He had had a hallucination\xe2\x80\x94that was all, a hallucination due\r\nto the fact that a night marauder was walking with a lantern in his hand\r\nnear the water's edge. What was there astonishing, besides, in the\r\ncircumstance that the recollection of his crime should sometimes bring\r\nbefore him the vision of the dead girl?\r\n\r\nHe rose from the ground, swallowed a glass of wine and sat down again.\r\nHe was thinking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do if this occurs again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it would occur; he felt it; he was sure of it. Already his glance\r\nwas drawn toward the window; it called him; it attracted him. In order\r\nto avoid looking at it, he turned his chair round. Then he took a book\r\nand tried to read, but it seemed to him that he presently heard\r\nsomething stirring behind him, and he swung round his armchair on one\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe curtain was moving again; unquestionably, it moved this time. He\r\ncould no longer have any doubt about it.\r\n\r\nHe rushed forward and grasped it so violently that he pulled it down\r\nwith its pole. Then he eagerly glued his face to the glass. He saw\r\nnothing. All was black outside, and he breathed with the joy of a man\r\nwhose life has just been saved.\r\n\r\nThen he went back to his chair and sat down again, but almost\r\nimmediately he felt a longing to look out once more through the window.\r\nSince the curtain had fallen down, the window made a sort of gap,\r\nfascinating and terrible, on the dark landscape. In order not to yield\r\nto this dangerous temptation, he undressed, blew out the light and\r\nclosed his eyes.\r\n\r\nLying on his back motionless, his skin warm and moist, he awaited sleep.\r\nSuddenly a great gleam of light flashed across his eyelids. He opened\r\nthem, believing that his dwelling was on fire. All was black as before,\r\nand he leaned on his elbow to try to distinguish the window which had\r\nstill for him an unconquerable attraction. By dint of, straining his\r\neyes he could perceive some stars, and he rose, groped his way across\r\nthe room, discovered the panes with his outstretched hands, and placed\r\nhis forehead close to them. There below, under the trees, lay the body\r\nof the little girl gleaming like phosphorus, lighting up the surrounding\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nRenardet uttered a cry and rushed toward his bed, where he lay till\r\nmorning, his head hidden under the pillow.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment his life became intolerable. He passed his days in\r\napprehension of each succeeding night, and each night the vision came\r\nback again. As soon as he had locked himself up in his room he strove to\r\nresist it, but in vain. An irresistible force lifted him up and pushed\r\nhim against the window, as if to call the phantom, and he saw it at\r\nonce, lying first in the spot where the crime was committed in the\r\nposition in which it had been found.\r\n\r\nThen the dead girl rose up and came toward him with little steps just as\r\nthe child had done when she came out of the river. She advanced quietly,\r\npassing straight across the grass and over the bed of withered flowers.\r\nThen she rose up in the air toward Renardet's window. She came toward\r\nhim as she had come on the day of the crime. And the man recoiled before\r\nthe apparition\xe2\x80\x94he retreated to his bed and sank down upon it, knowing\r\nwell that the little one had entered the room and that she now was\r\nstanding behind the curtain, which presently moved. And until daybreak\r\nhe kept staring at this curtain with a fixed glance, ever waiting to see\r\nhis victim depart.\r\n\r\nBut she did not show herself any more; she remained there behind the\r\ncurtain, which quivered tremulously now and then.\r\n\r\nAnd Renardet, his fingers clutching the clothes, squeezed them as he had\r\nsqueezed the throat of little Louise Roque.\r\n\r\nHe heard the clock striking the hours, and in the stillness the pendulum\r\nkept ticking in time with the loud beating of his heart. And he\r\nsuffered, the wretched man, more than any man had ever suffered before.\r\n\r\nThen, as soon as a white streak of light on the ceiling announced the\r\napproaching day, he felt himself free, alone at last, alone in his room;\r\nand he went to sleep. He slept several hours\xe2\x80\x94a restless, feverish sleep\r\nin which he retraced in dreams the horrible vision of the past night.\r\n\r\nWhen he went down to the late breakfast he felt exhausted as after\r\nunusual exertion, and he scarcely ate anything, still haunted as he was\r\nby the fear of what he had seen the night before.\r\n\r\nHe knew well, however, that it was not an apparition, that the dead do\r\nnot come back, and that his sick soul, his soul possessed by one thought\r\nalone, by an indelible remembrance, was the only cause of his torture,\r\nwas what brought the dead girl back to life and raised her form before\r\nhis eyes, on which it was ineffaceably imprinted. But he knew, too, that\r\nthere was no cure, that he would never escape from the savage\r\npersecution of his memory, and he resolved to die rather than to endure\r\nthese tortures any longer.\r\n\r\nThen he thought of how he would kill himself, It must be something\r\nsimple and natural, which would preclude the idea of suicide. For he\r\nclung to his reputation, to the name bequeathed to him by his ancestors;\r\nand if his death awakened any suspicion people's thoughts might be,\r\nperhaps, directed toward the mysterious crime, toward the murderer who\r\ncould not be found, and they would not hesitate to accuse him of the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nA strange idea came into his head, that of allowing himself to be\r\ncrushed by the tree at the foot of which he had assassinated little\r\nLouise Roque. So he determined to have the wood cut down and to simulate\r\nan accident. But the beech tree refused to crush his ribs.\r\n\r\nReturning to his house, a prey to utter despair, he had snatched up his\r\nrevolver, and then did not dare to fire it.\r\n\r\nThe dinner bell summoned him. He could eat nothing, and he went upstairs\r\nagain. And he did not know what to do. Now that he had escaped the first\r\ntime, he felt himself a coward. Presently he would be ready, brave,\r\ndecided, master of his courage and of his resolution; now he was weak\r\nand feared death as much as he did the dead girl.\r\n\r\nHe faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare not venture it again\xe2\x80\x94I dare not venture it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he glanced with terror, first at the revolver on the table and next\r\nat the curtain which hid his window. It seemed to him, moreover, that\r\nsomething horrible would occur as soon as his life was ended. Something?\r\nWhat? A meeting with her, perhaps. She was watching for him; she was\r\nwaiting for him; she was calling him; and it was in order to seize him\r\nin her turn, to draw him toward the doom that would avenge her, and to\r\nlead him to die, that she appeared thus every night.\r\n\r\nHe began to cry like a child, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not venture it again\xe2\x80\x94I will not venture it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he fell on his knees and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! my God!\xe2\x80\x9d without believing, nevertheless, in God. And he no\r\nlonger dared, in fact, to look at his window, where he knew the\r\napparition was hiding, nor at his table, where his revolver gleamed.\r\nWhen he had risen up he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis cannot last; there must be an end of it\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice in the silent room made a chill of fear pass\r\nthrough his limbs, but as he could not bring himself to come to a\r\ndetermination, as he felt certain that his finger would always refuse to\r\npull the trigger of his revolver, he turned round to hide his head under\r\nthe bedclothes and began to reflect.\r\n\r\nHe would have to find some way in which he could force himself to die,\r\nto play some trick on himself which would not permit of any hesitation\r\non his part, any delay, any possible regrets. He envied condemned\r\ncriminals who are led to the scaffold surrounded by soldiers. Oh! if he\r\ncould only beg of some one to shoot him; if after confessing his crime\r\nto a true friend who would never divulge it he could procure death at\r\nhis hand. But from whom could he ask this terrible service? From whom?\r\nHe thought of all the people he knew. The doctor? No, he would talk\r\nabout it afterward, most probably. And suddenly a fantastic idea entered\r\nhis mind. He would write to the magistrate, who was on terms of close\r\nfriendship with him, and would denounce himself as the perpetrator of\r\nthe crime. He would in this letter confess everything, revealing how his\r\nsoul had been tortured, how he had resolved to die, how he had hesitated\r\nabout carrying out his resolution and what means he had employed to\r\nstrengthen his failing courage. And in the name of their old friendship\r\nhe would implore of the other to destroy the letter as soon as he had\r\nascertained that the culprit had inflicted justice on himself. Renardet\r\ncould rely on this magistrate; he knew him to be true, discreet,\r\nincapable of even an idle word. He was one of those men who have an\r\ninflexible conscience, governed, directed, regulated by their reason\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he formed this project when a strange feeling of joy took\r\npossession of his heart. He was calm now. He would write his letter\r\nslowly, then at daybreak he would deposit it in the box nailed to the\r\noutside wall of his office; then he would ascend his tower to watch for\r\nthe postman's arrival; and when the man in the blue blouse had gone\r\naway, he would cast himself head foremost on the rocks on which the\r\nfoundations rested, He would take care to be seen first by the workmen\r\nwho had cut down his wood. He could climb to the projecting stone which\r\nbore the flagstaff displayed on festivals, He would smash this pole with\r\na shake and carry it along with him as he fell.\r\n\r\nWho would suspect that it was not an accident? And he would be killed\r\noutright, owing to his weight and the height of the tower.\r\n\r\nPresently he got out of bed, went over to the table and began to write.\r\nHe omitted nothing, not a single detail of the crime, not a single\r\ndetail of the torments of his heart, and he ended by announcing that he\r\nhad passed sentence on himself, that he was going to execute the\r\ncriminal, and begged his friend, his old friend, to be careful that\r\nthere should never be any stain on his memory.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished this letter he saw that the day had dawned.\r\n\r\nHe closed, sealed it and wrote the address. Then he descended with light\r\nsteps, hurried toward the little white box fastened to the outside wall\r\nin the corner of the farmhouse, and when he had thrown into it this\r\nletter, which made his hand tremble, he came back quickly, drew the\r\nbolts of the great door and climbed up to his tower to wait for the\r\npassing of the postman, who was to bear away his death sentence.\r\n\r\nHe felt self-possessed now. Liberated! Saved!\r\n\r\nA cold dry wind, an icy wind passed across his face. He inhaled it\r\neagerly with open mouth, drinking in its chilling kiss. The sky was red,\r\na wintry red, and all the plain, whitened with frost, glistened under\r\nthe first rays of the sun, as if it were covered with powdered glass.\r\n\r\nRenardet, standing up, his head bare, gazed at the vast tract of country\r\nbefore him, the meadows to the left and to the right the village whose\r\nchimneys were beginning to smoke in preparation for the morning meal. At\r\nhis feet he saw the Brindille flowing amid the rocks, where he would\r\nsoon be crushed to death. He felt new life on that beautiful frosty\r\nmorning. The light bathed him, entered his being like a new-born hope. A\r\nthousand recollections assailed him, recollections of similar mornings,\r\nof rapid walks on the hard earth which rang beneath his footsteps, of\r\nhappy days of shooting on the edges of pools where wild ducks sleep. All\r\nthe good things that he loved, the good things of existence, rushed to\r\nhis memory, penetrated him with fresh desires, awakened all the vigorous\r\nappetites of his active, powerful body.\r\n\r\nAnd he was about to die! Why? He was going to kill himself stupidly\r\nbecause he was afraid of a shadow-afraid of nothing! He was still rich\r\nand in the prime of life. What folly! All he needed was distraction,\r\nabsence, a voyage in order to forget.\r\n\r\nThis night even he had not seen the little girl because his mind was\r\npreoccupied and had wandered toward some other subject. Perhaps he would\r\nnot see her any more? And even if she still haunted him in this house,\r\ncertainly she would not follow him elsewhere! The earth was wide, the\r\nfuture was long.\r\n\r\nWhy should he die?\r\n\r\nHis glance travelled across the meadows, and he perceived a blue spot in\r\nthe path which wound alongside the Brindille. It was Mederic coming to\r\nbring letters from the town and to carry away those of the village.\r\n\r\nRenardet gave a start, a sensation of pain shot through his breast, and\r\nhe rushed down the winding staircase to get back his letter, to demand\r\nit back from the postman. Little did it matter to him now whether he was\r\nseen, He hurried across the grass damp from the light frost of the\r\nprevious night and arrived in front of the box in the corner of the\r\nfarmhouse exactly at the same time as the letter carrier.\r\n\r\nThe latter had opened the little wooden door and drew forth the four\r\npapers deposited there by the inhabitants of the locality.\r\n\r\nRenardet said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morrow, Mederic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morrow, Monsieur le Maire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Mederic, I threw a letter into the box that I want back again. I\r\ncame to ask you to give it back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's all right, Monsieur le Maire\xe2\x80\x94you'll get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the postman raised his eyes. He stood petrified at the sight of\r\nRenardet's face. The mayor's cheeks were purple, his eyes were anxious\r\nand sunken, with black circles round them, his hair was unbrushed, his\r\nbeard untrimmed, his necktie unfastened. It was evident that he had not\r\nbeen in bed.\r\n\r\nThe postman asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill, Monsieur le Maire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, suddenly comprehending that his appearance must be unusual,\r\nlost countenance and faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no-oh! no. Only I jumped out of bed to ask you for this letter. I\r\nwas asleep. You understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said in reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one you are going to give back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMederic now began to hesitate. The mayor's attitude did not strike him\r\nas natural. There was perhaps a secret in that letter, a political\r\nsecret. He knew Renardet was not a Republican, and he knew all the\r\ntricks and chicanery employed at elections.\r\n\r\nHe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom is it addressed, this letter of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Monsieur Putoin, the magistrate\xe2\x80\x94you know, my friend, Monsieur\r\nPutoin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe postman searched through the papers and found the one asked for.\r\nThen he began looking at it, turning it round and round between his\r\nfingers, much perplexed, much troubled by the fear of either committing\r\na grave offence or of making an enemy of the mayor.\r\n\r\nSeeing his hesitation, Renardet made a movement for the purpose of\r\nseizing the letter and snatching it away from him. This abrupt action\r\nconvinced Mederic that some important secret was at stake and made him\r\nresolve to do his duty, cost what it may.\r\n\r\nSo he flung the letter into his bag and fastened it up, with the reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can't, Monsieur le Maire. As long as it is for the magistrate, I\r\ncan't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA dreadful pang wrung Renardet's heart and he murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know me well. You are even able to recognize my handwriting. I\r\ntell you I want that paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Mederic, you know that I'm incapable of deceiving you\xe2\x80\x94I tell\r\nyou I want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tremor of rage passed through Renardet's soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it all, take care! You know that I never trifle and that I could\r\nget you out of your job, my good fellow, and without much delay, either,\r\nAnd then, I am the mayor of the district, after all; and I now order you\r\nto give me back that paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe postman answered firmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can't, Monsieur le Maire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon Renardet, losing his head, caught hold of the postman's arms\r\nin order to take away his bag; but, freeing himself by a strong effort,\r\nand springing backward, the letter carrier raised his big holly stick.\r\nWithout losing his temper, he said emphatically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't touch me, Monsieur le Maire, or I'll strike. Take care, I'm only\r\ndoing my duty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFeeling that he was lost, Renardet suddenly became humble, gentle,\r\nappealing to him like a whimpering child:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, look here, my friend, give me back that letter and I'll\r\nrecompense you\xe2\x80\x94I'll give you money. Stop! stop! I'll give you a hundred\r\nfrancs, you understand\xe2\x80\x94a hundred francs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe postman turned on his heel and started on his journey.\r\n\r\nRenardet followed him, out of breath, stammering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMederic, Mederic, listen! I'll give you a thousand francs, you\r\nunderstand\xe2\x80\x94a thousand francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe postman still went on without giving any answer.\r\n\r\nRenardet went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll make your fortune, you understand\xe2\x80\x94whatever you wish\xe2\x80\x94fifty thousand\r\nfrancs\xe2\x80\x94fifty thousand francs for that letter! What does it matter to\r\nyou? You won't? Well, a hundred thousand\xe2\x80\x94I say\xe2\x80\x94a hundred thousand\r\nfrancs. Do you understand? A hundred thousand francs\xe2\x80\x94a hundred thousand\r\nfrancs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe postman turned back, his face hard, his eye severe:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of this, or else I'll repeat to the magistrate everything you\r\nhave just said to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenardet stopped abruptly. It was all over. He turned back and rushed\r\ntoward his house, running like a hunted animal.\r\n\r\nThen, in his turn, Mederic stopped and watched his flight with\r\nstupefaction. He saw the mayor reenter his house, and he waited still,\r\nas if something astonishing were about to happen.\r\n\r\nIn fact, presently the tall form of Renardet appeared on the summit of\r\nthe Fox's tower. He ran round the platform like a madman. Then he seized\r\nthe flagstaff and shook it furiously without succeeding in breaking it;\r\nthen, all of a sudden, like a diver, with his two hands before him, he\r\nplunged into space.\r\n\r\nMederic rushed forward to his assistance. He saw the woodcutters going\r\nto work and called out to them, telling them an accident had occurred.\r\nAt the foot of the walls they found a bleeding body, its head crushed on\r\na rock. The Brindille surrounded this rock, and over its clear, calm\r\nwaters could be seen a long red thread of mingled brains and blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DONKEY\r\n\r\nThere was not a breath of air stirring; a heavy mist was lying over the\r\nriver. It was like a layer of cotton placed on the water. The banks\r\nthemselves were indistinct, hidden behind strange fogs. But day was\r\nbreaking and the hill was becoming visible. In the dawning light of day\r\nthe plaster houses began to appear like white spots. Cocks were crowing\r\nin the barnyard.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the river, hidden behind the fogs, just opposite\r\nFrette, a slight noise from time to time broke the dead silence of the\r\nquiet morning. At times it was an indistinct plashing, like the cautious\r\nadvance of a boat, then again a sharp noise like the rattle of an oar\r\nand then the sound of something dropping in the water. Then silence.\r\n\r\nSometimes whispered words, coming perhaps from a distance, perhaps from\r\nquite near, pierced through these opaque mists. They passed by like wild\r\nbirds which have slept in the rushes and which fly away at the first\r\nlight of day, crossing the mist and uttering a low and timid sound which\r\nwakes their brothers along the shores.\r\n\r\nSuddenly along the bank, near the village, a barely perceptible shadow\r\nappeared on the water. Then it grew, became more distinct and, coming\r\nout of the foggy curtain which hung over the river, a flatboat, manned\r\nby two men, pushed up on the grass.\r\n\r\nThe one who was rowing rose and took a pailful of fish from the bottom\r\nof the boat, then he threw the dripping net over his shoulder. His\r\ncompanion, who had not made a motion, exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Mailloche, get\r\nyour gun and see if we can't land some rabbit along the shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other one answered: \xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I'll be with you in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nhe disappeared, in order to hide their catch.\r\n\r\nThe man who had stayed in the boat slowly filled his pipe and lighted\r\nit. His name was Labouise, but he was called Chicot, and was in\r\npartnership with Maillochon, commonly called Mailloche, to practice the\r\ndoubtful and undefined profession of junk-gatherers along the shore.\r\n\r\nThey were a low order of sailors and they navigated regularly only in\r\nthe months of famine. The rest of the time they acted as junk-gatherers.\r\nRowing about on the river day and night, watching for any prey, dead or\r\nalive, poachers on the water and nocturnal hunters, sometimes ambushing\r\nvenison in the Saint-Germain forests, sometimes looking for drowned\r\npeople and searching their clothes, picking up floating rags and empty\r\nbottles; thus did Labouise and Maillochon live easily.\r\n\r\nAt times they would set out on foot about noon and stroll along straight\r\nahead. They would dine in some inn on the shore and leave again side by\r\nside. They would remain away for a couple of days; then one morning they\r\nwould be seen rowing about in the tub which they called their boat.\r\n\r\nAt Joinville or at Nogent some boatman would be looking for his boat,\r\nwhich had disappeared one night, probably stolen, while twenty or thirty\r\nmiles from there, on the Oise, some shopkeeper would be rubbing his\r\nhands, congratulating himself on the bargain he had made when he bought\r\na boat the day before for fifty francs, which two men offered him as\r\nthey were passing.\r\n\r\nMaillochon reappeared with his gun wrapped up in rags. He was a man of\r\nforty or fifty, tall and thin, with the restless eye of people who are\r\nworried by legitimate troubles and of hunted animals. His open shirt\r\nshowed his hairy chest, but he seemed never to have had any more hair on\r\nhis face than a short brush of a mustache and a few stiff hairs under\r\nhis lower lip. He was bald around the temples. When he took off the\r\ndirty cap that he wore his scalp seemed to be covered with a fluffy\r\ndown, like the body of a plucked chicken.\r\n\r\nChicot, on the contrary, was red, fat, short and hairy. He looked like a\r\nraw beefsteak. He continually kept his left eye closed, as if he were\r\naiming at something or at somebody, and when people jokingly cried to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cOpen your eye, Labouise!\xe2\x80\x9d he would answer quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cNever fear,\r\nsister, I open it when there's cause to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a habit of calling every one \xe2\x80\x9csister,\xe2\x80\x9d even his scavenger\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nHe took up the oars again, and once more the boat disappeared in the\r\nheavy mist, which was now turned snowy white in the pink-tinted sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of lead did you take, Maillochon?\xe2\x80\x9d Labouise asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery small, number nine; that's the best for rabbits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were approaching the other shore so slowly, so quietly that no\r\nnoise betrayed them. This bank belongs to the Saint-Germain forest and\r\nis the boundary line for rabbit hunting. It is covered with burrows\r\nhidden under the roots of trees, and the creatures at daybreak frisk\r\nabout, running in and out of the holes.\r\n\r\nMaillochon was kneeling in the bow, watching, his gun hidden on the\r\nfloor. Suddenly he seized it, aimed, and the report echoed for some time\r\nthroughout the quiet country.\r\n\r\nLabouise, in a few strokes, touched the beach, and his companion,\r\njumping to the ground, picked up a little gray rabbit, not yet dead.\r\n\r\nThen the boat once more disappeared into the fog in order to get to the\r\nother side, where it could keep away from the game wardens.\r\n\r\nThe two men seemed to be riding easily on the water. The weapon had\r\ndisappeared under the board which served as a hiding place and the\r\nrabbit was stuffed into Chicot's loose shirt.\r\n\r\nAfter about a quarter of an hour Labouise asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sister, shall we\r\nget one more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will suit me,\xe2\x80\x9d Maillochon answered.\r\n\r\nThe boat started swiftly down the current. The mist, which was hiding\r\nboth shores, was beginning to rise. The trees could be barely perceived,\r\nas through a veil, and the little clouds of fog were floating up from\r\nthe water. When they drew near the island, the end of which is opposite\r\nHerblay, the two men slackened their pace and began to watch. Soon a\r\nsecond rabbit was killed.\r\n\r\nThen they went down until they were half way to Conflans. Here they\r\nstopped their boat, tied it to a tree and went to sleep in the bottom of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Labouise would sit up and look over the horizon with\r\nhis open eye. The last of the morning mist had disappeared and the large\r\nsummer sun was climbing in the blue sky.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the river the vineyard-covered hill stretched out\r\nin a semicircle. One house stood out alone at the summit. Everything was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nSomething was moving slowly along the tow-path, advancing with\r\ndifficulty. It was a woman dragging a donkey. The stubborn, stiff-\r\njointed beast occasionally stretched out a leg in answer to its\r\ncompanion's efforts, and it proceeded thus, with outstretched neck and\r\nears lying flat, so slowly that one could not tell when it would ever be\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\nThe woman, bent double, was pulling, turning round occasionally to\r\nstrike the donkey with a stick.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw her, Labouise exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Mailloche!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMailloche answered: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant to have some fun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen hurry, sister; we're going to have a laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChicot took the oars. When he had crossed the river he stopped opposite\r\nthe woman and called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, sister!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman stopped dragging her donkey and looked.\r\n\r\nLabouise continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing\xe2\x80\x94going to the locomotive show?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman made no reply. Chicot continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, your trotter's prime for a race. Where are you taking him at that\r\nspeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last the woman answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to Macquart, at Champioux, to\r\nhave him killed. He's worthless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYou're right. How much do you think Macquart will\r\ngive you for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman wiped her forehead on the back of her hand and hesitated,\r\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know? Perhaps three francs, perhaps four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChicot exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cI'll give you five francs and your errand's done!\r\nHow's that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman considered the matter for a second and then exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men landed. Labouise grasped the animal by the bridle.\r\nMaillochon asked in surprise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you expect to do with that carcass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChicot this time opened his other eye in order to express his gaiety.\r\nHis whole red face was grinning with joy. He chuckled: \xe2\x80\x9cDon't worry,\r\nsister. I've got my idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave five francs to the woman, who then sat down by the road to see\r\nwhat was going to happen. Then Labouise, in great humor, got the gun and\r\nheld it out to Maillochon, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cEach one in turn; we're going after\r\nbig game, sister. Don't get so near or you'll kill it right away! You\r\nmust make the pleasure last a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed his companion about forty paces from the victim. The ass,\r\nfeeling itself free, was trying to get a little of the tall grass, but\r\nit was so exhausted that it swayed on its legs as if it were about to\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nMaillochon aimed slowly and said: \xe2\x80\x9cA little pepper for the ears; watch,\r\nGhicot!\xe2\x80\x9d And he fired.\r\n\r\nThe tiny shot struck the donkey's long ears and he began to shake them\r\nin order to get rid of the stinging sensation. The two men were doubled\r\nup with laughter and stamped their feet with joy. The woman, indignant,\r\nrushed forward; she did not want her donkey to be tortured, and she\r\noffered to return the five francs. Labouise threatened her with a\r\nthrashing and pretended to roll up his sleeves. He had paid, hadn't he?\r\nWell, then, he would take a shot at her skirts, just to show that it\r\ndidn't hurt. She went away, threatening to call the police. They could\r\nhear her protesting indignantly and cursing as she went her way.\r\n\r\nMaillochon held out the gun to his comrade, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's your turn,\r\nChicot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise aimed and fired. The donkey received the charge in his thighs,\r\nbut the shot was so small and came from such a distance that he thought\r\nhe was being stung by flies, for he began to thrash himself with his\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nLabouise sat down to laugh more comfortably, while Maillochon reloaded\r\nthe weapon, so happy that he seemed to sneeze into the barrel. He\r\nstepped forward a few paces, and, aiming at the same place that his\r\nfriend had shot at, he fired again. This time the beast started, tried\r\nto kick and turned its head. At last a little blood was running. It had\r\nbeen wounded and felt a sharp pain, for it tried to run away with a\r\nslow, limping, jerky gallop.\r\n\r\nBoth men darted after the beast, Maillochon with a long stride, Labouise\r\nwith the short, breathless trot of a little man. But the donkey, tired\r\nout, had stopped, and, with a bewildered look, was watching his two\r\nmurderers approach. Suddenly he stretched his neck and began to bray.\r\n\r\nLabouise, out of breath, had taken the gun. This time he walked right up\r\nclose, as he did not wish to begin the chase over again.\r\n\r\nWhen the poor beast had finished its mournful cry, like a last call for\r\nhelp, the man called: \xe2\x80\x9cHey, Mailloche! Come here, sister; I'm going to\r\ngive him some medicine.\xe2\x80\x9d And while the other man was forcing the\r\nanimal's mouth open, Chicot stuck the barrel of his gun down its throat,\r\nas if he were trying to make it drink a potion. Then he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook out,\r\nsister, here she goes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed the trigger. The donkey stumbled back a few steps, fell down,\r\ntried to get up again and finally lay on its side and closed its eyes:\r\nThe whole body was trembling, its legs were kicking as if it were,\r\ntrying to run. A stream of blood was oozing through its teeth. Soon it\r\nstopped moving. It was dead.\r\n\r\nThe two men went along, laughing. It was over too quickly; they had not\r\nhad their money's worth. Maillochon asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what are we going to\r\ndo now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise answered: \xe2\x80\x9cDon't worry, sister. Get the thing on the boat;\r\nwe're going to have some fun when night comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went and got the boat. The animal's body was placed on the bottom,\r\ncovered with fresh grass, and the two men stretched out on it and went\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nToward noon Labouise drew a bottle of wine, some bread and butter and\r\nraw onions from a hiding place in their muddy, worm-eaten boat, and they\r\nbegan to eat.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over they once more stretched out on the dead donkey\r\nand slept. At nightfall Labouise awoke and shook his comrade, who was\r\nsnoring like a buzzsaw. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered.\r\n\r\nMaillochon began to row. As they had plenty of time they went up the\r\nSeine slowly. They coasted along the reaches covered with water-lilies,\r\nand the heavy, mud-covered boat slipped over the lily pads and bent the\r\nflowers, which stood up again as soon as they had passed.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the wall of the Eperon, which separates the Saint-\r\nGermain forest from the Maisons-Laffitte Park, Labouise stopped his\r\ncompanion and explained his idea to him. Maillochon was moved by a\r\nprolonged, silent laugh.\r\n\r\nThey threw into the water the grass which had covered the body, took the\r\nanimal by the feet and hid it behind some bushes. Then they got into\r\ntheir boat again and went to Maisons-Laffitte.\r\n\r\nThe night was perfectly black when they reached the wine shop of old man\r\nJules. As soon as the dealer saw them he came up, shook hands with them\r\nand sat down at their table. They began to talk of one thing and\r\nanother. By eleven o'clock the last customer had left and old man Jules\r\nwinked at Labouise and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you got any?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise made a motion with his head and answered: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so, perhaps\r\nnot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dealer insisted: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you've not nothing but gray ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChicot dug his hands into his flannel shirt, drew out the ears of a\r\nrabbit and declared: \xe2\x80\x9cThree francs a pair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen began a long discussion about the price. Two francs sixty-five and\r\nthe two rabbits were delivered. As the two men were getting up to go,\r\nold man Jules, who had been watching them, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have something else, but you won't say what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise answered: \xe2\x80\x9cPossibly, but it is not for you; you're too stingy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man, growing eager, kept asking: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Something big? Perhaps\r\nwe might make a deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise, who seemed perplexed, pretended to consult Maillochon with a\r\nglance. Then he answered in a slow voice: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is how it is. We were in\r\nthe bushes at Eperon when something passed right near us, to the left,\r\nat the end of the wall. Mailloche takes a shot and it drops. We skipped\r\non account of the game people. I can't tell you what it is, because I\r\ndon't know. But it's big enough. But what is it? If I told you I'd be\r\nlying, and you know, sister, between us everything's above-board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnxiously the man asked: \xe2\x80\x9cThink it's venison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise answered: \xe2\x80\x9cMight be and then again it might not! Venison?\xe2\x80\x94uh!\r\nuh!\xe2\x80\x94might be a little big for that! Mind you, I don't say it's a doe,\r\nbecause I don't know, but it might be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill the dealer insisted: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it's a buck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise stretched out his hand, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it's not that! It's\r\nnot a buck. I should have seen the horns. No, it's not a buck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn't you bring it with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, sister, from now on I sell from where I stand. Plenty of\r\npeople will buy. All you have to do is to take a walk over there, find\r\nthe thing and take it. No risk for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper, growing suspicious, exclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing he wasn't\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabouise once more raised his hand and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's there, I swear!\xe2\x80\x94first bush to the left. What it is, I don't know.\r\nBut it's not a buck, I'm positive. It's for you to find out what it is.\r\nTwenty-five francs, cash down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill the man hesitated: \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn't you bring it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaillochon exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed! You know our price! Take it or leave\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dealer decided: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a bargain for twenty francs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they shook hands over the deal.\r\n\r\nThen he took out four big five-franc pieces from the cash drawer, and\r\nthe two friends pocketed the money. Labouise arose, emptied his glass\r\nand left. As he was disappearing in the shadows he turned round to\r\nexclaim: \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't a buck. I don't know what it is!\xe2\x80\x94but it's there. I'll\r\ngive you back your money if you find nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he disappeared in the darkness. Maillochon, who was following him,\r\nkept punching him in the back to express his joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOIRON\r\n\r\nAs we were still talking about Pranzini, M. Maloureau, who had been\r\nattorney general under the Empire, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I formerly knew a very\r\ncurious affair, curious for several reasons, as you will see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at that time imperial attorney in one of the provinces. I had to\r\ntake up the case which has remained famous under the name of the Moiron\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Moiron, who was a teacher in the north of France, enjoyed an\r\nexcellent reputation throughout the whole country. He was a person of\r\nintelligence, quiet, very religious, a little taciturn; he had married\r\nin the district of Boislinot, where he exercised his profession. He had\r\nhad three children, who had died of consumption, one after the other.\r\nFrom this time he seemed to bestow upon the youngsters confided to his\r\ncare all the tenderness of his heart. With his own money he bought toys\r\nfor his best scholars and for the good boys; he gave them little dinners\r\nand stuffed them with delicacies, candy and cakes: Everybody loved this\r\ngood man with his big heart, when suddenly five of his pupils died, in a\r\nstrange manner, one after the other. It was supposed that there was an\r\nepidemic due to the condition of the water, resulting from drought; they\r\nlooked for the causes without being able to discover them, the more so\r\nthat the symptoms were so peculiar. The children seemed to be attacked\r\nby a feeling of lassitude; they would not eat, they complained of pains\r\nin their stomachs, dragged along for a short time, and died in frightful\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA post-mortem examination was held over the last one, but nothing was\r\ndiscovered. The vitals were sent to Paris and analyzed, and they\r\nrevealed the presence of no toxic substance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a year nothing new developed; then two little boys, the best\r\nscholars in the class, Moiron's favorites, died within four days of each\r\nother. An examination of the bodies was again ordered, and in both of\r\nthem were discovered tiny fragments of crushed glass. The conclusion\r\narrived at was that the two youngsters must imprudently have eaten from\r\nsome carelessly cleaned receptacle. A glass broken over a pail of milk\r\ncould have produced this frightful accident, and the affair would have\r\nbeen pushed no further if Moiron's servant had not been taken sick at\r\nthis time. The physician who was called in noticed the same symptoms he\r\nhad seen in the children. He questioned her and obtained the admission\r\nthat she had stolen and eaten some candies that had been bought by the\r\nteacher for his scholars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn an order from the court the schoolhouse was searched, and a closet\r\nwas found which was full of toys and dainties destined for the children.\r\nAlmost all these delicacies contained bits of crushed glass or pieces of\r\nbroken needles!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoiron was immediately arrested; but he seemed so astonished and\r\nindignant at the suspicion hanging over him that he was almost released.\r\nHow ever, indications of his guilt kept appearing, and baffled in my\r\nmind my first conviction, based on his excellent reputation, on his\r\nwhole life, on the complete absence of any motive for such a crime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should this good, simple, religious man have killed little\r\nchildren, and the very children whom he seemed to love the most, whom he\r\nspoiled and stuffed with sweet things, for whom he spent half his salary\r\nin buying toys and bonbons?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne must consider him insane to believe him guilty of this act. Now,\r\nMoiron seemed so normal, so quiet, so rational and sensible that it\r\nseemed impossible to adjudge him insane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the proofs kept growing! In none of the candies that were\r\nbought at the places where the schoolmaster secured his provisions could\r\nthe slightest trace of anything suspicious be found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe then insisted that an unknown enemy must have opened his cupboard\r\nwith a false key in order to introduce the glass and the needles into\r\nthe eatables. And he made up a whole story of an inheritance dependent\r\non the death of a child, determined on and sought by some peasant, and\r\npromoted thus by casting suspicions on the schoolmaster. This brute, he\r\nclaimed, did not care about the other children who were forced to die as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story was possible. The man appeared to be so sure of himself and\r\nin such despair that we should undoubtedly have acquitted him,\r\nnotwithstanding the charges against him, if two crushing discoveries had\r\nnot been made, one after the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first one was a snuffbox full of crushed glass; his own snuffbox,\r\nhidden in the desk where he kept his money!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe explained this new find in an acceptable manner, as the ruse of the\r\nreal unknown criminal. But a mercer from Saint-Marlouf came to the\r\npresiding judge and said that a gentleman had several times come to his\r\nstore to buy some needles; and he always asked for the thinnest needles\r\nhe could find, and would break them to see whether they pleased him. The\r\nman was brought forward in the presence of a dozen or more persons, and\r\nimmediately recognized Moiron. The inquest revealed that the\r\nschoolmaster had indeed gone into Saint-Marlouf on the days mentioned by\r\nthe tradesman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will pass over the terrible testimony of children on the choice of\r\ndainties and the care which he took to have them eat the things in his\r\npresence, and to remove the slightest traces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPublic indignation demanded capital punishment, and it became more and\r\nmore insistent, overturning all objections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoiron was condemned to death, and his appeal was rejected. Nothing was\r\nleft for him but the imperial pardon. I knew through my father that the\r\nemperor would not grant it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne morning, as I was working in my study, the visit of the prison\r\nalmoner was announced. He was an old priest who knew men well and\r\nunderstood the habits of criminals. He seemed troubled, ill at ease,\r\nnervous. After talking for a few minutes about one thing and another, he\r\narose and said suddenly: 'If Moiron is executed, monsieur, you will have\r\nput an innocent man to death.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he left without bowing, leaving me behind with the deep impression\r\nmade by his words. He had pronounced them in such a sincere and solemn\r\nmanner, opening those lips, closed and sealed by the secret of\r\nconfession, in order to save a life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour later I left for Paris, and my father immediately asked that I\r\nbe granted an audience with the emperor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe following day I was received. His majesty was working in a little\r\nreception room when we were introduced. I described the whole case, and\r\nI was just telling about the priest's visit when a door opened behind\r\nthe sovereign's chair and the empress, who supposed he was alone,\r\nappeared. His majesty, Napoleon, consulted her. As soon as she had heard\r\nthe matter, she exclaimed: 'This man must be pardoned. He must, since he\r\nis innocent.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did this sudden conviction of a religious woman cast a terrible\r\ndoubt in my mind?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil then I had ardently desired a change of sentence. And now I\r\nsuddenly felt myself the toy, the dupe of a cunning criminal who had\r\nemployed the priest and confession as a last means of defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI explained my hesitancy to their majesties. The emperor remained\r\nundecided, urged on one side by his natural kindness and held back on\r\nthe other by the fear of being deceived by a criminal; but the empress,\r\nwho was convinced that the priest had obeyed a divine inspiration, kept\r\nrepeating: 'Never mind! It is better to spare a criminal than to kill an\r\ninnocent man!' Her advice was taken. The death sentence was commuted to\r\none of hard labor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few years later I heard that Moiron had again been called to the\r\nemperor's attention on account of his exemplary conduct in the prison at\r\nToulon and was now employed as a servant by the director of the\r\npenitentiary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a long time I heard nothing more of this man. But about two years\r\nago, while I was spending a summer near Lille with my cousin, De\r\nLarielle, I was informed one evening, just as we were sitting down to\r\ndinner, that a young priest wished to speak to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had him shown in and he begged me to come to a dying man who desired\r\nabsolutely to see me. This had often happened to me in my long career as\r\na magistrate, and, although I had been set aside by the Republic, I was\r\nstill often called upon in similar circumstances. I therefore followed\r\nthe priest, who led me to a miserable little room in a large tenement\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere I found a strange-looking man on a bed of straw, sitting with his\r\nback against the wall, in order to get his breath. He was a sort of\r\nskeleton, with dark, gleaming eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as he saw me, he murmured: 'Don't you recognize me?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am Moiron.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt a shiver run through me, and I asked 'The schoolmaster?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How do you happen to be here?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The story is too long. I haven't time to tell it. I was going to die\r\n\xe2\x80\x94and that priest was brought to me\xe2\x80\x94and as I knew that you were here I\r\nsent for you. It is to you that I wish to confess\xe2\x80\x94since you were the one\r\nwho once saved my life.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis hands clutched the straw of his bed through the sheet and he\r\ncontinued in a hoarse, forcible and low tone: 'You see\xe2\x80\x94I owe you the\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94I owe it to you\xe2\x80\x94for it must be told to some one before I leave\r\nthis earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is I who killed the children\xe2\x80\x94all of them. I did it\xe2\x80\x94for revenge!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Listen. I was an honest, straightforward, pure man\xe2\x80\x94adoring God\xe2\x80\x94this\r\ngood Father\xe2\x80\x94this Master who teaches us to love, and not the false God,\r\nthe executioner, the robber, the murderer who governs the earth. I had\r\nnever done any harm; I had never committed an evil act. I was as good as\r\nit is possible to be, monsieur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I married and had children, and I loved them as no father or mother\r\never loved their children. I lived only for them. I was wild about them.\r\nAll three of them died! Why? why? What had I done? I was rebellious,\r\nfurious; and suddenly my eyes were opened as if I were waking up out of\r\na sleep. I understood that God is bad. Why had He killed my children? I\r\nopened my eyes and saw that He loves to kill. He loves only that,\r\nmonsieur. He gives life but to destroy it! God, monsieur, is a murderer!\r\nHe needs death every day. And He makes it of every variety, in order the\r\nbetter to be amused. He has invented sickness and accidents in order to\r\ngive Him diversion all through the months and the years; and when He\r\ngrows tired of this, He has epidemics, the plague, cholera, diphtheria,\r\nsmallpox, everything possible! But this does not satisfy Him; all these\r\nthings are too similar; and so from time to time He has wars, in order\r\nto see two hundred thousand soldiers killed at once, crushed in blood\r\nand in the mud, blown apart, their arms and legs torn off, their heads\r\nsmashed by bullets, like eggs that fall on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'But this is not all. He has made men who eat each other. And then, as\r\nmen become better than He, He has made beasts, in order to see men hunt\r\nthem, kill them and eat them. That is not all. He has made tiny little\r\nanimals which live one day, flies who die by the millions in one hour,\r\nants which we are continually crushing under our feet, and so many, many\r\nothers that we cannot even imagine. And all these things are continually\r\nkilling each other and dying. And the good Lord looks on and is amused,\r\nfor He sees everything, the big ones as well as the little ones, those\r\nwho are in the drops of water and those in the other firmaments. He\r\nwatches them and is amused. Wretch!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then, monsieur, I began to kill children. I played a trick on Him. He\r\ndid not get those. It was not He, but I! And I would have killed many\r\nothers, but you caught me. There!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I was to be executed. I! How He would have laughed! Then I asked for a\r\npriest, and I lied. I confessed to him. I lied and I lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Now, all is over. I can no longer escape from Him. I no longer fear\r\nHim, monsieur; I despise Him too much.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis poor wretch was frightful to see as he lay there gasping, opening\r\nan enormous mouth in order to utter words which could scarcely be heard,\r\nhis breath rattling, picking at his bed and moving his thin legs under a\r\ngrimy sheet as though trying to escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! The mere remembrance of it is frightful!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You have nothing more to say?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, monsieur.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then, farewell.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Farewell, monsieur, till some day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned to the ashen-faced priest, whose dark outline stood out\r\nagainst the wall, and asked: 'Are you going to stay here, Monsieur\r\nl'Abbe?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the dying man sneered: 'Yes, yes, He sends His vultures to the\r\ncorpses.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had had enough of this. I opened the door and ran away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISPENSER OF HOLY WATER\r\n\r\nHe lived formerly in a little house beside the high road outside the\r\nvillage. He had set up in business as a wheelwright, after marrying the\r\ndaughter of a farmer of the neighborhood, and as they were both\r\nindustrious, they managed to save up a nice little fortune. But they had\r\nno children, and this caused them great sorrow. Finally a son was born,\r\nwhom they named Jean. They both loved and petted him, enfolding him with\r\ntheir affection, and were unwilling to let him be out of their sight.\r\n\r\nWhen he was five years old some mountebanks passed through the country\r\nand set up their tent in the town hall square.\r\n\r\nJean, who had seen them pass by, made his escape from the house, and\r\nafter his father had made a long search for him, he found him among the\r\nlearned goats and trick dogs, uttering shouts of laughter and sitting on\r\nthe knees of an old clown.\r\n\r\nThree days later, just as they were sitting down to dinner, the\r\nwheelwright and his wife noticed that their son was not in the house.\r\nThey looked for him in the garden, and as they did not find him, his\r\nfather went out into the road and shouted at the top of his voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight came on. A brown vapor arose making distant objects look still\r\nfarther away and giving them a dismal, weird appearance. Three tall\r\npines, close at hand, seemed to be weeping. Still there was no reply,\r\nbut the air appeared to be full of indistinct sighing. The father\r\nlistened for some time, thinking he heard a sound first in one\r\ndirection, then in another, and, almost beside himself, he ran, out into\r\nthe night, calling incessantly \xe2\x80\x9cJean! Jean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ran along thus until daybreak, filling the, darkness with his shouts,\r\nterrifying stray animals, torn by a terrible anguish and fearing that he\r\nwas losing his mind. His wife, seated on the stone step of their home,\r\nsobbed until morning.\r\n\r\nThey did not find their son. They both aged rapidly in their\r\ninconsolable sorrow. Finally they sold their house and set out to search\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThey inquired of the shepherds on the hillsides, of the tradesmen\r\npassing by, of the peasants in the villages and of the authorities in\r\nthe towns. But their boy had been lost a long time and no one knew\r\nanything about him. He had probably forgotten his own name by this time\r\nand also the name of his village, and his parents wept in silence,\r\nhaving lost hope.\r\n\r\nBefore long their money came to an end, and they worked out by the day\r\nin the farms and inns, doing the most menial work, eating what was left\r\nfrom the tables, sleeping on the ground and suffering from cold. Then as\r\nthey became enfeebled by hard work no one would employ them any longer,\r\nand they were forced to beg along the high roads. They accosted passers-\r\nby in an entreating voice and with sad, discouraged faces; they begged a\r\nmorsel of bread from the harvesters who were dining around a tree in the\r\nfields at noon, and they ate in silence seated on the edge of a ditch.\r\nAn innkeeper to whom they told their story said to them one day:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know some one who had lost their daughter, and they found her in\r\nParis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey at once set out for Paris.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the great city they were bewildered by its size and by\r\nthe crowds that they saw. But they knew that Jean must be in the midst\r\nof all these people, though they did not know how to set about looking\r\nfor him. Then they feared that they might not recognize him, for he was\r\nonly five years old when they last saw him.\r\n\r\nThey visited every place, went through all the streets, stopping\r\nwhenever they saw a group of people, hoping for some providential\r\nmeeting, some extraordinary luck, some compassionate fate.\r\n\r\nThey frequently walked at haphazard straight ahead, leaning one against\r\nthe other, looking so sad and poverty-stricken that people would give\r\nthem alms without their asking.\r\n\r\nThey spent every Sunday at the doors of the churches, watching the\r\ncrowds entering and leaving, trying to distinguish among the faces one\r\nthat might be familiar. Several times they thought they recognized him,\r\nbut always found they had made a mistake.\r\n\r\nIn the vestibule of one of the churches which they visited the most\r\nfrequently there was an old dispenser of holy Water who had become their\r\nfriend. He also had a very sad history, and their sympathy for him had\r\nestablished a bond of close friendship between them. It ended by them\r\nall three living together in a poor lodging on the top floor of a large\r\nhouse situated at some distance, quite on the outskirts of the city, and\r\nthe wheelwright would sometimes take his new friend's place at the\r\nchurch when the latter was ill.\r\n\r\nWinter came, a very severe winter. The poor holy water sprinkler died\r\nand the parish priest appointed the wheelwright, whose misfortunes had\r\ncome to his knowledge, to replace him. He went every morning and sat in\r\nthe same place, on the same chair, wearing away the old stone pillar by\r\ncontinually leaning against it. He would gaze steadily at every man who\r\nentered the church and looked forward to Sunday with as much impatience\r\nas a schoolboy, for on that day the church was filled with people from\r\nmorning till night.\r\n\r\nHe became very old, growing weaker each day from the dampness of the\r\nchurch, and his hope oozed away gradually.\r\n\r\nHe now knew by sight all the people who came to the services; he knew\r\ntheir hours, their manners, could distinguish their step on the stone\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nHis interests had become so contracted that the entrance of a stranger\r\nin the church was for him a great event. One day two ladies came in; one\r\nwas old, the other young\xe2\x80\x94a mother and daughter probably. Behind them\r\ncame a man who was following them. He bowed to them as they came out,\r\nand after offering them some holy water, he took the arm of the elder\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be the fiance of the younger one,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the wheelwright.\r\nAnd until evening he kept trying to recall where he had formerly seen a\r\nyoung man who resembled this one. But the one he was thinking of must be\r\nan old man by this time, for it seemed as if he had known him down home\r\nin his youth.\r\n\r\nThe same man frequently came again to walk home with the ladies, and\r\nthis vague, distant, familiar resemblance which he could not place\r\nworried the old man so much that he made his wife come with him to see\r\nif she could help his impaired memory.\r\n\r\nOne evening as it was growing dusk the three strangers entered together.\r\nWhen they had passed the old man said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife anxiously tried to ransack her memory. Suddenly she said in a\r\nlow tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94but he is darker, taller, stouter and is dressed like a\r\ngentleman, but, father, all the same, it is your face when you were\r\nyoung!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man started violently.\r\n\r\nIt was true. He looked like himself and also like his brother who was\r\ndead, and like his father, whom he remembered while he was yet young.\r\nThe old couple were so affected that they could not speak. The three\r\npersons came out and were about to leave the church.\r\n\r\nThe man touched his finger to the holy water sprinkler. Then the old\r\nman, whose hand was trembling so that he was fairly sprinkling the\r\nground with holy water, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man stopped and looked at him.\r\n\r\nHe repeated in a lower tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two women looked at them without understanding.\r\n\r\nHe then said for the third time, sobbing as he did so:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man stooped down, with his face close to the old man's, and as a\r\nmemory of his childhood dawned on him he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa Pierre, Mamma Jeanne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten everything, his father's surname and the name of his\r\nnative place, but he always remembered those two words that he had so\r\noften repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cPapa Pierre, Mamma Jeanne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sank to the floor, his face on the old man's knees, and he wept,\r\nkissing now his father and then his mother, while they were almost\r\nbreathless from intense joy.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies also wept, understanding as they did that some great\r\nhappiness had come to pass.\r\n\r\nThen they all went to the young man's house and he told them his\r\nhistory. The circus people had carried him off. For three years he\r\ntraveled with them in various countries. Then the troupe disbanded, and\r\none day an old lady in a chateau had paid to have him stay with her\r\nbecause she liked his appearance. As he was intelligent, he was sent to\r\nschool, then to college, and the old lady having no children, had left\r\nhim all her money. He, for his part, had tried to find his parents, but\r\nas he could remember only the two names, \xe2\x80\x9cPapa Pierre, Mamma Jeanne,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nhad been unable to do so. Now he was about to be married, and he\r\nintroduced his fiancee, who was very good and very pretty.\r\n\r\nWhen the two old people had told their story in their turn he kissed\r\nthem once more. They sat up very late that night, not daring to retire\r\nlest the happiness they had so long sought should escape them again\r\nwhile they were asleep.\r\n\r\nBut misfortune had lost its hold on them and they were happy for the\r\nrest of their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PARRICIDE\r\n\r\nThe lawyer had presented a plea of insanity. How could anyone explain\r\nthis strange crime otherwise?\r\n\r\nOne morning, in the grass near Chatou, two bodies had been found, a man\r\nand a woman, well known, rich, no longer young and married since the\r\npreceding year, the woman having been a widow for three years before.\r\n\r\nThey were not known to have enemies; they had not been robbed. They\r\nseemed to have been thrown from the roadside into the river, after\r\nhaving been struck, one after the other, with a long iron spike.\r\n\r\nThe investigation revealed nothing. The boatmen, who had been\r\nquestioned, knew nothing. The matter was about to be given up, when a\r\nyoung carpenter from a neighboring village, Georges Louis, nicknamed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Bourgeois,\xe2\x80\x9d gave himself up.\r\n\r\nTo all questions he only answered this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had known the man for two years, the woman for six months. They often\r\nhad me repair old furniture for them, because I am a clever workman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when he was asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you kill them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would obstinately answer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI killed them because I wanted to kill them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey could get nothing more out of him.\r\n\r\nThis man was undoubtedly an illegitimate child, put out to nurse and\r\nthen abandoned. He had no other name than Georges Louis, but as on\r\ngrowing up he became particularly intelligent, with the good taste and\r\nnative refinement which his acquaintances did not have, he was nicknamed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Bourgeois,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was never called otherwise. He had become\r\nremarkably clever in the trade of a carpenter, which he had taken up. He\r\nwas also said to be a socialist fanatic, a believer in communistic and\r\nnihilistic doctrines, a great reader of bloodthirsty novels, an\r\ninfluential political agitator and a clever orator in the public\r\nmeetings of workmen or of farmers.\r\n\r\nHis lawyer had pleaded insanity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, how could one imagine that this workman should kill his best\r\ncustomers, rich and generous (as he knew), who in two years had enabled\r\nhim to earn three thousand francs (his books showed it)? Only one\r\nexplanation could be offered: insanity, the fixed idea of the unclassed\r\nindividual who reeks vengeance on two bourgeois, on all the bourgeoisie,\r\nand the lawyer made a clever allusion to this nickname of \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nBourgeois,\xe2\x80\x9d given throughout the neighborhood to this poor wretch. He\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this irony not enough to unbalance the mind of this poor wretch, who\r\nhas neither father nor mother? He is an ardent republican. What am I\r\nsaying? He even belongs to the same political party, the members of\r\nwhich, formerly shot or exiled by the government, it now welcomes with\r\nopen arms this party to which arson is a principle and murder an\r\nordinary occurrence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese gloomy doctrines, now applauded in public meetings, have ruined\r\nthis man. He has heard republicans\xe2\x80\x94even women, yes, women\xe2\x80\x94ask for the\r\nblood of M. Gambetta, the blood of M. Grevy; his weakened mind gave way;\r\nhe wanted blood, the blood of a bourgeois!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not he whom you should condemn, gentlemen; it is the Commune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverywhere could be heard murmurs of assent. Everyone felt that the\r\nlawyer had won his case. The prosecuting attorney did not oppose him.\r\n\r\nThen the presiding judge asked the accused the customary question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrisoner, is there anything that you wish to add to your defense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man stood up.\r\n\r\nHe was a short, flaxen blond, with calm, clear, gray eyes. A strong,\r\nfrank, sonorous voice came from this frail-looking boy and, at the first\r\nwords, quickly changed the opinion which had been formed of him.\r\n\r\nHe spoke loud in a declamatory manner, but so distinctly that every word\r\ncould be understood in the farthest corners of the big hall:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, as I do not wish to go to an insane asylum, and as I even\r\nprefer death to that, I will tell everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI killed this man and this woman because they were my parents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, listen, and judge me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman, having given birth to a boy, sent him out, somewhere, to a\r\nnurse. Did she even know where her accomplice carried this innocent\r\nlittle being, condemned to eternal misery, to the shame of an\r\nillegitimate birth; to more than that\xe2\x80\x94to death, since he was abandoned\r\nand the nurse, no longer receiving the monthly pension, might, as they\r\noften do, let him die of hunger and neglect!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman who nursed me was honest, better, more noble, more of a\r\nmother than my own mother. She brought me up. She did wrong in doing her\r\nduty. It is more humane to let them die, these little wretches who are\r\ncast away in suburban villages just as garbage is thrown away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grew up with the indistinct impression that I was carrying some\r\nburden of shame. One day the other children called me a 'b\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94-'. They did\r\nnot know the meaning of this word, which one of them had heard at home.\r\nI was also ignorant of its meaning, but I felt the sting all the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was, I may say, one of the cleverest boys in the school. I would have\r\nbeen a good man, your honor, perhaps a man of superior intellect, if my\r\nparents had not committed the crime of abandoning me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis crime was committed against me. I was the victim, they were the\r\nguilty ones. I was defenseless, they were pitiless. Their duty was to\r\nlove me, they rejected me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owed them life\xe2\x80\x94but is life a boon? To me, at any rate, it was a\r\nmisfortune. After their shameful desertion, I owed them only vengeance.\r\nThey committed against me the most inhuman, the most infamous, the most\r\nmonstrous crime which can be committed against a human creature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man who has been insulted, strikes; a man who has been robbed, takes\r\nback his own by force. A man who has been deceived, played upon,\r\ntortured, kills; a man who has been slapped, kills; a man who has been\r\ndishonored, kills. I have been robbed, deceived, tortured, morally\r\nslapped, dishonored, all this to a greater degree than those whose anger\r\nyou excuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI revenged myself, I killed. It was my legitimate right. I took their\r\nhappy life in exchange for the terrible one which they had forced on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will call me parricide! Were these people my parents, for whom I\r\nwas an abominable burden, a terror, an infamous shame; for whom my birth\r\nwas a calamity and my life a threat of disgrace? They sought a selfish\r\npleasure; they got an unexpected child. They suppressed the child. My\r\nturn came to do the same for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, up to quite recently, I was ready to love them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I have said, this man, my father, came to me for the first time two\r\nyears ago. I suspected nothing. He ordered two pieces of furniture. I\r\nfound out, later on, that, under the seal of secrecy, naturally, he had\r\nsought information from the priest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe returned often. He gave me a lot of work and paid me well. Sometimes\r\nhe would even talk to me of one thing or another. I felt a growing\r\naffection for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning of this year he brought with him his wife, my mother.\r\nWhen she entered she was trembling so that I thought her to be suffering\r\nfrom some nervous disease. Then she asked for a seat and a glass of\r\nwater. She said nothing; she looked around abstractedly at my work and\r\nonly answered 'yes' and 'no,' at random, to all the questions which he\r\nasked her. When she had left I thought her a little unbalanced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe following month they returned. She was calm, self-controlled. That\r\nday they chattered for a long time, and they left me a rather large\r\norder. I saw her three more times, without suspecting anything. But one\r\nday she began to talk to me of my life, of my childhood, of my parents.\r\nI answered: 'Madame, my parents were wretches who deserted me.' Then she\r\nclutched at her heart and fell, unconscious. I immediately thought: 'She\r\nis my mother!' but I took care not to let her notice anything. I wished\r\nto observe her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, in turn, sought out information about them. I learned that they had\r\nbeen married since last July, my mother having been a widow for only\r\nthree years. There had been rumors that they had loved each other during\r\nthe lifetime of the first husband, but there was no proof of it. I was\r\nthe proof\xe2\x80\x94the proof which they had at first hidden and then hoped to\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited. She returned one evening, escorted as usual by my father.\r\nThat day she seemed deeply moved, I don't know why. Then, as she was\r\nleaving, she said to me: 'I wish you success, because you seem to me to\r\nbe honest and a hard worker; some day you will undoubtedly think of\r\ngetting married. I have come to help you to choose freely the woman who\r\nmay suit you. I was married against my inclination once and I know what\r\nsuffering it causes. Now I am rich, childless, free, mistress of my\r\nfortune. Here is your dowry.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe held out to me a large, sealed envelope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked her straight in the eyes and then said: 'Are you my mother?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe drew back a few steps and hid her face in her hands so as not to\r\nsee me. He, the man, my father, supported her in his arms and cried out\r\nto me: 'You must be crazy!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered: 'Not in the least. I know that you are my parents. I cannot\r\nbe thus deceived. Admit it and I will keep the secret; I will bear you\r\nno ill will; I will remain what I am, a carpenter.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe retreated towards the door, still supporting his wife who was\r\nbeginning to sob. Quickly I locked the door, put the key in my pocket\r\nand continued: 'Look at her and dare to deny that she is my mother.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he flew into a passion, very pale, terrified at the thought that\r\nthe scandal, which had so far been avoided, might suddenly break out;\r\nthat their position, their good name, their honor might all at once be\r\nlost. He stammered out: 'You are a rascal, you wish to get money from\r\nus! That's the thanks we get for trying to help such common people!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother, bewildered, kept repeating: 'Let's get out of here, let's\r\nget out!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, when he found the door locked, he exclaimed: 'If you do not open\r\nthis door immediately, I will have you thrown into prison for blackmail\r\nand assault!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had remained calm; I opened the door and saw them disappear in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I seemed to have been suddenly orphaned, deserted, pushed to the\r\nwall. I was seized with an overwhelming sadness, mingled with anger,\r\nhatred, disgust; my whole being seemed to rise up in revolt against the\r\ninjustice, the meanness, the dishonor, the rejected love. I began to\r\nrun, in order to overtake them along the Seine, which they had to follow\r\nin order to reach the station of Chaton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI soon caught up with them. It was now pitch dark. I was creeping up\r\nbehind them softly, that they might not hear me. My mother was still\r\ncrying. My father was saying: 'It's all your own fault. Why did you wish\r\nto see him? It was absurd in our position. We could have helped him from\r\nafar, without showing ourselves. Of what use are these dangerous visits,\r\nsince we can't recognize him?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I rushed up to them, beseeching. I cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You see! You are my parents. You have already rejected me once; would\r\nyou repulse me again?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, your honor, he struck me. I swear it on my honor, before the law\r\nand my country. He struck me, and as I seized him by the collar, he drew\r\nfrom his pocket a revolver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blood rushed to my head, I no longer knew what I was doing, I had\r\nmy compass in my pocket; I struck him with it as often as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she began to cry: 'Help! murder!' and to pull my beard. It seems\r\nthat I killed her also. How do I know what I did then?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, when I saw them both lying on the ground, without thinking, I\r\nthrew them into the Seine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's all. Now sentence me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner sat down. After this revelation the case was carried over\r\nto the following session. It comes up very soon. If we were jurymen,\r\nwhat would we do with this parricide?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERTHA\r\n\r\nDr. Bonnet, my old friend\xe2\x80\x94one sometimes has friends older than one's\r\nself\xe2\x80\x94had often invited me to spend some time with him at Riom, and, as I\r\ndid not know Auvergne, I made up my mind to visit him in the summer of\r\n1876.\r\n\r\nI arrived by the morning train, and the first person I saw on the\r\nplatform was the doctor. He was dressed in a gray suit, and wore a soft,\r\nblack, wide-brimmed, high-crowned felt hat, narrow at the top like a\r\nchimney pot, a hat which hardly any one except an Auvergnat would wear,\r\nand which reminded one of a charcoal burner. Dressed like that, the\r\ndoctor had the appearance of an old young man, with his spare body under\r\nhis thin coat, and his large head covered with white hair.\r\n\r\nHe embraced me with that evident pleasure which country people feel when\r\nthey meet long-expected friends, and, stretching out his arm, he said\r\nproudly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Auvergne!\xe2\x80\x9d I saw nothing before me except a range of mountains,\r\nwhose summits, which resembled truncated cones, must have been extinct\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nThen, pointing to the name of the station, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRiom, the fatherland of magistrates, the pride of the magistracy, and\r\nwhich ought rather to be the fatherland of doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d I, asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you transpose the letters, you have\r\nthe Latin word 'mori', to die. That is the reason why I settled here, my\r\nyoung friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, delighted at his own joke, he carried me off, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had swallowed a cup of coffee, he made me go and see the\r\ntown. I admired the druggist's house, and the other noted houses, which\r\nwere all black, but as pretty as bric-a-brac, with their facades of\r\nsculptured stone. I admired the statue of the Virgin, the patroness of\r\nbutchers, and he told me an amusing story about this, which I will\r\nrelate some other time, and then Dr. Bonnet said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg you to excuse me for a few minutes while I go and see a\r\npatient, and then I will take you to Chatel-Guyon, so as to show you the\r\ngeneral aspect of the town, and all the mountain chain of the Puy-de-\r\nDome before lunch. You can wait for me outside; I shall only go upstairs\r\nand come down immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left me outside one of those old, gloomy, silent, melancholy houses,\r\nwhich one sees in the provinces, and this one appeared to look\r\nparticularly sinister, and I soon discovered the reason. All the large\r\nwindows on the first floor were boarded half way up. The upper part of\r\nthem alone could be opened, as if one had wished to prevent the people\r\nwho were locked up in that huge stone box from looking into the street.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor came down again, I told him how it struck me, and he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right; the poor creature who is living there must never\r\nsee what is going on outside. She is a madwoman, or rather an idiot,\r\nwhat you Normans would call a Niente. It is a miserable story, but a\r\nvery singular pathological case at the same time. Shall I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI begged him to do so, and he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty years ago the owners of this house, who were my patients, had a\r\ndaughter who was like all other girls, but I soon discovered that while\r\nher body became admirably developed, her intellect remained stationary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe began to walk very early, but she could not talk. At first I\r\nthought she was deaf, but I soon discovered that, although she heard\r\nperfectly, she did not understand anything that was said to her. Violent\r\nnoises made her start and frightened her, without her understanding how\r\nthey were caused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe grew up into a superb woman, but she was dumb, from an absolute\r\nwant of intellect. I tried all means to introduce a gleam of\r\nintelligence into her brain, but nothing succeeded. I thought I noticed\r\nthat she knew her nurse, though as soon as she was weaned, she failed to\r\nrecognize her mother. She could never pronounce that word which is the\r\nfirst that children utter and the last which soldiers murmur when they\r\nare dying on the field of battle. She sometimes tried to talk, but she\r\nproduced nothing but incoherent sounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the weather was fine, she laughed continually, and emitted low\r\ncries which might be compared to the twittering of birds; when it rained\r\nshe cried and moaned in a mournful, terrifying manner, which sounded\r\nlike the howling of a dog before a death occurs in a house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was fond of rolling on the grass, as young animals do, and of\r\nrunning about madly, and she would clap her hands every morning, when\r\nthe sun shone into her room, and would insist, by signs, on being\r\ndressed as quickly as possible, so that she might get out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not appear to distinguish between people, between her mother\r\nand her nurse, or between her father and me, or between the coachman and\r\nthe cook. I particularly liked her parents, who were very unhappy on her\r\naccount, and went to see them nearly every day. I dined with them quite\r\nfrequently, which enabled me to remark that Bertha (they had called her\r\nBertha) seemed to recognize the various dishes, and to prefer some to\r\nothers. At that time she was twelve years old, but as fully formed in\r\nfigure as a girl of eighteen, and taller than I was. Then the idea\r\nstruck me of developing her greediness, and by this means of cultivating\r\nsome slight power of discrimination in her mind, and to force her, by\r\nthe diversity of flavors, if not to reason, at any rate to arrive at\r\ninstinctive distinctions, which would of themselves constitute a kind of\r\nprocess that was necessary to thought. Later on, by appealing to her\r\npassions, and by carefully making use of those which could serve our\r\npurpose, we might hope to obtain a kind of reaction on her intellect,\r\nand by degrees increase the unconscious action of her brain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day I put two plates before her, one of soup, and the other of very\r\nsweet vanilla cream. I made her taste each of them successively, and\r\nthen I let her choose for herself, and she ate the plate of cream. In a\r\nshort time I made her very greedy, so greedy that it appeared as if the\r\nonly idea she had in her head was the desire for eating. She perfectly\r\nrecognized the various dishes, and stretched out her hands toward those\r\nthat she liked, and took hold of them eagerly, and she used to cry when\r\nthey were taken from her. Then I thought I would try and teach her to\r\ncome to the dining-room when the dinner bell rang. It took a long time,\r\nbut I succeeded in the end. In her vacant intellect a vague correlation\r\nwas established between sound and taste, a correspondence between the\r\ntwo senses, an appeal from one to the other, and consequently a sort of\r\nconnection of ideas\xe2\x80\x94if one can call that kind of instinctive hyphen\r\nbetween two organic functions an idea\xe2\x80\x94and so I carried my experiments\r\nfurther, and taught her, with much difficulty, to recognize meal times\r\nby the clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible for me for a long time to attract her attention to\r\nthe hands, but I succeeded in making her remark the clockwork and the\r\nstriking apparatus. The means I employed were very simple; I asked them\r\nnot to have the bell rung for lunch, and everybody got up and went into\r\nthe dining-room when the little brass hammer struck twelve o'clock, but\r\nI found great difficulty in making her learn to count the strokes. She\r\nran to the door each time she heard the clock strike, but by degrees she\r\nlearned that all the strokes had not the same value as far as regarded\r\nmeals, and she frequently fixed her eyes, guided by her ears, on the\r\ndial of the clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I noticed that, I took care every day at twelve, and at six\r\no'clock, to place my fingers on the figures twelve and six, as soon as\r\nthe moment she was waiting for had arrived, and I soon noticed that she\r\nattentively followed the motion of the small brass hands, which I had\r\noften turned in her presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had understood! Perhaps I ought rather to say that she had grasped\r\nthe idea. I had succeeded in getting the knowledge, or, rather, the\r\nsensation, of the time into her, just as is the case with carp, who\r\ncertainly have no clocks, when they are fed every day exactly at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen once I had obtained that result all the clocks and watches in the\r\nhouse occupied her attention almost exclusively. She spent her time in\r\nlooking at them, listening to them, and in waiting for meal time, and\r\nonce something very funny happened. The striking apparatus of a pretty\r\nlittle Louis XVI clock that hung at the head of her bed having got out\r\nof order, she noticed it. She sat for twenty minutes with her eyes on\r\nthe hands, waiting for it to strike ten, but when the hands passed the\r\nfigure she was astonished at not hearing anything; so stupefied was she,\r\nindeed, that she sat down, no doubt overwhelmed by a feeling of violent\r\nemotion such as attacks us in the face of some terrible catastrophe. And\r\nshe had the wonderful patience to wait until eleven o'clock in order to\r\nsee what would happen, and as she naturally heard nothing, she was\r\nsuddenly either seized with a wild fit of rage at having been deceived\r\nand imposed upon by appearances, or else overcome by that fear which\r\nsome frightened creature feels at some terrible mystery, and by the\r\nfurious impatience of a passionate individual who meets with some\r\nobstacle; she took up the tongs from the fireplace and struck the clock\r\nso violently that she broke it to pieces in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was evident, therefore, that her, brain did act and calculate,\r\nobscurely it is true, and within very restricted limits, for I could\r\nnever succeed in making her distinguish persons as she distinguished the\r\ntime; and to stir her intellect, it was necessary to appeal to her\r\npassions, in the material sense of the word, and we soon had another,\r\nand alas! a very terrible proof of this!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had grown up into a splendid girl, a perfect type of a race, a sort\r\nof lovely and stupid Venus. She was sixteen, and I have rarely seen such\r\nperfection of form, such suppleness and such regular features. I said\r\nshe was a Venus; yes, a fair, stout, vigorous Venus, with large, bright,\r\nvacant eyes, which were as blue as the flowers of the flax plant; she\r\nhad a large mouth with full lips, the mouth of a glutton, of a\r\nsensualist, a mouth made for kisses. Well, one morning her father came\r\ninto my consulting room with a strange look on his face, and, sitting\r\ndown without even replying to my greeting, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I want to speak to you about a very serious matter. Would it be\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94would it be possible for Bertha to marry?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Bertha to marry! Why, it is quite impossible!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, I know, I know,' he replied. 'But reflect, doctor. Don't you\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94we hoped\xe2\x80\x94if she had children\xe2\x80\x94it would be a great shock to\r\nher, but a great happiness, and\xe2\x80\x94who knows whether maternity might not\r\nrouse her intellect?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in a state of great perplexity. He was right, and it was possible\r\nthat such a new situation, and that wonderful instinct of maternity,\r\nwhich beats in the hearts of the lower animals as it does in the heart\r\nof a woman, which makes the hen fly at a dog's jaws to defend her\r\nchickens, might bring about a revolution, an utter change in her vacant\r\nmind, and set the motionless mechanism of her thoughts in motion. And\r\nthen, moreover, I immediately remembered a personal instance. Some years\r\npreviously I had owned a spaniel bitch who was so stupid that I could do\r\nnothing with her, but when she had had puppies she became, if not\r\nexactly intelligent, yet almost like many other dogs who had not been\r\nthoroughly broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I foresaw the possibility of this, the wish to get Bertha\r\nmarried grew in me, not so much out of friendship for her and her poor\r\nparents as from scientific curiosity. What would happen? It was a\r\nsingular problem. I said in reply to her father:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Perhaps you are right. You might make the attempt, but you will never\r\nfind a man to consent to marry her.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have found somebody,' he said, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was dumfounded, and said: 'Somebody really suitable? Some one of your\r\nown rank and position in society?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Decidedly,' he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! And may I ask his name?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I came on purpose to tell you, and to consult you. It is Monsieur\r\nGaston du Boys de Lucelles.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt inclined to exclaim: 'The wretch!' but I held my tongue, and\r\nafter a few moments' silence I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! Very good. I see nothing against it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor man shook me heartily by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'She is to be married next month,' he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Gaston du Boys de Lucelles was a scapegrace of good family,\r\nwho, after having spent all that he had inherited from his father, and\r\nhaving incurred debts in all kinds of doubtful ways, had been trying to\r\ndiscover some other means of obtaining money, and he had discovered this\r\nmethod. He was a good-looking young fellow, and in capital health, but\r\nfast; one of that odious race of provincial fast men, and he appeared to\r\nme to be as suitable as anyone, and could be got rid of later by making\r\nhim an allowance. He came to the house to pay his addresses and to strut\r\nabout before the idiot girl, who, however, seemed to please him. He\r\nbrought her flowers, kissed her hands, sat at her feet, and looked at\r\nher with affectionate eyes; but she took no notice of any of his\r\nattentions, and did not make any distinction between him and the other\r\npersons who were about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the marriage took place, and you may guess how my curiosity\r\nwas aroused. I went to see Bertha the next day to try and discover from\r\nher looks whether any feelings had been awakened in her, but I found her\r\njust the same as she was every day, wholly taken up with the clock and\r\ndinner, while he, on the contrary, appeared really in love, and tried to\r\nrouse his wife's spirits and affection by little endearments and such\r\ncaresses as one bestows on a kitten. He could think of nothing better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called upon the married couple pretty frequently, and I soon\r\nperceived that the young woman knew her husband, and gave him those\r\neager looks which she had hitherto only bestowed on sweet dishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe followed his movements, knew his step on the stairs or in the\r\nneighboring rooms, clapped her hands when he came in, and her face was\r\nchanged and brightened by the flames of profound happiness and of\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe loved him with her whole body and with all her soul to the very\r\ndepths of her poor, weak soul, and with all her heart, that poor heart\r\nof some grateful animal. It was really a delightful and innocent picture\r\nof simple passion, of carnal and yet modest passion, such as nature had\r\nimplanted in mankind, before man had complicated and disfigured it by\r\nall the various shades of sentiment. But he soon grew tired of this\r\nardent, beautiful, dumb creature, and did not spend more than an hour\r\nduring the day with her, thinking it sufficient if he came home at\r\nnight, and she began to suffer in consequence. She used to wait for him\r\nfrom morning till night with her eyes on the clock; she did not even\r\nlook after the meals now, for he took all his away from home, Clermont,\r\nChatel-Guyon, Royat, no matter where, as long as he was not obliged to\r\ncome home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe began to grow thin; every other thought, every other wish, every\r\nother expectation, and every confused hope disappeared from her mind,\r\nand the hours during which she did not see him became hours of terrible\r\nsuffering to her. Soon he ceased to come home regularly of nights; he\r\nspent them with women at the casino at Royat and did not come home until\r\ndaybreak. But she never went to bed before he returned. She remained\r\nsitting motionless in an easy-chair, with her eyes fixed on the hands of\r\nthe clock, which turned so slowly and regularly round the china face on\r\nwhich the hours were painted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe heard the trot of his horse in the distance and sat up with a\r\nstart, and when he came into the room she got up with the movements of\r\nan automaton and pointed to the clock, as if to say: 'Look how late it\r\nis!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he began to be afraid of this amorous and jealous, half-witted\r\nwoman, and flew into a rage, as brutes do; and one night he even went so\r\nfar as to strike her, so they sent for me. When I arrived she was\r\nwrithing and screaming in a terrible crisis of pain, anger, passion, how\r\ndo I know what? Can one tell what goes on in such undeveloped brains?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI calmed her by subcutaneous injections of morphine, and forbade her to\r\nsee that man again, for I saw clearly that marriage would infallibly\r\nkill her by degrees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she went mad! Yes, my dear friend, that idiot went mad. She is\r\nalways thinking of him and waiting for him; she waits for him all day\r\nand night, awake or asleep, at this very moment, ceaselessly. When I saw\r\nher getting thinner and thinner, and as she persisted in never taking\r\nher eyes off the clocks, I had them removed from the house. I thus made\r\nit impossible for her to count the hours, and to try to remember, from\r\nher indistinct reminiscences, at what time he used to come home\r\nformerly. I hope to destroy the recollection of it in time, and to\r\nextinguish that ray of thought which I kindled with so much difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other day I tried an experiment. I offered her my watch; she took\r\nit and looked at it for some time; then she began to scream terribly, as\r\nif the sight of that little object had suddenly awakened her memory,\r\nwhich was beginning to grow indistinct. She is pitiably thin now, with\r\nhollow and glittering eyes, and she walks up and down ceaselessly, like\r\na wild beast in its cage; I have had gratings put on the windows,\r\nboarded them up half way, and have had the seats fixed to the floor so\r\nas to prevent her from looking to see whether he is coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! her poor parents! What a life they must lead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had got to the top of the hill, and the doctor turned round and said\r\nto me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Riom from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gloomy town looked like some ancient city. Behind it a green, wooded\r\nplain studded with towns and villages, and bathed in a soft blue haze,\r\nextended until it was lost in the distance. Far away, on my right, there\r\nwas a range of lofty mountains with round summits, or else cut off flat,\r\nas if with a sword, and the doctor began to enumerate the villages,\r\ntowns and hills, and to give me the history of all of them. But I did\r\nnot listen to him; I was thinking of nothing but the madwoman, and I\r\nonly saw her. She seemed to be hovering over that vast extent of country\r\nlike a mournful ghost, and I asked him abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of the husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friend seemed rather surprised, but after a few moments' hesitation,\r\nhe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is living at Royat, on an allowance that they made him, and is quite\r\nhappy; he leads a very fast life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we were slowly going back, both of us silent and rather low-spirited,\r\nan English dogcart, drawn by a thoroughbred horse, came up behind us and\r\npassed us rapidly. The doctor took me by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI saw nothing except a gray felt hat, cocked over one ear above a pair\r\nof broad shoulders, driving off in a cloud of dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PATRON\r\n\r\nWe never dreamed of such good fortune! The son of a provincial bailiff,\r\nJean Marin had come, as do so many others, to study law in the Quartier\r\nLatin. In the various beer-houses that he had frequented he had made\r\nfriends with several talkative students who spouted politics as they\r\ndrank their beer. He had a great admiration for them and followed them\r\npersistently from cafe to cafe, even paying for their drinks when he had\r\nthe money.\r\n\r\nHe became a lawyer and pleaded causes, which he lost. However, one\r\nmorning he read in the papers that one of his former comrades of the\r\nQuartier had just been appointed deputy.\r\n\r\nHe again became his faithful hound, the friend who does the drudgery,\r\nthe unpleasant tasks, for whom one sends when one has need of him and\r\nwith whom one does not stand on ceremony. But it chanced through some\r\nparliamentary incident that the deputy became a minister. Six months\r\nlater Jean Marin was appointed a state councillor.\r\n\r\nHe was so elated with pride at first that he lost his head. He would\r\nwalk through the streets just to show himself off, as though one could\r\ntell by his appearance what position he occupied. He managed to say to\r\nthe shopkeepers as soon as he entered a store, bringing it in somehow in\r\nthe course of the most insignificant remarks and even to the news\r\nvendors and the cabmen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, who am a state councillor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, in consequence of his position as well as for professional reasons\r\nand as in duty bound through being an influential and generous man, he\r\nfelt an imperious need of patronizing others. He offered his support to\r\nevery one on all occasions and with unbounded generosity.\r\n\r\nWhen he met any one he recognized on the boulevards he would advance to\r\nmeet them with a charmed air, would take their hand, inquire after their\r\nhealth, and, without waiting for any questions, remark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I am state councillor, and I am entirely at your service. If I\r\ncan be of any use to you, do not hesitate to call on me. In my position\r\none has great influence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he would go into some cafe with the friend he had just met and ask\r\nfor a pen and ink and a sheet of paper. \xe2\x80\x9cJust one, waiter; it is to\r\nwrite a letter of recommendation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he wrote ten, twenty, fifty letters of recommendation a day. He\r\nwrote them to the Cafe Americain, to Bignon's, to Tortoni's, to the\r\nMaison Doree, to the Cafe Riche, to the Helder, to the Cafe Anglais, to\r\nthe Napolitain, everywhere, everywhere. He wrote them to all the\r\nofficials of the republican government, from the magistrates to the\r\nministers. And he was happy, perfectly happy.\r\n\r\nOne morning as he was starting out to go to the council it began to\r\nrain. He hesitated about taking a cab, but decided not to do so and set\r\nout on foot.\r\n\r\nThe rain came down in torrents, swamping the sidewalks and inundating\r\nthe streets. M. Marin was obliged to take shelter in a doorway. An old\r\npriest was standing there\xe2\x80\x94an old priest with white hair. Before he\r\nbecame a councillor M. Marin did not like the clergy. Now he treated\r\nthem with consideration, ever since a cardinal had consulted him on an\r\nimportant matter. The rain continued to pour down in floods and obliged\r\nthe two men to take shelter in the porter's lodge so as to avoid getting\r\nwet. M. Marin, who was always itching to talk so as to let people know\r\nwho he was, remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is horrible weather, Monsieur l'Abbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old priest bowed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed, sir, it is very unpleasant when one comes to Paris for only\r\na few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You come from the provinces?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur. I am only passing through on my journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly is very disagreeable to have rain during the few days one\r\nspends in the capital. We officials who stay here the year round, we\r\nthink nothing of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest did not reply. He was looking at the street where the rain\r\nseemed to be falling less heavily. And with a sudden resolve he raised\r\nhis cassock just as women raise their skirts in stepping across water.\r\n\r\nM. Marin, seeing him start away, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will get drenched, Monsieur l'Abbe. Wait a few moments longer; the\r\nrain will be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good man stopped irresistibly and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am in a great hurry. I have an important engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marin seemed quite worried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will be absolutely drenched. Might I ask in which direction you\r\nare going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest appeared to hesitate. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going in the direction of the Palais Royal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, if you will allow me, Monsieur l'Abbe, I will offer you\r\nthe shelter of my umbrella: As for me, I am going to the council. I am a\r\ncouncillor of state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old priest raised his head and looked at his neighbor and then\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, monsieur. I shall be glad to accept your offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marin then took his arm and led him away. He directed him, watched\r\nover him and advised him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful of that stream, Monsieur l'Abbe. And be very careful about\r\nthe carriage wheels; they spatter you with mud sometimes from head to\r\nfoot. Look out for the umbrellas of the people passing by; there is\r\nnothing more dangerous to the eyes than the tips of the ribs. Women\r\nespecially are unbearable; they pay no heed to where they are going and\r\nalways jab you in the face with the point of their parasols or\r\numbrellas. And they never move aside for anybody. One would suppose the\r\ntown belonged to them. They monopolize the pavement and the street. It\r\nis my opinion that their education has been greatly neglected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd M. Marin laughed.\r\n\r\nThe priest did not reply. He walked along, slightly bent over, picking\r\nhis steps carefully so as not to get mud on his boots or his cassock.\r\n\r\nM. Marin resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have come to Paris to divert your mind a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good man replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have some business to attend to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAli! Is it important business? Might I venture to ask what it is? If I\r\ncan be of any service to you, you may command me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest seemed embarrassed. He murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is a little personal matter; a little difficulty with\xe2\x80\x94with my\r\nbishop. It would not interest you. It is a matter of internal\r\nregulation\xe2\x80\x94an ecclesiastical affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marin was eager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is precisely the state council that regulates all those things.\r\nIn that case, make use of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, it is to the council that I am going. You are a thousand\r\ntimes too kind. I have to see M. Lerepere and M. Savon and also perhaps\r\nM. Petitpas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marin stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, those are my friends, Monsieur l'Abbe, my best friends, excellent\r\ncolleagues, charming men. I will speak to them about you, and very\r\nhighly. Count upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cure thanked him, apologizing for troubling him, and stammered out a\r\nthousand grateful promises.\r\n\r\nM. Marin was enchanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you may be proud of having made a stroke of luck, Monsieur l'Abbe.\r\nYou will see\xe2\x80\x94you will see that, thanks to me, your affair will go along\r\nswimmingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached the council hall. M. Marin took the priest into his office,\r\noffered him a chair in front of the fire and sat down himself at his\r\ndesk and began to write.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear colleague, allow me to recommend to you most highly a venerable\r\nand particularly worthy and deserving priest, M. L'Abbe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cL'Abbe Ceinture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. l'Abbe Ceinture, who needs your good office in a little matter which\r\nhe will communicate to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am pleased at this incident which gives me an opportunity, my dear\r\ncolleague\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he finished with the usual compliments.\r\n\r\nWhen he had written the three letters he handed them to his protege, who\r\ntook his departure with many protestations of gratitude.\r\n\r\nM. Marin attended to some business and then went home, passed the day\r\nquietly, slept well, woke in a good humor and sent for his newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe first he opened was a radical sheet. He read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOUR CLERGY AND OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall never make an end of enumerating the misdeeds of the clergy. A\r\ncertain priest, named Ceinture, convicted of conspiracy against the\r\npresent government, accused of base actions to which we will not even\r\nallude, suspected besides of being a former Jesuit, metamorphosed into a\r\nsimple priest, suspended by a bishop for causes that are said to be\r\nunmentionable and summoned to Paris to give an explanation of his\r\nconduct, has found an ardent defender in the man named Marin, a\r\ncouncillor of state, who was not afraid to give this frocked malefactor\r\nthe warmest letters of recommendation to all the republican officials,\r\nhis colleagues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe call the, attention of the ministry to the unheard of attitude of\r\nthis councillor of state\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marin bounded out of bed, dressed himself and hastened to his\r\ncolleague, Petitpas, who said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now? You were crazy to recommend to me that old conspirator!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marin, bewildered, stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy no\xe2\x80\x94you see\xe2\x80\x94I was deceived. He looked such an honest man. He played\r\nme a trick\xe2\x80\x94a disgraceful trick! I beg that you will sentence him\r\nseverely, very severely. I am going to write. Tell me to whom I should\r\nwrite about having him punished. I will go and see the attorney-general\r\nand the archbishop of Paris\xe2\x80\x94yes, the archbishop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd seating himself abruptly at M. Petitpas' desk, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, I have the honor to bring to your grace's notice the fact\r\nthat I have recently been made a victim of the intrigues and lies of a\r\ncertain Abbe Ceinture, who imposed on my kind-heartedness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeceived by the representations of this ecclesiastic, I was led\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, having signed and sealed his letter, he turned to his colleague\r\nand exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here; my dear friend, let this be a warning to you never to\r\nrecommend any one again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOOR\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Karl Massouligny, \xe2\x80\x9cthe question of complaisant husbands\r\nis a difficult one. I have seen many kinds, and yet I am unable to give\r\nan opinion about any of them. I have often tried to determine whether\r\nthey are blind, weak or clairvoyant. I believe that there are some which\r\nbelong to each of these categories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us quickly pass over the blind ones. They cannot rightly be called\r\ncomplaisant, since they do not know, but they are good creatures who\r\ncannot see farther than their nose. It is a curious and interesting\r\nthing to notice the ease with which men and women can, be deceived. We\r\nare taken in by the slightest trick of those who surround us, by our\r\nchildren, our friends, our servants, our tradespeople. Humanity is\r\ncredulous, and in order to discover deceit in others, we do not display\r\none-tenth the shrewdness which we use when we, in turn, wish to deceive\r\nsome one else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClairvoyant husbands may be divided into three classes: Those who have\r\nsome interest, pecuniary, ambitious or otherwise, in their wife's having\r\nlove affairs. These ask only to safeguard appearances as much as\r\npossible, and they are satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext come those who get angry. What a beautiful novel one could write\r\nabout them!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally the weak ones! Those who are afraid of scandal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are also those who are powerless, or, rather, tired, who flee\r\nfrom the duties of matrimony through fear of ataxia or apoplexy, who are\r\nsatisfied to see a friend run these risks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I once met a husband of a rare species, who guarded against the\r\ncommon accident in a strange and witty manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Paris I had made the acquaintance of an elegant, fashionable couple.\r\nThe woman, nervous, tall, slender, courted, was supposed to have had\r\nmany love adventures. She pleased me with her wit, and I believe that I\r\npleased her also. I courted her, a trial courting to which she answered\r\nwith evident provocations. Soon we got to tender glances, hand\r\npressures, all the little gallantries which precede the final attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, I hesitated. I consider that, as a rule, the majority of\r\nsociety intrigues, however short they may be, are not worth the trouble\r\nwhich they give us and the difficulties which may arise. I therefore\r\nmentally compared the advantages and disadvantages which I might expect,\r\nand I thought I noticed that the husband suspected me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening, at a ball, as I was saying tender things to the young\r\nwoman in a little parlor leading from the big hall where the dancing was\r\ngoing on, I noticed in a mirror the reflection of some one who was\r\nwatching me. It was he. Our looks met and then I saw him turn his head\r\nand walk away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI murmured: 'Your husband is spying on us.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed dumbfounded and asked: 'My husband?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, he has been watching us for some time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Nonsense! Are you sure?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Very sure.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How strange! He is usually extraordinarily pleasant to all my\r\nfriends.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Perhaps he guessed that I love you!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Nonsense! You are not the first one to pay attention to me. Every\r\nwoman who is a little in view drags behind her a herd of admirers.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes. But I love you deeply.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Admitting that that is true, does a husband ever guess those things?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then he is not jealous?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No-no!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thought for an instant and then continued: 'No. I do not think that\r\nI ever noticed any jealousy on his part.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Has he never watched you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No. As I said, he is always agreeable to my friends.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom that day my courting became much more assiduous. The woman did not\r\nplease me any more than before, but the probable jealousy of her husband\r\ntempted me greatly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for her, I judged her coolly and clearly. She had a certain worldly\r\ncharm, due to a quick, gay, amiable and superficial mind, but no real,\r\ndeep attraction. She was, as I have already said, an excitable little\r\nbeing, all on the surface, with rather a showy elegance. How can I\r\nexplain myself? She was an ornament, not a home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day, after taking dinner with her, her husband said to me, just as\r\nI was leaving: 'My dear friend' (he now called me 'friend'), 'we soon\r\nleave for the country. It is a great pleasure to my wife and myself to\r\nentertain people whom we like. We would be very pleased to have you\r\nspend a month with us. It would be very nice of you to do so.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was dumbfounded, but I accepted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA month later I arrived at their estate of Vertcresson, in Touraine.\r\nThey were waiting for me at the station, five miles from the chateau.\r\nThere were three of them, she, the husband and a gentleman unknown to\r\nme, the Comte de Morterade, to whom I was introduced. He appeared to be\r\ndelighted to make my acquaintance, and the strangest ideas passed\r\nthrough my mind while we trotted along the beautiful road between two\r\nhedges. I was saying to myself: 'Let's see, what can this mean? Here is\r\na husband who cannot doubt that his wife and I are on more than friendly\r\nterms, and yet he invites me to his house, receives me like an old\r\nfriend and seems to say: \xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead, my friend, the road is clear!\xe2\x80\x9d'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am introduced to a very pleasant gentleman, who seems already to\r\nhave settled down in the house, and\xe2\x80\x94and who is perhaps trying to get out\r\nof it, and who seems as pleased at my arrival as the husband himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it some former admirer who wishes to retire? One might think so.\r\nBut, then, would these two men tacitly have come to one of these\r\ninfamous little agreements so common in society? And it is proposed to\r\nme that I should quietly enter into the pact and carry it out. All hands\r\nand arms are held out to me. All doors and hearts are open to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about her? An enigma. She cannot be ignorant of everything.\r\nHowever\xe2\x80\x94however\xe2\x80\x94Well, I cannot understand it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dinner was very gay and cordial. On leaving the table the husband\r\nand his friend began to play cards, while I went out on the porch to\r\nlook at the moonlight with madame. She seemed to be greatly affected by\r\nnature, and I judged that the moment for my happiness was near. That\r\nevening she was really delightful. The country had seemed to make her\r\nmore tender. Her long, slender waist looked pretty on this stone porch\r\nbeside a great vase in which grew some flowers. I felt like dragging her\r\nout under the trees, throwing myself at her feet and speaking to her\r\nwords of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer husband's voice called 'Louise!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, dear.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are forgetting the tea.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I'll go and see about it, my friend.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe returned to the house, and she gave us some tea. When the two men\r\nhad finished playing cards, they were visibly tired. I had to go to my\r\nroom. I did not get to sleep till late, and then I slept badly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn excursion was decided upon for the following afternoon, and we went\r\nin an open carriage to visit some ruins. She and I were in the back of\r\nthe vehicle and they were opposite us, riding backward. The conversation\r\nwas sympathetic and agreeable. I am an orphan, and it seemed to me as\r\nthough I had just found my family, I felt so at home with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly, as she had stretched out her foot between her husband's legs,\r\nhe murmured reproachfully: 'Louise, please don't wear out your old shoes\r\nyourself. There is no reason for being neater in Paris than in the\r\ncountry.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lowered my eyes. She was indeed wearing worn-out shoes, and I noticed\r\nthat her stockings were not pulled up tight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had blushed and hidden her foot under her dress. The friend was\r\nlooking out in the distance with an indifferent and unconcerned look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe husband offered me a cigar, which I accepted. For a few days it was\r\nimpossible for me to be alone with her for two minutes; he was with us\r\neverywhere. He was delightful to me, however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne morning he came to get me to take a walk before breakfast, and the\r\nconversation happened to turn on marriage. I spoke a little about\r\nsolitude and about how charming life can be made by the affection of a\r\nwoman. Suddenly he interrupted me, saying: 'My friend, don't talk about\r\nthings you know nothing about. A woman who has no other reason for\r\nloving you will not love you long. All the little coquetries which make\r\nthem so exquisite when they do not definitely belong to us cease as soon\r\nas they become ours. And then\xe2\x80\x94the respectable women\xe2\x80\x94that is to say our\r\nwives\xe2\x80\x94are\xe2\x80\x94are not\xe2\x80\x94in fact do not understand their profession of wife. Do\r\nyou understand?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said no more, and I could not guess his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo days after this conversation he called me to his room quite early,\r\nin order to show me a collection of engravings. I sat in an easy chair\r\nopposite the big door which separated his apartment from his wife's, and\r\nbehind this door I heard some one walking and moving, and I was thinking\r\nvery little of the engravings, although I kept exclaiming: 'Oh,\r\ncharming! delightful! exquisite!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe suddenly said: 'Oh, I have a beautiful specimen in the next room.\r\nI'll go and get it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ran to the door quickly, and both sides opened as though for a\r\ntheatrical effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a large room, all in disorder, in the midst of skirts, collars,\r\nwaists lying around on the floor, stood a tall, dried-up creature. The\r\nlower part of her body was covered with an old, worn-out silk petticoat,\r\nwhich was hanging limply on her shapeless form, and she was standing in\r\nfront of a mirror brushing some short, sparse blond hairs. Her arms\r\nformed two acute angles, and as she turned around in astonishment I saw\r\nunder a common cotton chemise a regular cemetery of ribs, which were\r\nhidden from the public gaze by well-arranged pads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe husband uttered a natural exclamation and came back, closing the\r\ndoors, and said: 'Gracious! how stupid I am! Oh, how thoughtless! My\r\nwife will never forgive me for that!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI already felt like thanking him. I left three days later, after\r\ncordially shaking hands with the two men and kissing the lady's fingers.\r\nShe bade me a cold good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKarl Massouligny was silent. Some one asked: \xe2\x80\x9cBut what was the friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know\xe2\x80\x94however\xe2\x80\x94however he looked greatly distressed to see me\r\nleaving so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SALE\r\n\r\nThe defendants, Cesaire-Isidore Brument and Prosper-Napoleon Cornu,\r\nappeared before the Court of Assizes of the Seine-Inferieure, on a\r\ncharge of attempted murder, by drowning, of Mme. Brument, lawful wife of\r\nthe first of the aforenamed.\r\n\r\nThe two prisoners sat side by side on the traditional bench. They were\r\ntwo peasants; the first was small and stout, with short arms, short\r\nlegs, and a round head with a red pimply face, planted directly on his\r\ntrunk, which was also round and short, and with apparently no neck. He\r\nwas a raiser of pigs and lived at Cacheville-la-Goupil, in the district\r\nof Criquetot.\r\n\r\nCornu (Prosper-Napoleon) was thin, of medium height, with enormously\r\nlong arms. His head was on crooked, his jaw awry, and he squinted. A\r\nblue blouse, as long as a shirt, hung down to his knees, and his yellow\r\nhair, which was scanty and plastered down on his head, gave his face a\r\nworn-out, dirty look, a dilapidated look that was frightful. He had been\r\nnicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cthe cure\xe2\x80\x9d because he could imitate to perfection the chanting\r\nin church, and even the sound of the serpent. This talent attracted to\r\nhis cafe\xe2\x80\x94for he was a saloon keeper at Criquetot\xe2\x80\x94a great many customers\r\nwho preferred the \xe2\x80\x9cmass at Cornu\xe2\x80\x9d to the mass in church.\r\n\r\nMme. Brument, seated on the witness bench, was a thin peasant woman who\r\nseemed to be always asleep. She sat there motionless, her hands crossed\r\non her knees, gazing fixedly before her with a stupid expression.\r\n\r\nThe judge continued his interrogation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Mme. Brument, they came into your house and threw you into\r\na barrel full of water. Tell us the details. Stand up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose. She looked as tall as a flag pole with her cap which looked\r\nlike a white skull cap. She said in a drawling tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was shelling beans. Just then they came in. I said to myself, 'What\r\nis the matter with them? They do not seem natural, they seem up to some\r\nmischief.' They watched me sideways, like this, especially Cornu,\r\nbecause he squints. I do not like to see them together, for they are two\r\ngood-for-nothings when they are in company. I said: 'What do you want\r\nwith me?' They did not answer. I had a sort of mistrust\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe defendant Brument interrupted the witness hastily, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Cornu, turning towards his accomplice said in the deep tones of an\r\norgan:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that we were both full, and you will be telling no lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge, severely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean by that that you were both drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrument: \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no question about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCornu: \xe2\x80\x9cThat might happen to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge to the victim: \xe2\x80\x9cContinue your testimony, woman Brument.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Brument said to me, 'Do you wish to earn a hundred sous?' 'Yes,'\r\nI replied, seeing that a hundred sous are not picked up in a horse's\r\ntracks. Then he said: 'Open your eyes and do as I do,' and he went to\r\nfetch the large empty barrel which is under the rain pipe in the corner,\r\nand he turned it over and brought it into my kitchen, and stuck it down\r\nin the middle of the floor, and then he said to me: 'Go and fetch water\r\nuntil it is full.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I went to the pond with two pails and carried water, and still more\r\nwater for an hour, seeing that the barrel was as large as a vat, saving\r\nyour presence, m'sieu le president.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this time Brument and Cornu were drinking a glass, and then another\r\nglass, and then another. They were finishing their drinks when I said to\r\nthem: 'You are full, fuller than this barrel.' And Brument answered me.\r\n'Do not worry, go on with your work, your turn will come, each one has\r\nhis share.' I paid no attention to what he said as he was full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the barrel was full to the brim, I said: 'There, that's done.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then Cornu gave me a hundred sous, not Brument, Cornu; it was Cornu\r\ngave them to me. And Brument said: 'Do you wish to earn a hundred sous\r\nmore?' 'Yes,' I said, for I am not accustomed to presents like that.\r\nThen he said: 'Take off your clothes!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Take off my clothes?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes,' he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How many shall I take off?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'If it worries you at all, keep on your chemise, that won't bother us.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred sous is a hundred sous, and I have to undress myself; but I\r\ndid not fancy undressing before those two good-for-nothings. I took off\r\nmy cap, and then my jacket, and then my skirt, and then my sabots.\r\nBrument said, 'Keep on your stockings, also; we are good fellows.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Cornu said, too, 'We are good fellows.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there I was, almost like mother Eve. And they got up from their\r\nchairs, but could not stand straight, they were so full, saving your\r\npresence, M'sieu le president.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to myself: 'What are they up to?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Brument said: 'Are you ready?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Cornu said: 'I'm ready!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then they took me, Brument by the head, and Cornu by the feet, as\r\none might take, for instance, a sheet that has been washed. Then I began\r\nto bawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Brument said: 'Keep still, wretched creature!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they lifted me up in the air and put me into the barrel, which was\r\nfull of water, so that I had a check of the circulation, a chill to my\r\nvery insides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Brument said: 'Is that all?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCornu said: 'That is all.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrument said: 'The head is not in, that will make a difference in the\r\nmeasure.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCornu said: 'Put in her head.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then Brument pushed down my head as if to drown me, so that the\r\nwater ran into my nose, so that I could already see Paradise. And he\r\npushed it down, and I disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then he must have been frightened. He pulled me out and said: 'Go\r\nand get dry, carcass.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for me, I took to my heels and ran as far as M. le cure's. He lent\r\nme a skirt belonging to his servant, for I was almost in a state of\r\nnature, and he went to fetch Maitre Chicot, the country watchman who\r\nwent to Criquetot to fetch the police who came to my house with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we found Brument and Cornu fighting each other like two rams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrument was bawling: 'It isn't true, I tell you that there is at least\r\na cubic metre in it. It is the method that was no good.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCornu bawled: 'Four pails, that is almost half a cubic metre. You need\r\nnot reply, that's what it is.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe police captain put them both under arrest. I have no more to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down. The audience in the court room laughed. The jurors looked\r\nat one another in astonishment. The judge said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefendant Cornu, you seem to have been the instigator of this infamous\r\nplot. What have you to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Cornu rose in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudge,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI was full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Judge answered gravely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it. Proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will. Well, Brument came to my place about nine o'clock, and ordered\r\ntwo drinks, and said: 'There's one for you, Cornu.' I sat down opposite\r\nhim and drank, and out of politeness, I offered him a glass. Then he\r\nreturned the compliment and so did I, and so it went on from glass to\r\nglass until noon, when we were full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Brument began to cry. That touched me. I asked him what was the\r\nmatter. He said: 'I must have a thousand francs by Thursday.' That\r\ncooled me off a little, you understand. Then he said to me all at once:\r\n'I will sell you my wife.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was full, and I was a widower. You understand, that stirred me up. I\r\ndid not know his wife, but she was a woman, wasn't she? I asked him:\r\n'How much would you sell her for?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe reflected, or pretended to reflect. When one is full one is not very\r\nclear-headed, and he replied: 'I will sell her by the cubic metre.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat did not surprise me, for I was as drunk as he was, and I knew what\r\na cubic metre is in my business. It is a thousand litres, that suited\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the price remained to be settled. All depends on the quality. I\r\nsaid: 'How much do you want a cubic metre?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe answered: 'Two thousand francs.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave a bound like a rabbit, and then I reflected that a woman ought\r\nnot to measure more than three hundred litres. So I said: 'That's too\r\ndear.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe answered: 'I cannot do it for less. I should lose by it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand, one is not a dealer in hogs for nothing. One\r\nunderstands one's business. But, if he is smart, the seller of bacon, I\r\nam smarter, seeing that I sell them also. Ha, Ha, Ha! So I said to him:\r\n'If she were new, I would not say anything, but she has been married to\r\nyou for some time, so she is not as fresh as she was. I will give you\r\nfifteen hundred francs a cubic metre, not a sou more. Will that suit\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe answered: 'That will do. That's a bargain!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agreed, and we started out, arm in arm. We must help each other in\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a fear came to me: 'How can you measure her unless you put her into\r\nthe liquid?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he explained his idea, not without difficulty for he was full. He\r\nsaid to me: 'I take a barrel, and fill it with water to the brim. I put\r\nher in it. All the water that comes out we will measure, that is the way\r\nto fix it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said: 'I see, I understand. But this water that overflows will run\r\naway; how are you going to gather it up?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he began stuffing me and explained to me that all we should have\r\nto do would be to refill the barrel with the water his wife had\r\ndisplaced as soon as she should have left. All the water we should pour\r\nin would be the measure. I supposed about ten pails; that would be a\r\ncubic metre. He isn't a fool, all the same, when he is drunk, that old\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be brief, we reached his house and I took a look at its mistress. A\r\nbeautiful woman she certainly was not. Anyone can see her, for there she\r\nis. I said to myself: 'I am disappointed, but never mind, she will be of\r\nvalue; handsome or ugly, it is all the same, is it not, monsieur le\r\npresident?' And then I saw that she was as thin as a rail. I said to\r\nmyself: 'She will not measure four hundred litres.' I understand the\r\nmatter, it being in liquids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told you about the proceeding. I even let her keep on her chemise\r\nand stockings, to my own disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen that was done she ran away. I said: 'Look out, Brument! she is\r\nescaping.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe replied: 'Do not be afraid. I will catch her all right. She will\r\nhave to come back to sleep, I will measure the deficit.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe measured. Not four pailfuls. Ha, Ha, Ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe witness began to laugh so persistently that a gendarme was obliged\r\nto punch him in the back. Having quieted down, he resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, Brument exclaimed: 'Nothing doing, that is not enough.' I\r\nbawled and bawled, and bawled again, he punched me, I hit back. That\r\nwould have kept on till the Day of judgment, seeing we were both drunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen came the gendarmes! They swore at us, they took us off to prison.\r\nI want damages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down.\r\n\r\nBrument confirmed in every particular the statements of his accomplice.\r\nThe jury, in consternation, retired to deliberate.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour they returned a verdict of acquittal for the\r\ndefendants, with some severe strictures on the dignity of marriage, and\r\nestablishing the precise limitations of business transactions.\r\n\r\nBrument went home to the domestic roof accompanied by his wife.\r\n\r\nCornu went back to his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPOLITE SEX\r\n\r\nMadame de X. to Madame de L.\r\n\r\nETRETAT, Friday. My Dear Aunt:\r\n\r\nI am coming to see you without anyone knowing it. I shall be at Les\r\nFresnes on the 2d of September, the day before the hunting season opens,\r\nas I do not want to miss it, so that I may tease these gentlemen. You\r\nare too good, aunt, and you will allow them, as you usually do when\r\nthere are no strange guests, to come to table, under pretext of fatigue,\r\nwithout dressing or shaving for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThey are delighted, of course, when I am not present. But I shall be\r\nthere and will hold a review, like a general, at dinner time; and, if I\r\nfind a single one of them at all careless in dress, no matter how\r\nlittle, I mean to send them down to the kitchen with the servants.\r\n\r\nThe men of to-day have so little consideration for others and so little\r\ngood manners that one must be always severe with them. We live indeed in\r\nan age of vulgarity. When they quarrel, they insult each other in terms\r\nworthy of longshoremen, and, in our presence, they do not conduct\r\nthemselves even as well as our servants. It is at the seaside that you\r\nsee this most clearly. They are to be found there in battalions, and you\r\ncan judge them in the lump. Oh! what coarse beings they are!\r\n\r\nJust imagine, in a train, a gentleman who looked well, as I thought at\r\nfirst sight, thanks to his tailor, carefully took off his boots in order\r\nto put on a pair of old shoes! Another, an old man who was probably some\r\nwealthy upstart (these are the most ill-bred), while sitting opposite to\r\nme, had the delicacy to place his two feet on the seat quite close to\r\nme. This is a positive fact.\r\n\r\nAt the watering-places the vulgarity is unrestrained. I must here make\r\none admission\xe2\x80\x94that my indignation is perhaps due to the fact that I am\r\nnot accustomed to associate, as a rule, with the sort of people one\r\ncomes across here, for I should be less shocked by their manners if I\r\nhad the opportunity of observing them oftener. In the office of the\r\nhotel I was nearly thrown down by a young man who snatched the key over\r\nmy head. Another knocked against me so violently without begging my\r\npardon or lifting his hat, coming away from a ball at the Casino, that\r\nit gave me a pain in the chest. It is the same way with all of them.\r\nWatch them addressing ladies on the terrace; they scarcely ever bow.\r\nThey merely raise their hands to their headgear. But, indeed, as they\r\nare all more or less bald, it is the best plan.\r\n\r\nBut what exasperates and disgusts me particularly is the liberty they\r\ntake of talking in public, without any kind of precaution, about the\r\nmost revolting adventures. When two men are together, they relate to\r\neach other, in the broadest language and with the most abominable\r\ncomments really horrible stories, without caring in the slightest degree\r\nwhether a woman's ear is within reach of their voices. Yesterday, on the\r\nbeach, I was forced to leave the place where I was sitting in order not\r\nto be any longer the involuntary confidante of an obscene anecdote, told\r\nin such immodest language that I felt just as humiliated as indignant at\r\nhaving heard it. Would not the most elementary good-breeding teach them\r\nto speak in a lower tone about such matters when we are near at hand.\r\nEtretat is, moreover, the country of gossip and scandal. From five to\r\nseven o'clock you can see people wandering about in quest of scandal,\r\nwhich they retail from group to group. As you remarked to me, my dear\r\naunt, tittle-tattle is the mark of petty individuals and petty minds. It\r\nis also the consolation of women who are no longer loved or sought\r\nafter. It is enough for me to observe the women who are fondest of\r\ngossiping to be persuaded that you are quite right.\r\n\r\nThe other day I was present at a musical evening at the Casino, given by\r\na remarkable artist, Madame Masson, who sings in a truly delightful\r\nmanner. I took the opportunity of applauding the admirable Coquelin, as\r\nwell as two charming vaudeville performers, M\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94and Meillet. I met, on\r\nthis occasion, all the bathers who were at the beach. It is no great\r\ndistinction this year.\r\n\r\nNext day I went to lunch at Yport. I noticed a tall man with a beard,\r\ncoming out of a large house like a castle. It was the painter, Jean Paul\r\nLaurens. He is not satisfied apparently with imprisoning the subjects of\r\nhis pictures, he insists on imprisoning himself.\r\n\r\nThen I found myself seated on the shingle close to a man still young, of\r\ngentle and refined appearance, who was reading poetry. But he read it\r\nwith such concentration, with such passion, I may say, that he did not\r\neven raise his eyes towards me. I was somewhat astonished and asked the\r\nproprietor of the baths, without appearing to be much concerned, the\r\nname of this gentleman. I laughed to myself a little at this reader of\r\nrhymes; he seemed behind the age, for a man. This person, I thought,\r\nmust be a simpleton. Well, aunt, I am now infatuated about this\r\nstranger. Just fancy, his name is Sully Prudhomme! I went back and sat\r\ndown beside him again so as to get a good look at him. His face has an\r\nexpression of calmness and of penetration. Somebody came to look for\r\nhim, and I heard his voice, which is sweet and almost timid. He would\r\ncertainly not tell obscene stories aloud in public or knock up against\r\nladies without apologizing. He is assuredly a man of refinement, but his\r\nrefinement is of an almost morbid, sensitive character, I will try this\r\nwinter to get an introduction to him.\r\n\r\nI have no more news, my dear aunt, and I must finish this letter in\r\nhaste, as the mail will soon close. I kiss your hands and your cheeks.\r\nYour devoted niece, BERTHE DE X.\r\n\r\nP. S.\xe2\x80\x94I should add, however, by way of justification of French\r\npoliteness, that our fellow-countrymen are, when travelling, models of\r\ngood manners in comparison with the abominable English, who seem to have\r\nbeen brought up in a stable, so careful are they not to discommode\r\nthemselves in any way, while they always discommode their neighbors.\r\n\r\nMadame de L. to Madame de X.\r\n\r\nLES FRESNES, Saturday. My Dear Child:\r\n\r\nMany of the things you have said to me are very sensible, but that does\r\nnot prevent you from being wrong. Like you, I used formerly to feel very\r\nindignant at the impoliteness of men, who, as I supposed, constantly\r\ntreated me with neglect; but, as I grew older and reflected on\r\neverything, putting aside coquetry, and observing things without taking\r\nany part in them myself, I perceived this much\xe2\x80\x94that if men are not\r\nalways polite, women are always indescribably rude.\r\n\r\nWe imagine that we should be permitted to do anything, my darling, and\r\nat the same time we consider that we have a right to the utmost respect,\r\nand in the most flagrant manner we commit actions devoid of that\r\nelementary good-breeding of which you speak so feelingly.\r\n\r\nI find, on the contrary, that men consider us much more than we consider\r\nthem. Besides, darling, men must needs be, and are, what we make them.\r\nIn a state of society, where women are all true gentlewomen, all men\r\nwould become gentlemen.\r\n\r\nCome now; just observe and reflect.\r\n\r\nLook at two women meeting in the street. What an attitude each assumes\r\ntowards the other! What disparaging looks! What contempt they throw into\r\neach glance! How they toss their heads while they inspect each other to\r\nfind something to condemn! And, if the footpath is narrow, do you think\r\none woman would make room for another, or would beg pardon as she sweeps\r\nby? Never! When two men jostle each other by accident in some narrow\r\nlane, each of them bows and at the same time gets out of the other's\r\nway, while we women press against each other stomach to stomach, face to\r\nface, insolently staring each other out of countenance.\r\n\r\nLook at two women who are acquaintances meeting on a staircase outside\r\nthe door of a friend's drawing-room, one of them just leaving, the other\r\nabout to go in. They begin to talk to each other and block up all the\r\nlanding. If anyone happens to be coming up behind them, man or woman, do\r\nyou imagine that they will put themselves half an inch out of their way?\r\nNever! never!\r\n\r\nI was waiting myself, with my watch in my hands, one day last winter at\r\na certain drawing-room door. And, behind me, two gentlemen were also\r\nwaiting without showing any readiness, as I did, to lose their temper.\r\nThe reason was that they had long grown accustomed to our unconscionable\r\ninsolence.\r\n\r\nThe other day, before leaving Paris, I went to dine with no less a\r\nperson than your husband, in the Champs Elysees, in order to enjoy the\r\nfresh air. Every table was occupied. The waiter asked us to wait and\r\nthere would soon be a vacant table.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I noticed an elderly lady of noble figure, who, having\r\npaid for her dinner, seemed on the point of going away. She saw me,\r\nscanned me from head to foot, and did not budge. For more than a quarter\r\nof an hour she sat there, immovable, putting on her gloves, and calmly\r\nstaring at those who were waiting like myself. Now, two young men who\r\nwere just finishing their dinner, having seen me in their turn, hastily\r\nsummoned the waiter, paid what they owed, and at once offered me their\r\nseats, even insisting on standing while waiting for their change. And,\r\nbear in mind, my fair niece, that I am no longer pretty, like you, but\r\nold and white-haired.\r\n\r\nIt is we, you see, who should be taught politeness, and the task would\r\nbe such a difficult one that Hercules himself would not be equal to it.\r\nYou speak to me about Etretat and about the people who indulged in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctittle-tattle\xe2\x80\x9d along the beach of that delightful watering-place. It is\r\na spot now lost to me, a thing of the past, but I found much amusement\r\ntherein days gone by.\r\n\r\nThere were only a few of us, people in good society, really good\r\nsociety, and a few artists, and we all fraternized. We paid little\r\nattention to gossip in those days.\r\n\r\nAs we had no monotonous Casino, where people only gather for show, where\r\nthey whisper, where they dance stupidly, where they succeed in\r\nthoroughly boring one another, we sought some other way of passing our\r\nevenings pleasantly. Now, just guess what came into the head of one of\r\nour husbands? Nothing less than to go and dance each night in one of the\r\nfarm-houses in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe started out in a group with a street-organ, generally played by Le\r\nPoittevin, the painter, with a cotton nightcap on his head. Two men\r\ncarried lanterns. We followed in procession, laughing and chattering\r\nlike a pack of fools.\r\n\r\nWe woke up the farmer and his servant-maids and farm hands. We got them\r\nto make onion soup (horror!), and we danced under the apple trees, to\r\nthe sound of the barrel-organ. The cocks waking up began to crow in the\r\ndarkness of the out-houses; the horses began prancing on the straw of\r\ntheir stables. The cool air of the country caressed our cheeks with the\r\nsmell of grass and of new-mown hay.\r\n\r\nHow long ago it is! How long ago it is! It is thirty years since then!\r\n\r\nI do not want you, my darling, to come for the opening of the hunting\r\nseason. Why spoil the pleasure of our friends by inflicting on them\r\nfashionable toilettes on this day of vigorous exercise in the country?\r\nThis is the way, child, that men are spoiled. I embrace you. Your old\r\naunt, GENEVIEVE DE L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WEDDING GIFT\r\n\r\nFor a long time Jacques Bourdillere had sworn that he would never marry,\r\nbut he suddenly changed his mind. It happened suddenly, one summer, at\r\nthe seashore.\r\n\r\nOne morning as he lay stretched out on the sand, watching the women\r\ncoming out of the water, a little foot had struck him by its neatness\r\nand daintiness. He raised his eyes and was delighted with the whole\r\nperson, although in fact he could see nothing but the ankles and the\r\nhead emerging from a flannel bathrobe carefully held closed. He was\r\nsupposed to be sensual and a fast liver. It was therefore by the mere\r\ngrace of the form that he was at first captured. Then he was held by the\r\ncharm of the young girl's sweet mind, so simple and good, as fresh as\r\nher cheeks and lips.\r\n\r\nHe was presented to the family and pleased them. He immediately fell\r\nmadly in love. When he saw Berthe Lannis in the distance, on the long\r\nyellow stretch of sand, he would tingle to the roots of his hair. When\r\nhe was near her he would become silent, unable to speak or even to\r\nthink, with a kind of throbbing at his heart, and a buzzing in his ears,\r\nand a bewilderment in his mind. Was that love?\r\n\r\nHe did not know or understand, but he had fully decided to have this\r\nchild for his wife.\r\n\r\nHer parents hesitated for a long time, restrained by the young man's bad\r\nreputation. It was said that he had an old sweetheart, one of these\r\nbinding attachments which one always believes to be broken off and yet\r\nwhich always hold.\r\n\r\nBesides, for a shorter or longer period, he loved every woman who came\r\nwithin reach of his lips.\r\n\r\nThen he settled down and refused, even once, to see the one with whom he\r\nhad lived for so long. A friend took care of this woman's pension and\r\nassured her an income. Jacques paid, but he did not even wish to hear of\r\nher, pretending even to ignore her name. She wrote him letters which he\r\nnever opened. Every week he would recognize the clumsy writing of the\r\nabandoned woman, and every week a greater anger surged within him\r\nagainst her, and he would quickly tear the envelope and the paper,\r\nwithout opening it, without reading one single line, knowing in advance\r\nthe reproaches and complaints which it contained.\r\n\r\nAs no one had much faith in his constancy, the test was prolonged\r\nthrough the winter, and Berthe's hand was not granted him until the\r\nspring. The wedding took place in Paris at the beginning of May.\r\n\r\nThe young couple had decided not to take the conventional wedding trip,\r\nbut after a little dance for the younger cousins, which would not be\r\nprolonged after eleven o'clock, in order that this day of lengthy\r\nceremonies might not be too tiresome, the young pair were to spend the\r\nfirst night in the parental home and then, on the following morning, to\r\nleave for the beach so dear to their hearts, where they had first known\r\nand loved each other.\r\n\r\nNight had come, and the dance was going on in the large parlor. 'The two\r\nhad retired into a little Japanese boudoir hung with bright silks and\r\ndimly lighted by the soft rays of a large colored lantern hanging from\r\nthe ceiling like a gigantic egg. Through the open window the fresh air\r\nfrom outside passed over their faces like a caress, for the night was\r\nwarm and calm, full of the odor of spring.\r\n\r\nThey were silent, holding each other's hands and from time to time\r\nsqueezing them with all their might. She sat there with a dreamy look,\r\nfeeling a little lost at this great change in her life, but smiling,\r\nmoved, ready to cry, often also almost ready to faint from joy,\r\nbelieving the whole world to be changed by what had just happened to\r\nher, uneasy, she knew not why, and feeling her whole body and soul\r\nfilled with an indefinable and delicious lassitude.\r\n\r\nHe was looking at her persistently with a fixed smile. He wished to\r\nspeak, but found nothing to say, and so sat there, expressing all his\r\nardor by pressures of the hand. From time to time he would murmur:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBerthe!\xe2\x80\x9d And each time she would raise her eyes to him with a look of\r\ntenderness; they would look at each other for a second and then her\r\nlook, pierced and fascinated by his, would fall.\r\n\r\nThey found no thoughts to exchange. They had been left alone, but\r\noccasionally some of the dancers would cast a rapid glance at them, as\r\nthough they were the discreet and trusty witnesses of a mystery.\r\n\r\nA door opened and a servant entered, holding on a tray a letter which a\r\nmessenger had just brought. Jacques, trembling, took this paper,\r\noverwhelmed by a vague and sudden fear, the mysterious terror of swift\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nHe looked for a longtime at the envelope, the writing on which he did\r\nnot know, not daring to open it, not wishing to read it, with a wild\r\ndesire to put it in his pocket and say to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI'll leave that till\r\nto-morrow, when I'm far away!\xe2\x80\x9d But on one corner two big words,\r\nunderlined, \xe2\x80\x9cVery urgent,\xe2\x80\x9d filled him with terror. Saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease\r\nexcuse me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he tore open the envelope. He read the paper, grew\r\nfrightfully pale, looked over it again, and, slowly, he seemed to spell\r\nit out word for word.\r\n\r\nWhen he raised his head his whole expression showed how upset he was. He\r\nstammered: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, it's\xe2\x80\x94it's from my best friend, who has had a very\r\ngreat misfortune. He has need of me immediately\xe2\x80\x94for a matter of life or\r\ndeath. Will you excuse me if I leave you for half an hour? I'll be right\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrembling and dazed, she stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cGo, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d not having been his\r\nwife long enough to dare to question him, to demand to know. He\r\ndisappeared. She remained alone, listening to the dancing in the\r\nneighboring parlor.\r\n\r\nHe had seized the first hat and coat he came to and rushed downstairs\r\nthree steps at a time. As he was emerging into the street he stopped\r\nunder the gas-jet of the vestibule and reread the letter. This is what\r\nit said:\r\n\r\nSIR: A girl by the name of Ravet, an old sweetheart of yours, it seems,\r\nhas just given birth to a child that she says is yours. The mother is\r\nabout to die and is begging for you. I take the liberty to write and ask\r\nyou if you can grant this last request to a woman who seems to be very\r\nunhappy and worthy of pity. Yours truly,                 DR. BONNARD.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the sick-room the woman was already on the point of\r\ndeath. He did not recognize her at first. The doctor and two nurses were\r\ntaking care of her. And everywhere on the floor were pails full of ice\r\nand rags covered with blood. Water flooded the carpet; two candles were\r\nburning on a bureau; behind the bed, in a little wicker crib, the child\r\nwas crying, and each time it would moan the mother, in torture, would\r\ntry to move, shivering under her ice bandages.\r\n\r\nShe was mortally wounded, killed by this birth. Her life was flowing\r\nfrom her, and, notwithstanding the ice and the care, the merciless\r\nhemorrhage continued, hastening her last hour.\r\n\r\nShe recognized Jacques and wished to raise her arms. They were so weak\r\nthat she could not do so, but tears coursed down her pallid cheeks. He\r\ndropped to his knees beside the bed, seized one of her hands and kissed\r\nit frantically. Then, little by little, he drew close to the thin face,\r\nwhich started at the contact. One of the nurses was lighting them with a\r\ncandle, and the doctor was watching them from the back of the room.\r\n\r\nThen she said in a voice which sounded as though it came from a\r\ndistance: \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to die, dear. Promise to stay to the end. Oh!\r\ndon't leave me now. Don't leave me in my last moments!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her face and her hair, and, weeping, he murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not be\r\nuneasy; I will stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was several minutes before she could speak again, she was so weak.\r\nShe continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe little one is yours. I swear it before God and on my\r\nsoul. I swear it as I am dying! I have never loved another man but you\r\n\xe2\x80\x94promise to take care of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was trying to take this poor pain-racked body in his arms. Maddened\r\nby remorse and sorrow, he stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you that I will bring\r\nhim up and love him. He shall never leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she tried to kiss Jacques. Powerless to lift her head, she held out\r\nher white lips in an appeal for a kiss. He approached his lips to\r\nrespond to this piteous entreaty.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she felt a little calmer, she murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cBring him here and\r\nlet me see if you love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went and got the child. He placed him gently on the bed between them,\r\nand the little one stopped crying. She murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cDon't move any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he was quiet. And he stayed there, holding in his burning hand this\r\nother hand shaking in the chill of death, just as, a while ago, he had\r\nbeen holding a hand trembling with love. From time to time he would cast\r\na quick glance at the clock, which marked midnight, then one o'clock,\r\nthen two.\r\n\r\nThe physician had returned. The two nurses, after noiselessly moving\r\nabout the room for a while, were now sleeping on chairs. The child was\r\nasleep, and the mother, with eyes shut, appeared also to be resting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, just as pale daylight was creeping in behind the curtains, she\r\nstretched out her arms with such a quick and violent motion that she\r\nalmost threw her baby on the floor. A kind of rattle was heard in her\r\nthroat, then she lay on her back motionless, dead.\r\n\r\nThe nurses sprang forward and declared: \xe2\x80\x9cAll is over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked once more at this woman whom he had so loved, then at the\r\nclock, which pointed to four, and he ran away, forgetting his overcoat,\r\nin the evening dress, with the child in his arms.\r\n\r\nAfter he had left her alone the young wife had waited, calmly enough at\r\nfirst, in the little Japanese boudoir. Then, as she did not see him\r\nreturn, she went back to the parlor with an indifferent and calm\r\nappearance, but terribly anxious. When her mother saw her alone she\r\nasked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d She answered: \xe2\x80\x9cIn his room; he is coming\r\nright back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter an hour, when everybody had questioned her, she told about the\r\nletter, Jacques' upset appearance and her fears of an accident.\r\n\r\nStill they waited. The guests left; only the nearest relatives remained.\r\nAt midnight the bride was put to bed, sobbing bitterly. Her mother and\r\ntwo aunts, sitting around the bed, listened to her crying, silent and in\r\ndespair. The father had gone to the commissary of police to see if he\r\ncould obtain some news.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock a slight noise was heard in the hall. A door was softly\r\nopened and closed. Then suddenly a little cry like the mewing of a cat\r\nwas heard throughout the silent house.\r\n\r\nAll the women started forward and Berthe sprang ahead of them all,\r\npushing her way past her aunts, wrapped in a bathrobe.\r\n\r\nJacques stood in the middle of the room, pale and out of breath, holding\r\nan infant in his arms. The four women looked at him, astonished; but\r\nBerthe, who had suddenly become courageous, rushed forward with anguish\r\nin her heart, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked about him wildly and answered shortly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I have a child and the mother has just died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with his clumsy hands he held out the screaming infant.\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, Berthe seized the child, kissed it and hugged it\r\nto her. Then she raised her tear-filled eyes to him, asking: \xe2\x80\x9cDid you\r\nsay that the mother was dead?\xe2\x80\x9d He answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94just now\xe2\x80\x94in my arms. I\r\nhad broken with her since summer. I knew nothing. The physician sent for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Berthe murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will bring up the little one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELIC \xe2\x80\x9cTo the Abbe Louis d'Ennemare, at Soissons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Abbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy marriage with your cousin is broken off in the most stupid way, all\r\non account of an idiotic trick which I almost involuntarily played my\r\nintended. In my perplexity I turn to you, my old school chum, for you\r\nmay be able to help me out of the difficulty. If you can, I shall be\r\ngrateful to you until I die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know Gilberte, or, rather, you think you know her, but do we ever\r\nunderstand women? All their opinions, their ideas, their creeds, are a\r\nsurprise to us. They are all full of twists and turns, cf the\r\nunforeseen, of unintelligible arguments, of defective logic and of\r\nobstinate ideas, which seem final, but which they alter because a little\r\nbird came and perched on the window ledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not tell you that your cousin is very religious, as she was\r\nbrought up by the White (or was it the Black?) Ladies at Nancy. You know\r\nthat better than I do, but what you perhaps do not know is, that she is\r\njust as excitable about other matters as she is about religion. Her head\r\nflies away, just as a leaf is whirled away by the wind; and she is a\r\ntrue woman, or, rather, girl, for she is moved or made angry in a\r\nmoment, starting off at a gallop in affection, just as she does in\r\nhatred, and returning in the same manner; and she is pretty\xe2\x80\x94as you know,\r\nand more charming than I can say\xe2\x80\x94as you will never know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we became engaged, and I adored her, as I adore her still, and\r\nshe appeared to love me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening, I received a telegram summoning me to Cologne for a\r\nconsultation, which might be followed by a serious and difficult\r\noperation, and as I had to start the next morning, I went to wish\r\nGilberte good-by, and tell her why I could not dine with them on\r\nWednesday, but would do so on Friday, the day of my return. Ah! Beware\r\nof Fridays, for I assure you they are unlucky!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I told her that I had to go to Germany, I saw that her eyes filled\r\nwith tears, but when I said I should be back very soon, she clapped her\r\nhands, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am very glad you are going, then! You must bring me back something;\r\na mere trifle, just a souvenir, but a souvenir that you have chosen for\r\nme. You must guess what I should like best, do you hear? And then I\r\nshall see whether you have any imagination.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thought for a few moments, and then added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I forbid you to spend more than twenty francs on it. I want it for the\r\nintention, and for a remembrance of your penetration, and not for its\r\nintrinsic value:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, after another moment's silence, she said, in a low voice, and\r\nwith downcast eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'If it costs you nothing in money, but is something very ingenious and\r\npretty, I will\xe2\x80\x94I will kiss you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day I was in Cologne. It was a case of a terrible accident,\r\nwhich had plunged a whole family into despair, and a difficult\r\namputation was necessary. They lodged me in the house; I might say, they\r\nalmost locked me up, and I saw nobody but people in tears, who almost\r\ndeafened me with their lamentations; I operated on a man who appeared to\r\nbe in a moribund state, and who nearly died under my hands, and with\r\nwhom I remained two nights; and then, when I saw that there was a chance\r\nof his recovery, I drove to the station. I had, however, made a mistake\r\nin the trains, and I had an hour to wait, and so I wandered about the\r\nstreets, still thinking of my poor patient, when a man accosted me. I do\r\nnot know German, and he was totally ignorant of French, but at last I\r\nmade out that he was offering me some relics. I thought of Gilberte, for\r\nI knew her fanatical devotion, and here was my present ready to hand, so\r\nI followed the man into a shop where religious objects were for sale,\r\nand I bought a small piece of a bone of one of the Eleven Thousand\r\nVirgins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pretended relic was inclosed in a charming old silver box, and that\r\ndetermined my choice, and, putting my purchase into my pocket, I went to\r\nthe railway station, and so on to Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I got home, I wished to examine my purchase again, and on\r\ntaking hold of it, I found that the box was open, and the relic missing!\r\nI searched in vain in my pocket, and turned it inside out; the small bit\r\nof bone, which was no bigger than half a pin, had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, my dear little Abbe, that my faith is not very fervent, but,\r\nas my friend, you are magnanimous enough to put up with my lukewarmness,\r\nand to leave me alone, and to wait for the future, so you say. But I\r\nabsolutely disbelieve in the relics of secondhand dealers in piety, and\r\nyou share my doubts in that respect. Therefore, the loss of that bit of\r\nsheep's carcass did not grieve me, and I easily procured a similar\r\nfragment, which I carefully fastened inside my jewel-box, and then I\r\nwent to see my intended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as she saw me, she ran up to me, smiling and eager, and, said\r\nto me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What have you brought me?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pretended to have forgotten, but she did not believe me, and I made\r\nher beg, and even beseech me. But when I saw that she was devoured by\r\ncuriosity, I gave her the sacred silver box. She appeared overjoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A relic! Oh! A relic!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she kissed the box passionately, so that I was ashamed of my\r\ndeception. She was not quite satisfied, however, and her uneasiness soon\r\nturned to terrible fear, and looking straight into my eyes, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Are you sure-that it is genuine?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Absolutely certain.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How can you be so certain?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was trapped; for to say that I had bought it of a man in the streets\r\nwould be my destruction. What was I to say? A wild idea struck me, and I\r\nsaid, in a low, mysterious voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I stole it for you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looked at me with astonishment and delight in her large eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! You stole it? Where?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'In the cathedral; in the very shrine of the Eleven Thousand Virgins.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer heart beat with pleasure, and she murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! Did you really do that-for me? Tell me-all about it!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the climax; I could not retract what I had said. I made up a\r\nfanciful story; with precise details: I had given the custodian of the\r\nbuilding a hundred francs to be allowed to go about the building by\r\nmyself; the shrine was being repaired, but I happened to be there at the\r\nbreakfast hour of the workmen and clergy; by removing a small panel, I\r\nhad been enabled to seize a small piece of bone (oh! so small), among a\r\nquantity of others (I said a quantity, as I thought of the amount that\r\nthe remains of the skeletons of eleven thousand virgins must produce).\r\nThen I went to a goldsmith's and bought a casket worthy of the relic;\r\nand I was not sorry to let her know that the silver box cost me five\r\nhundred francs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she did not think of that; she listened to me, trembling, in an\r\necstasy, and whispering: 'How I love you!' she threw herself into my\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust note this: I had committed sacrilege for her sake. I had committed\r\na theft; I had violated a church; I had violated a shrine; violated and\r\nstolen holy relics, and for that she adored me, thought me perfect,\r\ntender, divine. Such is woman, my dear Abbe, every woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor two months I was the most admirable of lovers. In her room, she had\r\nmade a kind of magnificent chapel in which to keep this bit of mutton\r\nchop, which, as she thought, had made me commit that divine love-crime,\r\nand she worked up her religious enthusiasm in front of it every morning\r\nand evening. I had asked her to keep the matter secret, for fear, as I\r\nsaid, that I might be arrested, condemned, and given over to Germany,\r\nand she kept her promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at the beginning of the summer, she was seized with an\r\nirresistible desire to see the scene of my exploit, and she teased her\r\nfather so persistently (without telling him her secret reason), that he\r\ntook her to Cologne, but without telling me of their trip, according to\r\nhis daughter's wish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not tell you that I had not seen the interior of the cathedral.\r\nI do not know where the tomb (if there be a tomb) of the Eleven Thousand\r\nVirgins is; and then, it appears, it is unapproachable, alas!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA week afterward, I received ten lines, breaking off our engagement,\r\nand then an explanatory letter from her father, whom she had, somewhat\r\nlate, taken into her confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the sight of the shrine, she had suddenly seen through my trickery\r\nand my lie, and at the same time discovered my real innocence of any\r\ncrime. Having asked the keeper of the relics whether any robbery had\r\nbeen committed, the man began to laugh, and pointed out to them how\r\nimpossible such a crime was. But, from the moment that I had not plunged\r\nmy profane hand into venerable relics, I was no longer worthy of my\r\nfair-haired, sensitive betrothed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was forbidden the house; I begged and prayed in vain; nothing could\r\nmove the fair devotee, and I became ill from grief. Well, last week, her\r\ncousin, Madame d'Arville, who is your cousin also, sent me word that she\r\nshould like to see me, and when I called, she told me on what conditions\r\nI might obtain my pardon, and here they are. I must bring her a relic, a\r\nreal, authentic relic of some virgin and martyr, certified to be such by\r\nour Holy Father, the Pope, and I am going mad from embarrassment and\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to Rome, if needful, but I cannot call on the Pope\r\nunexpectedly, to tell him my stupid misadventure; and, besides, I doubt\r\nwhether they allow private individuals to have relics. Could not you\r\ngive me an introduction to some cardinal, or even to some French prelate\r\nwho possesses some remains of a female saint? Or, perhaps, you may have\r\nthe precious object she wants in your collection?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me out of my difficulty, my dear Abbe, and I promise you that I\r\nwill be converted ten years sooner than I otherwise should be!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame d'Arville, who takes the matter seriously, said to me the other\r\nday:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Poor Gilberte will never marry.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear old schoolmate, will you allow your cousin to die the victim of\r\na stupid piece of subterfuge on my part? Pray prevent her from being\r\nvirgin eleven thousand and one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, I am unworthy, but I embrace you, and love you with all my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour old friend, \xe2\x80\x9cHENRI FONTAL.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 4.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORIBUND\r\n\r\nThe warm autumn sun was beating down on the farmyard. Under the grass,\r\nwhich had been cropped close by the cows, the earth soaked by recent\r\nrains, was soft and sank in under the feet with a soggy noise, and the\r\napple trees, loaded with apples, were dropping their pale green fruit in\r\nthe dark green grass.\r\n\r\nFour young heifers, tied in a line, were grazing and at times looking\r\ntoward the house and lowing. The fowls made a colored patch on the dung-\r\nheap before the stable, scratching, moving about and cackling, while two\r\nroosters crowed continually, digging worms for their hens, whom they\r\nwere calling with a loud clucking.\r\n\r\nThe wooden gate opened and a man entered. He might have been forty years\r\nold, but he looked at least sixty, wrinkled, bent, walking slowly,\r\nimpeded by the weight of heavy wooden shoes full of straw. His long arms\r\nhung down on both sides of his body. When he got near the farm a yellow\r\ncur, tied at the foot of an enormous pear tree, beside a barrel which\r\nserved as his kennel, began at first to wag his tail and then to bark\r\nfor joy. The man cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown, Finot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dog was quiet.\r\n\r\nA peasant woman came out of the house. Her large, flat, bony body was\r\noutlined under a long woollen jacket drawn in at the waist. A gray\r\nskirt, too short, fell to the middle of her legs, which were encased in\r\nblue stockings. She, too, wore wooden shoes, filled with straw. The\r\nwhite cap, turned yellow, covered a few hairs which were plastered to\r\nthe scalp, and her brown, thin, ugly, toothless face had that wild,\r\nanimal expression which is often to be found on the faces of the\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nThe man asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he gettin' along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest said it's the end\xe2\x80\x94that he will never live through the\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth of them went into the house.\r\n\r\nAfter passing through the kitchen, they entered a low, dark room, barely\r\nlighted by one window, in front of which a piece of calico was hanging.\r\nThe big beams, turned brown with age and smoke, crossed the room from\r\none side to the other, supporting the thin floor of the garret, where an\r\narmy of rats ran about day and night.\r\n\r\nThe moist, lumpy earthen floor looked greasy, and, at the back of the\r\nroom, the bed made an indistinct white spot. A harsh, regular noise, a\r\ndifficult, hoarse, wheezing breathing, like the gurgling of water from a\r\nbroken pump, came from the darkened couch where an old man, the father\r\nof the peasant woman, was dying.\r\n\r\nThe man and the woman approached the dying man and looked at him with\r\ncalm, resigned eyes.\r\n\r\nThe son-in-law said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess it's all up with him this time; he will not last the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's been gurglin' like that ever since midday.\xe2\x80\x9d They were silent. The\r\nfather's eyes were closed, his face was the color of the earth and so\r\ndry that it looked like wood. Through his open mouth came his harsh,\r\nrattling breath, and the gray linen sheet rose and fell with each\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nThe son-in-law, after a long silence, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's nothing more to do; I can't help him. It's a nuisance, just the\r\nsame, because the weather is good and we've got a lot of work to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife seemed annoyed at this idea. She reflected a few moments and\r\nthen said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't be buried till Saturday, and that will give you all day\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant thought the matter over and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but to-morrow I'll have to invite the people to the funeral. That\r\nmeans five or six hours to go round to Tourville and Manetot, and to see\r\neverybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman, after meditating two or three minutes, declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't three o'clock yet. You could begin this evening and go all\r\nround the country to Tourville. You can just as well say that he's dead,\r\nseem' as he's as good as that now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man stood perplexed for a while, weighing the pros and cons of the\r\nidea. At last he declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I'll go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was leaving the room, but came back after a minute's hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you haven't got anythin' to do you might shake down some apples to\r\nbake and make four dozen dumplings for those who come to the funeral,\r\nfor one must have something to cheer them. You can light the fire with\r\nthe wood that's under the shed. It's dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the room, went back into the kitchen, opened the cupboard, took\r\nout a six-pound loaf of bread, cut off a slice, and carefully gathered\r\nthe crumbs in the palm of his hand and threw them into his mouth, so as\r\nnot to lose anything. Then, with the end of his knife, he scraped out a\r\nlittle salt butter from the bottom of an earthen jar, spread it on his\r\nbread and began to eat slowly, as he did everything.\r\n\r\nHe recrossed the farmyard, quieted the dog, which had started barking\r\nagain, went out on the road bordering on his ditch, and disappeared in\r\nthe direction of Tourville.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was alone, the woman began to work. She uncovered the\r\nmeal-bin and made the dough for the dumplings. She kneaded it a long\r\ntime, turning it over and over again, punching, pressing, crushing it.\r\nFinally she made a big, round, yellow-white ball, which she placed on\r\nthe corner of the table.\r\n\r\nThen she went to get her apples, and, in order not to injure the tree\r\nwith a pole, she climbed up into it by a ladder. She chose the fruit\r\nwith care, only taking the ripe ones, and gathering them in her apron.\r\n\r\nA voice called from the road:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Madame Chicot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round. It was a neighbor, Osime Favet, the mayor, on his way\r\nto fertilize his fields, seated on the manure-wagon, with his feet\r\nhanging over the side. She turned round and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you, Maitre Osime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is the father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is as good as dead. The funeral is Saturday at seven, because\r\nthere's lots of work to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe neighbor answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! Good luck to you! Take care of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo his kind remarks she answered:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks; the same to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she continued picking apples.\r\n\r\nWhen she went back to the house, she went over to look at her father,\r\nexpecting to find him dead. But as soon as she reached the door she\r\nheard his monotonous, noisy rattle, and, thinking it a waste of time to\r\ngo over to him, she began to prepare her dumplings. She wrapped up the\r\nfruit, one by one, in a thin layer of paste, then she lined them up on\r\nthe edge of the table. When she had made forty-eight dumplings, arranged\r\nin dozens, one in front of the other, she began to think of preparing\r\nsupper, and she hung her kettle over the fire to cook potatoes, for she\r\njudged it useless to heat the oven that day, as she had all the next day\r\nin which to finish the preparations.\r\n\r\nHer husband returned at about five. As soon as he had crossed the\r\nthreshold he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; he's still gurglin'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to look at him. The old man was in exactly the same condition.\r\nHis hoarse rattle, as regular as the ticking of a clock, was neither\r\nquicker nor slower. It returned every second, the tone varying a little,\r\naccording as the air entered or left his chest.\r\n\r\nHis son-in-law looked at him and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe'll pass away without our noticin' it, just like a candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey returned to the kitchen and started to eat without saying a word.\r\nWhen they had swallowed their soup, they ate another piece of bread and\r\nbutter. Then, as soon as the dishes were washed, they returned to the\r\ndying man.\r\n\r\nThe woman, carrying a little lamp with a smoky wick, held it in front of\r\nher father's face. If he had not been breathing, one would certainly\r\nhave thought him dead.\r\n\r\nThe couple's bed was hidden in a little recess at the other end of the\r\nroom. Silently they retired, put out the light, closed their eyes, and\r\nsoon two unequal snores, one deep and the other shriller, accompanied\r\nthe uninterrupted rattle of the dying man.\r\n\r\nThe rats ran about in the garret.\r\n\r\nThe husband awoke at the first streaks of dawn. His father-in-law was\r\nstill alive. He shook his wife, worried by the tenacity of the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Phemie, he don't want to quit. What would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew that she gave good advice.\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn't be afraid; he can't live through the day. And the mayor\r\nwon't stop our burying him to-morrow, because he allowed it for Maitre\r\nRenard's father, who died just during the planting season.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was convinced by this argument, and left for the fields.\r\n\r\nHis wife baked the dumplings and then attended to her housework.\r\n\r\nAt noon the old man was not dead. The people hired for the day's work\r\ncame by groups to look at him. Each one had his say. Then they left\r\nagain for the fields.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock, when the work was over, the father was still breathing.\r\nAt last his son-in-law was frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you do now, Phemie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe no longer knew how to solve the problem. They went to the mayor. He\r\npromised that he would close his eyes and authorize the funeral for the\r\nfollowing day. They also went to the health officer, who likewise\r\npromised, in order to oblige Maitre Chicot, to antedate the death\r\ncertificate. The man and the woman returned, feeling more at ease.\r\n\r\nThey went to bed and to sleep, just as they did the preceding day, their\r\nsonorous breathing blending with the feeble breathing of the old man.\r\n\r\nWhen they awoke, he was not yet dead.\r\n\r\nThen they began to be frightened. They stood by their father, watching\r\nhim with distrust, as though he had wished to play them a mean trick, to\r\ndeceive them, to annoy them on purpose, and they were vexed at him for\r\nthe time which he was making them lose.\r\n\r\nThe son-in-law asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I goin' to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not know. She answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly is annoying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guests who were expected could not be notified. They decided to wait\r\nand explain the case to them.\r\n\r\nToward a quarter to seven the first ones arrived. The women in black,\r\ntheir heads covered with large veils, looking very sad. Then men, ill at\r\nease in their homespun coats, were coming forward more slowly, in\r\ncouples, talking business.\r\n\r\nMaitre Chicot and his wife, bewildered, received them sorrowfully, and\r\nsuddenly both of them together began to cry as they approached the first\r\ngroup. They explained the matter, related their difficulty, offered\r\nchairs, bustled about, tried to make excuses, attempting to prove that\r\neverybody would have done as they did, talking continually and giving\r\nnobody a chance to answer.\r\n\r\nThey were going from one person to another:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never would have thought it; it's incredible how he can last this\r\nlong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guests, taken aback, a little disappointed, as though they had\r\nmissed an expected entertainment, did not know what to do, some\r\nremaining seated others standing. Several wished to leave. Maitre Chicot\r\nheld them back:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must take something, anyhow! We made some dumplings; might as well\r\nmake use of 'em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe faces brightened at this idea. The yard was filling little by\r\nlittle; the early arrivals were telling the news to those who had\r\narrived later. Everybody was whispering. The idea of the dumplings\r\nseemed to cheer everyone up.\r\n\r\nThe women went in to take a look at the dying man. They crossed\r\nthemselves beside the bed, muttered a prayer and went out again. The\r\nmen, less anxious for this spectacle, cast a look through the window,\r\nwhich had been opened.\r\n\r\nMadame Chicot explained her distress:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's how he's been for two days, neither better nor worse. Doesn't he\r\nsound like a pump that has gone dry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen everybody had had a look at the dying man, they thought of the\r\nrefreshments; but as there were too many people for the kitchen to hold,\r\nthe table was moved out in front of the door. The four dozen golden\r\ndumplings, tempting and appetizing, arranged in two big dishes,\r\nattracted the eyes of all. Each one reached out to take his, fearing\r\nthat there would not be enough. But four remained over.\r\n\r\nMaitre Chicot, his mouth full, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather would feel sad if he were to see this. He loved them so much\r\nwhen he was alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA big, jovial peasant declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't eat any more now. Each one in his turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis remark, instead of making the guests sad, seemed to cheer them up.\r\nIt was their turn now to eat dumplings.\r\n\r\nMadame Chicot, distressed at the expense, kept running down to the\r\ncellar continually for cider. The pitchers were emptied in quick\r\nsuccession. The company was laughing and talking loud now. They were\r\nbeginning to shout as they do at feasts.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an old peasant woman who had stayed beside the dying man, held\r\nthere by a morbid fear of what would soon happen to herself, appeared at\r\nthe window and cried in a shrill voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's dead! he's dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody was silent. The women arose quickly to go and see. He was\r\nindeed dead. The rattle had ceased. The men looked at each other,\r\nlooking down, ill at ease. They hadn't finished eating the dumplings.\r\nCertainly the rascal had not chosen a propitious moment. The Chicots\r\nwere no longer weeping. It was over; they were relieved.\r\n\r\nThey kept repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it couldn't 'last. If he could only have done it last night, it\r\nwould have saved us all this trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, anyhow, it was over. They would bury him on Monday, that was all,\r\nand they would eat some more dumplings for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe guests went away, talking the matter over, pleased at having had the\r\nchance to see him and of getting something to eat.\r\n\r\nAnd when the husband and wife were alone, face to face, she said, her\r\nface distorted with grief:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll have to bake four dozen more dumplings! Why couldn't he have made\r\nup his mind last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe husband, more resigned, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we'll not have to do this every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAMEKEEPER\r\n\r\nIt was after dinner, and we were talking about adventures and accidents\r\nwhich happened while out shooting.\r\n\r\nAn old friend, known to all of us, M. Boniface, a great sportsman and a\r\nconnoisseur of wine, a man of wonderful physique, witty and gay, and\r\nendowed with an ironical and resigned philosophy, which manifested\r\nitself in caustic humor, and never in melancholy, suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know a story, or rather a tragedy, which is somewhat peculiar. It is\r\nnot at all like those which one hears of usually, and I have never told\r\nit, thinking that it would interest no one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not at all sympathetic. I mean by that, that it does not arouse\r\nthe kind of interest which pleases or which moves one agreeably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the story:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was then about thirty-five years of age, and a most enthusiastic\r\nsportsman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn those days I owned a lonely bit of property in the neighborhood of\r\nJumieges, surrounded by forests and abounding in hares and rabbits. I\r\nwas accustomed to spending four or five days alone there each year,\r\nthere not being room enough to allow of my bringing a friend with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had placed there as gamekeeper, an old retired gendarme, a good man,\r\nhot-tempered, a severe disciplinarian, a terror to poachers and fearing\r\nnothing. He lived all alone, far from the village, in a little house, or\r\nrather hut, consisting of two rooms downstairs, with kitchen and store-\r\nroom, and two upstairs. One of them, a kind of box just large enough to\r\naccommodate a bed, a cupboard and a chair, was reserved for my use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld man Cavalier lived in the other one. When I said that he was alone\r\nin this place, I was wrong. He had taken his nephew with him, a young\r\nscamp about fourteen years old, who used to go to the village and run\r\nerrands for the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis young scapegrace was long and lanky, with yellow hair, so light\r\nthat it resembled the fluff of a plucked chicken, so thin that he seemed\r\nbald. Besides this, he had enormous feet and the hands of a giant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was cross-eyed, and never looked at anyone. He struck me as being in\r\nthe same relation to the human race as ill-smelling beasts are to the\r\nanimal race. He reminded me of a polecat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe slept in a kind of hole at the top of the stairs which led to the\r\ntwo rooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut during my short sojourns at the Pavilion\xe2\x80\x94so I called the hut\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Marius would give up his nook to an old woman from Ecorcheville, called\r\nCeleste, who used to come and cook for me, as old man Cavalier's stews\r\nwere not sufficient for my healthy appetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou now know the characters and the locality. Here is the story:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on the fifteenth of October, 1854\xe2\x80\x94I shall remember that date as\r\nlong as I live.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left Rouen on horseback, followed by my dog Bock, a big Dalmatian\r\nhound from Poitou, full-chested and with a heavy jaw, which could\r\nretrieve among the bushes like a Pont-Andemer spaniel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was carrying my satchel slung across my back and my gun diagonally\r\nacross my chest. It was a cold, windy, gloomy day, with clouds scurrying\r\nacross the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I went up the hill at Canteleu, I looked over the broad valley of\r\nthe Seine, the river winding in and out along its course as far as the\r\neye could see. To the right the towers of Rouen stood out against the\r\nsky, and to the left the landscape was bounded by the distant slopes\r\ncovered with trees. Then I crossed the forest of Roumare and, toward\r\nfive o'clock, reached the Pavilion, where Cavalier and Celeste were\r\nexpecting me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor ten years I had appeared there at the same time, in the same\r\nmanner; and for ten years the same faces had greeted me with the same\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Welcome, master! We hope your health is good.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCavalier had hardly changed. He withstood time like an old tree; but\r\nCeleste, especially in the past four years, had become unrecognizable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was bent almost double, and, although still active, when she walked\r\nher body was almost at right angles to her legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old woman, who was very devoted to me, always seemed affected at\r\nseeing me again, and each time, as I left, she would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This may be the last time, master.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sad, timid farewell of this old servant, this hopeless resignation\r\nto the inevitable fate which was not far off for her, moved me strangely\r\neach year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dismounted, and while Cavalier, whom I had greeted, was leading my\r\nhorse to the little shed which served as a stable, I entered the\r\nkitchen, which also served as dining-room, followed by Celeste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere the gamekeeper joined us. I saw at first glance that something was\r\nthe matter. He seemed preoccupied, ill at ease, worried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, Cavalier, is everything all right?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes and no. There are things I don't like.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What? Tell me about it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, not yet, monsieur. I do not wish to bother you with my little\r\ntroubles so soon after your arrival.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI insisted, but he absolutely refused to give me any information before\r\ndinner. From his expression, I could tell that it was something very\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot knowing what to say to him, I asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How about game? Much of it this year?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, yes! You'll find all you want. Thank heaven, I looked out for\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said this with so much seriousness, with such sad solemnity, that it\r\nwas really almost funny. His big gray mustache seemed almost ready to\r\ndrop from his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly I remembered that I had not yet seen his nephew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Where is Marius? Why does he not show himself?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gamekeeper started, looking me suddenly in the face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, I had rather tell you the whole business right away;\r\nit's on account of him that I am worrying.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ah! Well, where is he?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Over in the stable, monsieur. I was waiting for the right time to\r\nbring him out.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What has he done?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, monsieur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gamekeeper, however, hesitated, his voice altered and shaky, his\r\nface suddenly furrowed by the deep lines of an old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe continued slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, I found out, last winter, that someone was poaching in the woods\r\nof Roseraies, but I couldn't seem to catch the man. I spent night after\r\nnight on the lookout for him. In vain. During that time they began\r\npoaching over by Ecorcheville. I was growing thin from vexation. But as\r\nfor catching the trespasser, impossible! One might have thought that the\r\nrascal was forewarned of my plans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'But one day, while I was brushing Marius' Sunday trousers, I found\r\nforty cents in his pocket. Where did he get it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I thought the matter over for about a week, and I noticed that he used\r\nto go out; he would leave the house just as I was coming home to go to\r\nbed\xe2\x80\x94yes, monsieur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then I started to watch him, without the slightest suspicion of the\r\nreal facts. One morning, just after I had gone to bed before him, I got\r\nright up again, and followed him. For shadowing a man, there is nobody\r\nlike me, monsieur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And I caught him, Marius, poaching on your land, monsieur; he my\r\nnephew, I your keeper!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The blood rushed to my head, and I almost killed him on the spot, I\r\nhit him so hard. Oh! yes, I thrashed him all right. And I promised him\r\nthat he would get another beating from my hand, in your presence, as an\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'There! I have grown thin from sorrow. You know how it is when one is\r\nworried like that. But tell me, what would you have done? The boy has no\r\nfather or mother, and I am the last one of his blood; I kept him, I\r\ncouldn't drive him out, could I?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I told him that if it happened again I would have no more pity for\r\nhim, all would be over. There! Did I do right, monsieur?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered, holding out my hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You did well, Cavalier; you are an honest man.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Thank you, monsieur. Now I am going to fetch him. I must give him his\r\nthrashing, as an example.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that it was hopeless to try and turn the old man from his idea.\r\nI therefore let him have his own way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got the rascal and brought him back by the ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was seated on a cane chair, with the solemn expression of a judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarius seemed to have grown; he was homelier even than the year before,\r\nwith his evil, sneaking expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis big hands seemed gigantic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis uncle pushed him up to me, and, in his soldierly voice, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Beg the gentleman's pardon.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy didn't say a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen putting one arm round him, the former gendarme lifted him right\r\noff the ground, and began to whack him with such force that I rose to\r\nstop the blows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy was now howling: 'Mercy! mercy! mercy! I promise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCavalier put him back on the ground and forced him to his knees:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Beg for pardon,' he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith eyes lowered, the scamp murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I ask for pardon!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen his uncle lifted him to his feet, and dismissed him with a cuff\r\nwhich almost knocked him down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe made his escape, and I did not see him again that evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCavalier appeared overwhelmed.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He is a bad egg,' he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd throughout the whole dinner, he kept repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh! that worries me, monsieur, that worries me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to comfort him, but in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to bed early, so that I might start out at daybreak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dog was already asleep on the floor, at the foot of my bed, when I\r\nput out the light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was awakened toward midnight by the furious barking of my dog Bock. I\r\nimmediately noticed that my room was full of smoke. I jumped out of bed,\r\nstruck a light, ran to the door and opened it. A cloud of flames burst\r\nin. The house was on fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quickly closed the heavy oak door and, drawing on my trousers, I\r\nfirst lowered the dog through the window, by means of a rope made of my\r\nsheets; then, having thrown out the rest of my clothes, my game-bag and\r\nmy gun, I in turn escaped the same way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to shout with all my might: 'Cavalier! Cavalier! Cavalier!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the gamekeeper did not wake up. He slept soundly like an old\r\ngendarme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I could see through the lower windows that the whole ground-\r\nfloor was nothing but a roaring furnace; I also noticed that it had been\r\nfilled with straw to make it burn readily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody must purposely have set fire to the place!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI continued shrieking wildly: 'Cavalier!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the thought struck me that the smoke might be suffocating him. An\r\nidea came to me. I slipped two cartridges into my gun, and shot straight\r\nat his window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe six panes of glass shattered into the room in a cloud of glass.\r\nThis time the old man had heard me, and he appeared, dazed, in his\r\nnightshirt, bewildered by the glare which illumined the whole front of\r\nhis 'house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cried to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Your house is on fire! Escape through the window! Quick! Quick!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe flames were coming out through all the cracks downstairs, were\r\nlicking along the wall, were creeping toward him and going to surround\r\nhim. He jumped and landed on his feet, like a cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was none too soon. The thatched roof cracked in the middle, right\r\nover the staircase, which formed a kind of flue for the fire downstairs;\r\nand an immense red jet jumped up into the air, spreading like a stream\r\nof water and sprinkling a shower of sparks around the hut. In a few\r\nseconds it was nothing but a pool of flames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCavalier, thunderstruck, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How did the fire start?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Somebody lit it in the kitchen.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Who could have started the fire?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, suddenly guessing, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Marius!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old man understood. He stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Good God! That is why he didn't return.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA terrible thought flashed through my mind. I cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And Celeste! Celeste!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not answer. The house caved in before us, forming only an\r\nenormous, bright, blinding brazier, an awe-inspiring funeral-pile, where\r\nthe poor woman could no longer be anything but a glowing ember, a\r\nglowing ember of human flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had not heard a single cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the fire crept toward the shed, I suddenly bethought me of my horse,\r\nand Cavalier ran to free it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly had he opened the door of the stable, when a supple, nimble body\r\ndarted between his legs, and threw him on his face. It was Marius,\r\nrunning for all he was worth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man was up in a second. He tried to run after the wretch, but,\r\nseeing that he could not catch him, and maddened by an irresistible\r\nanger, yielding to one of those thoughtless impulses which we cannot\r\nforesee or prevent, he picked up my gun, which was lying on the ground.\r\nnear him, put it to his shoulder, and, before I could make a motion, he\r\npulled the trigger without even noticing whether or not the weapon was\r\nloaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the cartridges which I had put in to announce the fire was still\r\nintact, and the charge caught the fugitive right in the back,\xe2\x80\x94throwing\r\nhim forward on the ground, bleeding profusely. He immediately began to\r\nclaw the earth with his hands and with his knees, as though trying to\r\nrun on all fours like a rabbit who has been mortally wounded, and sees\r\nthe hunter approaching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rushed forward to the boy, but I could already hear the death-rattle.\r\nHe passed away before the fire was extinguished, without having said a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCavalier, still in his shirt, his legs bare, was standing near us,\r\nmotionless, dazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the people from the village arrived, my gamekeeper was taken away,\r\nlike an insane man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appeared at the trial as witness, and related the facts in detail,\r\nwithout changing a thing. Cavalier was acquitted. He disappeared that\r\nvery day, leaving the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen him since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, gentlemen, that is my story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A FARM GIRL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nAs the weather was very fine, the people on the farm had hurried through\r\ntheir dinner and had returned to the fields.\r\n\r\nThe servant, Rose, remained alone in the large kitchen, where the fire\r\nwas dying out on the hearth beneath the large boiler of hot water. From\r\ntime to time she dipped out some water and slowly washed her dishes,\r\nstopping occasionally to look at the two streaks of light which the sun\r\nthrew across the long table through the window, and which showed the\r\ndefects in the glass.\r\n\r\nThree venturesome hens were picking up the crumbs under the chairs,\r\nwhile the smell of the poultry yard and the warmth from the cow stall\r\ncame in through the half-open door, and a cock was heard crowing in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished her work, wiped down the table, dusted the\r\nmantelpiece and put the plates on the high dresser close to the wooden\r\nclock with its loud tick-tock, she drew a long breath, as she felt\r\nrather oppressed, without exactly knowing why. She looked at the black\r\nclay walls, the rafters that were blackened with smoke and from which\r\nhung spiders' webs, smoked herrings and strings of onions, and then she\r\nsat down, rather overcome by the stale odor from the earthen floor, on\r\nwhich so many things had been continually spilled and which the heat\r\nbrought out. With this there was mingled the sour smell of the pans of\r\nmilk which were set out to raise the cream in the adjoining dairy.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to sew, as usual, but she did not feel strong enough, and so\r\nshe went to the door to get a mouthful of fresh air, which seemed to do\r\nher good.\r\n\r\nThe fowls were lying on the steaming dunghill; some of them were\r\nscratching with one claw in search of worms, while the cock stood up\r\nproudly in their midst. When he crowed, the cocks in all the neighboring\r\nfarmyards replied to him, as if they were uttering challenges from farm\r\nto farm.\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at them without thinking, and then she raised her eyes\r\nand was almost dazzled at the sight of the apple trees in blossom. Just\r\nthen a colt, full of life and friskiness, jumped over the ditches and\r\nthen stopped suddenly, as if surprised at being alone.\r\n\r\nShe also felt inclined to run; she felt inclined to move and to stretch\r\nher limbs and to repose in the warm, breathless air. She took a few\r\nundecided steps and closed her eyes, for she was seized with a feeling\r\nof animal comfort, and then she went to look for eggs in the hen loft.\r\nThere were thirteen of them, which she took in and put into the\r\nstoreroom; but the smell from the kitchen annoyed her again, and she\r\nwent out to sit on the grass for a time.\r\n\r\nThe farmyard, which was surrounded by trees, seemed to be asleep. The\r\ntall grass, amid which the tall yellow dandelions rose up like streaks\r\nof yellow light, was of a vivid, fresh spring green. The apple trees\r\ncast their shade all round them, and the thatched roofs, on which grew\r\nblue and yellow irises, with their sword-like leaves, steamed as if the\r\nmoisture of the stables and barns were coming through the straw. The\r\ngirl went to the shed, where the carts and buggies were kept. Close to\r\nit, in a ditch, there was a large patch of violets, whose fragrance was\r\nspread abroad, while beyond the slope the open country could be seen,\r\nwhere grain was growing, with clumps of trees in places, and groups of\r\nlaborers here and there, who looked as small as dolls, and white horses\r\nlike toys, who were drawing a child's cart, driven by a man as tall as\r\none's finger.\r\n\r\nShe took up a bundle of straw, threw it into the ditch and sat down upon\r\nit. Then, not feeling comfortable, she undid it, spread it out and lay\r\ndown upon it at full length on her back, with both arms under her head\r\nand her legs stretched out.\r\n\r\nGradually her eyes closed, and she was falling into a state of\r\ndelightful languor. She was, in fact, almost asleep when she felt two\r\nhands on her bosom, and she sprang up at a bound. It was Jacques, one of\r\nthe farm laborers, a tall fellow from Picardy, who had been making love\r\nto her for a long time. He had been herding the sheep, and, seeing her\r\nlying down in the shade, had come up stealthily and holding his breath,\r\nwith glistening eyes and bits of straw in his hair.\r\n\r\nHe tried to kiss her, but she gave him a smack in the face, for she was\r\nas strong as he, and he was shrewd enough to beg her pardon; so they sat\r\ndown side by side and talked amicably. They spoke about the favorable\r\nweather, of their master, who was a good fellow, then of their\r\nneighbors, of all the people in the country round, of themselves, of\r\ntheir village, of their youthful days, of their recollections, of their\r\nrelations, who had left them for a long time, and it might be forever.\r\nShe grew sad as she thought of it, while he, with one fixed idea in his\r\nhead, drew closer to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen my mother for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very hard\r\nto be separated like that,\xe2\x80\x9d and she directed her looks into the\r\ndistance, toward the village in the north which she had left.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, he seized her by the neck and kissed her again, but\r\nshe struck him so violently in the face with her clenched fist that his\r\nnose began to bleed, and he got up and laid his head against the stem of\r\na tree. When she saw that, she was sorry, and going up to him, she said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d He, however, only laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was a mere\r\nnothing; only she had hit him right on the middle of the nose. What a\r\ndevil!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and he looked at her with admiration, for she had\r\ninspired him with a feeling of respect and of a very different kind of\r\nadmiration which was the beginning of a real love for that tall, strong\r\nwench. When the bleeding had stopped, he proposed a walk, as he was\r\nafraid of his neighbor's heavy hand, if they remained side by side like\r\nthat much longer; but she took his arm of her own accord, in the avenue,\r\nas if they had been out for an evening's walk, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not nice\r\nof you to despise me like that, Jacques.\xe2\x80\x9d He protested, however. No, he\r\ndid not despise her. He was in love with her, that was all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you really want to marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and then looked at her sideways, while she looked straight\r\nahead of her. She had fat, red cheeks, a full bust beneath her cotton\r\njacket; thick, red lips; and her neck, which was almost bare, was\r\ncovered with small beads of perspiration. He felt a fresh access of\r\ndesire, and, putting his lips to her ear, he murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him till they were\r\nboth out of breath. From that moment the eternal story of love began\r\nbetween them. They plagued one another in corners; they met in the\r\nmoonlight beside the haystack and gave each other bruises on the legs,\r\nunder the table, with their heavy nailed boots. By degrees, however,\r\nJacques seemed to grow tired of her; he avoided her, scarcely spoke to\r\nher, and did not try any longer to meet her alone, which made her sad\r\nand anxious; and soon she found that she was enceinte.\r\n\r\nAt first she was in a state of consternation, but then she got angry,\r\nand her rage increased every day because she could not meet him, as he\r\navoided her most carefully. At last, one night, when every one in the\r\nfarmhouse was asleep, she went out noiselessly in her petticoat, with\r\nbare feet, crossed the yard and opened the door of the stable where\r\nJacques was lying in a large box of straw above his horses. He pretended\r\nto snore when he heard her coming, but she knelt down by his side and\r\nshook him until he sat up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he then asked her. And with clenched teeth, and\r\ntrembling with anger, she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI want\xe2\x80\x94I want you to marry me, as\r\nyou promised.\xe2\x80\x9d But he only laughed and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! if a man were to\r\nmarry all the girls with whom he has made a slip, he would have more\r\nthan enough to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she seized him by the throat, threw him or his back, so that he\r\ncould not get away from her, and, half strangling him, she shouted into\r\nhis face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am enceinte, do you hear? I am enceinte!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gasped for breath, as he was almost choked, and so they remained,\r\nboth of them, motionless and without speaking, in the dark silence,\r\nwhich was only broken by the noise made by a horse as he, pulled the hay\r\nout of the manger and then slowly munched it.\r\n\r\nWhen Jacques found that she was the stronger, he stammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nwell, I will marry you, as that is the case.\xe2\x80\x9d But she did not believe\r\nhis promises. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be at once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have the banns\r\nput up.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAt once,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cSwear solemnly that you will.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhesitated for a few moments and then said: \xe2\x80\x9cI swear it, by Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she released her grasp and went away without another word.\r\n\r\nShe had no chance of speaking to him for several days; and, as the\r\nstable was now always locked at night, she was afraid to make any noise,\r\nfor fear of creating a scandal. One morning, however, she saw another\r\nman come in at dinner time, and she said: \xe2\x80\x9cHas Jacques left?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes;\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nman replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI have got his place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis made her tremble so violently that she could not take the saucepan\r\noff the fire; and later, when they were all at work, she went up into\r\nher room and cried, burying her head in the bolster, so that she might\r\nnot be heard. During the day, however, she tried to obtain some\r\ninformation without exciting any suspicion, but she was so overwhelmed\r\nby the thoughts of her misfortune that she fancied that all the people\r\nwhom she asked laughed maliciously. All she learned, however, was that\r\nhe had left the neighborhood altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThen a cloud of constant misery began for her. She worked mechanically,\r\nwithout thinking of what she was doing, with one fixed idea in her head:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose people were to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis continual feeling made her so incapable of reasoning that she did\r\nnot even try to think of any means of avoiding the disgrace that she\r\nknew must ensue, which was irreparable and drawing nearer every day, and\r\nwhich was as sure as death itself. She got up every morning long before\r\nthe others and persistently tried to look at her figure in a piece of\r\nbroken looking-glass, before which she did her hair, as she was very\r\nanxious to know whether anybody would notice a change in her, and,\r\nduring the day, she stopped working every few minutes to look at herself\r\nfrom top to toe, to see whether her apron did not look too short.\r\n\r\nThe months went on, and she scarcely spoke now, and when she was asked a\r\nquestion, did not appear to understand; but she had a frightened look,\r\nhaggard eyes and trembling hands, which made her master say to her\r\noccasionally: \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor girl, how stupid you have grown lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn church she hid behind a pillar, and no longer ventured to go to\r\nconfession, as she feared to face the priest, to whom she attributed\r\nsuperhuman powers, which enabled him to read people's consciences; and\r\nat meal times the looks of her fellow servants almost made her faint\r\nwith mental agony; and she was always fancying that she had been found\r\nout by the cowherd, a precocious and cunning little lad, whose bright\r\neyes seemed always to be watching her.\r\n\r\nOne morning the postman brought her a letter, and as she had never\r\nreceived one in her life before she was so upset by it that she was\r\nobliged to sit down. Perhaps it was from him? But, as she could not\r\nread, she sat anxious and trembling with that piece of paper, covered\r\nwith ink, in her hand. After a time, however, she put it into her\r\npocket, as she did not venture to confide her secret to any one. She\r\noften stopped in her work to look at those lines written at regular\r\nintervals, and which terminated in a signature, imagining vaguely that\r\nshe would suddenly discover their meaning, until at last, as she felt\r\nhalf mad with impatience and anxiety, she went to the schoolmaster, who\r\ntold her to sit down and read to her as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR DAUGHTER: I write to tell you that I am very ill. Our neighbor,\r\nMonsieur Dentu, begs you to come, if you can.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom your affectionate mother, \xe2\x80\x9cCESAIRE DENTU, Deputy Mayor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe did not say a word and went away, but as soon as she was alone her\r\nlegs gave way under her, and she fell down by the roadside and remained\r\nthere till night.\r\n\r\nWhen she got back, she told the farmer her bad news, and he allowed her\r\nto go home for as long as she liked, and promised to have her work done\r\nby a charwoman and to take her back when she returned.\r\n\r\nHer mother died soon after she got there, and the next day Rose gave\r\nbirth to a seven-months child, a miserable little skeleton, thin enough\r\nto make anybody shudder, and which seemed to be suffering continually,\r\nto judge from the painful manner in which it moved its poor little\r\nhands, which were as thin as a crab's legs; but it lived for all that.\r\nShe said she was married, but could not be burdened with the child, so\r\nshe left it with some neighbors, who promised to take great care of it,\r\nand she went back to the farm.\r\n\r\nBut now in her heart, which had been wounded so long, there arose\r\nsomething like brightness, an unknown love for that frail little\r\ncreature which she had left behind her, though there was fresh suffering\r\nin that very love, suffering which she felt every hour and every minute,\r\nbecause she was parted from her child. What pained her most, however,\r\nwas the mad longing to kiss it, to press it in her arms, to feel the\r\nwarmth of its little body against her breast. She could not sleep at\r\nnight; she thought of it the whole day long, and in the evening, when\r\nher work was done, she would sit in front of the fire and gaze at it\r\nintently, as people do whose thoughts are far away.\r\n\r\nThey began to talk about her and to tease her about her lover. They\r\nasked her whether he was tall, handsome and rich. When was the wedding\r\nto be and the christening? And often she ran away to cry by herself, for\r\nthese questions seemed to hurt her like the prick of a pin; and, in\r\norder to forget their jokes, she began to work still more energetically,\r\nand, still thinking of her child, she sought some way of saving up money\r\nfor it, and determined to work so that her master would be obliged to\r\nraise her wages.\r\n\r\nBy degrees she almost monopolized the work and persuaded him to get rid\r\nof one servant girl, who had become useless since she had taken to\r\nworking like two; she economized in the bread, oil and candles; in the\r\ncorn, which they gave to the chickens too extravagantly, and in the\r\nfodder for the horses and cattle, which was rather wasted. She was as\r\nmiserly about her master's money as if it had been her own; and, by dint\r\nof making good bargains, of getting high prices for all their produce,\r\nand by baffling the peasants' tricks when they offered anything for\r\nsale, he, at last, entrusted her with buying and selling everything,\r\nwith the direction of all the laborers, and with the purchase of\r\nprovisions necessary for the household; so that, in a short time, she\r\nbecame. indispensable to him. She kept such a strict eye on everything\r\nabout her that, under her direction, the farm prospered wonderfully, and\r\nfor five miles around people talked of \xe2\x80\x9cMaster Vallin's servant,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe farmer himself said everywhere: \xe2\x80\x9cThat girl is worth more than her\r\nweight in gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut time passed by, and her wages remained the same. Her hard work was\r\naccepted as something that was due from every good servant, and as a\r\nmere token of good will; and she began to think rather bitterly that if\r\nthe farmer could put fifty or a hundred crowns extra into the bank every\r\nmonth, thanks to her, she was still only earning her two hundred francs\r\na year, neither more nor less; and so she made up her mind to ask for an\r\nincrease of wages. She went to see the schoolmaster three times about\r\nit, but when she got there, she spoke about something else. She felt a\r\nkind of modesty in asking for money, as if it were something\r\ndisgraceful; but, at last, one day, when the farmer was having breakfast\r\nby himself in the kitchen, she said to him, with some embarrassment,\r\nthat she wished to speak to him particularly. He raised his head in\r\nsurprise, with both his hands on the table, holding his knife, with its\r\npoint in the air, in one, and a piece of bread in the other, and he\r\nlooked fixedly at, the girl, who felt uncomfortable under his gaze, but\r\nasked for a week's holiday, so that she might get away, as she was not\r\nvery well. He acceded to her request immediately, and then added, in\r\nsome embarrassment himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you come back, I shall have something to say to you myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThe child was nearly eight months old, and she did not recognize it. It\r\nhad grown rosy and chubby all over, like a little roll of fat. She threw\r\nherself on it, as if it had been some prey, and kissed it so violently\r\nthat it began to scream with terror; and then she began to cry herself,\r\nbecause it did not know her, and stretched out its arms to its nurse as\r\nsoon as it saw her. But the next day it began to know her, and laughed\r\nwhen it saw her, and she took it into the fields, and ran about\r\nexcitedly with it, and sat down under the shade of the trees; and then,\r\nfor the first time in her life, she opened her heart to somebody,\r\nalthough he could not understand her, and told him her troubles; how\r\nhard her work was, her anxieties and her hopes, and she quite tired the\r\nchild with the violence of her caresses.\r\n\r\nShe took the greatest pleasure in handling it, in washing and dressing\r\nit, for it seemed to her that all this was the confirmation of her\r\nmaternity; and she would look at it, almost feeling surprised 'that it\r\nwas hers, and would say to herself in a low voice as she danced it in\r\nher arms: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my baby, it's my baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe cried all the way home as she returned to the farm and had scarcely\r\ngot in before her master called her into his room; and she went, feeling\r\nastonished and nervous, without knowing why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. She sat down, and for some moments they\r\nremained side by side, in some embarrassment, with their arms hanging at\r\ntheir sides, as if they did not know what to do with them, and looking\r\neach other in the face, after the manner of peasants.\r\n\r\nThe farmer, a stout, jovial, obstinate man of forty-five, who had lost\r\ntwo wives, evidently felt embarrassed, which was very unusual with him;\r\nbut, at last, he made up his mind, and began to speak vaguely,\r\nhesitating a little, and looking out of the window as he talked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is\r\nit, Rose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have never thought of settling in life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe grew as pale as death, and, seeing that she gave him no answer, he\r\nwent on: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a good, steady, active and economical girl; and a wife\r\nlike you would make a man's fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not move, but looked frightened; she did not even try to\r\ncomprehend his meaning, for her thoughts were in a whirl, as if at the\r\napproach of some great danger; so, after waiting for a few seconds, he\r\nwent on: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, a farm without a mistress can never succeed, even\r\nwith a servant like you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he stopped, for he did not know what else\r\nto say, and Rose looked at him with the air of a person who thinks that\r\nhe is face to face with a murderer and ready to flee at the slightest\r\nmovement he may make; but, after waiting for about five minutes, he\r\nasked her: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, will it suit you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWill what suit me, master?\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nsaid quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to marry me, by Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe jumped up, but fell back on her chair, as if she had been struck,\r\nand there she remained motionless, like a person who is overwhelmed by\r\nsome great misfortune. At last the farmer grew impatient and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, what more do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him, almost in terror, then\r\nsuddenly the tears came into her eyes and she said twice in a choking\r\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot, I cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, don't be silly;\r\nI will give you until tomorrow to think it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he hurried out of the room, very glad to have got through with the\r\nmatter, which had troubled him a good deal, for he had no doubt that she\r\nwould the next morning accept a proposal which she could never have\r\nexpected and which would be a capital bargain for him, as he thus bound\r\na woman to his interests who would certainly bring him more than if she\r\nhad the best dowry in the district.\r\n\r\nNeither could there be any scruples about an unequal match between them,\r\nfor in the country every one is very nearly equal; the farmer works with\r\nhis laborers, who frequently become masters in their turn, and the\r\nfemale servants constantly become the mistresses of the establishments\r\nwithout its making any change in their life or habits.\r\n\r\nRose did not go to bed that night. She threw herself, dressed as she\r\nwas, on her bed, and she had not even the strength to cry left in her,\r\nshe was so thoroughly dumfounded. She remained quite inert, scarcely\r\nknowing that she had a body, and without being at all able to collect\r\nher thoughts, though, at moments, she remembered something of what had\r\nhappened, and then she was frightened at the idea of what might happen.\r\nHer terror increased, and every time the great kitchen clock struck the\r\nhour she broke out in a perspiration from grief. She became bewildered,\r\nand had the nightmare; her candle went out, and then she began to\r\nimagine that some one had cast a spell over her, as country people so\r\noften imagine, and she felt a mad inclination to run away, to escape and\r\nto flee before her misfortune, like a ship scudding before the wind. An\r\nowl hooted; she shivered, sat up, passed her hands over her face, her\r\nhair, and all over her body, and then she went downstairs, as if she\r\nwere walking in her sleep. When she got into the yard she stooped down,\r\nso as not to be seen by any prowling scamp, for the moon, which was\r\nsetting, shed a bright light over the fields. Instead of opening the\r\ngate she scrambled over the fence, and as soon as she was outside she\r\nstarted off. She went on straight before her, with a quick, springy\r\ntrot, and from time to time she unconsciously uttered a piercing cry.\r\nHer long shadow accompanied her, and now and then some night bird flew\r\nover her head, while the dogs in the farmyards barked as they heard her\r\npass; one even jumped over the ditch, and followed her and tried to bite\r\nher, but she turned round and gave such a terrible yell that the\r\nfrightened animal ran back and cowered in silence in its kennel.\r\n\r\nThe stars grew dim, and the birds began to twitter; day was breaking.\r\nThe girl was worn out and panting; and when the sun rose in the purple\r\nsky, she stopped, for her swollen feet refused to go any farther; but\r\nshe saw a pond in the distance, a large pond whose stagnant water looked\r\nlike blood under the reflection of this new day, and she limped on\r\nslowly with her hand on her heart, in order to dip both her feet in it.\r\nShe sat down on a tuft of grass, took off her heavy shoes, which were\r\nfull of dust, pulled off her stockings and plunged her legs into the\r\nstill water, from which bubbles were rising here and there.\r\n\r\nA feeling of delicious coolness pervaded her from head to foot, and\r\nsuddenly, while she was looking fixedly at the deep pool, she was seized\r\nwith dizziness, and with a mad longing to throw herself into it. All her\r\nsufferings would be over in there, over forever. She no longer thought\r\nof her child; she only wanted peace, complete rest, and to sleep\r\nforever, and she got up with raised arms and took two steps forward. She\r\nwas in the water up to her thighs, and she was just about to throw her\r\nself in when sharp, pricking pains in her ankles made her jump back, and\r\nshe uttered a cry of despair, for, from her knees to the tips of her\r\nfeet, long black leeches were sucking her lifeblood, and were swelling\r\nas they adhered to her flesh. She did not dare to touch them, and\r\nscreamed with horror, so that her cries of despair attracted a peasant,\r\nwho was driving along at some distance, to the spot. He pulled off the\r\nleeches one by one, applied herbs to the wounds, and drove the girl to\r\nher master's farm in his gig.\r\n\r\nShe was in bed for a fortnight, and as she was sitting outside the door\r\non the first morning that she got up, the farmer suddenly came and\r\nplanted himself before her. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the affair is\r\nsettled isn't it?\xe2\x80\x9d She did not reply at first, and then, as he remained\r\nstanding and looking at her intently with his piercing eyes, she said\r\nwith difficulty: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, master, I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d He immediately flew into a\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot, girl; you cannot? I should just like to know the reason\r\nwhy?\xe2\x80\x9d She began to cry, and repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her, and\r\nthen exclaimed angrily: \xe2\x80\x9cThen I suppose you have a lover?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that\r\nis it,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, trembling with shame.\r\n\r\nThe man got as red as a poppy, and stammered out in a rage: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! So you\r\nconfess it, you slut! And pray who is the fellow? Some penniless, half-\r\nstarved ragamuffin, without a roof to his head, I suppose? Who is it, I\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d And as she gave him no answer, he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! So you will not\r\ntell me. Then I will tell you; it is Jean Baudu?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not he,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThen it is Pierre Martin?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he angrily mentioned all the young fellows in the neighborhood,\r\nwhile she denied that he had hit upon the right one, and every moment\r\nwiped her eyes with the corner of her blue apron. But he still tried to\r\nfind it out, with his brutish obstinacy, and, as it were, scratching at\r\nher heart to discover her secret, just as a terrier scratches at a hole\r\nto try and get at the animal which he scents inside it. Suddenly,\r\nhowever, the man shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cBy George! It is Jacques, the man who was\r\nhere last year. They used to say that you were always talking together,\r\nand that you thought about getting married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose was choking, and she grew scarlet, while her tears suddenly stopped\r\nand dried up on her cheeks, like drops of water on hot iron, and she\r\nexclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not he, it is not he!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs that really a fact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked the cunning peasant, who partly guessed the truth; and she\r\nreplied, hastily: \xe2\x80\x9cI will swear it; I will swear it to you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She tried\r\nto think of something by which to swear, as she did not venture to\r\ninvoke sacred things, but he interrupted her: \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, he used to\r\nfollow you into every corner and devoured you with his eyes at meal\r\ntimes. Did you ever give him your promise, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time she looked her master straight in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, never, never;\r\nI will solemnly swear to you that if he were to come to-day and ask me\r\nto marry him I would have nothing to do with him.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with such\r\nan air of sincerity that the farmer hesitated, and then he continued, as\r\nif speaking to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then? You have not had a misfortune, as\r\nthey call it, or it would have been known, and as it has no\r\nconsequences, no girl would refuse her master on that account. There\r\nmust be something at the bottom of it, however.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could say nothing; she had not the strength to speak, and he asked\r\nher again: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot, master,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a sigh,\r\nand he turned on his heel.\r\n\r\nShe thought she had got rid of him altogether and spent the rest of the\r\nday almost tranquilly, but was as exhausted as if she had been turning\r\nthe thrashing machine all day in the place of the old white horse, and\r\nshe went to bed as soon as she could and fell asleep immediately. In the\r\nmiddle of the night, however, two hands touching the bed woke her. She\r\ntrembled with fear, but immediately recognized the farmer's voice, when\r\nhe said to her: \xe2\x80\x9cDon't be frightened, Rose; I have come to speak to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d She was surprised at first, but when he tried to take liberties\r\nwith her she understood and began to tremble violently, as she felt\r\nquite alone in the darkness, still heavy from sleep, and quite\r\nunprotected, with that man standing near her. She certainly did not\r\nconsent, but she resisted carelessly struggling against that instinct\r\nwhich is always strong in simple natures and very imperfectly protected\r\nby the undecided will of inert and gentle races. She turned her head now\r\nto the wall, and now toward the room, in order to avoid the attentions\r\nwhich the farmer tried to press on her, but she was weakened by fatigue,\r\nwhile he became brutal, intoxicated by desire.\r\n\r\nThey lived together as man and wife, and one morning he said to her: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave put up our banns, and we will get married next month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, for what could she say? She did not resist, for what\r\ncould she do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nShe married him. She felt as if she were in a pit with inaccessible\r\nsides from which she could never get out, and all kinds of misfortunes\r\nwere hanging over her head, like huge rocks, which would fall on the\r\nfirst occasion. Her husband gave her the impression of a man whom she\r\nhad robbed, and who would find it out some day or other. And then she\r\nthought of her child, who was the cause of her misfortunes, but who was\r\nalso the cause of all her happiness on earth, and whom she went to see\r\ntwice a year, though she came back more unhappy each time.\r\n\r\nBut she gradually grew accustomed to her life, her fears were allayed,\r\nher heart was at rest, and she lived with an easier mind, though still\r\nwith some vague fear floating in it. And so years went on, until the\r\nchild was six. She was almost happy now, when suddenly the farmer's\r\ntemper grew very bad.\r\n\r\nFor two or three years he seemed to have been nursing some secret\r\nanxiety, to be troubled by some care, some mental disturbance, which was\r\ngradually increasing. He remained sitting at table after dinner, with\r\nhis head in his hands, sad and devoured by sorrow. He always spoke\r\nhastily, sometimes even brutally, and it even seemed as if he had a\r\ngrudge against his wife, for at times he answered her roughly, almost\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\nOne day, when a neighbor's boy came for some eggs, and she spoke rather\r\ncrossly to him, as she was very busy, her husband suddenly came in and\r\nsaid to her in his unpleasant voice: \xe2\x80\x9cIf that were your own child you\r\nwould not treat him so.\xe2\x80\x9d She was hurt and did not reply, and then she\r\nwent back into the house, with all her grief awakened afresh; and at\r\ndinner the farmer neither spoke to her nor looked at her, and he seemed\r\nto hate her, to despise her, to know something about the affair at last.\r\nIn consequence she lost her composure, and did not venture to remain\r\nalone with him after the meal was over, but left the room and hastened\r\nto the church.\r\n\r\nIt was getting dusk; the narrow nave was in total darkness, but she\r\nheard footsteps in the choir, for the sacristan was preparing the\r\ntabernacle lamp for the night. That spot of trembling light, which was\r\nlost in the darkness of the arches, looked to Rose like her last hope,\r\nand with her eyes fixed on it, she fell on her knees. The chain rattled\r\nas the little lamp swung up into the air, and almost immediately the\r\nsmall bell rang out the Angelus through the increasing mist. She went up\r\nto him, as he was going out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Monsieur le Cure at home?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course he is; this is his\r\ndinnertime.\xe2\x80\x9d She trembled as she rang the bell of the parsonage. The\r\npriest was just sitting down to dinner, and he made her sit down also.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know all about it; your husband has mentioned the matter to\r\nme that brings you here.\xe2\x80\x9d The poor woman nearly fainted, and the priest\r\ncontinued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, my child?\xe2\x80\x9d And he hastily swallowed\r\nseveral spoonfuls of soup, some of which dropped on to his greasy\r\ncassock. But Rose did not venture to say anything more, and she got up\r\nto go, but the priest said: \xe2\x80\x9cCourage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she went out and returned to the farm without knowing what she was\r\ndoing. The farmer was waiting for her, as the laborers had gone away\r\nduring her absence, and she fell heavily at his feet, and, shedding a\r\nflood of tears, she said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got against me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to shout and to swear: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I got against you? That I\r\nhave no children, by\xe2\x80\x94-. When a man takes a wife it is not that they may\r\nlive alone together to the end of their days. That is what I have\r\nagainst you. When a cow has no calves she is not worth anything, and\r\nwhen a woman has no children she is also not worth anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to cry, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my fault! It is not my fault!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ngrew rather more gentle when he heard that, and added: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not say\r\nthat it is, but it is very provoking, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward she had only one thought: to have a child another\r\nchild; she confided her wish to everybody, and, in consequence of this,\r\na neighbor told her of an infallible method. This was, to make her\r\nhusband drink a glass of water with a pinch of ashes in it every\r\nevening. The farmer consented to try it, but without success; so they\r\nsaid to each other: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps there are some secret ways?\xe2\x80\x9d And they tried\r\nto find out. They were told of a shepherd who lived ten leagues off, and\r\nso Vallin one day drove off to consult him. The shepherd gave him a loaf\r\non which he had made some marks; it was kneaded up with herbs, and each\r\nof them was to eat a piece of it, but they ate the whole loaf without\r\nobtaining any results from it.\r\n\r\nNext, a schoolmaster unveiled mysteries and processes of love which were\r\nunknown in the country, but infallible, so he declared; but none of them\r\nhad the desired effect. Then the priest advised them to make a\r\npilgrimage to the shrine at Fecamp. Rose went with the crowd and\r\nprostrated herself in the abbey, and, mingling her prayers with the\r\ncoarse desires of the peasants around her, she prayed that she might be\r\nfruitful a second time; but it was in vain, and then she thought that\r\nshe was being punished for her first fault, and she was seized by\r\nterrible grief. She was wasting away with sorrow; her husband was also\r\naging prematurely, and was wearing himself out in useless hopes.\r\n\r\nThen war broke out between them; he called her names and beat her. They\r\nquarrelled all day long, and when they were in their room together at\r\nnight he flung insults and obscenities at her, choking with rage, until\r\none night, not being able to think of any means of making her suffer\r\nmore he ordered her to get up and go and stand out of doors in the rain\r\nuntil daylight. As she did not obey him, he seized her by the neck and\r\nbegan to strike her in the face with his fists, but she said nothing and\r\ndid not move. In his exasperation he knelt on her stomach, and with\r\nclenched teeth, and mad with rage, he began to beat her. Then in her\r\ndespair she rebelled, and flinging him against the wall with a furious\r\ngesture, she sat up, and in an altered voice she hissed: \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a\r\nchild, I have had one! I had it by Jacques; you know Jacques. He\r\npromised to marry me, but he left this neighborhood without keeping his\r\nword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was thunderstruck and could hardly speak, but at last he\r\nstammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you saying? What are you saying?\xe2\x80\x9d Then she\r\nbegan to sob, and amid her tears she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the reason why\r\nI did not want to marry you. I could not tell you, for you would have\r\nleft me without any bread for my child. You have never had any children,\r\nso you cannot understand, you cannot understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said again, mechanically, with increasing surprise: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a\r\nchild? You have a child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou took me by force, as I suppose you know? I did not want to marry\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still sobbing.\r\n\r\nThen he got up, lit the candle, and began to walk up and down, with his\r\narms behind him. She was cowering on the bed and crying, and suddenly he\r\nstopped in front of her, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThen it is my fault that you have no\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x9d She gave him no answer, and he began to walk up and down\r\nagain, and then, stopping again, he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHow old is your child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust six,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not tell me about it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nHe remained standing, motionless. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, get up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. She got up\r\nwith some difficulty, and then, when she was standing on the floor, he\r\nsuddenly began to laugh with the hearty laugh of his good days, and,\r\nseeing how surprised she was, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, we will go and fetch\r\nthe child, as you and I can have none together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so scared that if she had had the strength she would assuredly\r\nhave run away, but the farmer rubbed his hands and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to\r\nadopt one, and now we have found one. I asked the cure about an orphan\r\nsome time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, still laughing, he kissed his weeping and agitated wife on both\r\ncheeks, and shouted out, as though she could not hear him: \xe2\x80\x9cCome along,\r\nmother, we will go and see whether there is any soup left; I should not\r\nmind a plateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put on her petticoat and they went downstairs; and while she was\r\nkneeling in front of the fireplace and lighting the fire under the\r\nsaucepan, he continued to walk up and down the kitchen with long\r\nstrides, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am really glad of this; I am not saying it for form's sake, but\r\nI am glad, I am really very glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRECK It was yesterday, the 31st of December.\r\n\r\nI had just finished breakfast with my old friend Georges Garin when the\r\nservant handed him a letter covered with seals and foreign stamps.\r\n\r\nGeorges said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you excuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he began to read the letter, which was written in a large English\r\nhandwriting, crossed and recrossed in every direction. He read them\r\nslowly, with serious attention and the interest which we only pay to\r\nthings which touch our hearts.\r\n\r\nThen he put the letter on the mantelpiece and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a curious story! I've never told you about it, I think. Yet it\r\nwas a sentimental adventure, and it really happened to me. That was a\r\nstrange New Year's Day, indeed! It must have been twenty years ago, for\r\nI was then thirty and am now fifty years old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was then an inspector in the Maritime Insurance Company, of which I\r\nam now director. I had arranged to pass New Year's Day in Paris\xe2\x80\x94since it\r\nis customary to make that day a fete\xe2\x80\x94when I received a letter from the\r\nmanager, asking me to proceed at once to the island of Re, where a\r\nthree-masted vessel from Saint-Nazaire, insured by us, had just been\r\ndriven ashore. It was then eight o'clock in the morning. I arrived at\r\nthe office at ten to get my advices, and that evening I took the\r\nexpress, which put me down in La Rochelle the next day, the 31st of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had two hours to wait before going aboard the boat for Re. So I made\r\na tour of the town. It is certainly a queer city, La Rochelle, with\r\nstrong characteristics of its own streets tangled like a labyrinth,\r\nsidewalks running under endless arcaded galleries like those of the Rue\r\nde Rivoli, but low, mysterious, built as if to form a suitable setting\r\nfor conspirators and making a striking background for those old-time\r\nwars, the savage heroic wars of religion. It is indeed the typical old\r\nHuguenot city, conservative, discreet, with no fine art to show, with no\r\nwonderful monuments, such as make Rouen; but it is remarkable for its\r\nsevere, somewhat sullen look; it is a city of obstinate fighters, a city\r\nwhere fanaticism might well blossom, where the faith of the Calvinists\r\nbecame enthusiastic and which gave birth to the plot of the 'Four\r\nSergeants.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter I had wandered for some time about these curious streets, I went\r\naboard the black, rotund little steamboat which was to take me to the\r\nisland of Re. It was called the Jean Guiton. It started with angry\r\npuffings, passed between the two old towers which guard the harbor,\r\ncrossed the roadstead and issued from the mole built by Richelieu, the\r\ngreat stones of which can be seen at the water's edge, enclosing the\r\ntown like a great necklace. Then the steamboat turned to the right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was one of those sad days which give one the blues, tighten the\r\nheart and take away all strength and energy and force-a gray, cold day,\r\nwith a heavy mist which was as wet as rain, as cold as frost, as bad to\r\nbreathe as the steam of a wash-tub.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder this low sky of dismal fog the shallow, yellow, sandy sea of all\r\npractically level beaches lay without a wrinkle, without a movement,\r\nwithout life, a sea of turbid water, of greasy water, of stagnant water.\r\nThe Jean Guiton passed over it, rolling a little from habit, dividing\r\nthe smooth, dark blue water and leaving behind a few waves, a little\r\nsplashing, a slight swell, which soon calmed down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to talk to the captain, a little man with small feet, as round\r\nas his boat and rolling in the same manner. I wanted some details of the\r\ndisaster on which I was to draw up a report. A great square-rigged\r\nthree-master, the Marie Joseph, of Saint-Nazaire, had gone ashore one\r\nnight in a hurricane on the sands of the island of Re.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe owner wrote us that the storm had thrown the ship so far ashore\r\nthat it was impossible to float her and that they had to remove\r\neverything which could be detached with the utmost possible haste.\r\nNevertheless I must examine the situation of the wreck, estimate what\r\nmust have been her condition before the disaster and decide whether all\r\nefforts had been used to get her afloat. I came as an agent of the\r\ncompany in order to give contradictory testimony, if necessary, at the\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn receipt of my report, the manager would take what measures he might\r\nthink necessary to protect our interests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain of the Jean Guiton knew all about the affair, having been\r\nsummoned with his boat to assist in the attempts at salvage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me the story of the disaster. The Marie Joseph, driven by a\r\nfurious gale lost her bearings completely in the night, and steering by\r\nchance over a heavy foaming sea\xe2\x80\x94'a milk-soup sea,' said the captain\xe2\x80\x94had\r\ngone ashore on those immense sand banks which make the coasts of this\r\ncountry look like limitless Saharas when the tide is low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile talking I looked around and ahead. Between the ocean and the\r\nlowering sky lay an open space where the eye could see into the\r\ndistance. We were following a coast. I asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Is that the island of Re?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd suddenly the captain stretched his right hand out before us,\r\npointed to something almost imperceptible in the open sea, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'There's your ship!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The Marie Joseph!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was amazed. This black, almost imperceptible speck, which looked to\r\nme like a rock, seemed at least three miles from land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'But, captain, there must be a hundred fathoms of water in that place.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A hundred fathoms, my child! Well, I should say about two!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was from Bordeaux. He continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's now nine-forty, just high tide. Go down along the beach with your\r\nhands in your pockets after you've had lunch at the Hotel du Dauphin,\r\nand I'll wager that at ten minutes to three, or three o'clock, you'll\r\nreach the wreck without wetting your feet, and have from an hour and\r\nthree-quarters to two hours aboard of her; but not more, or you'll be\r\ncaught. The faster the sea goes out the faster it comes back. This coast\r\nis as flat as a turtle! But start away at ten minutes to five, as I tell\r\nyou, and at half-past seven you will be again aboard of the Jean Guiton,\r\nwhich will put you down this same evening on the quay at La Rochelle.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thanked the captain and I went and sat down in the bow of the steamer\r\nto get a good look at the little city of Saint-Martin, which we were now\r\nrapidly approaching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just like all small seaports which serve as capitals of the\r\nbarren islands scattered along the coast\xe2\x80\x94a large fishing village, one\r\nfoot on sea and one on shore, subsisting on fish and wild fowl,\r\nvegetables and shell-fish, radishes and mussels. The island is very low\r\nand little cultivated, yet it seems to be thickly populated. However, I\r\ndid not penetrate into the interior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter breakfast I climbed across a little promontory, and then, as the\r\ntide was rapidly falling, I started out across the sands toward a kind\r\nof black rock which I could just perceive above the surface of the\r\nwater, out a considerable distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked quickly over the yellow plain. It was elastic, like flesh and\r\nseemed to sweat beneath my tread. The sea had been there very lately.\r\nNow I perceived it at a distance, escaping out of sight, and I no longer\r\ncould distinguish the line which separated the sands from ocean. I felt\r\nas though I were looking at a gigantic supernatural work of enchantment.\r\nThe Atlantic had just now been before me, then it had disappeared into\r\nthe sands, just as scenery disappears through a trap; and I was now\r\nwalking in the midst of a desert. Only the feeling, the breath of the\r\nsalt-water, remained in me. I perceived the smell of the wrack, the\r\nsmell of the sea, the good strong smell of sea coasts. I walked fast; I\r\nwas no longer cold. I looked at the stranded wreck, which grew in size\r\nas I approached, and came now to resemble an enormous shipwrecked whale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed fairly to rise out of the ground, and on that great, flat,\r\nyellow stretch of sand assumed wonderful proportions. After an hour's\r\nwalk I at last reached it. It lay upon its side, ruined and shattered,\r\nits broken bones showing as though it were an animal, its bones of\r\ntarred wood pierced with great bolts. The sand had already invaded it,\r\nentering it by all the crannies, and held it and refused to let it go.\r\nIt seemed to have taken root in it. The bow had entered deep into this\r\nsoft, treacherous beach, while the stern, high in air, seemed to cast at\r\nheaven, like a cry of despairing appeal, the two white words on the\r\nblack planking, Marie Joseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI climbed upon this carcass of a ship by the lowest side; then, having\r\nreached the deck, I went below. The daylight, which entered by the\r\nstove-in hatches and the cracks in the sides, showed me dimly long dark\r\ncavities full of demolished woodwork. They contained nothing but sand,\r\nwhich served as foot-soil in this cavern of planks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to take some notes about the condition of the ship. I was\r\nseated on a broken empty cask, writing by the light of a great crack,\r\nthrough which I could perceive the boundless stretch of the strand. A\r\nstrange shivering of cold and loneliness ran over my skin from time to\r\ntime, and I would often stop writing for a moment to listen to the\r\nmysterious noises in the derelict: the noise of crabs scratching the\r\nplanking with their crooked claws; the noise of a thousand little\r\ncreatures of the sea already crawling over this dead body or else boring\r\ninto the wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly, very near me, I heard human voices. I started as though I had\r\nseen a ghost. For a second I really thought I was about to see drowned\r\nmen rise from the sinister depths of the hold, who would tell me about\r\ntheir death. At any rate, it did not take me long to swing myself on\r\ndeck. There, standing by the bows, was a tall Englishman with three\r\nyoung misses. Certainly they were a good deal more frightened at seeing\r\nthis sudden apparition on the abandoned three-master than I was at\r\nseeing them. The youngest girl turned and ran, the two others threw\r\ntheir arms round their father. As for him, he opened his mouth\xe2\x80\x94that was\r\nthe only sign of emotion which he showed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, after several seconds, he spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Mosieu, are you the owner of this ship?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'May I go over it?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You may.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he uttered a long sentence in English, in which I only\r\ndistinguished the word 'gracious,' repeated several times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs he was looking for a place to climb up I showed him the easiest way,\r\nand gave him a hand. He climbed up. Then we helped up the three girls,\r\nwho had now quite recovered their composure. They were charming,\r\nespecially the oldest, a blonde of eighteen, fresh as a flower, and very\r\ndainty and pretty! Ah, yes! the pretty Englishwomen have indeed the look\r\nof tender sea fruit. One would have said of this one that she had just\r\nrisen out of the sands and that her hair had kept their tint. They all,\r\nwith their exquisite freshness, make you think of the delicate colors of\r\npink sea-shells and of shining pearls hidden in the unknown depths of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe spoke French a little better than her father and acted as\r\ninterpreter. I had to tell all about the shipwreck, and I romanced as\r\nthough I had been present at the catastrophe. Then the whole family\r\ndescended into the interior of the wreck. As soon as they had penetrated\r\ninto this sombre, dimly lit cavity they uttered cries of astonishment\r\nand admiration. Suddenly the father and his three daughters were holding\r\nsketch-books in their hands, which they had doubtless carried hidden\r\nsomewhere in their heavy weather-proof clothes, and were all beginning\r\nat once to make pencil sketches of this melancholy and weird place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had seated themselves side by side on a projecting beam, and the\r\nfour sketch-books on the eight knees were being rapidly covered with\r\nlittle black lines which were intended to represent the half-opened hulk\r\nof the Marie Joseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI continued to inspect the skeleton of the ship, and the oldest girl\r\ntalked to me while she worked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had none of the usual English arrogance; they were simple honest\r\nhearts of that class of continuous travellers with which England covers\r\nthe globe. The father was long and thin, with a red face framed in white\r\nwhiskers, and looking like a living sandwich, a piece of ham carved like\r\na face between two wads of hair. The daughters, who had long legs like\r\nyoung storks, were also thin-except the oldest. All three were pretty,\r\nespecially the tallest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had such a droll way of speaking, of laughing, of understanding and\r\nof not understanding, of raising her eyes to ask a question (eyes blue\r\nas the deep ocean), of stopping her drawing a moment to make a guess at\r\nwhat you meant, of returning once more to work, of saying 'yes' or\r\n'no'\xe2\x80\x94that I could have listened and looked indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly she murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I hear a little sound on this boat.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI listened and I immediately distinguished a low, steady, curious\r\nsound. I rose and looked out of the crack and gave a scream. The sea had\r\ncome up to us; it would soon surround us!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were on deck in an instant. It was too late. The water circled us\r\nabout and was running toward the coast at tremendous speed. No, it did\r\nnot run, it glided, crept, spread like an immense, limitless blot. The\r\nwater was barely a few centimeters deep, but the rising flood had gone\r\nso far that we no longer saw the vanishing line of the imperceptible\r\ntide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman wanted to jump. I held him back. Flight was impossible\r\nbecause of the deep places which we had been obliged to go round on our\r\nway out and into which we should fall on our return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a minute of horrible anguish in our hearts. Then the little\r\nEnglish girl began to smile and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is we who are shipwrecked.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to laugh, but fear held me, a fear which was cowardly and\r\nhorrid and base and treacherous like the tide. All the danger which we\r\nran appeared to me at once. I wanted to shriek: 'Help!' But to whom?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two younger girls were clinging to their father, who looked in\r\nconsternation at the measureless sea which hedged us round about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe night fell as swiftly as the ocean rose\xe2\x80\x94a lowering, wet, icy night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'There's nothing to do but to stay on the ship:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, yes!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we waited there a quarter of an hour, half an hour, indeed I don't\r\nknow how long, watching that creeping water growing deeper as it swirled\r\naround us, as though it were playing on the beach, which it had\r\nregained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the young girls was cold, and we went below to shelter ourselves\r\nfrom the light but freezing wind that made our skins tingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leaned over the hatchway. The ship was full of water. So we had to\r\ncower against the stern planking, which shielded us a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarkness was now coming on, and we remained huddled together. I felt\r\nthe shoulder of the little English girl trembling against mine, her\r\nteeth chattering from time to time. But I also felt the gentle warmth of\r\nher body through her ulster, and that warmth was as delicious to me as a\r\nkiss. We no longer spoke; we sat motionless, mute, cowering down like\r\nanimals in a ditch when a hurricane is raging. And, nevertheless,\r\ndespite the night, despite the terrible and increasing danger, I began\r\nto feel happy that I was there, glad of the cold and the peril, glad of\r\nthe long hours of darkness and anguish that I must pass on this plank so\r\nnear this dainty, pretty little girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked myself, 'Why this strange sensation of well-being and of joy?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! Does one know? Because she was there? Who? She, a little unknown\r\nEnglish girl? I did not love her, I did not even know her. And for all\r\nthat, I was touched and conquered. I wanted to save her, to sacrifice\r\nmyself for her, to commit a thousand follies! Strange thing! How does it\r\nhappen that the presence of a woman overwhelms us so? Is it the power of\r\nher grace which enfolds us? Is it the seduction of her beauty and youth,\r\nwhich intoxicates one like wine?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not rather the touch of Love, of Love the Mysterious, who seeks\r\nconstantly to unite two beings, who tries his strength the instant he\r\nhas put a man and a woman face to face?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe silence of the darkness became terrible, the stillness of the sky\r\ndreadful, because we could hear vaguely about us a slight, continuous\r\nsound, the sound of the rising tide and the monotonous plashing of the\r\nwater against the ship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly I heard the sound of sobs. The youngest of the girls was\r\ncrying. Her father tried to console her, and they began to talk in their\r\nown tongue, which I did not understand. I guessed that he was reassuring\r\nher and that she was still afraid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked my neighbor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are not too cold, are you, mademoiselle?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, yes. I am very cold.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offered to give her my cloak; she refused it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I had taken it off and I covered her with it against her will. In\r\nthe short struggle her hand touched mine. It made a delicious thrill run\r\nthrough my body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor some minutes the air had been growing brisker, the dashing of the\r\nwater stronger against the flanks of the ship. I raised myself; a great\r\ngust of wind blew in my face. The wind was rising!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman perceived this at the same time that I did and said\r\nsimply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This is bad for us, this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it was bad, it was certain death if any breakers, however\r\nfeeble, should attack and shake the wreck, which was already so\r\nshattered and disconnected that the first big sea would carry it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo our anguish increased momentarily as the squalls grew stronger and\r\nstronger. Now the sea broke a little, and I saw in the darkness white\r\nlines appearing and disappearing, lines of foam, while each wave struck\r\nthe Marie Joseph and shook her with a short quiver which went to our\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe English girl was trembling. I felt her shiver against me. And I had\r\na wild desire to take her in my arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown there, before and behind us, to the left and right, lighthouses\r\nwere shining along the shore\xe2\x80\x94lighthouses white, yellow and red,\r\nrevolving like the enormous eyes of giants who were watching us, waiting\r\neagerly for us to disappear. One of them in especial irritated me. It\r\nwent out every thirty seconds and it lit up again immediately. It was\r\nindeed an eye, that one, with its lid incessantly lowered over its fiery\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom time to time the Englishman struck a match to see the hour; then\r\nhe put his watch back in his pocket. Suddenly he said to me, over the\r\nheads of his daughters, with tremendous gravity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I wish you a happy New Year, Mosieu.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was midnight. I held out my hand, which he pressed. Then he said\r\nsomething in English, and suddenly he and his daughters began to sing\r\n'God Save the Queen,' which rose through the black and silent air and\r\nvanished into space.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first I felt a desire to laugh; then I was seized by a powerful,\r\nstrange emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was something sinister and superb, this chant of the shipwrecked,\r\nthe condemned, something like a prayer and also like something grander,\r\nsomething comparable to the ancient 'Ave Caesar morituri te salutant.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they had finished I asked my neighbor to sing a ballad alone,\r\nanything she liked, to make us forget our terrors. She consented, and\r\nimmediately her clear young voice rang out into the night. She sang\r\nsomething which was doubtless sad, because the notes were long drawn out\r\nand hovered, like wounded birds, above the waves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sea was rising now and beating upon our wreck. As for me, I thought\r\nonly of that voice. And I thought also of the sirens. If a ship had\r\npassed near by us what would the sailors have said? My troubled spirit\r\nlost itself in the dream! A siren! Was she not really a siren, this\r\ndaughter of the sea, who had kept me on this worm-eaten ship and who was\r\nsoon about to go down with me deep into the waters?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suddenly we were all five rolling on the deck, because the Marie\r\nJoseph had sunk on her right side. The English girl had fallen upon me,\r\nand before I knew what I was doing, thinking that my last moment was\r\ncome, I had caught her in my arms and kissed her cheek, her temple and\r\nher hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ship did not move again, and we, we also, remained motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe father said, 'Kate!' The one whom I was holding answered 'Yes' and\r\nmade a movement to free herself. And at that moment I should have wished\r\nthe ship to split in two and let me fall with her into the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A little rocking; it's nothing. I have my three daughters safe.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot having seen the oldest, he had thought she was lost overboard!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rose slowly, and suddenly I made out a light on the sea quite close\r\nto us. I shouted; they answered. It was a boat sent out in search of us\r\nby the hotelkeeper, who had guessed at our imprudence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were saved. I was in despair. They picked us up off our raft and\r\nthey brought us back to Saint-Martin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman began to rub his hand and murmur:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A good supper! A good supper!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did sup. I was not gay. I regretted the Marie Joseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had to separate the next day after much handshaking and many\r\npromises to write. They departed for Biarritz. I wanted to follow them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was hard hit. I wanted to ask this little girl to marry me. If we had\r\npassed eight days together, I should have done so! How weak and\r\nincomprehensible a man sometimes is!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years passed without my hearing a word from them. Then I received a\r\nletter from New York. She was married and wrote to tell me. And since\r\nthen we write to each other every year, on New Year's Day. She tells me\r\nabout her life, talks of her children, her sisters, never of her\r\nhusband! Why? Ah! why? And as for me, I only talk of the Marie Joseph.\r\nThat was perhaps the only woman I have ever loved\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94that I ever should\r\nhave loved. Ah, well! who can tell? Circumstances rule one. And then\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94all passes. She must be old now; I should not know her. Ah! she of\r\nthe bygone time, she of the wreck! What a creature! Divine! She writes\r\nme her hair is white. That caused me terrible pain. Ah! her yellow hair.\r\nNo, my English girl exists no longer. How sad it all is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODULE SABOT'S CONFESSION\r\n\r\nWhen Sabot entered the inn at Martinville it was a signal for laughter.\r\nWhat a rogue he was, this Sabot! There was a man who did not like\r\npriests, for instance! Oh, no, oh, no! He did not spare them, the scamp.\r\n\r\nSabot (Theodule), a master carpenter, represented liberal thought in\r\nMartinville. He was a tall, thin man, with gray, cunning eyes, and thin\r\nlips, and wore his hair plastered down on his temples. When he said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur holy father, the pope\xe2\x80\x9d in a certain manner, everyone laughed. He\r\nmade a point of working on Sunday during the hour of mass. He killed his\r\npig each year on Monday in Holy Week in order to have enough black\r\npudding to last till Easter, and when the priest passed by, he always\r\nsaid by way of a joke: \xe2\x80\x9cThere goes one who has just swallowed his God\r\noff a salver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest, a stout man and also very tall, dreaded him on account of\r\nhis boastful talk which attracted followers. The Abbe Maritime was a\r\npolitic man, and believed in being diplomatic. There had been a rivalry\r\nbetween them for ten years, a secret, intense, incessant rivalry. Sabot\r\nwas municipal councillor, and they thought he would become mayor, which\r\nwould inevitably mean the final overthrow of the church.\r\n\r\nThe elections were about to take place. The church party was shaking in\r\nits shoes in Martinville.\r\n\r\nOne morning the cure set out for Rouen, telling his servant that he was\r\ngoing to see the archbishop. He returned in two days with a joyous,\r\ntriumphant air. And everyone knew the following day that the chancel of\r\nthe church was going to be renovated. A sum of six hundred francs had\r\nbeen contributed by the archbishop out of his private fund. All the old\r\npine pews were to be removed, and replaced by new pews made of oak. It\r\nwould be a big carpentering job, and they talked about it that very\r\nevening in all the houses in the village.\r\n\r\nTheodule Sabot was not laughing.\r\n\r\nWhen he went through the village the following morning, the neighbors,\r\nfriends and enemies, all asked him, jokingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to do the work on the chancel of the church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could find nothing to say, but he was furious, he was good and angry.\r\n\r\nIll-natured people added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good piece of work; and will bring in not less than two or\r\nthree per cent. profit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo days later, they heard that the work of renovation had been\r\nentrusted to Celestin Chambrelan, the carpenter from Percheville. Then\r\nthis was denied, and it was said that all the pews in the church were\r\ngoing to be changed. That would be well worth the two thousand francs\r\nthat had been demanded of the church administration.\r\n\r\nTheodule Sabot could not sleep for thinking about it. Never, in all the\r\nmemory of man, had a country carpenter undertaken a similar piece of\r\nwork. Then a rumor spread abroad that the cure felt very grieved that he\r\nhad to give this work to a carpenter who was a stranger in the\r\ncommunity, but that Sabot's opinions were a barrier to his being\r\nentrusted with the job.\r\n\r\nSabot knew it well. He called at the parsonage just as it was growing\r\ndark. The servant told him that the cure was at church. He went to the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nTwo attendants on the altar of the Virgin, two sour old maids, were\r\ndecorating the altar for the month of Mary, under the direction of the\r\npriest, who stood in the middle of the chancel with his portly paunch,\r\ndirecting the two women who, mounted on chairs, were placing flowers\r\naround the tabernacle.\r\n\r\nSabot felt ill at ease in there, as though he were in the house of his\r\ngreatest enemy, but the greed of gain was gnawing at his heart. He drew\r\nnearer, holding his cap in his hand, and not paying any attention to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdemoiselles de la Vierge,\xe2\x80\x9d who remained standing startled, astonished,\r\nmotionless on their chairs.\r\n\r\nHe faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, monsieur le cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest replied without looking at him, all occupied as he was with\r\nthe altar:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Mr. Carpenter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSabot, nonplussed, knew not what to say next. But after a pause he\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are making preparations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbbe Maritime replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we are near the month of Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, why,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Sabot and then was silent. He would have liked to\r\nretire now without saying anything, but a glance at the chancel held him\r\nback. He saw sixteen seats that had to be remade, six to the right and\r\neight to the left, the door of the sacristy occupying the place of two.\r\nSixteen oak seats, that would be worth at most three hundred francs, and\r\nby figuring carefully one might certainly make two hundred francs on the\r\nwork if one were not clumsy.\r\n\r\nThen he stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come about the work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cure appeared surprised. He asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Sabot, in dismay.\r\n\r\nThen the priest turned round and looking him straight in the eyes, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean the repairs in the chancel of my church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the tone of the abbe, Theodule Sabot felt a chill run down his back\r\nand he once more had a longing to take to his heels. However, he replied\r\nhumbly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, monsieur le cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the abbe folded his arms across his large stomach and, as if filled\r\nwith amazement, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94you, Sabot\xe2\x80\x94who have come to ask me for this . . . You\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nonly irreligious man in my parish! Why, it would be a scandal, a public\r\nscandal! The archbishop would give me a reprimand, perhaps transfer me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped a few seconds, for breath, and then resumed in a calmer tone:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can understand that it pains you to see a work of such importance\r\nentrusted to a carpenter from a neighboring parish. But I cannot do\r\notherwise, unless\xe2\x80\x94but no\xe2\x80\x94it is impossible\xe2\x80\x94you would not consent, and\r\nunless you did, never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSabot now looked at the row of benches in line as far as the entrance\r\ndoor. Christopher, if they were going to change all those!\r\n\r\nAnd he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you require of me? Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest, in a firm tone replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have an extraordinary token of your good intentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say\xe2\x80\x94I do not say; perhaps we might come to an understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfaltered Sabot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to take communion publicly at high mass next Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndeclared the cure.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter felt he was growing pale, and without replying, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the benches, are they going to be renovated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe abbe replied with confidence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but later on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSabot resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say, I do not say. I am not calling it off, I am consenting to\r\nreligion, for sure. But what rubs me the wrong way is, putting it in\r\npractice; but in this case I will not be refractory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe attendants of the Virgin, having got off their chairs had concealed\r\nthemselves behind the altar; and they listened pale with emotion.\r\n\r\nThe cure, seeing he had gained the victory, became all at once very\r\nfriendly, quite familiar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is good, that is good. That was wisely said, and not stupid, you\r\nunderstand. You will see, you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSabot smiled and asked with an awkward air:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it not be possible to put off this communion just a trifle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the priest replied, resuming his severe expression:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the moment that the work is put into your hands, I want to be\r\nassured of your conversion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he continued more gently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will come to confession to-morrow; for I must examine you at least\r\ntwice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwice?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Sabot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand perfectly that you must have a general cleaning up, a\r\nthorough cleansing. So I will expect you to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carpenter, much agitated, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94in the confessional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn\xe2\x80\x94that box, over there in the corner? The fact is\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94that it does not\r\nsuit me, your box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing that\xe2\x80\x94seeing that I am not accustomed to that, and also I am\r\nrather hard of hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cure was very affable and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then! you shall come to my house and into my parlor. We will have\r\nit just the two of us, tete-a-tete. Does that suit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is all right, that will suit me, but your box, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, to-morrow after the days work, at six o'clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is understood, that is all right, that is agreed on. To-morrow,\r\nmonsieur le cure. Whoever draws back is a skunk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he held out his great rough hand which the priest grasped heartily\r\nwith a clap that resounded through the church.\r\n\r\nTheodule Sabot was not easy in his mind all the following day. He had a\r\nfeeling analogous to the apprehension one experiences when a tooth has\r\nto be drawn. The thought recurred to him at every moment: \xe2\x80\x9cI must go to\r\nconfession this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d And his troubled mind, the mind of an atheist\r\nonly half convinced, was bewildered with a confused and overwhelming\r\ndread of the divine mystery.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had finished his work, he betook himself to the parsonage.\r\nThe cure was waiting for him in the garden, reading his breviary as he\r\nwalked along a little path. He appeared radiant and greeted him with a\r\ngood-natured laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here we are! Come in, come in, Monsieur Sabot, no one will eat\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Sabot preceded him into the house. He faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not mind I should like to get through with this little matter\r\nat once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cure replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at your service. I have my surplice here. One minute and I will\r\nlisten to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carpenter, so disturbed that he had not two ideas in his head,\r\nwatched him as he put on the white vestment with its pleated folds. The\r\npriest beckoned to him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKneel down on this cushion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSabot remained standing, ashamed of having to kneel. He stuttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the abbe had become dignified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot approach the penitent bench except on your knees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Sabot knelt down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepeat the confiteor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the priest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sabot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe confiteor. If you do not remember it, repeat after me, one by one,\r\nthe words I am going to say.\xe2\x80\x9d And the cure repeated the sacred prayer,\r\nin a slow tone, emphasizing the words which the carpenter repeated after\r\nhim. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow make your confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sabot was silent, not knowing where to begin. The abbe then came to\r\nhis aid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child, I will ask you questions, since you don't seem familiar with\r\nthese things. We will take, one by one, the commandments of God. Listen\r\nto me and do not be disturbed. Speak very frankly and never fear that\r\nyou may say too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'One God alone, thou shalt adore, And love him perfectly.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever loved anything, or anybody, as well as you loved God?\r\nHave you loved him with all your soul, all your heart, all the strength\r\nof your love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSabot was perspiring with the effort of thinking. He replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Oh, no, m'sieu le cure. I love God as much as I can. That is \xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nlove him very much. To say that I do not love my children, no\xe2\x80\x94I cannot\r\nsay that. To say that if I had to choose between them and God, I could\r\nnot be sure. To say that if I had to lose a hundred francs for the love\r\nof God, I could not say about that. But I love him well, for sure, I\r\nlove him all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d The priest said gravely \xe2\x80\x9cYou must love Him more\r\nthan all besides.\xe2\x80\x9d And Sabot, meaning well, declared \xe2\x80\x9cI will do what I\r\npossibly can, m'sieu le cure.\xe2\x80\x9d The abbe resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'God's name in vain thou shalt not take Nor swear by any other thing.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever swear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-oh, that, no! I never swear, never. Sometimes, in a moment of anger,\r\nI may say sacre nom de Dieu! But then, I never swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is swearing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the priest, and added seriously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not do it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Thy Sundays thou shalt keep In serving God devoutly.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do on Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Sabot scratched his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I serve God as best I can, m'sieu le cure. I serve him\xe2\x80\x94at home. I\r\nwork on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cure interrupted him, saying magnanimously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, you will do better in future. I will pass over the following\r\ncommandments, certain that you have not transgressed the two first. We\r\nwill take from the sixth to the ninth. I will resume:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Others' goods thou shalt not take Nor keep what is not thine.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever taken in any way what belonged to another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Theodule Sabot became indignant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not, of course not! I am an honest man, m'sieu le cure, I\r\nswear it, for sure. To say that I have not sometimes charged for a few\r\nmore hours of work to customers who had means, I could not say that. To\r\nsay that I never add a few centimes to bills, only a few, I would not\r\nsay that. But to steal, no! Oh, not that, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest resumed severely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take one single centime constitutes a theft. Do not do it again.\r\n\r\n'False witness thou shalt not bear, Nor lie in any way.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever told a lie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, as to that, no. I am not a liar. That is my quality. To say that I\r\nhave never told a big story, I would not like to say that. To say that I\r\nhave never made people believe things that were not true when it was to\r\nmy own interest, I would not like to say that. But as for lying, I am\r\nnot a liar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest simply said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch yourself more closely.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The works of the flesh thou shalt not desire Except in marriage only.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever desire, or live with, any other woman than your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSabot exclaimed with sincerity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that, no; oh, as to that, no, m'sieu le Cure. My poor wife,\r\ndeceive her! No, no! Not so much as the tip of a finger, either in\r\nthought or in act. That is the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were silent a few seconds, then, in a lower tone, as though a doubt\r\nhad arisen in his mind, he resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I go to town, to say that I never go into a house, you know, one\r\nof the licensed houses, just to laugh and talk and see something\r\ndifferent, I could not say that. But I always pay, monsieur le cure, I\r\nalways pay. From the moment you pay, without anyone seeing or knowing\r\nyou, no one can get you into trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cure did not insist, and gave him absolution.\r\n\r\nTheodule Sabot did the work on the chancel, and goes to communion every\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRONG HOUSE\r\n\r\nQuartermaster Varajou had obtained a week's leave to go and visit his\r\nsister, Madame Padoie. Varajou, who was in garrison at Rennes and was\r\nleading a pretty gay life, finding himself high and dry, wrote to his\r\nsister saying that he would devote a week to her. It was not that he\r\ncared particularly for Mme. Padoie, a little moralist, a devotee, and\r\nalways cross; but he needed money, needed it very badly, and he\r\nremembered that, of all his relations, the Padoies were the only ones\r\nwhom he had never approached on the subject.\r\n\r\nPere Varajou, formerly a horticulturist at Angers, but now retired from\r\nbusiness, had closed his purse strings to his scapegrace son and had\r\nhardly seen him for two years. His daughter had married Padoie, a former\r\ntreasury clerk, who had just been appointed tax collector at Vannes.\r\n\r\nVarajou, on leaving the train, had some one direct him to the house of\r\nhis brother-in-law, whom he found in his office arguing with the Breton\r\npeasants of the neighborhood. Padoie rose from his seat, held out his\r\nhand across the table littered with papers, murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cTake a chair. I\r\nwill be at liberty in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d sat down again and resumed his\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe peasants did not understand his explanations, the collector did not\r\nunderstand their line of argument. He spoke French, they spoke Breton,\r\nand the clerk who acted as interpreter appeared not to understand\r\neither.\r\n\r\nIt lasted a long time, a very long time. Varajou looked at his brother-\r\nin-law and thought: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d Padoie must have been almost fifty.\r\nHe was tall, thin, bony, slow, hairy, with heavy arched eyebrows. He\r\nwore a velvet skull cap with a gold cord vandyke design round it. His\r\nlook was gentle, like his actions. His speech, his gestures, his\r\nthoughts, all were soft. Varajou said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe, himself, was one of those noisy roysterers for whom the greatest\r\npleasures in life are the cafe and abandoned women. He understood\r\nnothing outside of these conditions of existence.\r\n\r\nA boisterous braggart, filled with contempt for the rest of the world,\r\nhe despised the entire universe from the height of his ignorance. When\r\nhe said: \xe2\x80\x9cNom d'un chien, what a spree!\xe2\x80\x9d he expressed the highest degree\r\nof admiration of which his mind was capable.\r\n\r\nHaving finally got rid of his peasants, Padoie inquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, as you see. And how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite well, thank you. It is very kind of you to have thought of coming\r\nto see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have been thinking of it for some time; but, you know, in the\r\nmilitary profession one has not much freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know, I know. All the same, it is very kind of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Josephine, is she well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, thank you; you will see her presently.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is making some calls. We have a great many friends here; it is a\r\nvery nice town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Mme. Padoie appeared. She went over to her brother\r\nwithout any eagerness, held her cheek for him to kiss, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been here long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, hardly half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I thought the train would be late. Will you come into the parlor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went into the adjoining room, leaving Padoie to his accounts and\r\nhis taxpayers. As soon as they were alone, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard nice things about you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that you are behaving like a blackguard, getting drunk and\r\ncontracting debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared very much astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! never in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do not deny it, I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe attempted to defend himself, but she gave him such a lecture that he\r\ncould say nothing more.\r\n\r\nShe then resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe dine at six o'clock, and you can amuse yourself until then. I cannot\r\nentertain you, as I have so many things to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was alone he hesitated as to whether he should sleep or take a\r\nwalk. He looked first at the door leading to his room and then at the\r\nhall door, and decided to go out. He sauntered slowly through the quiet\r\nBreton town, so sleepy, so calm, so dead, on the shores of its inland\r\nbay that is called \xe2\x80\x9cle Morbihan.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the little gray houses,\r\nthe occasional pedestrians, the empty stores, and he murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVannes is certainly not gay, not lively. It was a sad idea, my coming\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reached the harbor, the desolate harbor, walked back along a lonely,\r\ndeserted boulevard, and got home before five o'clock. Then he threw\r\nhimself on his bed to sleep till dinner time. The maid woke him,\r\nknocking at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner is ready, sir:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs. In the damp dining-room with the paper peeling from\r\nthe walls near the floor, he saw a soup tureen on a round table without\r\nany table cloth, on which were also three melancholy soup-plates.\r\n\r\nM. and Mme. Padoie entered the room at the same time as Varajou. They\r\nall sat down to table, and the husband and wife crossed themselves over\r\nthe pit of their stomachs, after which Padoie helped the soup, a meat\r\nsoup. It was the day for pot-roast.\r\n\r\nAfter the soup, they had the beef, which was done to rags, melted,\r\ngreasy, like pap. The officer ate slowly, with disgust, weariness and\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nMme. Padoie said to her husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to the judge's house this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not stay late. You always get so tired when you go out. You are not\r\nmade for society, with your poor health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then talked about society in Vannes, of the excellent social circle\r\nin which the Padoies moved, thanks to their religious sentiments.\r\n\r\nA puree of potatoes and a dish of pork were next served, in honor of the\r\nguest. Then some cheese, and that was all. No coffee.\r\n\r\nWhen Varajou saw that he would have to spend the evening tete-a-tete\r\nwith his sister, endure her reproaches, listen to her sermons, without\r\neven a glass of liqueur to help him to swallow these remonstrances, he\r\nfelt that he could not stand the torture, and declared that he was\r\nobliged to go to the police station to have something attended to\r\nregarding his leave of absence. And he made his escape at seven o'clock.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely reached the street before he gave himself a shake like a\r\ndog coming out of the water. He muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens, heavens, heavens, what a galley slave's life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he set out to look for a cafe, the best in the town. He found it on\r\na public square, behind two gas lamps. Inside the cafe, five or six men,\r\nsemi-gentlemen, and not noisy, were drinking and chatting quietly,\r\nleaning their elbows on the small tables, while two billiard players\r\nwalked round the green baize, where the balls were hitting each other as\r\nthey rolled.\r\n\r\nOne heard them counting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighteen-nineteen. No luck. Oh, that's a good stroke! Well played!\r\nEleven. You should have played on the red. Twenty. Froze! Froze! Twelve.\r\nHa! Wasn't I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVarajou ordered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA demi-tasse and a small decanter of brandy, the best.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he sat\r\ndown and waited for it.\r\n\r\nHe was accustomed to spending his evenings off duty with his companions,\r\namid noise and the smoke of pipes. This silence, this quiet, exasperated\r\nhim. He began to drink; first the coffee, then the brandy, and asked for\r\nanother decanter. He now wanted to laugh, to shout, to sing, to fight\r\nsome one. He said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee, I am half full. I must go and have a good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he thought he would go and look for some girls to amuse him. He\r\ncalled the waiter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, waiter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, where does one amuse oneself here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man looked stupid, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know, sir. Here, I suppose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean here? What do you call amusing oneself, yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know, sir, drinking good beer or good wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, go away, dummy, how about the girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girls, ah! ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the girls, where can one find any here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, girls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy approached and lowering his voice, said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know where\r\nthey live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take the second street to the left and then the first to the right.\r\nIt is number fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, old man. There is something for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Varajou went out of the cafe, repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cSecond to the left, first\r\nto the right, number 15.\xe2\x80\x9d But at the end of a few seconds he thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csecond to the left yes. But on leaving the cafe must I walk to the\r\nright or the left? Bah, it cannot be helped, we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he walked on, turned down the second street to the left, then the\r\nfirst to the right and looked for number 15. It was a nice looking\r\nhouse, and one could see behind the closed blinds that the windows were\r\nlighted up on the first floor. The hall door was left partly open, and a\r\nlamp was burning in the vestibule. The non-commissioned officer thought\r\nto himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis looks all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went in and, as no one appeared, he called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo there, hallo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little maid appeared and looked astonished at seeing a soldier. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, my child. Are the ladies upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the parlor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I go up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe door opposite the stairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ascended the stairs, opened a door and saw sitting in a room well\r\nlighted up by two lamps, a chandelier, and two candelabras with candles\r\nin them, four ladies in evening dress, apparently expecting some one.\r\n\r\nThree of them, the younger ones, remained seated, with rather a formal\r\nair, on some crimson velvet chairs; while the fourth, who was about\r\nforty-five, was arranging some flowers in a vase. She was very stout,\r\nand wore a green silk dress with low neck and short sleeves, allowing\r\nher red neck, covered with powder, to escape as a huge flower might from\r\nits corolla.\r\n\r\nThe officer saluted them, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe older woman turned round, appeared surprised, but bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down. But seeing that they did not welcome him eagerly, he\r\nthought that possibly only commissioned officers were admitted to the\r\nhouse, and this made him uneasy. But he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah, if one comes in, we can soon tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe large lady, no doubt the mistress of the house, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could think of nothing else to say, and they were all silent. But at\r\nlast, being ashamed of his bashfulness, and with an awkward laugh, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not people have any amusement in this country? I will pay for a\r\nbottle of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not finished his sentence when the door opened, and in walked\r\nPadoie dressed in a black suit.\r\n\r\nVarajou gave a shout of joy, and rising from his seat, he rushed at his\r\nbrother-in-law, put his arms round him and waltzed him round the room,\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is Padoie! Here is Padoie! Here is Padoie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen letting go of the tax collector he exclaimed as he looked him in\r\nthe face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh, you scamp, you scamp! You are out for a good time, too. Oh,\r\nyou scamp! And my sister! Are you tired of her, say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he thought of all that he might gain through this unexpected\r\nsituation, the forced loan, the inevitable blackmail, he flung himself\r\non the lounge and laughed so heartily that the piece of furniture\r\ncreaked all over.\r\n\r\nThe three young ladies, rising simultaneously, made their escape, while\r\nthe older woman retreated to the door looking as though she were about\r\nto faint.\r\n\r\nAnd then two gentlemen appeared in evening dress, and wearing the ribbon\r\nof an order. Padoie rushed up to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, judge\xe2\x80\x94he is crazy, he is crazy. He was sent to us as a\r\nconvalescent. You can see that he is crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVarajou was sitting up now, and not being able to understand it all, he\r\nguessed that he had committed some monstrous folly. Then he rose, and\r\nturning to his brother-in-law, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat house is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Padoie, becoming suddenly furious, stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat house\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94what house is this? Wretch\xe2\x80\x94scoundrel\xe2\x80\x94villain\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nhouse, indeed? The house of the judge\xe2\x80\x94of the judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt\xe2\x80\x94of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x94of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x94Oh, oh\xe2\x80\x94rascal!\r\n\xe2\x80\x94rascal!\xe2\x80\x94rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMOND NECKLACE\r\n\r\nThe girl was one of those pretty and charming young creatures who\r\nsometimes are born, as if by a slip of fate, into a family of clerks.\r\nShe had no dowry, no expectations, no way of being known, understood,\r\nloved, married by any rich and distinguished man; so she let herself be\r\nmarried to a little clerk of the Ministry of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\nShe dressed plainly because she could not dress well, but she was\r\nunhappy as if she had really fallen from a higher station; since with\r\nwomen there is neither caste nor rank, for beauty, grace and charm take\r\nthe place of family and birth. Natural ingenuity, instinct for what is\r\nelegant, a supple mind are their sole hierarchy, and often make of women\r\nof the people the equals of the very greatest ladies.\r\n\r\nMathilde suffered ceaselessly, feeling herself born to enjoy all\r\ndelicacies and all luxuries. She was distressed at the poverty of her\r\ndwelling, at the bareness of the walls, at the shabby chairs, the\r\nugliness of the curtains. All those things, of which another woman of\r\nher rank would never even have been conscious, tortured her and made her\r\nangry. The sight of the little Breton peasant who did her humble\r\nhousework aroused in her despairing regrets and bewildering dreams. She\r\nthought of silent antechambers hung with Oriental tapestry, illumined by\r\ntall bronze candelabra, and of two great footmen in knee breeches who\r\nsleep in the big armchairs, made drowsy by the oppressive heat of the\r\nstove. She thought of long reception halls hung with ancient silk, of\r\nthe dainty cabinets containing priceless curiosities and of the little\r\ncoquettish perfumed reception rooms made for chatting at five o'clock\r\nwith intimate friends, with men famous and sought after, whom all women\r\nenvy and whose attention they all desire.\r\n\r\nWhen she sat down to dinner, before the round table covered with a\r\ntablecloth in use three days, opposite her husband, who uncovered the\r\nsoup tureen and declared with a delighted air, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, the good soup! I\r\ndon't know anything better than that,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought of dainty dinners, of\r\nshining silverware, of tapestry that peopled the walls with ancient\r\npersonages and with strange birds flying in the midst of a fairy forest;\r\nand she thought of delicious dishes served on marvellous plates and of\r\nthe whispered gallantries to which you listen with a sphinxlike smile\r\nwhile you are eating the pink meat of a trout or the wings of a quail.\r\n\r\nShe had no gowns, no jewels, nothing. And she loved nothing but that.\r\nShe felt made for that. She would have liked so much to please, to be\r\nenvied, to be charming, to be sought after.\r\n\r\nShe had a friend, a former schoolmate at the convent, who was rich, and\r\nwhom she did not like to go to see any more because she felt so sad when\r\nshe came home.\r\n\r\nBut one evening her husband reached home with a triumphant air and\r\nholding a large envelope in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tore the paper quickly and drew out a printed card which bore these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Public Instruction and Madame Georges Ramponneau request\r\nthe honor of M. and Madame Loisel's company at the palace of the\r\nMinistry on Monday evening, January 18th.\r\n\r\nInstead of being delighted, as her husband had hoped, she threw the\r\ninvitation on the table crossly, muttering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wish me to do with that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear, I thought you would be glad. You never go out, and this\r\nis such a fine opportunity. I had great trouble to get it. Every one\r\nwants to go; it is very select, and they are not giving many invitations\r\nto clerks. The whole official world will be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with an irritated glance and said impatiently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you wish me to put on my back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not thought of that. He stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the gown you go to the theatre in. It looks very well to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, distracted, seeing that his wife was weeping. Two great\r\ntears ran slowly from the corners of her eyes toward the corners of her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter? What's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nBy a violent effort she conquered her grief and replied in a calm voice,\r\nwhile she wiped her wet cheeks:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Only I have no gown, and, therefore, I can't go to this ball.\r\nGive your card to some colleague whose wife is better equipped than I\r\nam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was in despair. He resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let us see, Mathilde. How much would it cost, a suitable gown,\r\nwhich you could use on other occasions\xe2\x80\x94something very simple?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reflected several seconds, making her calculations and wondering\r\nalso what sum she could ask without drawing on herself an immediate\r\nrefusal and a frightened exclamation from the economical clerk.\r\n\r\nFinally she replied hesitating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know exactly, but I think I could manage it with four hundred\r\nfrancs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grew a little pale, because he was laying aside just that amount to\r\nbuy a gun and treat himself to a little shooting next summer on the\r\nplain of Nanterre, with several friends who went to shoot larks there of\r\na Sunday.\r\n\r\nBut he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I will give you four hundred francs. And try to have a\r\npretty gown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day of the ball drew near and Madame Loisel seemed sad, uneasy,\r\nanxious. Her frock was ready, however. Her husband said to her one\r\nevening:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? Come, you have seemed very queer these last three\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt annoys me not to have a single piece of jewelry, not a single\r\nornament, nothing to put on. I shall look poverty-stricken. I would\r\nalmost rather not go at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might wear natural flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cThey're very\r\nstylish at this time of year. For ten francs you can get two or three\r\nmagnificent roses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was not convinced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; there's nothing more humiliating than to look poor among other\r\nwomen who are rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid you are!\xe2\x80\x9d her husband cried. \xe2\x80\x9cGo look up your friend, Madame\r\nForestier, and ask her to lend you some jewels. You're intimate enough\r\nwith her to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uttered a cry of joy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue! I never thought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day she went to her friend and told her of her distress.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier went to a wardrobe with a mirror, took out a large\r\njewel box, brought it back, opened it and said to Madame Loisel:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChoose, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw first some bracelets, then a pearl necklace, then a Venetian\r\ngold cross set with precious stones, of admirable workmanship. She tried\r\non the ornaments before the mirror, hesitated and could not make up her\r\nmind to part with them, to give them back. She kept asking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven't you any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes. Look further; I don't know what you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she discovered, in a black satin box, a superb diamond\r\nnecklace, and her heart throbbed with an immoderate desire. Her hands\r\ntrembled as she took it. She fastened it round her throat, outside her\r\nhigh-necked waist, and was lost in ecstasy at her reflection in the\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\nThen she asked, hesitating, filled with anxious doubt:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you lend me this, only this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms round her friend's neck, kissed her passionately,\r\nthen fled with her treasure.\r\n\r\nThe night of the ball arrived. Madame Loisel was a great success. She\r\nwas prettier than any other woman present, elegant, graceful, smiling\r\nand wild with joy. All the men looked at her, asked her name, sought to\r\nbe introduced. All the attaches of the Cabinet wished to waltz with her.\r\nShe was remarked by the minister himself.\r\n\r\nShe danced with rapture, with passion, intoxicated by pleasure,\r\nforgetting all in the triumph of her beauty, in the glory of her\r\nsuccess, in a sort of cloud of happiness comprised of all this homage,\r\nadmiration, these awakened desires and of that sense of triumph which is\r\nso sweet to woman's heart.\r\n\r\nShe left the ball about four o'clock in the morning. Her husband had\r\nbeen sleeping since midnight in a little deserted anteroom with three\r\nother gentlemen whose wives were enjoying the ball.\r\n\r\nHe threw over her shoulders the wraps he had brought, the modest wraps\r\nof common life, the poverty of which contrasted with the elegance of the\r\nball dress. She felt this and wished to escape so as not to be remarked\r\nby the other women, who were enveloping themselves in costly furs.\r\n\r\nLoisel held her back, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit. You will catch cold outside.\r\nI will call a cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she did not listen to him and rapidly descended the stairs. When\r\nthey reached the street they could not find a carriage and began to look\r\nfor one, shouting after the cabmen passing at a distance.\r\n\r\nThey went toward the Seine in despair, shivering with cold. At last they\r\nfound on the quay one of those ancient night cabs which, as though they\r\nwere ashamed to show their shabbiness during the day, are never seen\r\nround Paris until after dark.\r\n\r\nIt took them to their dwelling in the Rue des Martyrs, and sadly they\r\nmounted the stairs to their flat. All was ended for her. As to him, he\r\nreflected that he must be at the ministry at ten o'clock that morning.\r\n\r\nShe removed her wraps before the glass so as to see herself once more in\r\nall her glory. But suddenly she uttered a cry. She no longer had the\r\nnecklace around her neck!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded her husband, already half\r\nundressed.\r\n\r\nShe turned distractedly toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have\xe2\x80\x94I have\xe2\x80\x94I've lost Madame Forestier's necklace,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, bewildered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x94how? Impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked among the folds of her skirt, of her cloak, in her pockets,\r\neverywhere, but did not find it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're sure you had it on when you left the ball?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I felt it in the vestibule of the minister's house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you had lost it in the street we should have heard it fall. It\r\nmust be in the cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, probably. Did you take his number?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. And you\xe2\x80\x94didn't you notice it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked, thunderstruck, at each other. At last Loisel put on his\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go back on foot,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cover the whole route, to see\r\nwhether I can find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out. She sat waiting on a chair in her ball dress, without\r\nstrength to go to bed, overwhelmed, without any fire, without a thought.\r\n\r\nHer husband returned about seven o'clock. He had found nothing.\r\n\r\nHe went to police headquarters, to the newspaper offices to offer a\r\nreward; he went to the cab companies\xe2\x80\x94everywhere, in fact, whither he was\r\nurged by the least spark of hope.\r\n\r\nShe waited all day, in the same condition of mad fear before this\r\nterrible calamity.\r\n\r\nLoisel returned at night with a hollow, pale face. He had discovered\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must write to your friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have broken the\r\nclasp of her necklace and that you are having it mended. That will give\r\nus time to turn round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wrote at his dictation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week they had lost all hope. Loisel, who had aged five\r\nyears, declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must consider how to replace that ornament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day they took the box that had contained it and went to the\r\njeweler whose name was found within. He consulted his books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not I, madame, who sold that necklace; I must simply have\r\nfurnished the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they went from jeweler to jeweler, searching for a necklace like\r\nthe other, trying to recall it, both sick with chagrin and grief.\r\n\r\nThey found, in a shop at the Palais Royal, a string of diamonds that\r\nseemed to them exactly like the one they had lost. It was worth forty\r\nthousand francs. They could have it for thirty-six.\r\n\r\nSo they begged the jeweler not to sell it for three days yet. And they\r\nmade a bargain that he should buy it back for thirty-four thousand\r\nfrancs, in case they should find the lost necklace before the end of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nLoisel possessed eighteen thousand francs which his father had left him.\r\nHe would borrow the rest.\r\n\r\nHe did borrow, asking a thousand francs of one, five hundred of another,\r\nfive louis here, three louis there. He gave notes, took up ruinous\r\nobligations, dealt with usurers and all the race of lenders. He\r\ncompromised all the rest of his life, risked signing a note without even\r\nknowing whether he could meet it; and, frightened by the trouble yet to\r\ncome, by the black misery that was about to fall upon him, by the\r\nprospect of all the physical privations and moral tortures that he was\r\nto suffer, he went to get the new necklace, laying upon the jeweler's\r\ncounter thirty-six thousand francs.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Loisel took back the necklace Madame Forestier said to her\r\nwith a chilly manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have returned it sooner; I might have needed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not open the case, as her friend had so much feared. If she had\r\ndetected the substitution, what would she have thought, what would she\r\nhave said? Would she not have taken Madame Loisel for a thief?\r\n\r\nThereafter Madame Loisel knew the horrible existence of the needy. She\r\nbore her part, however, with sudden heroism. That dreadful debt must be\r\npaid. She would pay it. They dismissed their servant; they changed their\r\nlodgings; they rented a garret under the roof.\r\n\r\nShe came to know what heavy housework meant and the odious cares of the\r\nkitchen. She washed the dishes, using her dainty fingers and rosy nails\r\non greasy pots and pans. She washed the soiled linen, the shirts and the\r\ndishcloths, which she dried upon a line; she carried the slops down to\r\nthe street every morning and carried up the water, stopping for breath\r\nat every landing. And dressed like a woman of the people, she went to\r\nthe fruiterer, the grocer, the butcher, a basket on her arm, bargaining,\r\nmeeting with impertinence, defending her miserable money, sou by sou.\r\n\r\nEvery month they had to meet some notes, renew others, obtain more time.\r\n\r\nHer husband worked evenings, making up a tradesman's accounts, and late\r\nat night he often copied manuscript for five sous a page.\r\n\r\nThis life lasted ten years.\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten years they had paid everything, everything, with the\r\nrates of usury and the accumulations of the compound interest.\r\n\r\nMadame Loisel looked old now. She had become the woman of impoverished\r\nhouseholds\xe2\x80\x94strong and hard and rough. With frowsy hair, skirts askew and\r\nred hands, she talked loud while washing the floor with great swishes of\r\nwater. But sometimes, when her husband was at the office, she sat down\r\nnear the window and she thought of that gay evening of long ago, of that\r\nball where she had been so beautiful and so admired.\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened if she had not lost that necklace? Who knows?\r\nwho knows? How strange and changeful is life! How small a thing is\r\nneeded to make or ruin us!\r\n\r\nBut one Sunday, having gone to take a walk in the Champs Elysees to\r\nrefresh herself after the labors of the week, she suddenly perceived a\r\nwoman who was leading a child. It was Madame Forestier, still young,\r\nstill beautiful, still charming.\r\n\r\nMadame Loisel felt moved. Should she speak to her? Yes, certainly. And\r\nnow that she had paid, she would tell her all about it. Why not?\r\n\r\nShe went up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, Jeanne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, astonished to be familiarly addressed by this plain good-\r\nwife, did not recognize her at all and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94madame!\xe2\x80\x94I do not know\xe2\x80\x94You must have mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I am Mathilde Loisel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my poor Mathilde! How you are changed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have had a pretty hard life, since I last saw you, and great\r\npoverty\xe2\x80\x94and that because of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf me! How so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that diamond necklace you lent me to wear at the\r\nministerial ball?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I lost it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? You brought it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI brought you back another exactly like it. And it has taken us ten\r\nyears to pay for it. You can understand that it was not easy for us, for\r\nus who had nothing. At last it is ended, and I am very glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier had stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that you bought a necklace of diamonds to replace mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You never noticed it, then! They were very similar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she smiled with a joy that was at once proud and ingenuous.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier, deeply moved, took her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my poor Mathilde! Why, my necklace was paste! It was worth at most\r\nonly five hundred francs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS DE FUMEROL\r\n\r\nRoger de Tourneville was whiffing a cigar and blowing out small clouds\r\nof smoke every now and then, as he sat astride a chair amid a party of\r\nfriends. He was talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were at dinner when a letter was brought in which my father opened.\r\nYou know my father, who thinks that he is king of France ad interim. I\r\ncall him Don Quixote, because for twelve years he has been running a\r\ntilt against the windmill of the Republic, without quite knowing whether\r\nit was in the cause of the Bourbons or the Orleanists. At present he is\r\nbearing the lance in the cause of the Orleanists alone, because there is\r\nno one else left. In any case, he thinks himself the first gentleman of\r\nFrance, the best known, the most influential, the head of the party; and\r\nas he is an irremovable senator, he thinks that the thrones of the\r\nneighboring kings are very insecure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for my mother, she is my father's soul, she is the soul of the\r\nkingdom and of religion, and the scourge of all evil-thinkers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a letter was brought in while we were at dinner, and my father\r\nopened and read it, and then he said to mother: 'Your brother is dying.'\r\nShe grew very pale. My uncle was scarcely ever mentioned in the house,\r\nand I did not know him at all; all I knew from public talk was, that he\r\nhad led, and was still leading, a gay life. After having spent his\r\nfortune in fast living, he was now in small apartments in the Rue des\r\nMartyrs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn ancient peer of France and former colonel of cavalry, it was said\r\nthat he believed in neither God nor devil. Not believing, therefore, in\r\na future life he had abused the present life in every way, and had\r\nbecome a live wound in my mother's heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Give me that letter, Paul,' she said, and when she read it, I asked\r\nfor it in my turn. Here it is:\r\n\r\n'Monsieur le Comte, I think I ought to let you know that your brother-\r\nin-law, the Comte Fumerol, is going to die. Perhaps you would like to\r\nmake some arrangements, and do not forget I told you. Your servant,\r\n'MELANIE.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'We must take counsel,' papa murmured. 'In my position, I ought to\r\nwatch over your brother's last moments.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma continued: 'I will send for Abbe Poivron and ask his advice, and\r\nthen I will go to my brother with the abbe and Roger. Remain here, Paul,\r\nfor you must not compromise yourself; but a woman can, and ought to do\r\nthese things. For a politician in your position, it is another matter.\r\nIt would be a fine thing for one of your opponents to be able to bring\r\none of your most laudable actions up against you.' 'You are right,' my\r\nfather said. 'Do as you think best, my dear wife.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA quarter of an hour, later, the Abbe Poivron came into the drawing-\r\nroom, and the situation was explained to him, analyzed and discussed in\r\nall its bearings. If the Marquis de Fumerol, one of the greatest names\r\nin France, were to die without the ministrations of religion, it would\r\nassuredly be a terrible blow to the nobility in general, and to the\r\nCount de Tourneville in particular, and the freethinkers would be\r\ntriumphant. The liberal newspapers would sing songs of victory for six\r\nmonths; my mother's name would be dragged through the mire and brought\r\ninto the prose of Socialistic journals, and my father's name would be\r\nsmirched. It was impossible that such a thing should be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA crusade was therefore immediately decided upon, which was to be led\r\nby the Abbe Poivron, a little, fat, clean, priest with a faint perfume\r\nabout him, a true vicar of a large church in a noble and rich quarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe landau was ordered and we all three set out, my mother, the cure\r\nand I, to administer the last sacraments to my uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had been decided first of all we should see Madame Melanie who had\r\nwritten the letter, and who was most likely the porter's wife, or my\r\nuncle's servant, and I dismounted, as an advance guard, in front of a\r\nseven-story house and went into a dark passage, where I had great\r\ndifficulty in finding the porter's den. He looked at me distrustfully,\r\nand I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Madame Melanie, if you please.' 'Don't know her!' 'But I have received\r\na letter from her.' 'That may be, but I don't know her. Are you asking\r\nfor a lodger?' 'No, a servant probably. She wrote me about a place.' 'A\r\nservant?\xe2\x80\x94a servant? Perhaps it is the marquis'. Go and see, the fifth\r\nstory on the left.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as he found I was not asking for a doubtful character he became\r\nmore friendly and came as far as the corridor with me. He was a tall,\r\nthin man with white whiskers, the manners of a beadle and majestic\r\ngestures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI climbed up a long spiral staircase, the railing of which I did not\r\nventure to touch, and I gave three discreet knocks at the left-hand door\r\non the fifth story. It opened immediately, and an enormous dirty woman\r\nappeared before me. She barred the entrance with her extended arms which\r\nshe placed against the two doorposts, and growled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What do you want?' 'Are you Madame Melanie?' 'Yes.' 'I am the Visconte\r\nde Tourneville.' 'Ah! All right! Come in.' 'Well, the fact is, my mother\r\nis downstairs with a priest.' 'Oh! All right; go and bring them up; but\r\nbe careful of the porter.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went downstairs and came up again with my mother, who was followed by\r\nthe abbe, and I fancied that I heard other footsteps behind us. As soon\r\nas we were in the kitchen, Melanie offered us chairs, and we all four\r\nsat down to deliberate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Is he very ill?' my mother asked. 'Oh! yes, madame; he will not be\r\nhere long.' 'Does he seem disposed to receive a visit from a priest?'\r\n'Oh! I do not think so.' 'Can I see him?' 'Well\xe2\x80\x94yes madame\xe2\x80\x94only\r\n\xe2\x80\x94only\xe2\x80\x94those young ladies are with him.' 'What young ladies?'\r\n'Why\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94his lady friends, of course.' 'Oh!' Mamma had grown scarlet,\r\nand the Abbe Poivron had lowered his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe affair began to amuse me, and I said: 'Suppose I go in first? I\r\nshall see how he receives me, and perhaps I shall be able to prepare him\r\nto receive you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother, who did not suspect any trick, replied: 'Yes, go, my dear.'\r\nBut a woman's voice cried out: 'Melanie!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servant ran out and said: 'What do you want, Mademoiselle Claire?'\r\n'The omelette; quickly.' 'In a minute, mademoiselle.' And coming back to\r\nus, she explained this summons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had ordered a cheese omelette at two o'clock as a slight\r\ncollation. And she at once began to break the eggs into a salad bowl,\r\nand to whip them vigorously, while I went out on the landing and pulled\r\nthe bell, so as to formally announce my arrival. Melanie opened the door\r\nto me, and made me sit down in an ante-room, while she went to tell my\r\nuncle that I had come; then she came back and asked me to go in, while\r\nthe abbe hid behind the door, so that he might appear at the first\r\nsignal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was certainly very much surprised at the sight of my uncle, for he\r\nwas very handsome, very solemn and very elegant, the old rake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSitting, almost lying, in a large armchair, his legs wrapped in\r\nblankets, his hands, his long, white hands, over the arms of the chair,\r\nhe was waiting for death with the dignity of a patriarch. His white\r\nbeard fell on his chest, and his hair, which was also white, mingled\r\nwith it on his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStanding behind his armchair, as if to defend him against me, were two\r\nyoung women, who looked at me with bold eyes. In their petticoats and\r\nmorning wrappers, with bare arms, with coal black hair twisted in a knot\r\non the nape of their neck, with embroidered, Oriental slippers, which\r\nshowed their ankles and silk stockings, they looked like the figures in\r\nsome symbolical painting, by the side of the dying man. Between the\r\neasy-chair and the bed, there was a table covered with a white cloth, on\r\nwhich two plates, two glasses, two forks and two knives, were waiting\r\nfor the cheese omelette which had been ordered some time before of\r\nMelanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle said in a weak, almost breathless, but clear voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Good-morning, my child; it is rather late in the day to come and see\r\nme; our acquaintanceship will not last long.' I stammered out, 'It was\r\nnot my fault, uncle:' 'No; I know that,' he replied. 'It is your father\r\nand mother's fault more than yours. How are they?' 'Pretty well, thank\r\nyou. When they heard that you were ill, they sent me to ask after you.'\r\n'Ah! Why did they not come themselves?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked up at the two girls and said gently: 'It is not their fault if\r\nthey could not come, uncle. But it would be difficult for my father, and\r\nimpossible for my mother to come in here.' The old man did not reply,\r\nbut raised his hand toward mine, and I took the pale, cold hand and held\r\nit in my own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe door opened, Melanie came in with the omelette and put it on the\r\ntable, and the two girls immediately sat down at the table, and began to\r\neat without taking their eyes off me. Then I said: 'Uncle, it would give\r\ngreat pleasure to my mother to embrace you.' 'I also,' he murmured,\r\n'should like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94' He said no more, and I could think of nothing to propose\r\nto him, and there was silence except for the noise of the plates and\r\nthat vague sound of eating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the abbe, who was listening behind the door, seeing our\r\nembarrassment, and thinking we had won the game, thought the time had\r\ncome to interpose, and showed himself. My uncle was so stupefied at\r\nsight of him that at first he remained motionless; and then he opened\r\nhis mouth as if he meant to swallow up the priest, and shouted to him in\r\na strong, deep, furious voice: 'What are you doing here?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe abbe, who was used to difficult situations, came forward into the\r\nroom, murmuring: 'I have come in your sister's name, Monsieur le\r\nMarquis; she has sent me. She would be happy, monsieur\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the marquis was not listening. Raising one hand, he pointed to the\r\ndoor with a proud, tragic gesture, and said angrily and breathing hard:\r\n'Leave this room\xe2\x80\x94go out\xe2\x80\x94robber of souls. Go out from here, you violator\r\nof consciences. Go out from here, you pick-lock of dying men's doors!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe abbe retreated, and I also went to the door, beating a retreat with\r\nthe priest; the two young women, who had the best of it, got up, leaving\r\ntheir omelette only half eaten, and went and stood on either side of my\r\nuncle's easy-chair, putting their hands on his arms to calm him, and to\r\nprotect him against the criminal enterprises of the Family, and of\r\nReligion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe abbe and I rejoined my mother in the kitchen, and Melanie again\r\noffered us chairs. 'I knew quite well that this method would not work;\r\nwe must try some other means, otherwise he will escape us.' And they\r\nbegan deliberating afresh, my mother being of one opinion and the abbe\r\nof another, while I held a third.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had been discussing the matter in a low voice for half an hour,\r\nperhaps, when a great noise of furniture being moved and of cries\r\nuttered by my uncle, more vehement and terrible even than the former had\r\nbeen, made us all four jump up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the doors and walls we could hear him shouting: 'Go out\xe2\x80\x94out\r\n\xe2\x80\x94rascals\xe2\x80\x94humbugs, get out, scoundrels\xe2\x80\x94get out\xe2\x80\x94get out!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelanie rushed in, but came back immediately to call me to help her,\r\nand I hastened in. Opposite to my uncle, who was terribly excited by\r\nanger, almost standing up and vociferating, stood two men, one behind\r\nthe other, who seemed to be waiting till he should be dead with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy his ridiculous long coat, his long English shoes, his manners of a\r\ntutor out of a position, his high collar, white necktie and straight\r\nhair, his humble face of a false priest of a bastard religion, I\r\nimmediately recognized the first as a Protestant minister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second was the porter of the house, who belonged to the reformed\r\nreligion and had followed us, and having seen our defeat, had gone to\r\nfetch his own pastor, in hopes that he might meet a better reception. My\r\nuncle seemed mad with rage! If the sight of the Catholic priest, of the\r\npriest of his ancestors, had irritated the Marquis de Fumerol, who had\r\nbecome a freethinker, the sight of his porter's minister made him\r\naltogether beside himself. I therefore took the two men by the arm and\r\nthrew them out of the room so roughly that they bumped against each\r\nother twice, between the two doors which led to the staircase; and then\r\nI disappeared in my turn and returned to the kitchen, which was our\r\nheadquarters in order to take counsel with my mother and the abbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Melanie came back in terror, sobbing out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He is dying\xe2\x80\x94he is dying\xe2\x80\x94come immediately\xe2\x80\x94he is dying.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother rushed out. My uncle had fallen to the ground, and lay full\r\nlength along the floor, without moving. I fancy he was already dead. My\r\nmother was superb at that moment! She went straight up to the two girls\r\nwho were kneeling by the body and trying to raise it up, and pointing to\r\nthe door with irresistible authority, dignity and majesty, she said:\r\n'Now it is time for you to leave the room.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they went out without a word of protest. I must add, that I was\r\ngetting ready to turn them out as unceremoniously as I had done the\r\nparson and the porter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the Abbe Poivron administered the last sacraments to my uncle with\r\nall the customary prayers, and remitted all his sins, while my mother\r\nsobbed as she knelt near her brother. Suddenly, however, she exclaimed:\r\n'He recognized me; he pressed my hand; I am sure he recognized me!!!\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat he thanked me! Oh, God, what happiness!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor mamma! If she had known or guessed for whom those thanks were\r\nintended!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey laid my uncle on his bed; he was certainly dead this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Madame,' Melanie said, 'we have no sheets to bury him in; all the\r\nlinen belongs to these two young ladies,' and when I looked at the\r\nomelette which they had not finished, I felt inclined to laugh and to\r\ncry at the same time. There are some humorous moments and some humorous\r\nsituations in life, occasionally!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe gave my uncle a magnificent funeral, with five speeches at the\r\ngrave. Baron de Croiselles, the senator, showed in admirable terms that\r\nGod always returns victorious into well-born souls which have\r\ntemporarily been led into error. All the members of the Royalist and\r\nCatholic party followed the funeral procession with the enthusiasm of\r\nvictors, as they spoke of that beautiful death after a somewhat\r\ntroublous life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nViscount Roger ceased speaking; his audience was laughing. Then somebody\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cBah! That is the story of all conversions in extremis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIP OF LE HORLA\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 8th I received the following telegram: \xe2\x80\x9cFine day.\r\nAlways my predictions. Belgian frontier. Baggage and servants left at\r\nnoon at the social session. Beginning of manoeuvres at three. So I will\r\nwait for you at the works from five o'clock on. Jovis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock sharp I entered the gas works of La Villette. It might\r\nhave been mistaken for the colossal ruins of an old town inhabited by\r\nCyclops. There were immense dark avenues separating heavy gasometers\r\nstanding one behind another, like monstrous columns, unequally high and,\r\nundoubtedly, in the past the supports of some tremendous, some fearful\r\niron edifice.\r\n\r\nThe balloon was lying in the courtyard and had the appearance of a cake\r\nmade of yellow cloth, flattened on the ground under a rope. That is\r\ncalled placing a balloon in a sweep-net, and, in fact, it appeared like\r\nan enormous fish.\r\n\r\nTwo or three hundred people were looking at it, sitting or standing, and\r\nsome were examining the basket, a nice little square basket for a human\r\ncargo, bearing on its side in gold letters on a mahogany plate the\r\nwords: Le Horla.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the people began to stand back, for the gas was beginning to\r\nenter into the balloon through a long tube of yellow cloth, which lay on\r\nthe soil, swelling and undulating like an enormous worm. But another\r\nthought, another picture occurs to every mind. It is thus that nature\r\nitself nourishes beings until their birth. The creature that will rise\r\nsoon begins to move, and the attendants of Captain Jovis, as Le Horla\r\ngrew larger, spread and put in place the net which covers it, so that\r\nthe pressure will be regular and equally distributed at every point.\r\n\r\nThe operation is very delicate and very important, for the resistance of\r\nthe cotton cloth of which the balloon is made is figured not in\r\nproportion to the contact surface of this cloth with the net, but in\r\nproportion to the links of the basket.\r\n\r\nLe Horla, moreover, has been designed by M. Mallet, constructed under\r\nhis own eyes and made by himself. Everything had been made in the shops\r\nof M. Jovis by his own working staff and nothing was made outside.\r\n\r\nWe must add that everything was new in this balloon, from the varnish to\r\nthe valve, those two essential parts of a balloon. Both must render the\r\ncloth gas-proof, as the sides of a ship are waterproof. The old\r\nvarnishes, made with a base of linseed oil, sometimes fermented and thus\r\nburned the cloth, which in a short time would tear like a piece of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe valves were apt to close imperfectly after being opened and when the\r\ncovering called \xe2\x80\x9ccataplasme\xe2\x80\x9d was injured. The fall of M. L'Hoste in the\r\nopen sea during the night proved the imperfection of the old system.\r\n\r\nThe two discoveries of Captain Jovis, the varnish principally, are of\r\ninestimable value in the art of ballooning.\r\n\r\nThe crowd has begun to talk, and some men, who appear to be specialists,\r\naffirm with authority that we shall come down before reaching the\r\nfortifications. Several other things have been criticized in this novel\r\ntype of balloon with which we are about to experiment with so much\r\npleasure and success.\r\n\r\nIt is growing slowly but surely. Some small holes and scratches made in\r\ntransit have been discovered, and we cover them and plug them with a\r\nlittle piece of paper applied on the cloth while wet. This method of\r\nrepairing alarms and mystifies the public.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Jovis and his assistants are busy with the last details,\r\nthe travellers go to dine in the canteen of the gas-works, according to\r\nthe established custom.\r\n\r\nWhen we come out again the balloon is swaying, enormous and transparent,\r\na prodigious golden fruit, a fantastic pear which is still ripening,\r\ncovered by the last rays of the setting sun. Now the basket is attached,\r\nthe barometers are brought, the siren, which we will blow to our hearts'\r\ncontent, is also brought, also the two trumpets, the eatables, the\r\novercoats and raincoats, all the small articles that can go with the men\r\nin that flying basket.\r\n\r\nAs the wind pushes the balloon against the gasometers, it is necessary\r\nto steady it now and then, to avoid an accident at the start.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jovis is now ready and calls all the passengers.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Mallet jumps aboard, climbing first on the aerial net between\r\nthe basket and the balloon, from which he will watch during the night\r\nthe movements of Le Horla across the skies, as the officer on watch,\r\nstanding on starboard, watches the course of a ship.\r\n\r\nM. Etierine Beer gets in after him, then comes M. Paul Bessand, then M.\r\nPatrice Eyries and I get in last.\r\n\r\nBut the basket is too heavy for the balloon, considering the long trip\r\nto be taken, and M. Eyries has to get out, not without great regret.\r\n\r\nM. Joliet, standing erect on the edge of the basket, begs the ladies, in\r\nvery gallant terms, to stand aside a little, for he is afraid he might\r\nthrow sand on their hats in rising. Then he commands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it loose,\xe2\x80\x9d and, cutting with one stroke of his knife the ropes that\r\nhold the balloon to the ground, he gives Le Horla its liberty.\r\n\r\nIn one second we fly skyward. Nothing can be heard; we float, we rise,\r\nwe fly, we glide. Our friends shout with glee and applaud, but we hardly\r\nhear them, we hardly see them. We are already so far, so high! What? Are\r\nwe really leaving these people down there? Is it possible? Paris spreads\r\nout beneath us, a dark bluish patch, cut by its streets, from which\r\nrise, here and there, domes, towers, steeples, then around it the plain,\r\nthe country, traversed by long roads, thin and white, amidst green\r\nfields of a tender or dark green, and woods almost black.\r\n\r\nThe Seine appears like a coiled snake, asleep, of which we see neither\r\nhead nor tail; it crosses Paris, and the entire field resembles an\r\nimmense basin of prairies and forests dotted here and there by\r\nmountains, hardly visible in the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe sun, which we could no longer see down below, now reappears as\r\nthough it were about to rise again, and our balloon seems to be lighted;\r\nit must appear like a star to the people who are looking up. M. Mallet\r\nevery few seconds throws a cigarette paper intospace and says quietly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are rising, always rising,\xe2\x80\x9d while Captain Jovis, radiant with joy,\r\nrubs his hands together and repeats: \xe2\x80\x9cEh? this varnish? Isn't it good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, we can see whether we are rising or sinking only by throwing a\r\ncigarette paper out of the basket now and then. If this paper appears to\r\nfall down like a stone, it means that the balloon is rising; if it\r\nappears to shoot skyward the balloon is descending.\r\n\r\nThe two barometers mark about five hundred meters, and we gaze with\r\nenthusiastic admiration at the earth we are leaving and to which we are\r\nnot attached in any way; it looks like a colored map, an immense plan of\r\nthe country. All its noises, however, rise to our ears very distinctly,\r\neasily recognizable. We hear the sound of the wheels rolling in the\r\nstreets, the snap of a whip, the cries of drivers, the rolling and\r\nwhistling of trains and the laughter of small boys running after one\r\nanother. Every time we pass over a village the noise of children's\r\nvoices is heard above the rest and with the greatest distinctness. Some\r\nmen are calling us; the locomotives whistle; we answer with the siren,\r\nwhich emits plaintive, fearfully shrill wails like the voice of a weird\r\nbeing wandering through the world.\r\n\r\nWe perceive lights here and there, some isolated fire in the farms, and\r\nlines of gas in the towns. We are going toward the northwest, after\r\nroaming for some time over the little lake of Enghien. Now we see a\r\nriver; it is the Oise, and we begin to argue about the exact spot we are\r\npassing. Is that town Creil or Pontoise\xe2\x80\x94the one with so many lights? But\r\nif we were over Pontoise we could see the junction of the Seine and the\r\nOise; and that enormous fire to the left, isn't it the blast furnaces of\r\nMontataire? So then we are above Creil. The view is superb; it is dark\r\non the earth, but we are still in the light, and it is now past ten\r\no'clock. Now we begin to hear slight country noises, the double cry of\r\nthe quail in particular, then the mewing of cats and the barking of\r\ndogs. Surely the dogs have scented the balloon; they have seen it and\r\nhave given the alarm. We can hear them barking all over the plain and\r\nmaking the identical noise they make when baying at the moon. The cows\r\nalso seem to wake up in the barns, for we can hear them lowing; all the\r\nbeasts are scared and moved before the aerial monster that is passing.\r\n\r\nThe delicious odors of the soil rise toward us, the smell of hay, of\r\nflowers, of the moist, verdant earth, perfuming the air-a light air, in\r\nfact, so light, so sweet, so delightful that I realize I never was so\r\nfortunate as to breathe before. A profound sense of well-being, unknown\r\nto me heretofore, pervades me, a well-being of body and spirit, composed\r\nof supineness, of infinite rest, of forgetfulness, of indifference to\r\neverything and of this novel sensation of traversing space without any\r\nof the sensations that make motion unbearable, without noise, without\r\nshocks and without fear.\r\n\r\nAt times we rise and then descend. Every few minutes Lieutenant Mallet,\r\nsuspended in his cobweb of netting, says to Captain Jovis: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\ndescending; throw down half a handful.\xe2\x80\x9d And the captain, who is talking\r\nand laughing with us, with a bag of ballast between his legs, takes a\r\nhandful of sand out of the bag and throws it overboard.\r\n\r\nNothing is more amusing, more delicate, more interesting than the\r\nmanoeuvring of a balloon. It is an enormous toy, free and docile, which\r\nobeys with surprising sensitiveness, but it is also, and before all, the\r\nslave of the wind, which we cannot control. A pinch of sand, half a\r\nsheet of paper, one or two drops of water, the bones of a chicken which\r\nwe had just eaten, thrown overboard, makes it go up quickly.\r\n\r\nA breath of cool, damp air rising from the river or the wood we are\r\ntraversing makes the balloon descend two hundred metres. It does not\r\nvary when passing over fields of ripe grain, and it rises when it passes\r\nover towns.\r\n\r\nThe earth sleeps now, or, rather, men sleep on the earth, for the beasts\r\nawakened by the sight of our balloon announce our approach everywhere.\r\nNow and then the rolling of a train or the whistling of a locomotive is\r\nplainly distinguishable. We sound our siren as we pass over inhabited\r\nplaces; and the peasants, terrified in their beds, must surely tremble\r\nand ask themselves if the Angel Gabriel is not passing by.\r\n\r\nA strong and continuous odor of gas can be plainly observed. We must\r\nhave encountered a current of warm air, and the balloon expands, losing\r\nits invisible blood by the escape-valve, which is called the appendix,\r\nand which closes of itself as soon as the expansion ceases.\r\n\r\nWe are rising. The earth no longer gives back the echo of our trumpets;\r\nwe have risen almost two thousand feet. It is not light enough for us to\r\nconsult the instruments; we only know that the rice paper falls from us\r\nlike dead butterflies, that we are rising, always rising. We can no\r\nlonger see the earth; a light mist separates us from it; and above our\r\nhead twinkles a world of stars.\r\n\r\nA silvery light appears before us and makes the sky turn pale, and\r\nsuddenly, as if it were rising from unknown depths behind the horizon\r\nbelow us rises the moon on the edge of a cloud. It seems to be coming\r\nfrom below, while we are looking down upon it from a great height,\r\nleaning on the edge of our basket like an audience on a balcony. Clear\r\nand round, it emerges from the clouds and slowly rises in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe earth no longer seems to exist, it is buried in milky vapors that\r\nresemble a sea. We are now alone in space with the moon, which looks\r\nlike another balloon travelling opposite us; and our balloon, which\r\nshines in the air, appears like another, larger moon, a world wandering\r\nin the sky amid the stars, through infinity. We no longer speak, think\r\nnor live; we float along through space in delicious inertia. The air\r\nwhich is bearing us up has made of us all beings which resemble itself,\r\nsilent, joyous, irresponsible beings, intoxicated by this stupendous\r\nflight, peculiarly alert, although motionless. One is no longer\r\nconscious of one's flesh or one's bones; one's heart seems to have\r\nceased beating; we have become something indescribable, birds who do not\r\neven have to flap their wings.\r\n\r\nAll memory has disappeared from our minds, all trouble from our\r\nthoughts; we have no more regrets, plans nor hopes. We look, we feel, we\r\nwildly enjoy this fantastic journey; nothing in the sky but the moon and\r\nourselves! We are a wandering, travelling world, like our sisters, the\r\nplanets; and this little world carries five men who have left the earth\r\nand who have almost forgotten it. We can now see as plainly as in\r\ndaylight; we look at each other, surprised at this brightness, for we\r\nhave nothing to look at but ourselves and a few silvery clouds floating\r\nbelow us. The barometers mark twelve hundred metres, then thirteen,\r\nfourteen, fifteen hundred; and the little rice papers still fall about\r\nus.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jovis claims that the moon has often made balloons act thus, and\r\nthat the upward journey will continue.\r\n\r\nWe are now at two thousand metres; we go up to two thousand three\r\nhundred and fifty; then the balloon stops: We blow the siren and are\r\nsurprised that no one answers us from the stars.\r\n\r\nWe are now going down rapidly. M. Mallet keeps crying: \xe2\x80\x9cThrow out more\r\nballast! throw out more ballast!\xe2\x80\x9d And the sand and stones that we throw\r\nover come back into our faces, as if they were going up, thrown from\r\nbelow toward the stars, so rapid is our descent.\r\n\r\nHere is the earth! Where are we? It is now past midnight, and we are\r\ncrossing a broad, dry, well-cultivated country, with many roads and well\r\npopulated.\r\n\r\nTo the right is a large city and farther away to the left is another.\r\nBut suddenly from the earth appears a bright fairy light; it disappears,\r\nreappears and once more disappears. Jovis, intoxicated by space,\r\nexclaims: \xe2\x80\x9cLook, look at this phenomenon of the moon in the water. One\r\ncan see nothing more beautiful at night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing indeed can give one an idea of the wonderful brightness of these\r\nspots of light which are not fire, which do not look like reflections,\r\nwhich appear quickly here or there and immediately go out again. These\r\nshining lights appear on the winding rivers at every turn, but one\r\nhardly has time to see them as the balloon passes as quickly as the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nWe are now quite near the earth, and Beer exclaims:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that! What\r\nis that running over there in the fields? Isn't it a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed,\r\nsomething is running along the ground with great speed, and this\r\nsomething seems to jump over ditches, roads, trees with such ease that\r\nwe could not understand what it might be. The captain laughed: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nthe shadow of our balloon. It will grow as we descend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI distinctly hear a great noise of foundries in the distance. And,\r\naccording to the polar star, which we have been observing all night,\r\n'and which I have so often watched and consulted from the bridge of my\r\nlittle yacht on the Mediterranean, we are heading straight for Belgium.\r\n\r\nOur siren and our two horns are continually calling. A few cries from\r\nsome truck driver or belated reveler answer us. We bellow: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are\r\nwe?\xe2\x80\x9d But the balloon is going so rapidly that the bewildered man has not\r\neven time to answer us. The growing shadow of Le Horla, as large as a\r\nchild's ball, is fleeing before us over the fields, roads and woods. It\r\ngoes along steadily, preceding us by about a quarter of a mile; and now\r\nI am leaning out of the basket, listening to the roaring of the wind in\r\nthe trees and across the harvest fields. I say to Captain Jovis: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nthe wind blows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answers: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, those are probably waterfalls.\xe2\x80\x9d I insist, sure of my\r\near that knows the sound of the wind, from hearing it so often whistle\r\nthrough the rigging. Then Jovis nudges me; he fears to frighten his\r\nhappy, quiet passengers, for he knows full well that a storm is pursuing\r\nus.\r\n\r\nAt last a man manages to understand us; he answers: \xe2\x80\x9cNord!\xe2\x80\x9d We get the\r\nsame reply from another.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the lights of a town, which seems to be of considerable size,\r\nappear before us. Perhaps it is Lille. As we approach it, such a\r\nwonderful flow of fire appears below us that I think myself transported\r\ninto some fairyland where precious stones are manufactured for giants.\r\n\r\nIt seems that it is a brick factory. Here are others, two, three. The\r\nfusing material bubbles, sparkles, throws out blue, red, yellow, green\r\nsparks, reflections from giant diamonds, rubies, emeralds, turquoises,\r\nsapphires, topazes. And near by are great foundries roaring like\r\napocalyptic lions; high chimneys belch forth their clouds of smoke and\r\nflame, and we can hear the noise of metal striking against metal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice of some joker or of a crazy person answers: \xe2\x80\x9cIn a balloon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Lille!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were not mistaken. We are already out of sight of the town, and we\r\nsee Roubaix to the right, then some well-cultivated, rectangular fields,\r\nof different colors according to the crops, some yellow, some gray or\r\nbrown. But the clouds are gathering behind us, hiding the moon, whereas\r\ntoward the east the sky is growing lighter, becoming a clear blue tinged\r\nwith red. It is dawn. It grows rapidly, now showing us all the little\r\ndetails of the earth, the trains, the brooks, the cows, the goats. And\r\nall this passes beneath us with surprising speed. One hardly has time to\r\nnotice that other fields, other meadows, other houses have already\r\ndisappeared. Cocks are crowing, but the voice of ducks drowns\r\neverything. One might think the world to be peopled, covered with them,\r\nthey make so much noise.\r\n\r\nThe early rising peasants are waving their arms and crying to us: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nyourselves drop!\xe2\x80\x9d But we go along steadily, neither rising nor falling,\r\nleaning over the edge of the basket and watching the world fleeing under\r\nour feet.\r\n\r\nJovis sights another city far off in the distance. It approaches;\r\neverywhere are old church spires. They are delightful, seen thus from\r\nabove. Where are we? Is this Courtrai? Is it Ghent?\r\n\r\nWe are already very near it, and we see that it is surrounded by water\r\nand crossed in every direction by canals. One might think it a Venice of\r\nthe north. Just as we are passing so near to a church tower that our\r\nlong guy-rope almost touches it, the chimes begin to ring three o'clock.\r\nThe sweet, clear sounds rise to us from this frail roof which we have\r\nalmost touched in our wandering course. It is a charming greeting, a\r\nfriendly welcome from Holland. We answer with our siren, whose raucous\r\nvoice echoes throughout the streets.\r\n\r\nIt was Bruges. But we have hardly lost sight of it when my neighbor,\r\nPaul Bessand, asks me: \xe2\x80\x9cDon't you see something over there, to the\r\nright, in front of us? It looks like a river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, far ahead of us stretches a bright highway, in the light of\r\nthe dawning day. Yes, it looks like a river, an immense river full of\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet ready for the descent,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain. He makes M. Mallet leave\r\nhis net and return to the basket; then we pack the barometers and\r\neverything that could be injured by possible shocks. M. Bessand\r\nexclaims: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the masts over there to the left! We are at the sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFogs had hidden it from us until then. The sea was everywhere, to the\r\nleft and opposite us, while to our right the Scheldt, which had joined\r\nthe Moselle, extended as far as the sea, its mouths vaster than a lake.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to descend within a minute or two. The rope to the\r\nescape-valve, which had been religiously enclosed in a little white bag\r\nand placed in sight of all so that no one would touch it, is unrolled,\r\nand M. Mallet holds it in his hand while Captain Jovis looks for a\r\nfavorable landing.\r\n\r\nBehind us the thunder was rumbling and not a single bird followed our\r\nmad flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jovis.\r\n\r\nWe were passing over a canal. The basket trembled and tipped over\r\nslightly. The guy-rope touched the tall trees on both banks. But our\r\nspeed is so great that the long rope now trailing does not seem to slow\r\ndown, and we pass with frightful rapidity over a large farm, from which\r\nthe bewildered chickens, pigeons and ducks fly away, while the cows,\r\ncats and dogs run, terrified, toward the house.\r\n\r\nJust one-half bag of ballast is left. Jovis throws it overboard, and Le\r\nHorla flies lightly across the roof.\r\n\r\nThe captain once more cries: \xe2\x80\x9cThe escape-valve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Mallet reaches for the rope and hangs to it, and we drop like an\r\narrow. With a slash of a knife the cord which retains the anchor is cut,\r\nand we drag this grapple behind us, through a field of beets. Here are\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care! Hold fast! Look out for your heads!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe pass over them. Then a strong shock shakes us. The anchor has taken\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out! Take a good hold! Raise yourselves by your wrists. We are\r\ngoing to touch ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe basket does indeed strike the earth. Then it flies up again. Once\r\nmore it falls and bounds upward again, and at last it settles on the\r\nground, while the balloon struggles madly, like a wounded beast.\r\n\r\nPeasants run toward us, but they do not dare approach. They were a long\r\ntime before they decided to come and deliver us, for one cannot set foot\r\non the ground until the bag is almost completely deflated.\r\n\r\nThen, almost at the same time as the bewildered men, some of whom showed\r\ntheir astonishment by jumping, with the wild gestures of savages, all\r\nthe cows that were grazing along the coast came toward us, surrounding\r\nour balloon with a strange and comical circle of horns, big eyes and\r\nblowing nostrils.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the accommodating and hospitable Belgian peasants, we\r\nwere able in a short time to pack up all our material and carry it to\r\nthe station at Heyst, where at twenty minutes past eight we took the\r\ntrain for Paris.\r\n\r\nThe descent occurred at three-fifteen in the morning, preceding by only\r\na few seconds the torrent of rain and the blinding lightning of the\r\nstorm which had been chasing us before it.\r\n\r\nThanks to Captain Jovis, of whom I had heard much from my colleague,\r\nPaul Ginisty\xe2\x80\x94for both of them had fallen together and voluntarily into\r\nthe sea opposite Mentone\xe2\x80\x94thanks to this brave man, we were able to see,\r\nin a single night, from far up in the sky, the setting of the sun, the\r\nrising of the moon and the dawn of day and to go from Paris to the mouth\r\nof the Scheldt through the skies.\r\n\r\n[This story appeared in \xe2\x80\x9cFigaro\xe2\x80\x9d on July 16, 1887, under the title:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Paris to Heyst.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAREWELL!\r\n\r\nThe two friends were getting near the end of their dinner. Through the\r\ncafe windows they could see the Boulevard, crowded with people. They\r\ncould feel the gentle breezes which are wafted over Paris on warm summer\r\nevenings and make you feel like going out somewhere, you care not where,\r\nunder the trees, and make you dream of moonlit rivers, of fireflies and\r\nof larks.\r\n\r\nOne of the two, Henri Simon, heaved a deep sigh and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I am growing old. It's sad. Formerly, on evenings like this, I felt\r\nfull of life. Now, I only feel regrets. Life is short!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was perhaps forty-five years old, very bald and already growing\r\nstout.\r\n\r\nThe other, Pierre Carnier, a trifle older, but thin and lively,\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy, I have grown old without noticing it in the least. I have\r\nalways been merry, healthy, vigorous and all the rest. As one sees\r\noneself in the mirror every day, one does not realize the work of age,\r\nfor it is slow, regular, and it modifies the countenance so gently that\r\nthe changes are unnoticeable. It is for this reason alone that we do not\r\ndie of sorrow after two or three years of excitement. For we cannot\r\nunderstand the alterations which time produces. In order to appreciate\r\nthem one would have to remain six months without seeing one's own face\r\n\xe2\x80\x94then, oh, what a shock!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the women, my friend, how I pity the poor beings! All their joy,\r\nall their power, all their life, lies in their beauty, which lasts ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I said, I aged without noticing it; I thought myself practically a\r\nyouth, when I was almost fifty years old. Not feeling the slightest\r\ninfirmity, I went about, happy and peaceful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe revelation of my decline came to me in a simple and terrible\r\nmanner, which overwhelmed me for almost six months\xe2\x80\x94then I became\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike all men, I have often been in love, but most especially once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met her at the seashore, at Etretat, about twelve years ago, shortly\r\nafter the war. There is nothing prettier than this beach during the\r\nmorning bathing hour. It is small, shaped like a horseshoe, framed by\r\nhigh while cliffs, which are pierced by strange holes called the\r\n'Portes,' one stretching out into the ocean like the leg of a giant, the\r\nother short and dumpy. The women gather on the narrow strip of sand in\r\nthis frame of high rocks, which they make into a gorgeous garden of\r\nbeautiful gowns. The sun beats down on the shores, on the multicolored\r\nparasols, on the blue-green sea; and all is gay, delightful, smiling.\r\nYou sit down at the edge of the water and you watch the bathers. The\r\nwomen come down, wrapped in long bath robes, which they throw off\r\ndaintily when they reach the foamy edge of the rippling waves; and they\r\nrun into the water with a rapid little step, stopping from time to time\r\nfor a delightful little thrill from the cold water, a short gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery few stand the test of the bath. It is there that they can be\r\njudged, from the ankle to the throat. Especially on leaving the water\r\nare the defects revealed, although water is a powerful aid to flabby\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first time that I saw this young woman in the water, I was\r\ndelighted, entranced. She stood the test well. There are faces whose\r\ncharms appeal to you at first glance and delight you instantly. You seem\r\nto have found the woman whom you were born to love. I had that feeling\r\nand that shock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was introduced, and was soon smitten worse than I had ever been\r\nbefore. My heart longed for her. It is a terrible yet delightful thing\r\nthus to be dominated by a young woman. It is almost torture, and yet\r\ninfinite delight. Her look, her smile, her hair fluttering in the wind,\r\nthe little lines of her face, the slightest movement of her features,\r\ndelighted me, upset me, entranced me. She had captured me, body and\r\nsoul, by her gestures, her manners, even by her clothes, which seemed to\r\ntake on a peculiar charm as soon as she wore them. I grew tender at the\r\nsight of her veil on some piece of furniture, her gloves thrown on a\r\nchair. Her gowns seemed to me inimitable. Nobody had hats like hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was married, but her husband came only on Saturday, and left on\r\nMonday. I didn't cencern myself about him, anyhow. I wasn't jealous of\r\nhim, I don't know why; never did a creature seem to me to be of less\r\nimportance in life, to attract my attention less than this man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she! how I loved her! How beautiful, graceful and young she was!\r\nShe was youth, elegance, freshness itself! Never before had I felt so\r\nstrongly what a pretty, distinguished, delicate, charming, graceful\r\nbeing woman is. Never before had I appreciated the seductive beauty to\r\nbe found in the curve of a cheek, the movement of a lip, the pinkness of\r\nan ear, the shape of that foolish organ called the nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis lasted three months; then I left for America, overwhelmed with\r\nsadness. But her memory remained in me, persistent, triumphant. From far\r\naway I was as much hers as I had been when she was near me. Years passed\r\nby, and I did not forget her. The charming image of her person was ever\r\nbefore my eyes and in my heart. And my love remained true to her, a\r\nquiet tenderness now, something like the beloved memory of the most\r\nbeautiful and the most enchanting thing I had ever met in my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve years are not much in a lifetime! One does not feel them slip\r\nby. The years follow each other gently and quickly, slowly yet rapidly,\r\neach one is long and yet so soon over! They add up so rapidly, they\r\nleave so few traces behind them, they disappear so completely, that,\r\nwhen one turns round to look back over bygone years, one sees nothing\r\nand yet one does not understand how one happens to be so old. It seemed\r\nto me, really, that hardly a few months separated me from that charming\r\nseason on the sands of Etretat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast spring I went to dine with some friends at Maisons-Laffitte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as the train was leaving, a big, fat lady, escorted by four little\r\ngirls, got into my car. I hardly looked at this mother hen, very big,\r\nvery round, with a face as full as the moon framed in an enormous,\r\nberibboned hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was puffing, out of breath from having been forced to walk quickly.\r\nThe children began to chatter. I unfolded my paper and began to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had just passed Asnieres, when my neighbor suddenly turned to me and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Excuse me, sir, but are you not Monsieur Garnier?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, madame.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she began to laugh, the pleased laugh of a good woman; and yet it\r\nwas sad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You do not seem to recognize me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hesitated. It seemed to me that I had seen that face somewhere; but\r\nwhere? when? I answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes\xe2\x80\x94and no. I certainly know you, and yet I cannot recall your name.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe blushed a little:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Madame Julie Lefevre.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever had I received such a shock. In a second it seemed to me as\r\nthough it were all over with me! I felt that a veil had been torn from\r\nmy eyes and that I was going to make a horrible and heartrending\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that was she! That big, fat, common woman, she! She had become the\r\nmother of these four girls since I had last her. And these little beings\r\nsurprised me as much as their mother. They were part of her; they were\r\nbig girls, and already had a place in life. Whereas she no longer\r\ncounted, she, that marvel of dainty and charming gracefulness. It seemed\r\nto me that I had seen her but yesterday, and this is how I found her\r\nagain! Was it possible? A poignant grief seized my heart; and also a\r\nrevolt against nature herself, an unreasoning indignation against this\r\nbrutal, infarious act of destruction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at her, bewildered. Then I took her hand in mine, and tears\r\ncame to my eyes. I wept for her lost youth. For I did not know this fat\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was also excited, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am greatly changed, am I not? What can you expect\xe2\x80\x94everything has its\r\ntime! You see, I have become a mother, nothing but a good mother.\r\nFarewell to the rest, that is over. Oh! I never expected you to\r\nrecognize me if we met. You, too, have changed. It took me quite a while\r\nto be sure that I was not mistaken. Your hair is all white. Just think!\r\nTwelve years ago! Twelve years! My oldest girl is already ten.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at the child. And I recognized in her something of her\r\nmother's old charm, but something as yet unformed, something which\r\npromised for the future. And life seemed to me as swift as a passing\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had reached. Maisons-Laffitte. I kissed my old friend's hand. I had\r\nfound nothing utter but the most commonplace remarks. I was too much\r\nupset to talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt night, alone, at home, I stood in front of the mirror for a long\r\ntime, a very long time. And I finally remembered what I had been,\r\nfinally saw in my mind's eye my brown mustache, my black hair and the\r\nyouthful expression of my face. Now I was old. Farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF\r\n\r\nThis is what the old Marquis d'Arville told us after St. Hubert's dinner\r\nat the house of the Baron des Ravels.\r\n\r\nWe had killed a stag that day. The marquis was the only one of the\r\nguests who had not taken part in this chase. He never hunted.\r\n\r\nDuring that long repast we had talked about hardly anything but the\r\nslaughter of animals. The ladies themselves were interested in bloody\r\nand exaggerated tales, and the orators imitated the attacks and the\r\ncombats of men against beasts, raised their arms, romanced in a\r\nthundering voice.\r\n\r\nM. d Arville talked well, in a certain flowery, high-sounding, but\r\neffective style. He must have told this story frequently, for he told it\r\nfluently, never hesitating for words, choosing them with skill to make\r\nhis description vivid.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have never hunted, neither did my father, nor my\r\ngrandfather, nor my great-grandfather. This last was the son of a man\r\nwho hunted more than all of you put together. He died in 1764. I will\r\ntell you the story of his death.\r\n\r\nHis name was Jean. He was married, father of that child who became my\r\ngreat-grandfather, and he lived with his younger brother, Francois\r\nd'Arville, in our castle in Lorraine, in the midst of the forest.\r\n\r\nFrancois d'Arville had remained a bachelor for love of the chase.\r\n\r\nThey both hunted from one end of the year to the other, without stopping\r\nand seemingly without fatigue. They loved only hunting, understood\r\nnothing else, talked only of that, lived only for that.\r\n\r\nThey had at heart that one passion, which was terrible and inexorable.\r\nIt consumed them, had completely absorbed them, leaving room for no\r\nother thought.\r\n\r\nThey had given orders that they should not be interrupted in the chase\r\nfor any reason whatever. My great-grandfather was born while his father\r\nwas following a fox, and Jean d'Arville did not stop the chase, but\r\nexclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce! The rascal might have waited till after the view\r\n\xe2\x80\x94halloo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis brother Francois was still more infatuated. On rising he went to see\r\nthe dogs, then the horses, then he shot little birds about the castle\r\nuntil the time came to hunt some large game.\r\n\r\nIn the countryside they were called M. le Marquis and M. le Cadet, the\r\nnobles then not being at all like the chance nobility of our time, which\r\nwishes to establish an hereditary hierarchy in titles; for the son of a\r\nmarquis is no more a count, nor the son of a viscount a baron, than a\r\nson of a general is a colonel by birth. But the contemptible vanity of\r\ntoday finds profit in that arrangement.\r\n\r\nMy ancestors were unusually tall, bony, hairy, violent and vigorous. The\r\nyounger, still taller than the older, had a voice so strong that,\r\naccording to a legend of which he was proud, all the leaves of the\r\nforest shook when he shouted.\r\n\r\nWhen they were both mounted to set out hunting, it must have been a\r\nsuperb sight to see those two giants straddling their huge horses.\r\n\r\nNow, toward the midwinter of that year, 1764, the frosts were excessive,\r\nand the wolves became ferocious.\r\n\r\nThey even attacked belated peasants, roamed at night outside the houses,\r\nhowled from sunset to sunrise, and robbed the stables.\r\n\r\nAnd soon a rumor began to circulate. People talked of a colossal wolf\r\nwith gray fur, almost white, who had eaten two children, gnawed off a\r\nwoman's arm, strangled all the watch dogs in the district, and even come\r\nwithout fear into the farmyards. The people in the houses affirmed that\r\nthey had felt his breath, and that it made the flame of the lights\r\nflicker. And soon a panic ran through all the province. No one dared go\r\nout any more after nightfall. The darkness seemed haunted by the image\r\nof the beast.\r\n\r\nThe brothers d'Arville determined to find and kill him, and several\r\ntimes they brought together all the gentlemen of the country to a great\r\nhunt.\r\n\r\nThey beat the forests and searched the coverts in vain; they never met\r\nhim. They killed wolves, but not that one. And every night after a\r\nbattue the beast, as if to avenge himself, attacked some traveller or\r\nkilled some one's cattle, always far from the place where they had\r\nlooked for him.\r\n\r\nFinally, one night he stole into the pigpen of the Chateau d'Arville and\r\nate the two fattest pigs.\r\n\r\nThe brothers were roused to anger, considering this attack as a direct\r\ninsult and a defiance. They took their strong bloodhounds, used to\r\npursue dangerous animals, and they set off to hunt, their hearts filled\r\nwith rage.\r\n\r\nFrom dawn until the hour when the empurpled sun descended behind the\r\ngreat naked trees, they beat the woods without finding anything.\r\n\r\nAt last, furious and disgusted, both were returning, walking their\r\nhorses along a lane bordered with hedges, and they marvelled that their\r\nskill as huntsmen should be baffled by this wolf, and they were suddenly\r\nseized with a mysterious fear.\r\n\r\nThe elder said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat beast is not an ordinary one. You would say it had a mind like a\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe younger answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we should have a bullet blessed by our cousin, the bishop, or\r\npray some priest to pronounce the words which are needed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they were silent.\r\n\r\nJean continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook how red the sun is. The great wolf will do some harm to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had hardly finished speaking when his horse reared; that of Franqois\r\nbegan to kick. A large thicket covered with dead leaves opened before\r\nthem, and a mammoth beast, entirely gray, jumped up and ran off through\r\nthe wood.\r\n\r\nBoth uttered a kind of grunt of joy, and bending over the necks of their\r\nheavy horses, they threw them forward with an impulse from all their\r\nbody, hurling them on at such a pace, urging them, hurrying them away,\r\nexciting them so with voice and with gesture and with spur that the\r\nexperienced riders seemed to be carrying the heavy beasts between their\r\nthighs and to bear them off as if they were flying.\r\n\r\nThus they went, plunging through the thickets, dashing across the beds\r\nof streams, climbing the hillsides, descending the gorges, and blowing\r\nthe horn as loud as they could to attract their people and the dogs.\r\n\r\nAnd now, suddenly, in that mad race, my ancestor struck his forehead\r\nagainst an enormous branch which split his skull; and he fell dead on\r\nthe ground, while his frightened horse took himself off, disappearing in\r\nthe gloom which enveloped the woods.\r\n\r\nThe younger d'Arville stopped quick, leaped to the earth, seized his\r\nbrother in his arms, and saw that the brains were escaping from the\r\nwound with the blood.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down beside the body, rested the head, disfigured and red,\r\non his knees, and waited, regarding the immobile face of his elder\r\nbrother. Little by little a fear possessed him, a strange fear which he\r\nhad never felt before, the fear of the dark, the fear of loneliness, the\r\nfear of the deserted wood, and the fear also of the weird wolf who had\r\njust killed his brother to avenge himself upon them both.\r\n\r\nThe gloom thickened; the acute cold made the trees crack. Francois got\r\nup, shivering, unable to remain there longer, feeling himself growing\r\nfaint. Nothing was to be heard, neither the voice of the dogs nor the\r\nsound of the horns-all was silent along the invisible horizon; and this\r\nmournful silence of the frozen night had something about it terrific and\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\nHe seized in his immense hands the great body of Jean, straightened it,\r\nand laid it across the saddle to carry it back to the chateau; then he\r\nwent on his way softly, his mind troubled as if he were in a stupor,\r\npursued by horrible and fear-giving images.\r\n\r\nAnd all at once, in the growing darkness a great shape crossed his path.\r\nIt was the beast. A shock of terror shook the hunter; something cold,\r\nlike a drop of water, seemed to glide down his back, and, like a monk\r\nhaunted of the devil, he made a great sign of the cross, dismayed at\r\nthis abrupt return of the horrible prowler. But his eyes fell again on\r\nthe inert body before him, and passing abruptly from fear to anger, he\r\nshook with an indescribable rage.\r\n\r\nThen he spurred his horse and rushed after the wolf.\r\n\r\nHe followed it through the copses, the ravines, and the tall trees,\r\ntraversing woods which he no longer recognized, his eyes fixed on the\r\nwhite speck which fled before him through the night.\r\n\r\nHis horse also seemed animated by a force and strength hitherto unknown.\r\nIt galloped straight ahead with outstretched neck, striking against\r\ntrees, and rocks, the head and the feet of the dead man thrown across\r\nthe saddle. The limbs tore out his hair; the brow, beating the huge\r\ntrunks, spattered them with blood; the spurs tore their ragged coats of\r\nbark. Suddenly the beast and the horseman issued from the forest and\r\nrushed into a valley, just as the moon appeared above the mountains. The\r\nvalley here was stony, inclosed by enormous rocks.\r\n\r\nFrancois then uttered a yell of joy which the echoes repeated like a\r\npeal of thunder, and he leaped from his horse, his cutlass in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe beast, with bristling hair, the back arched, awaited him, its eyes\r\ngleaming like two stars. But, before beginning battle, the strong\r\nhunter, seizing his brother, seated him on a rock, and, placing stones\r\nunder his head, which was no more than a mass of blood, he shouted in\r\nthe ears as if he was talking to a deaf man: \xe2\x80\x9cLook, Jean; look at this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he attacked the monster. He felt himself strong enough to overturn\r\na mountain, to bruise stones in his hands. The beast tried to bite him,\r\naiming for his stomach; but he had seized the fierce animal by the neck,\r\nwithout even using his weapon, and he strangled it gently, listening to\r\nthe cessation of breathing in its throat and the beatings of its heart.\r\nHe laughed, wild with joy, pressing closer and closer his formidable\r\nembrace, crying in a delirium of joy, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, Jean, look!\xe2\x80\x9d All resistance\r\nceased; the body of the wolf became limp. He was dead.\r\n\r\nFrancois took him up in his arms and carried him to the feet of the\r\nelder brother, where he laid him, repeating, in a tender voice: \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\r\nthere, there, my little Jean, see him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he replaced on the saddle the two bodies, one upon the other, and\r\nrode away.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the chateau, laughing and crying, like Gargantua at the\r\nbirth of Pantagruel, uttering shouts of triumph, and boisterous with joy\r\nas he related the death of the beast, and grieving and tearing his beard\r\nin telling of that of his brother.\r\n\r\nAnd often, later, when he talked again of that day, he would say, with\r\ntears in his eyes: \xe2\x80\x9cIf only poor Jean could have seen me strangle the\r\nbeast, he would have died content, that I am sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe widow of my ancestor inspired her orphan son with that horror of the\r\nchase which has transmitted itself from father to son as far down as\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis d'Arville was silent. Some one asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat story is a legend, isn't it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the story teller answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you that it is true from beginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen a lady declared, in a little, soft voice\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, it is fine to have passions like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INN\r\n\r\nResembling in appearance all the wooden hostelries of the High Alps\r\nsituated at the foot of glaciers in the barren rocky gorges that\r\nintersect the summits of the mountains, the Inn of Schwarenbach serves\r\nas a resting place for travellers crossing the Gemini Pass.\r\n\r\nIt remains open for six months in the year and is inhabited by the\r\nfamily of Jean Hauser; then, as soon as the snow begins to fall and to\r\nfill the valley so as to make the road down to Loeche impassable, the\r\nfather and his three sons go away and leave the house in charge of the\r\nold guide, Gaspard Hari, with the young guide, Ulrich Kunsi, and Sam,\r\nthe great mountain dog.\r\n\r\nThe two men and the dog remain till the spring in their snowy prison,\r\nwith nothing before their eyes except the immense white slopes of the\r\nBalmhorn, surrounded by light, glistening summits, and are shut in,\r\nblocked up and buried by the snow which rises around them and which\r\nenvelops, binds and crushes the little house, which lies piled on the\r\nroof, covering the windows and blocking up the door.\r\n\r\nIt was the day on which the Hauser family were going to return to\r\nLoeche, as winter was approaching, and the descent was becoming\r\ndangerous. Three mules started first, laden with baggage and led by the\r\nthree sons. Then the mother, Jeanne Hauser, and her daughter Louise\r\nmounted a fourth mule and set off in their turn and the father followed\r\nthem, accompanied by the two men in charge, who were to escort the\r\nfamily as far as the brow of the descent. First of all they passed round\r\nthe small lake, which was now frozen over, at the bottom of the mass of\r\nrocks which stretched in front of the inn, and then they followed the\r\nvalley, which was dominated on all sides by the snow-covered summits.\r\n\r\nA ray of sunlight fell into that little white, glistening, frozen desert\r\nand illuminated it with a cold and dazzling flame. No living thing\r\nappeared among this ocean of mountains. There was no motion in this\r\nimmeasurable solitude and no noise disturbed the profound silence.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the young guide, Ulrich Kunsi, a tall, long-legged Swiss,\r\nleft old man Hauser and old Gaspard behind, in order to catch up the\r\nmule which bore the two women. The younger one looked at him as he\r\napproached and appeared to be calling him with her sad eyes. She was a\r\nyoung, fairhaired little peasant girl, whose milk-white cheeks and pale\r\nhair looked as if they had lost their color by their long abode amid the\r\nice. When he had got up to the animal she was riding he put his hand on\r\nthe crupper and relaxed his speed. Mother Hauser began to talk to him,\r\nenumerating with the minutest details all that he would have to attend\r\nto during the winter. It was the first time that he was going to stay up\r\nthere, while old Hari had already spent fourteen winters amid the snow,\r\nat the inn of Schwarenbach.\r\n\r\nUlrich Kunsi listened, without appearing to understand and looked\r\nincessantly at the girl. From time to time he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Madame\r\nHauser,\xe2\x80\x9d but his thoughts seemed far away and his calm features remained\r\nunmoved.\r\n\r\nThey reached Lake Daube, whose broad, frozen surface extended to the end\r\nof the valley. On the right one saw the black, pointed, rocky summits of\r\nthe Daubenhorn beside the enormous moraines of the Lommern glacier,\r\nabove which rose the Wildstrubel. As they approached the Gemmi pass,\r\nwhere the descent of Loeche begins, they suddenly beheld the immense\r\nhorizon of the Alps of the Valais, from which the broad, deep valley of\r\nthe Rhone separated them.\r\n\r\nIn the distance there was a group of white, unequal, flat, or pointed\r\nmountain summits, which glistened in the sun; the Mischabel with its two\r\npeaks, the huge group of the Weisshorn, the heavy Brunegghorn, the lofty\r\nand formidable pyramid of Mount Cervin, that slayer of men, and the\r\nDent-Blanche, that monstrous coquette.\r\n\r\nThen beneath them, in a tremendous hole, at the bottom of a terrific\r\nabyss, they perceived Loeche, where houses looked as grains of sand\r\nwhich had been thrown into that enormous crevice that is ended and\r\nclosed by the Gemmi and which opens, down below, on the Rhone.\r\n\r\nThe mule stopped at the edge of the path, which winds and turns\r\ncontinually, doubling backward, then, fantastically and strangely, along\r\nthe side of the mountain as far as the almost invisible little village\r\nat its feet. The women jumped into the snow and the two old men joined\r\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d father Hauser said, \xe2\x80\x9cgood-by, and keep up your spirits\r\ntill next year, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d and old Hari replied: \xe2\x80\x9cTill next year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey embraced each other and then Madame Hauser in her turn offered her\r\ncheek, and the girl did the same.\r\n\r\nWhen Ulrich Kunsi's turn came, he whispered in Louise's ear, \xe2\x80\x9cDo not\r\nforget those up yonder,\xe2\x80\x9d and she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d in such a low voice that\r\nhe guessed what she had said without hearing it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, adieu,\xe2\x80\x9d Jean\r\nHauser repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cand don't fall ill.\xe2\x80\x9d And going before the two women,\r\nhe commenced the descent, and soon all three disappeared at the first\r\nturn in the road, while the two men returned to the inn at Schwarenbach.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly, side by side, without speaking. It was over, and\r\nthey would be alone together for four or five months. Then Gaspard Hari\r\nbegan to relate his life last winter. He had remained with Michael\r\nCanol, who was too old now to stand it, for an accident might happen\r\nduring that long solitude. They had not been dull, however; the only\r\nthing was to make up one's mind to it from the first, and in the end one\r\nwould find plenty of distraction, games and other means of whiling away\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nUlrich Kunsi listened to him with his eyes on the ground, for in his\r\nthoughts he was following those who were descending to the village. They\r\nsoon came in sight of the inn, which was, however, scarcely visible, so\r\nsmall did it look, a black speck at the foot of that enormous billow of\r\nsnow, and when they opened the door Sam, the great curly dog, began to\r\nromp round them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d old Gaspard said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have no women now, so we must get\r\nour own dinner ready. Go and peel the potatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d And they both sat down\r\non wooden stools and began to prepare the soup.\r\n\r\nThe next morning seemed very long to Kunsi. Old Hari smoked and spat on\r\nthe hearth, while the young man looked out of the window at the snow-\r\ncovered mountain opposite the house.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he went out, and going over yesterday's ground again,\r\nhe looked for the traces of the mule that had carried the two women.\r\nThen when he had reached the Gemmi Pass, he laid himself down on his\r\nstomach and looked at Loeche.\r\n\r\nThe village, in its rocky pit, was not yet buried under the snow, from\r\nwhich it was sheltered by the pine woods which protected it on all\r\nsides. Its low houses looked like paving stones in a large meadow from\r\nabove. Hauser's little daughter was there now in one of those gray-\r\ncolored houses. In which? Ulrich Kunsi was too far away to be able to\r\nmake them out separately. How he would have liked to go down while he\r\nwas yet able!\r\n\r\nBut the sun had disappeared behind the lofty crest of the Wildstrubel\r\nand the young man returned to the chalet. Daddy Hari was smoking, and\r\nwhen he saw his mate come in he proposed a game of cards to him, and\r\nthey sat down opposite each other, on either side of the table. They\r\nplayed for a long time a simple game called brisque and then they had\r\nsupper and went to bed.\r\n\r\nThe following days were like the first, bright and cold, without any\r\nfresh snow. Old Gaspard spent his afternoons in watching the eagles and\r\nother rare birds which ventured on those frozen heights, while Ulrich\r\nreturned regularly to the Gemmi Pass to look at the village. Then they\r\nplayed cards, dice or dominoes and lost and won a trifle, just to create\r\nan interest in the game.\r\n\r\nOne morning Hari, who was up first, called his companion. A moving, deep\r\nand light cloud of white spray was falling on them noiselessly and was\r\nby degrees burying them under a thick, heavy coverlet of foam. That\r\nlasted four days and four nights. It was necessary to free the door and\r\nthe windows, to dig out a passage and to cut steps to get over this\r\nfrozen powder, which a twelve hours' frost had made as hard as the\r\ngranite of the moraines.\r\n\r\nThey lived like prisoners and did not venture outside their abode. They\r\nhad divided their duties, which they performed regularly. Ulrich Kunsi\r\nundertook the scouring, washing and everything that belonged to\r\ncleanliness. He also chopped up the wood while Gaspard Hari did the\r\ncooking and attended to the fire. Their regular and monotonous work was\r\ninterrupted by long games at cards or dice, and they never quarrelled,\r\nbut were always calm and placid. They were never seen impatient or ill-\r\nhumored, nor did they ever use hard words, for they had laid in a stock\r\nof patience for their wintering on the top of the mountain.\r\n\r\nSometimes old Gaspard took his rifle and went after chamois, and\r\noccasionally he killed one. Then there was a feast in the inn at\r\nSchwarenbach and they revelled in fresh meat. One morning he went out as\r\nusual. The thermometer outside marked eighteen degrees of frost, and as\r\nthe sun had not yet risen, the hunter hoped to surprise the animals at\r\nthe approaches to the Wildstrubel, and Ulrich, being alone, remained in\r\nbed until ten o'clock. He was of a sleepy nature, but he would not have\r\ndared to give way like that to his inclination in the presence of the\r\nold guide, who was ever an early riser. He breakfasted leisurely with\r\nSam, who also spent his days and nights in sleeping in front of the\r\nfire; then he felt low-spirited and even frightened at the solitude, and\r\nwas seized by a longing for his daily game of cards, as one is by the\r\ncraving of a confirmed habit, and so he went out to meet his companion,\r\nwho was to return at four o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe snow had levelled the whole deep valley, filled up the crevasses,\r\nobliterated all signs of the two lakes and covered the rocks, so that\r\nbetween the high summits there was nothing but an immense, white,\r\nregular, dazzling and frozen surface. For three weeks Ulrich had not\r\nbeen to the edge of the precipice from which he had looked down on the\r\nvillage, and he wanted to go there before climbing the slopes which led\r\nto Wildstrubel. Loeche was now also covered by the snow and the houses\r\ncould scarcely be distinguished, covered as they were by that white\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the right, he reached the Loemmern glacier. He went\r\nalong with a mountaineer's long strides, striking the snow, which was as\r\nhard as a rock, with his iron-pointed stick, and with his piercing eyes\r\nhe looked for the little black, moving speck in the distance, on that\r\nenormous, white expanse.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the end of the glacier he stopped and asked himself\r\nwhether the old man had taken that road, and then he began to walk along\r\nthe moraines with rapid and uneasy steps. The day was declining, the\r\nsnow was assuming a rosy tint, and a dry, frozen wind blew in rough\r\ngusts over its crystal surface. Ulrich uttered a long, shrill, vibrating\r\ncall. His voice sped through the deathlike silence in which the\r\nmountains were sleeping; it reached the distance, across profound and\r\nmotionless waves of glacial foam, like the cry of a bird across the\r\nwaves of the sea. Then it died away and nothing answered him.\r\n\r\nHe began to walk again. The sun had sunk yonder behind the mountain\r\ntops, which were still purple with the reflection from the sky, but the\r\ndepths of the valley were becoming gray, and suddenly the young man felt\r\nfrightened. It seemed to him as if the silence, the cold, the solitude,\r\nthe winter death of these mountains were taking possession of him, were\r\ngoing to stop and to freeze his blood, to make his limbs grow stiff and\r\nto turn him into a motionless and frozen object, and he set off running,\r\nfleeing toward his dwelling. The old man, he thought, would have\r\nreturned during his absence. He had taken another road; he would, no\r\ndoubt, be sitting before the fire, with a dead chamois at his feet. He\r\nsoon came in sight of the inn, but no smoke rose from it. Ulrich walked\r\nfaster and opened the door. Sam ran up to him to greet him, but Gaspard\r\nHari had not returned. Kunsi, in his alarm, turned round suddenly, as if\r\nhe had expected to find his comrade hidden in a corner. Then he\r\nrelighted the fire and made the soup, hoping every moment to see the old\r\nman come in. From time to time he went out to see if he were not coming.\r\nIt was quite night now, that wan, livid night of the mountains, lighted\r\nby a thin, yellow crescent moon, just disappearing behind the mountain\r\ntops.\r\n\r\nThen the young man went in and sat down to warm his hands and feet,\r\nwhile he pictured to himself every possible accident. Gaspard might have\r\nbroken a leg, have fallen into a crevasse, taken a false step and\r\ndislocated his ankle. And, perhaps, he was lying on the snow, overcome\r\nand stiff with the cold, in agony of mind, lost and, perhaps, shouting\r\nfor help, calling with all his might in the silence of the night.. But\r\nwhere? The mountain was so vast, so rugged, so dangerous in places,\r\nespecially at that time of the year, that it would have required ten or\r\ntwenty guides to walk for a week in all directions to find a man in that\r\nimmense space. Ulrich Kunsi, however, made up his mind to set out with\r\nSam if Gaspard did not return by one in the morning, and he made his\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nHe put provisions for two days into a bag, took his steel climbing iron,\r\ntied a long, thin, strong rope round his waist, and looked to see that\r\nhis iron-shod stick and his axe, which served to cut steps in the ice,\r\nwere in order. Then he waited. The fire was burning on the hearth, the\r\ngreat dog was snoring in front of it, and the clock was ticking, as\r\nregularly as a heart beating, in its resounding wooden case. He waited,\r\nwith his ears on the alert for distant sounds, and he shivered when the\r\nwind blew against the roof and the walls. It struck twelve and he\r\ntrembled: Then, frightened and shivering, he put some water on the fire,\r\nso that he might have some hot coffee before starting, and when the\r\nclock struck one he got up, woke Sam, opened the door and went off in\r\nthe direction of the Wildstrubel. For five hours he mounted, scaling the\r\nrocks by means of his climbing irons, cutting into the ice, advancing\r\ncontinually, and occasionally hauling up the dog, who remained below at\r\nthe foot of some slope that was too steep for him, by means of the rope.\r\nIt was about six o'clock when he reached one of the summits to which old\r\nGaspard often came after chamois, and he waited till it should be\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nThe sky was growing pale overhead, and a strange light, springing nobody\r\ncould tell whence, suddenly illuminated the immense ocean of pale\r\nmountain summits, which extended for a hundred leagues around him. One\r\nmight have said that this vague brightness arose from the snow itself\r\nand spread abroad in space. By degrees the highest distant summits\r\nassumed a delicate, pink flesh color, and the red sun appeared behind\r\nthe ponderous giants of the Bernese Alps.\r\n\r\nUlrich Kunsi set off again, walking like a hunter, bent over, looking\r\nfor tracks, and saying to his dog: \xe2\x80\x9cSeek, old fellow, seek!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was descending the mountain now, scanning the depths closely, and\r\nfrom time to time shouting, uttering aloud, prolonged cry, which soon\r\ndied away in that silent vastness. Then he put his ear to the ground to\r\nlisten. He thought he could distinguish a voice, and he began to run and\r\nshouted again, but he heard nothing more and sat down, exhausted and in\r\ndespair. Toward midday he breakfasted and gave Sam, who was as tired as\r\nhimself, something to eat also, and then he recommenced his search.\r\n\r\nWhen evening came he was still walking, and he had walked more than\r\nthirty miles over the mountains. As he was too far away to return home\r\nand too tired to drag himself along any further, he dug a hole in the\r\nsnow and crouched in it with his dog under a blanket which he had\r\nbrought with him. And the man and the dog lay side by side, trying to\r\nkeep warm, but frozen to the marrow nevertheless. Ulrich scarcely slept,\r\nhis mind haunted by visions and his limbs shaking with cold.\r\n\r\nDay was breaking when he got up. His legs were as stiff as iron bars and\r\nhis spirits so low that he was ready to cry with anguish, while his\r\nheart was beating so that he almost fell over with agitation, when he\r\nthought he heard a noise.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he imagined that he also was going to die of cold in the midst\r\nof this vast solitude, and the terror of such a death roused his\r\nenergies and gave him renewed vigor. He was descending toward the inn,\r\nfalling down and getting up again, and followed at a distance by Sam,\r\nwho was limping on three legs, and they did not reach Schwarenbach until\r\nfour o'clock in the afternoon. The house was empty and the young man\r\nmade a fire, had something to eat and went to sleep, so worn out that he\r\ndid not think of anything more.\r\n\r\nHe slept for a long time, for a very long time, an irresistible sleep.\r\nBut suddenly a voice, a cry, a name, \xe2\x80\x9cUlrich!\xe2\x80\x9d aroused him from his\r\nprofound torpor and made him sit up in bed. Had he been dreaming? Was it\r\none of those strange appeals which cross the dreams of disquieted minds?\r\nNo, he heard it still, that reverberating cry-which had entered his ears\r\nand remained in his flesh-to the tips of his sinewy fingers. Certainly\r\nsomebody had cried out and called \xe2\x80\x9cUlrich!\xe2\x80\x9d There was somebody there\r\nnear the house, there could be no doubt of that, and he opened the door\r\nand shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Gaspard?\xe2\x80\x9d with all the strength of his lungs.\r\nBut there was no reply, no murmur, no groan, nothing. It was quite dark\r\nand the snow looked wan.\r\n\r\nThe wind had risen, that icy wind that cracks the rocks and leaves\r\nnothing alive on those deserted heights, and it came in sudden gusts,\r\nwhich were more parching and more deadly than the burning wind of the\r\ndesert, and again Ulrich shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cGaspard! Gaspard! Gaspard.\xe2\x80\x9d And then\r\nhe waited again. Everything was silent on the mountain.\r\n\r\nThen he shook with terror and with a bound he was inside the inn, when\r\nhe shut and bolted the door, and then he fell into a chair trembling all\r\nover, for he felt certain that his comrade had called him at the moment\r\nhe was expiring.\r\n\r\nHe was sure of that, as sure as one is of being alive or of eating a\r\npiece of bread. Old Gaspard Hari had been dying for two days and three\r\nnights somewhere, in some hole, in one of those deep, untrodden ravines\r\nwhose whiteness is more sinister than subterranean darkness. He had been\r\ndying for two days and three nights and he had just then died, thinking\r\nof his comrade. His soul, almost before it was released, had taken its\r\nflight to the inn where Ulrich was sleeping, and it had called him by\r\nthat terrible and mysterious power which the spirits of the dead have to\r\nhaunt the living. That voiceless soul had cried to the worn-out soul of\r\nthe sleeper; it had uttered its last farewell, or its reproach, or its\r\ncurse on the man who had not searched carefully enough.\r\n\r\nAnd Ulrich felt that it was there, quite close to him, behind the wall,\r\nbehind the door which he had just fastened. It was wandering about, like\r\na night bird which lightly touches a lighted window with his wings, and\r\nthe terrified young man was ready to scream with horror. He wanted to\r\nrun away, but did not dare to go out; he did not dare, and he should\r\nnever dare to do it in the future, for that phantom would remain there\r\nday and night, round the inn, as long as the old man's body was not\r\nrecovered and had not been deposited in the consecrated earth of a\r\nchurchyard.\r\n\r\nWhen it was daylight Kunsi recovered some of his courage at the return\r\nof the bright sun. He prepared his meal, gave his dog some food and then\r\nremained motionless on a chair, tortured at heart as he thought of the\r\nold man lying on the snow, and then, as soon as night once more covered\r\nthe mountains, new terrors assailed him. He now walked up and down the\r\ndark kitchen, which was scarcely lighted by the flame of one candle, and\r\nhe walked from one end of it to the other with great strides, listening,\r\nlistening whether the terrible cry of the other night would again break\r\nthe dreary silence outside. He felt himself alone, unhappy man, as no\r\nman had ever been alone before! He was alone in this immense desert of\r\nSnow, alone five thousand feet above the inhabited earth, above human\r\nhabitation, above that stirring, noisy, palpitating life, alone under an\r\nicy sky! A mad longing impelled him to run away, no matter where, to get\r\ndown to Loeche by flinging himself over the precipice; but he did not\r\neven dare to open the door, as he felt sure that the other, the dead\r\nman, would bar his road, so that he might not be obliged to remain up\r\nthere alone:\r\n\r\nToward midnight, tired with walking, worn out by grief and fear, he at\r\nlast fell into a doze in his chair, for he was afraid of his bed as one\r\nis of a haunted spot. But suddenly the strident cry of the other evening\r\npierced his ears, and it was so shrill that Ulrich stretched out his\r\narms to repulse the ghost, and he fell backward with his chair.\r\n\r\nSam, who was awakened by the noise, began to howl as frightened dogs do\r\nhowl, and he walked all about the house trying to find out where the\r\ndanger came from. When he got to the door, he sniffed beneath it,\r\nsmelling vigorously, with his coat bristling and his tail stiff, while\r\nhe growled angrily. Kunsi, who was terrified, jumped up, and, holding\r\nhis chair by one leg, he cried: \xe2\x80\x9cDon't come in, don't come in, or I\r\nshall kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d And the dog, excited by this threat, barked angrily at\r\nthat invisible enemy who defied his master's voice. By degrees, however,\r\nhe quieted down and came back and stretched himself in front of the\r\nfire, but he was uneasy and kept his head up and growled between his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nUlrich, in turn, recovered his senses, but as he felt faint with terror,\r\nhe went and got a bottle of brandy out of the sideboard, and he drank\r\noff several glasses, one after anther, at a gulp. His ideas became\r\nvague, his courage revived and a feverish glow ran through his veins.\r\n\r\nHe ate scarcely anything the next day and limited himself to alcohol,\r\nand so he lived for several days, like a drunken brute. As soon as he\r\nthought of Gaspard Hari, he began to drink again, and went on drinking\r\nuntil he fell to the ground, overcome by intoxication. And there he\r\nremained lying on his face, dead drunk, his limbs benumbed, and snoring\r\nloudly. But scarcely had he digested the maddening and burning liquor\r\nthan the same cry, \xe2\x80\x9cUlrich!\xe2\x80\x9d woke him like a bullet piercing his brain,\r\nand he got up, still staggering, stretching out his hands to save\r\nhimself from falling, and calling to Sam to help him. And the dog, who\r\nappeared to be going mad like his master, rushed to the door, scratched\r\nit with his claws and gnawed it with his long white teeth, while the\r\nyoung man, with his head thrown back drank the brandy in draughts, as if\r\nit had been cold water, so that it might by and by send his thoughts,\r\nhis frantic terror, and his memory to sleep again.\r\n\r\nIn three weeks he had consumed all his stock of ardent spirits. But his\r\ncontinual drunkenness only lulled his terror, which awoke more furiously\r\nthan ever as soon as it was impossible for him to calm it. His fixed\r\nidea then, which had been intensified by a month of drunkenness, and\r\nwhich was continually increasing in his absolute solitude, penetrated\r\nhim like a gimlet. He now walked about the house like a wild beast in\r\nits cage, putting his ear to the door to listen if the other were there\r\nand defying him through the wall. Then, as soon as he dozed, overcome by\r\nfatigue, he heard the voice which made him leap to his feet.\r\n\r\nAt last one night, as cowards do when driven to extremities, he sprang\r\nto the door and opened it, to see who was calling him and to force him\r\nto keep quiet, but such a gust of cold wind blew into his face that it\r\nchilled him to the bone, and he closed and bolted the door again\r\nimmediately, without noticing that Sam had rushed out. Then, as he was\r\nshivering with cold, he threw some wood on the fire and sat down in\r\nfront of it to warm himself, but suddenly he started, for somebody was\r\nscratching at the wall and crying. In desperation he called out: \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x9d but was answered by another long, sorrowful wail.\r\n\r\nThen all his remaining senses forsook him from sheer fright. He\r\nrepeated: \xe2\x80\x9cGo away!\xe2\x80\x9d and turned round to try to find some corner in\r\nwhich to hide, while the other person went round the house still crying\r\nand rubbing against the wall. Ulrich went to the oak sideboard, which\r\nwas full of plates and dishes and of provisions, and lifting it up with\r\nsuperhuman strength, he dragged it to the door, so as to form a\r\nbarricade. Then piling up all the rest of the furniture, the mattresses,\r\npalliasses and chairs, he stopped up the windows as one does when\r\nassailed by an enemy.\r\n\r\nBut the person outside now uttered long, plaintive, mournful groans, to\r\nwhich the young man replied by similar groans, and thus days and nights\r\npassed without their ceasing to howl at each other. The one was\r\ncontinually walking round the house and scraped the walls with his nails\r\nso vigorously that it seemed as if he wished to destroy them, while the\r\nother, inside, followed all his movements, stooping down and holding his\r\near to the walls and replying to all his appeals with terrible cries.\r\nOne evening, however, Ulrich heard nothing more, and he sat down, so\r\novercome by fatigue, that he went to sleep immediately and awoke in the\r\nmorning without a thought, without any recollection of what had\r\nhappened, just as if his head had been emptied during his heavy sleep,\r\nbut he felt hungry, and he ate.\r\n\r\nThe winter was over and the Gemmi Pass was practicable again, so the\r\nHauser family started off to return to their inn. As soon as they had\r\nreached the top of the ascent the women mounted their mule and spoke\r\nabout the two men whom they would meet again shortly. They were, indeed,\r\nrather surprised that neither of them had come down a few days before,\r\nas soon as the road was open, in order to tell them all about their long\r\nwinter sojourn. At last, however, they saw the inn, still covered with\r\nsnow, like a quilt. The door and the window were closed, but a little\r\nsmoke was coming out of the chimney, which reassured old Hauser. On\r\ngoing up to the door, however, he saw the skeleton of an animal which\r\nhad been torn to pieces by the eagles, a large skeleton lying on its\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThey all looked close at it and the mother said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d and then she shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cHi, Gaspard!\xe2\x80\x9d A cry from the\r\ninterior of the house answered her and a sharp cry that one might have\r\nthought some animal had uttered it. Old Hauser repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cHi, Gaspard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand they heard another cry similar to the first.\r\n\r\nThen the three men, the father and the two sons, tried to open the door,\r\nbut it resisted their efforts. From the empty cow-stall they took a beam\r\nto serve as a battering-ram and hurled it against the door with all\r\ntheir might. The wood gave way and the boards flew into splinters. Then\r\nthe house was shaken by a loud voice, and inside, behind the side board\r\nwhich was overturned, they saw a man standing upright, with his hair\r\nfalling on his shoulders and a beard descending to his breast, with\r\nshining eyes, and nothing but rags to cover him. They did not recognize\r\nhim, but Louise Hauser exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Ulrich, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d And her mother declared that it was Ulrich,\r\nalthough his hair was white.\r\n\r\nHe allowed them to go up to him and to touch him, but he did not reply\r\nto any of their questions, and they were obliged to take him to Loeche,\r\nwhere the doctors found that he was mad, and nobody ever found out what\r\nhad become of his companion.\r\n\r\nLittle Louise Hauser nearly died that summer of decline, which the\r\nphysicians attributed to the cold air of the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 5.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR PARENT\r\n\r\nGeorge's father was sitting in an iron chair, watching his little son\r\nwith concentrated affection and attention, as little George piled up the\r\nsand into heaps during one of their walks. He would take up the sand\r\nwith both hands, make a mound of it, and put a chestnut leaf on top. His\r\nfather saw no one but him in that public park full of people.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just disappearing behind the roofs of the Rue Saint-Lazare,\r\nbut still shed its rays obliquely on that little, overdressed crowd. The\r\nchestnut trees were lighted up by its yellow rays, and the three\r\nfountains before the lofty porch of the church had the appearance of\r\nliquid silver.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Parent, accidentally looking up at the church clock, saw that\r\nhe was five minutes late. He got up, took the child by the arm, shook\r\nhis dress, which was covered with sand, wiped his hands, and led him in\r\nthe direction of the Rue Blanche. He walked quickly, so as not to get in\r\nafter his wife, and the child could not keep up with him. He took him up\r\nand carried him, though it made him pant when he had to walk up the\r\nsteep street. He was a man of forty, already turning gray, and rather\r\nstout. At last he reached his house. An old servant who had brought him\r\nup, one of those trusted servants who are the tyrants of families,\r\nopened the door to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas madame come in yet?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe servant shrugged her shoulders:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen have you ever known madame to come home at half-past six,\r\nmonsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; all the better; it will give me time to change my things,\r\nfor I am very warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant looked at him with angry and contemptuous pity. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\r\nsee that well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she grumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are covered with perspiration,\r\nmonsieur. I suppose you walked quickly and carried the child, and only\r\nto have to wait until half-past seven, perhaps, for madame. I have made\r\nup my mind not to have dinner ready on time. I shall get it for eight\r\no'clock, and if, you have to wait, I cannot help it; roast meat ought\r\nnot to be burnt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Parent pretended not to hear, but went into his own room, and\r\nas soon as he got in, locked the door, so as to be alone, quite alone.\r\nHe was so used now to being abused and badly treated that he never\r\nthought himself safe except when he was locked in.\r\n\r\nWhat could he do? To get rid of Julie seemed to him such a formidable\r\nthing to do that he hardly ventured to think of it, but it was just as\r\nimpossible to uphold her against his wife, and before another month the\r\nsituation would become unbearable between the two. He remained sitting\r\nthere, with his arms hanging down, vaguely trying to discover some means\r\nto set matters straight, but without success. He said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nlucky that I have George; without him I should-be very miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then the clock struck seven, and he started up. Seven o'clock, and\r\nhe had not even changed his clothes. Nervous and breathless, he\r\nundressed, put on a clean shirt, hastily finished his toilet, as if he\r\nhad been expected in the next room for some event of extreme importance,\r\nand went into the drawing-room, happy at having nothing to fear. He\r\nglanced at the newspaper, went and looked out of the window, and then\r\nsat down again, when the door opened, and the boy came in, washed,\r\nbrushed, and smiling. Parent took him up in his arms and kissed him\r\npassionately; then he tossed him into the air, and held him up to the\r\nceiling, but soon sat down again, as he was tired with all his exertion.\r\nThen, taking George on his knee, he made him ride a-cock-horse. The\r\nchild laughed and clapped his hands and shouted with pleasure, as did\r\nhis father, who laughed until his big stomach shook, for it amused him\r\nalmost more than it did the child.\r\n\r\nParent loved him with all the heart of a weak, resigned, ill-used man.\r\nHe loved him with mad bursts of affection, with caresses and with all\r\nthe bashful tenderness which was hidden in him, and which had never\r\nfound an outlet, even at the early period of his married life, for his\r\nwife had always shown herself cold and reserved.\r\n\r\nJust then Julie came to the door, with a pale face and glistening eyes,\r\nand said in a voice which trembled with exasperation: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is half-past\r\nseven, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent gave an uneasy and resigned look at the clock and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nit certainly is half-past seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dinner is quite ready now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing the storm which was coming, he tried to turn it aside. \xe2\x80\x9cBut did\r\nyou not tell me when I came in that it would not be ready before eight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight! what are you thinking about? You surely do not mean to let the\r\nchild dine at eight o'clock? It would ruin his stomach. Just suppose\r\nthat he only had his mother to look after him! She cares a great deal\r\nabout her child. Oh, yes, we will speak about her; she is a mother! What\r\na pity it is that there should be any mothers like her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent thought it was time to cut short a threatened scene. \xe2\x80\x9cJulie,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not allow you to speak like that of your mistress. You\r\nunderstand me, do you not? Do not forget it in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old servant, who was nearly choked with surprise, turned and went\r\nout, slamming the door so violently after her that the lustres on the\r\nchandelier rattled, and for some seconds it sounded as if a number of\r\nlittle invisible bells were ringing in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nEight o'clock struck, the door opened, and Julie came in again. She had\r\nlost her look of exasperation, but now she put on an air of cold and\r\ndetermined resolution, which was still more formidable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI served your mother until the day of her death,\r\nand I have attended to you from your birth until now, and I think it may\r\nbe said that I am devoted to the family.\xe2\x80\x9d She waited for a reply, and\r\nParent stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, certainly, my good Julie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know quite well,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have never done anything\r\nfor the sake of money, but always for your sake; that I have never\r\ndeceived you nor lied to you, that you have never had to find fault with\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my good Julie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, monsieur; it cannot go on any longer like this. I have\r\nsaid nothing, and left you in your ignorance, out of respect and liking\r\nfor you, but it is too much, and every one in the neighborhood is\r\nlaughing at you. Everybody knows about it, and so I must tell you also,\r\nalthough I do not like to repeat it. The reason why madame comes in at\r\nany time she chooses is that she is doing abominable things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed stupefied and not to understand, and could only stammer out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue; you know I have forbidden you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she interrupted him with irresistible resolution. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, I\r\nmust tell you everything now. For a long time madame has been carrying\r\non with Monsieur Limousin. I have seen them kiss scores of times behind\r\nthe door. Ah! you may be sure that if Monsieur Limousin had been rich,\r\nmadame would never have married Monsieur Parent. If you remember how the\r\nmarriage was brought about, you would understand the matter from\r\nbeginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent had risen, and stammered out, his face livid: \xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue\r\n\xe2\x80\x94hold your tongue, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on, however: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I mean to tell you everything. She married\r\nyou from interest, and she deceived you from the very first day. It was\r\nall settled between them beforehand. You need only reflect for a few\r\nmoments to understand it, and then, as she was not satisfied with having\r\nmarried you, as she did not love you, she has made your life miserable,\r\nso miserable that it has almost broken my heart when I have seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down the room with hands clenched, repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cHold\r\nyour tongue\xe2\x80\x94hold your tongue\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d For he could find nothing else to say.\r\nThe old servant, however, would not yield; she seemed resolved on\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nGeorge, who had been at first astonished and then frightened at those\r\nangry voices, began to utter shrill screams, and remained behind his\r\nfather, with his face puckered up and his mouth open, roaring.\r\n\r\nHis son's screams exasperated Parent, and filled him with rage and\r\ncourage. He rushed at Julie with both arms raised, ready to strike her,\r\nexclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you wretch. You will drive the child out of his\r\nsenses.\xe2\x80\x9d He already had his hand on her, when she screamed in his face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, you may beat me if you like, me who reared you, but that will\r\nnot prevent your wife from deceiving you, or alter the fact that your\r\nchild is not yours\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly, let his arms fall, and remained standing opposite\r\nto her, so overwhelmed that he could understand nothing more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need only to look at the child,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cto know who is its\r\nfather! He is the very image of Monsieur Limousin. You need only look at\r\nhis eyes and forehead. Why, a blind man could not be mistaken in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had taken her by the shoulders, and was now shaking her with all his\r\nmight. \xe2\x80\x9cViper, viper!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo out the room, viper! Go out, or I\r\nshall kill you! Go out! Go out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with a desperate effort he threw her into the next room. She fell\r\nacross the table, which was laid for dinner, breaking the glasses. Then,\r\nrising to her feet, she put the table between her master and herself.\r\nWhile he was pursuing her, in order to take hold of her again, she flung\r\nterrible words at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need only go out this evening after dinner, and come in again\r\nimmediately, and you will see! You will see whether I have been lying!\r\nJust try it, and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d She had reached the kitchen door and\r\nescaped, but he ran after her, up the back stairs to her bedroom, into\r\nwhich she had locked herself, and knocking at the door, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will leave my house this very instant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be certain of that, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d was her reply. \xe2\x80\x9cIn an hour's\r\ntime I shall not be here any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then went slowly downstairs again, holding on to the banister so as\r\nnot to fall, and went back to the drawing-room, where little George was\r\nsitting on the floor, crying. He fell into a chair, and looked at the\r\nchild with dull eyes. He understood nothing, knew nothing more; he felt\r\ndazed, stupefied, mad, as if he had just fallen on his head, and he\r\nscarcely even remembered the dreadful things the servant had told him.\r\nThen, by degrees, his mind, like muddy water, became calmer and clearer,\r\nand the abominable revelations began to work in his heart.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer thinking of George. The child was quiet now and sitting\r\non the carpet; but, seeing that no notice was being taken of him, he\r\nbegan to cry. His father ran to him, took him in his arms, and covered\r\nhim with kisses. His child remained to him, at any rate! What did the\r\nrest matter? He held him in his arms and pressed his lips to his light\r\nhair, and, relieved and composed, he whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge\xe2\x80\x94my little George\xe2\x80\x94my dear little George\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But he suddenly\r\nremembered what Julie had said! Yes, she had said that he was Limousin's\r\nchild. Oh! it could not be possible, surely. He could not believe it,\r\ncould not doubt, even for a moment, that he was his own child. It was\r\none of those low scandals which spring from servants' brains! And he\r\nrepeated: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge\xe2\x80\x94my dear little George.\xe2\x80\x9d The youngster was quiet again,\r\nnow that his father was fondling him.\r\n\r\nParent felt the warmth of the little chest penetrate through his\r\nclothes, and it filled him with love, courage, and happiness; that\r\ngentle warmth soothed him, fortified him and saved him. Then he put the\r\nsmall, curly head away from him a little, and looked at it\r\naffectionately, still repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! Oh, my little George!\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nsuddenly he thought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose he were to resemble Limousin, after all!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at him with\r\nhaggard, troubled eyes, and tried to discover whether there was any\r\nlikeness in his forehead, in his nose, mouth, or cheeks. His thoughts\r\nwandered as they do when a person is going mad, and his child's face\r\nchanged in his eyes, and assumed a strange look and improbable\r\nresemblances.\r\n\r\nThe hall bell rang. Parent gave a bound as if a bullet had gone through\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cThere she is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d And he ran and locked\r\nhimself up in his room, to have time to bathe his eyes. But in a few\r\nmoments another ring at the bell made him jump again, and then he\r\nremembered that Julie had left, without the housemaid knowing it, and so\r\nnobody would go to open the door. What was he to do? He went himself,\r\nand suddenly he felt brave, resolute, ready for dissimulation and the\r\nstruggle. The terrible blow had matured him in a few moments. He wished\r\nto know the truth, he desired it with the rage of a timid man, and with\r\nthe tenacity of an easy-going man who has been exasperated.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he trembled. Does one know how much excited cowardice\r\nthere often is in boldness? He went to the door with furtive steps, and\r\nstopped to listen; his heart beat furiously. Suddenly, however, the\r\nnoise of the bell over his head startled him like an explosion. He\r\nseized the lock, turned the key, and opening the door, saw his wife and\r\nLimousin standing before him on the stairs.\r\n\r\nWith an air of astonishment, which also betrayed a little irritation,\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you open the door now? Where is Julie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis throat felt tight and his breathing was labored as he tried to.\r\nreply, without being able to utter a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you dumb?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked you where Julie is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x94has\xe2\x80\x94gone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he managed to stammer.\r\n\r\nHis wife began to get angry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by gone? Where has she\r\ngone? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy degrees he regained his coolness. He felt an intense hatred rise up\r\nin him for that insolent woman who was standing before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she has gone altogether. I sent her away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have sent away Julie? Why, you must be mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I sent her away because she was insolent, and because\xe2\x80\x94because she\r\nwas ill-using the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94Julie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was she insolent about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, because the dinner was burnt, and you did not come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said\xe2\x80\x94offensive things about you\xe2\x80\x94which I ought not\xe2\x80\x94which I could not\r\nlisten to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she, say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no good repeating them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to hear them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said it was unfortunate for a man like me to be married to a woman\r\nlike you, unpunctual, careless, disorderly, a bad mother, and a bad\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman had gone into the anteroom, followed by Limousin, who\r\ndid not say a word at this unexpected condition of things. She shut the\r\ndoor quickly, threw her cloak on a chair, and going straight up to her\r\nhusband, she stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say? You say? That I am\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery pale and calm, he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI say nothing, my dear. I am simply\r\nrepeating what Julie said to me, as you wanted to know what it was, and\r\nI wish you to remark that I turned her off just on account of what she\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe trembled with a violent longing to tear out his beard and scratch\r\nhis face. In his voice and manner she felt that he was asserting his\r\nposition as master. Although she had nothing to say by way of reply, she\r\ntried to assume the offensive by saying something unpleasant. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou have had dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I waited for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very stupid of you to\r\nwait after half-past seven,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have guessed that I\r\nwas detained, that I had a good many things to do, visits and shopping,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, she felt that she wanted to explain how she had\r\nspent her time, and told him in abrupt, haughty words that, having to\r\nbuy some furniture in a shop a long distance off, very far off, in the\r\nRue de Rennes, she had met Limousin at past seven o'clock on the\r\nBoulevard Saint-Germain, and that then she had gone with him to have\r\nsomething to eat in a restaurant, as she did not like to go to one by\r\nherself, although she was faint with hunger. That was how she had dined\r\nwith Limousin, if it could be called dining, for they had only some soup\r\nand half a chicken, as they were in a great hurry to get back.\r\n\r\nParent replied simply: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you were quite right. I am not finding\r\nfault with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Limousin, who, had not spoken till then, and who had been half\r\nhidden behind Henriette, came forward and put out his hand, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou very well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent took his hand, and shaking it gently, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the young woman had felt a reproach in her husband's last words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinding fault! Why do you speak of finding fault? One might think that\r\nyou meant to imply something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, by way of excuse. \xe2\x80\x9cI simply meant that I was\r\nnot at all anxious although you were late, and that I did not find fault\r\nwith you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe, however, took the high hand, and tried to find a pretext for a\r\nquarrel. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I was late? One might really think that it was one\r\no'clock in the morning, and that I spent my nights away from home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not, my dear. I said late because I could find no other word.\r\nYou said you should be back at half-past six, and you returned at half-\r\npast eight. That was surely being late. I understand it perfectly well.\r\nI am not at all surprised, even. But\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94I can hardly use any other\r\nword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you pronounce them as if I had been out all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no-oh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw that he would yield on every point, and she was going into her\r\nown room, when at last she noticed that George was screaming, and then\r\nshe asked, with some feeling: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with the child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you that Julie had been rather unkind to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has the wretch been doing to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh nothing much. She gave him a push, and he fell down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wanted to see her child, and ran into the dining room, but stopped\r\nshort at the sight of the table covered with spilt wine, with broken\r\ndecanters and glasses and overturned saltcellars. \xe2\x80\x9cWho did all that\r\nmischief?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Julie, who\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But she interrupted him furiously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is too much, really! Julie speaks of me as if I were a shameless\r\nwoman, beats my child, breaks my plates and dishes, turns my house\r\nupside down, and it appears that you think it all quite natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not, as I have got rid of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally! You have got rid of her! But you ought to have given her in\r\ncharge. In such cases, one ought to call in the Commissary of Police!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94my dear\xe2\x80\x94I really could not. There was no reason. It would have been\r\nvery difficult\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders disdainfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! you will never be\r\nanything but a poor, wretched fellow, a man without a will, without any\r\nfirmness or energy. Ah! she must have said some nice things to you, your\r\nJulie, to make you turn her off like that. I should like to have been\r\nhere for a minute, only for a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she opened the drawing-room\r\ndoor and ran to George, took him into her arms and kissed him, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorgie, what is it, my darling, my pretty one, my treasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly turning to another idea, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cBut the child has had\r\nno dinner? You have had nothing to eat, my pet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she again turned furiously upon her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you must be mad,\r\nutterly mad! It is half-past eight, and George has had no dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe excused himself as best he could, for he had nearly lost his wits\r\nthrough the overwhelming scene and the explanation, and felt crushed by\r\nthis ruin of his life. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, we were waiting for you, as I did\r\nnot wish to dine without you. As you come home late every day, I\r\nexpected you every moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw her bonnet, which she had kept on till then, into an easy-\r\nchair, and in an angry voice she said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is really intolerable to have\r\nto do with people who can understand nothing, who can divine nothing and\r\ndo nothing by themselves. So, I suppose, if I were to come in at twelve\r\no'clock at night, the child would have had nothing to eat? Just as if\r\nyou could not have understood that, as it was after half-past seven, I\r\nwas prevented from coming home, that I had met with some hindrance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent trembled, for he felt that his anger was getting the upper hand,\r\nbut Limousin interposed, and turning toward the young woman, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, you, are altogether unjust. Parent could not guess that\r\nyou would come here so late, as you never do so, and then, how could you\r\nexpect him to get over the difficulty all by himself, after having sent\r\naway Julie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Henriette was very angry, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at any rate, he must get over the difficulty himself, for I will\r\nnot help him,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him settle it!\xe2\x80\x9d And she went into her\r\nown room, quite forgetting that her child had not had anything to eat.\r\n\r\nLimousin immediately set to work to help his friend. He picked up the\r\nbroken glasses which strewed the table and took them out, replaced the\r\nplates and knives and forks, and put the child into his high chair,\r\nwhile Parent went to look for the chambermaid to wait at table. The girl\r\ncame in, in great astonishment, as she had heard nothing in George's\r\nroom, where she had been working. She soon, however, brought in the\r\nsoup, a burnt leg of mutton, and mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\nParent sat by the side of the child, very much upset and distressed at\r\nall that had happened. He gave the boy his dinner, and endeavored to eat\r\nsomething himself, but he could only swallow with an effort, as his\r\nthroat felt paralyzed. By degrees he was seized with an insane desire to\r\nlook at Limousin, who was sitting opposite to him, making bread pellets,\r\nto see whether George was like him, but he did not venture to raise his\r\neyes for some time. At last, however, he made up his mind to do so, and\r\ngave a quick, sharp look at the face which he knew so well, although he\r\nalmost fancied that he had never examined it carefully. It looked so\r\ndifferent to what he had imagined. From time to time he looked at\r\nLimousin, trying to recognize a likeness in the smallest lines of his\r\nface, in the slightest features, and then he looked at his son, under\r\nthe pretext of feeding him.\r\n\r\nTwo words were sounding in his ears: \xe2\x80\x9cHis father! his father! his\r\nfather!\xe2\x80\x9d They buzzed in his temples at every beat of his heart. Yes,\r\nthat man, that tranquil man who was sitting on the other side of the\r\ntable, was, perhaps, the father of his son, of George, of his little\r\nGeorge. Parent left off eating; he could not swallow any more. A\r\nterrible pain, one of those attacks of pain which make men scream, roll\r\non the ground, and bite the furniture, was tearing at his entrails, and\r\nhe felt inclined to take a knife and plunge it into his stomach. He\r\nstarted when he heard the door open. His wife came in. \xe2\x80\x9cI am hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said; \xe2\x80\x9care not you, Limousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a little, and then said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am, upon my word.\xe2\x80\x9d She had\r\nthe leg of mutton brought in again. Parent asked himself \xe2\x80\x9cHave they had\r\ndinner? Or are they late because they have had a lovers' meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both ate with a very good appetite. Henriette was very calm, but\r\nlaughed and joked. Her husband watched her furtively. She had on a pink\r\nteagown trimmed with white lace, and her fair head, her white neck and\r\nher plump hands stood out from that coquettish and perfumed dress as\r\nthough it were a sea shell edged with foam.\r\n\r\nWhat fun they must be making of him, if he had been their dupe since the\r\nfirst day! Was it possible to make a fool of a man, of a worthy man,\r\nbecause his father had left him a little money? Why could one not see\r\ninto people's souls? How was it that nothing revealed to upright hearts\r\nthe deceits of infamous hearts? How was it that voices had the same\r\nsound for adoring as for lying? Why was a false, deceptive look the same\r\nas a sincere one? And he watched them, waiting to catch a gesture, a\r\nword, an intonation. Then suddenly he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cI will surprise them\r\nthis evening,\xe2\x80\x9d and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, as I have dismissed Julie, I will see about getting another\r\ngirl this very day. I will go at once to procure one by to-morrow\r\nmorning, so I may not be in until late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cgo. I shall not stir from here. Limousin will\r\nkeep me company. We will wait for you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, turning to the maid, she\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better put George to bed, and then you can clear away and\r\ngo up to your room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent had got up; he was unsteady on his legs, dazed and bewildered,\r\nand saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you again later on,\xe2\x80\x9d he went out, holding on to\r\nthe wall, for the floor seemed to roll like a ship. George had been\r\ncarried out by his nurse, while Henriette and Limousin went into the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the door was shut, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be mad, surely, to\r\ntorment your husband as you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe immediately turned on him: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Do you know that I think the habit\r\nyou have got into lately, of looking upon Parent as a martyr, is very\r\nunpleasant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLimousin threw himself into an easy-chair and crossed his legs. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot setting him up as a martyr in the least, but I think that, situated\r\nas we are, it is ridiculous to defy this man as you do, from morning\r\ntill night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took a cigarette from the mantelpiece, lighted it, and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nI do not defy him; quite the contrary. Only he irritates me by his\r\nstupidity, and I treat him as he deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLimousin continued impatiently: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you are doing is very foolish! I\r\nam only asking you to treat your husband gently, because we both of us\r\nrequire him to trust us. I think that you ought to see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were close together: he, tall, dark, with long whiskers and the\r\nrather vulgar manners of a good-looking man who is very well satisfied\r\nwith himself; she, small, fair, and pink, a little Parisian, born in the\r\nback room of a shop, half cocotte and half bourgeoise, brought up to\r\nentice customers to the store by her glances, and married, in\r\nconsequence, to a simple, unsophisticated man, who saw her outside the\r\ndoor every morning when he went out and every evening when he came home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you not understand; you great booby,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I hate him\r\njust because he married me, because he bought me, in fact; because\r\neverything that he says and does, everything that he thinks, acts on my\r\nnerves? He exasperates me every moment by his stupidity, which you call\r\nhis kindness; by his dullness, which you call his confidence, and then,\r\nabove all, because he is my husband, instead of you. I feel him between\r\nus, although he does not interfere with us much. And then\xe2\x80\x94-and then! No,\r\nit is, after all, too idiotic of him not to guess anything! I wish he\r\nwould, at any rate, be a little jealous. There are moments when I feel\r\ninclined to say to him: 'Do you not see, you stupid creature, that Paul\r\nis my lover?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite incomprehensible that you cannot understand how hateful he\r\nis to me, how he irritates me. You always seem to like him, and you\r\nshake hands with him cordially. Men are very extraordinary at times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne must know how to dissimulate, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no question of dissimulation, but of feeling. One might think\r\nthat, when you men deceive one another, you like each other better on\r\nthat account, while we women hate a man from the moment that we have\r\nbetrayed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not see why one should hate an excellent fellow because one is\r\nfriendly with his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not see it? You do not see it? You all of you are wanting in\r\nrefinement of feeling. However, that is one of those things which one\r\nfeels and cannot express. And then, moreover, one ought not. No, you\r\nwould not understand; it is quite useless! You men have no delicacy of\r\nfeeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd smiling, with the gentle contempt of an impure woman, she put both\r\nher hands on his shoulders and held up her lips to him. He stooped down\r\nand clasped her closely in his arms, and their lips met. And as they\r\nstood in front of the mantel mirror, another couple exactly like them\r\nembraced behind the clock.\r\n\r\nThey had heard nothing, neither the noise of the key nor the creaking of\r\nthe door, but suddenly Henriette, with a loud cry, pushed Limousin away\r\nwith both her arms, and they saw Parent looking at them, livid with\r\nrage, without his shoes on and his hat over his forehead. He looked at\r\neach, one after the other, with a quick glance of his eyes and without\r\nmoving his head. He appeared beside himself. Then, without saying a\r\nword, he threw himself on Limousin, seized him as if he were going to\r\nstrangle him, and flung him into the opposite corner of the room so\r\nviolently that the other lost his balance, and, beating the air with his\r\nhand, struck his head violently against the wall.\r\n\r\nWhen Henriette saw that her husband was going to murder her lover, she\r\nthrew herself on Parent, seized him by the neck, and digging her ten\r\ndelicate, rosy fingers into his neck, she squeezed him so tightly, with\r\nall the vigor of a desperate woman, that the blood spurted out under her\r\nnails, and she bit his shoulder, as if she wished to tear it with her\r\nteeth. Parent, half-strangled and choking, loosened his hold on\r\nLimousin, in order to shake off his wife, who was hanging to his neck.\r\nPutting his arms round her waist, he flung her also to the other end of\r\nthe drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThen, as his passion was short-lived, like that of most good-tempered\r\nmen, and his strength was soon exhausted, he remained standing between\r\nthe two, panting, worn out, not knowing what to do next. His brutal fury\r\nhad expended itself in that effort, like the froth of a bottle of\r\nchampagne, and his unwonted energy ended in a gasping for breath. As\r\nsoon as he could speak, however, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away\xe2\x80\x94both of you\xe2\x80\x94immediately! Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLimousin remained motionless in his corner, against the wall, too\r\nstartled to understand anything as yet, too frightened to move a finger;\r\nwhile Henriette, with her hands resting on a small, round table, her\r\nhead bent forward, her hair hanging down, the bodice of her dress\r\nunfastened, waited like a wild animal which is about to spring. Parent\r\ncontinued in a stronger voice: \xe2\x80\x9cGo away immediately. Get out of the\r\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife, however, seeing that he had got over his first exasperation\r\ngrew bolder, drew herself up, took two steps toward him, and, grown\r\nalmost insolent, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you lost your head? What is the matter\r\nwith you? What is the meaning of this unjustifiable violence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he turned toward her, and raising his fist to strike her, he\r\nstammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94oh\xe2\x80\x94this is too much, too much! I heard everything!\r\nEverything\xe2\x80\x94do you understand? Everything! You wretch\xe2\x80\x94you wretch! You are\r\ntwo wretches! Get out of the house, both of you! Immediately, or I shall\r\nkill you! Leave the house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw that it was all over, and that he knew everything; that she\r\ncould not prove her innocence, and that she must comply. But all her\r\nimpudence had returned to her, and her hatred for the man, which was\r\naggravated now, drove her to audacity, made her feel the need of\r\nbravado, and of defying him, and she said in a clear voice: \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nLimousin; as he is going to turn me out of doors, I will go to your\r\nlodgings with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Limousin did not move, and Parent, in a fresh access of rage, cried\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x9cGo, will you? Go, you wretches! Or else\xe2\x80\x94or else\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He seized a\r\nchair and whirled it over his head.\r\n\r\nHenriette walked quickly across the room, took her lover by the arm,\r\ndragged him from the wall, to which he appeared fixed, and led him\r\ntoward the door, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cDo come, my friend\xe2\x80\x94you see that the man is\r\nmad. Do come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she went out she turned round to her husband, trying to think of\r\nsomething that she could do, something that she could invent to wound\r\nhim to the heart as she left the house, and an idea struck her, one of\r\nthose venomous, deadly ideas in which all a woman's perfidy shows\r\nitself, and she said resolutely: \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to take my child with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent was stupefied, and stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cYour\xe2\x80\x94your\xe2\x80\x94child? You dare to talk\r\nof your child? You venture\xe2\x80\x94you venture to ask for your child\xe2\x80\x94after-\r\nafter\xe2\x80\x94Oh, oh, that is too much! Go, you vile creature! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went up to him again, almost smiling, almost avenged already, and\r\ndefying him, standing close to him, and face to face, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI want\r\nmy child, and you have no right to keep him, because he is not yours\xe2\x80\x94do\r\nyou understand? He is not yours! He is Limousin's!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Parent cried out in bewilderment: \xe2\x80\x9cYou lie\xe2\x80\x94you lie\xe2\x80\x94worthless woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cYou fool! Everybody knows it except you. I tell you,\r\nthis is his father. You need only look at him to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent staggered backward, and then he suddenly turned round, took a\r\ncandle, and rushed into the next room; returning almost immediately,\r\ncarrying little George wrapped up in his bedclothes. The child, who had\r\nbeen suddenly awakened, was crying from fright. Parent threw him into\r\nhis wife's arms, and then, without speaking, he pushed her roughly out\r\ntoward the stairs, where Limousin was waiting, from motives of prudence.\r\n\r\nThen he shut the door again, double-locked and bolted it, but had\r\nscarcely got back into the drawing-room when he fell to the floor at\r\nfull length.\r\n\r\nParent lived alone, quite alone. During the five weeks that followed\r\ntheir separation, the feeling of surprise at his new life prevented him\r\nfrom thinking much. He had resumed his bachelor life, his habits of\r\nlounging, about, and took his meals at a restaurant, as he had done\r\nformerly. As he wished to avoid any scandal, he made his wife an\r\nallowance, which was arranged by their lawyers. By degrees, however, the\r\nthought of the child began to haunt him. Often, when he was at home\r\nalone at night, he suddenly thought he heard George calling out \xe2\x80\x9cPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand his heart would begin to beat, and he would get up quickly and open\r\nthe door, to see whether, by chance, the child might have returned, as\r\ndogs or pigeons do. Why should a child have less instinct than an\r\nanimal? On finding that he was mistaken, he would sit down in his\r\narmchair again and think of the boy. He would think of him for hours and\r\nwhole days. It was not only a moral, but still more a physical\r\nobsession, a nervous longing to kiss him, to hold and fondle him, to\r\ntake him on his knees and dance him. He felt the child's little arms\r\naround his neck, his little mouth pressing a kiss on his beard, his soft\r\nhair tickling his cheeks, and the remembrance of all those childish ways\r\nmade him suffer as a man might for some beloved woman who has left him.\r\nTwenty or a hundred times a day he asked himself the question whether he\r\nwas or was not George's father, and almost before he was in bed every\r\nnight he recommenced the same series of despairing questionings.\r\n\r\nHe especially dreaded the darkness of the evening, the melancholy\r\nfeeling of the twilight. Then a flood of sorrow invaded his heart, a\r\ntorrent of despair which seemed to overwhelm him and drive him mad. He\r\nwas as afraid of his own thoughts as men are of criminals, and he fled\r\nbefore them as one does from wild beasts. Above all things, he feared\r\nhis empty, dark, horrible dwelling and the deserted streets, in which,\r\nhere and there, a gas lamp flickered, where the isolated foot passenger\r\nwhom one hears in the distance seems to be a night prowler, and makes\r\none walk faster or slower, according to whether he is coming toward you\r\nor following you.\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of himself, and by instinct, Parent went in the direction\r\nof the broad, well-lighted, populous streets. The light and the crowd\r\nattracted him, occupied his mind and distracted his thoughts, and when\r\nhe was tired of walking aimlessly about among the moving crowd, when he\r\nsaw the foot passengers becoming more scarce and the pavements less\r\ncrowded, the fear of solitude and silence drove him into some large cafe\r\nfull of drinkers and of light. He went there as flies go to a candle,\r\nand he would sit down at one of the little round tables and ask for a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbock,\xe2\x80\x9d which he would drink slowly, feeling uneasy every time a\r\ncustomer got up to go. He would have liked to take him by the arm, hold\r\nhim back, and beg him to stay a little longer, so much did he dread the\r\ntime when the waiter should come up to him and say sharply: \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nmonsieur, it is closing time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thus got into the habit of going to the beer houses, where the\r\ncontinual elbowing of the drinkers brings you in contact with a familiar\r\nand silent public, where the heavy clouds of tobacco smoke lull\r\ndisquietude, while the heavy beer dulls the mind and calms the heart. He\r\nalmost lived there. He was scarcely up before he went there to find\r\npeople to distract his glances and his thoughts, and soon, as he felt\r\ntoo lazy to move, he took his meals there.\r\n\r\nAfter every meal, during more than an hour, he sipped three or four\r\nsmall glasses of brandy, which stupefied him by degrees, and then his\r\nhead drooped on his chest, he shut his eyes, and went to sleep. Then,\r\nawaking, he raised himself on the red velvet seat, straightened his\r\nwaistcoat, pulled down his cuffs, and took up the newspapers again,\r\nthough he had already seen them in the morning, and read them all\r\nthrough again, from beginning to end. Between four and five o'clock he\r\nwent for a walk on the boulevards, to get a little fresh air, as he used\r\nto say, and then came back to the seat which had been reserved for him,\r\nand asked for his absinthe. He would talk to the regular customers whose\r\nacquaintance he had made. They discussed the news of the day and\r\npolitical events, and that carried him on till dinner time; and he spent\r\nthe evening as he had the afternoon, until it was time to close. That\r\nwas a terrible moment for him when he was obliged to go out into the\r\ndark, into his empty room full of dreadful recollections, of horrible\r\nthoughts, and of mental agony. He no longer saw any of his old friends,\r\nnone of his relatives, nobody who might remind him of his past life. But\r\nas his apartments were a hell to him, he took a room in a large hotel, a\r\ngood room on the ground floor, so as to see the passers-by. He was no\r\nlonger alone in that great building. He felt people swarming round him,\r\nhe heard voices in the adjoining rooms, and when his former sufferings\r\ntormented him too much at the sight of his bed, which was turned down,\r\nand of his solitary fireplace, he went out into the wide passages and\r\nwalked up and down them like a sentinel, before all the closed doors,\r\nand looked sadly at the shoes standing in couples outside them, women's\r\nlittle boots by the side of men's thick ones, and he thought that, no\r\ndoubt, all these people were happy, and were sleeping in their warm\r\nbeds. Five years passed thus; five miserable years. But one day, when he\r\nwas taking his usual walk between the Madeleine and the Rue Drouot, he\r\nsuddenly saw a lady whose bearing struck him. A tall gentleman and a\r\nchild were with her, and all three were walking in front of him. He\r\nasked himself where he had seen them before, when suddenly he recognized\r\na movement of her hand; it was his wife, his wife with Limousin and his\r\nchild, his little George.\r\n\r\nHis heart beat as if it would suffocate him, but he did not stop, for he\r\nwished to see them, and he followed them. They looked like a family of\r\nthe better middle class. Henriette was leaning on Paul's arm, and\r\nspeaking to him in a low voice, and looking at him sideways\r\noccasionally. Parent got a side view of her and recognized her pretty\r\nfeatures, the movements of her lips, her smile, and her coaxing glances.\r\nBut the child chiefly took up his attention. How tall and strong he was!\r\nParent could not see his face, but only his long, fair curls. That tall\r\nboy with bare legs, who was walking by his mother's side like a little\r\nman, was George. He saw them suddenly, all three, as they stopped in\r\nfront of a shop. Limousin had grown very gray, had aged and was thinner;\r\nhis wife, on the contrary, was as young looking as ever, and had grown\r\nstouter. George he would not have recognized, he was so different from\r\nwhat he had been formerly.\r\n\r\nThey went on again and Parent followed them. He walked on quickly,\r\npassed them, and then turned round, so as to meet them face to face. As\r\nhe passed the child he felt a mad longing to take him into his arms and\r\nrun off with him, and he knocked against him as if by accident. The boy\r\nturned round and looked at the clumsy man angrily, and Parent hurried\r\naway, shocked, hurt, and pursued by that look. He went off like a thief,\r\nseized with a horrible fear lest he should have been seen and recognized\r\nby his wife and her lover. He went to his cafe without stopping, and\r\nfell breathless into his chair. That evening he drank three absinthes.\r\nFor four months he felt the pain of that meeting in his heart. Every\r\nnight he saw the three again, happy and tranquil, father, mother, and\r\nchild walking on the boulevard before going in to dinner, and that new\r\nvision effaced the old one. It was another matter, another hallucination\r\nnow, and also a fresh pain. Little George, his little George, the child\r\nhe had so much loved and so often kissed, disappeared in the far\r\ndistance, and he saw a new one, like a brother of the first, a little\r\nboy with bare legs, who did not know him! He suffered terribly at that\r\nthought. The child's love was dead; there was no bond between them; the\r\nchild would not have held out his arms when he saw him. He had even\r\nlooked at him angrily.\r\n\r\nThen, by degrees he grew calmer, his mental torture diminished, the\r\nimage that had appeared to his eyes and which haunted his nights became\r\nmore indistinct and less frequent. He began once more to live nearly\r\nlike everybody else, like all those idle people who drink beer off\r\nmarble-topped tables and wear out their clothes on the threadbare velvet\r\nof the couches.\r\n\r\nHe grew old amid the smoke from pipes, lost his hair under the gas\r\nlights, looked upon his weekly bath, on his fortnightly visit to the\r\nbarber's to have his hair cut, and on the purchase of a new coat or hat\r\nas an event. When he got to his cafe in a new hat he would look at\r\nhimself in the glass for a long time before sitting down, and take it\r\noff and put it on again several times, and at last ask his friend, the\r\nlady at the bar, who was watching him with interest, whether she thought\r\nit suited him.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times a year he went to the theatre, and in the summer he\r\nsometimes spent his evenings at one of the open-air concerts in the\r\nChamps Elysees. And so the years followed each other slow, monotonous,\r\nand short, because they were quite uneventful.\r\n\r\nHe very rarely now thought of the dreadful drama which had wrecked his\r\nlife; for twenty years had passed since that terrible evening. But the\r\nlife he had led since then had worn him out. The landlord of his cafe\r\nwould often say to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to pull yourself together a little,\r\nMonsieur Parent; you should get some fresh air and go into the country.\r\nI assure you that you have changed very much within the last few\r\nmonths.\xe2\x80\x9d And when his customer had gone out be used to say to the\r\nbarmaid: \xe2\x80\x9cThat poor Monsieur Parent is booked for another world; it is\r\nbad never to get out of Paris. Advise him to go out of town for a day\r\noccasionally; he has confidence in you. Summer will soon be here; that\r\nwill put him straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she, full of pity and kindness for such a regular customer, said to\r\nParent every day: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, monsieur, make up your mind to get a little\r\nfresh air. It is so charming in the country when the weather is fine.\r\nOh, if I could, I would spend my life there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy degrees he was seized with a vague desire to go just once and see\r\nwhether it was really as pleasant there as she said, outside the walls\r\nof the great city. One morning he said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where one can get a good luncheon in the neighborhood of\r\nParis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the Terrace at Saint-Germain; it is delightful there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been there formerly, just when he became engaged. He made up his\r\nmind to go there again, and he chose a Sunday, for no special reason,\r\nbut merely because people generally do go out on Sundays, even when they\r\nhave nothing to do all the week; and so one Sunday morning he went to\r\nSaint-Germain. He felt low-spirited and vexed at having yielded to that\r\nnew longing, and at having broken through his usual habits. He was\r\nthirsty; he would have liked to get out at every station and sit down in\r\nthe cafe which he saw outside and drink a \xe2\x80\x9cbock\xe2\x80\x9d or two, and then take\r\nthe first train back to Paris. The journey seemed very long to him. He\r\ncould remain sitting for whole days, as long as he had the same\r\nmotionless objects before his eyes, but he found it very trying and\r\nfatiguing to remain sitting while he was being whirled along, and to see\r\nthe whole country fly by, while he himself was motionless.\r\n\r\nHowever, he found the Seine interesting every time he crossed it. Under\r\nthe bridge at Chatou he saw some small boats going at great speed under\r\nthe vigorous strokes of the bare-armed oarsmen, and he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nare some fellows who are certainly enjoying themselves!\xe2\x80\x9d The train\r\nentered the tunnel just before you get to the station at Saint-Germain,\r\nand presently stopped at the platform. Parent got out, and walked\r\nslowly, for he already felt tired, toward the Terrace, with his hands\r\nbehind his back, and when he got to the iron balustrade, stopped to look\r\nat the distant horizon. The immense plain spread out before him vast as\r\nthe sea, green and studded with large villages, almost as populous as\r\ntowns. The sun bathed the whole landscape in its full, warm light. The\r\nSeine wound like an endless serpent through the plain, flowed round the\r\nvillages and along the slopes. Parent inhaled the warm breeze, which\r\nseemed to make his heart young again, to enliven his spirits, and to\r\nvivify his blood, and said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is delightful here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went on a few steps, and stopped again to look about him. The\r\nutter misery of his existence seemed to be brought into full relief by\r\nthe intense light which inundated the landscape. He saw his twenty years\r\nof cafe life\xe2\x80\x94dull, monotonous, heartbreaking. He might have traveled as\r\nothers did, have gone among foreigners, to unknown countries beyond the\r\nsea, have interested himself somewhat in everything which other men are\r\npassionately devoted to, in arts and science; he might have enjoyed life\r\nin a thousand forms, that mysterious life which is either charming or\r\npainful, constantly changing, always inexplicable and strange. Now,\r\nhowever, it was too late. He would go on drinking \xe2\x80\x9cbock\xe2\x80\x9d after \xe2\x80\x9cbock\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nuntil he died, without any family, without friends, without hope,\r\nwithout any curiosity about anything, and he was seized with a feeling\r\nof misery and a wish to run away, to hide himself in Paris, in his cafe\r\nand his lethargy! All the thoughts, all the dreams, all the desires\r\nwhich are dormant in the slough of stagnating hearts had reawakened,\r\nbrought to life by those rays of sunlight on the plain.\r\n\r\nParent felt that if he were to remain there any longer he should lose\r\nhis reason, and he made haste to get to the Pavilion Henri IV for lunch,\r\nto try and forget his troubles under\xe2\x80\x94the influence of wine and alcohol,\r\nand at any rate to have some one to speak to.\r\n\r\nHe took a small table in one of the arbors, from which one can see all\r\nthe surrounding country, ordered his lunch, and asked to be served at\r\nonce. Then some more people arrived and sat down at tables near him. He\r\nfelt more comfortable; he was no longer alone. Three persons were eating\r\nluncheon near him. He looked at them two or three times without seeing\r\nthem clearly, as one looks at total strangers. Suddenly a woman's voice\r\nsent a shiver through him which seemed to penetrate to his very marrow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you carve the chicken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd another voice replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nParent looked up, and he understood; he guessed immediately who those\r\npeople were! He should certainly not have known them again. His wife had\r\ngrown quite white and very stout, an elderly, serious, respectable lady,\r\nand she held her head forward as she ate for fear of spotting her dress,\r\nalthough she had a table napkin tucked under her chin. George had become\r\na man. He had a slight beard, that uneven and almost colorless beard\r\nwhich adorns the cheeks of youths. He wore a high hat, a white\r\nwaistcoat, and a monocle, because it looked swell, no doubt. Parent\r\nlooked at him in astonishment. Was that George, his son? No, he did not\r\nknow that young man; there could be nothing in common between them.\r\nLimousin had his back to him, and was eating; with his shoulders rather\r\nbent.\r\n\r\nAll three of them seemed happy and satisfied; they came and took\r\nluncheon in the country at well-known restaurants. They had had a calm\r\nand pleasant existence, a family existence in a warm and comfortable\r\nhouse, filled with all those trifles which make life agreeable, with\r\naffection, with all those tender words which people exchange continually\r\nwhen they love each other. They had lived thus, thanks to him, Parent,\r\non his money, after having deceived him, robbed him, ruined him! They\r\nhad condemned him, the innocent, simple-minded, jovial man, to all the\r\nmiseries of solitude, to that abominable life which he had led, between\r\nthe pavement and a bar-room, to every mental torture and every physical\r\nmisery! They had made him a useless, aimless being, a waif in the world,\r\na poor old man without any pleasures, any prospects, expecting nothing\r\nfrom anybody or anything. For him, the world was empty, because he loved\r\nnothing in the world. He might go among other nations, or go about the\r\nstreets, go into all the houses in Paris, open every room, but he would\r\nnot find inside any door the beloved face, the face of wife or child\r\nwhich smiles when it sees you. This idea worked upon him more than any\r\nother, the idea of a door which one opens, to see and to embrace\r\nsomebody behind it.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the fault of those three wretches! The fault of that\r\nworthless woman, of that infamous friend, and of that tall, light-haired\r\nlad who put on insolent airs. Now he felt as angry with the child as he\r\ndid with the other two. Was he not Limousin's son? Would Limousin have\r\nkept him and loved him otherwise? Would not Limousin very quickly have\r\ngot rid of the mother and of the child if he had not felt sure that it\r\nwas his, positively his? Does anybody bring up other people's children?\r\nAnd now they were there, quite close to him, those three who had made\r\nhim suffer so much.\r\n\r\nParent looked at them, irritated and excited at the recollection of all\r\nhis sufferings and of his despair, and was especially exasperated at\r\ntheir placid and satisfied looks. He felt inclined to kill them, to\r\nthrow his siphon of Seltzer water at them, to split open Limousin's head\r\nas he every moment bent it over his plate, raising it again immediately.\r\n\r\nHe would have his revenge now, on the spot, as he had them under his\r\nhand. But how? He tried to think of some means, he pictured such\r\ndreadful things as one reads of in the newspapers occasionally, but\r\ncould not hit on anything practical. And he went on drinking to excite\r\nhimself, to give himself courage not to allow such an opportunity to\r\nescape him, as he might never have another.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an idea struck him, a terrible idea; and he left off drinking\r\nto mature it. He smiled as he murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cI have them, I have them! We\r\nwill see; we will see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey finished their luncheon slowly, conversing with perfect unconcern.\r\nParent could not hear what they were saying, but he saw their quiet\r\ngestures. His wife's face especially exasperated him. She had assumed a\r\nhaughty air, the air of a comfortable, devout woman, of an\r\nunapproachable, devout woman, sheathed in principles, iron-clad in\r\nvirtue. They paid their bill and got up from table. Parent then noticed\r\nLimousin. He might have been taken for a retired diplomat, for he looked\r\na man of great importance, with his soft white whiskers, the tips of\r\nwhich touched his coat collar.\r\n\r\nThey walked away. Parent rose and followed them. First they went up and\r\ndown the terrace, and calmly admired the landscape, and then they went\r\ninto the forest. Parent followed them at a distance, hiding himself so\r\nas not to excite their suspicion too soon.\r\n\r\nParent came up to them by degrees, breathing hard with emotion and\r\nfatigue, for he was unused to walking now. He soon came up to them, but\r\nwas seized with fear, an inexplicable fear, and he passed them, so as to\r\nturn round and meet them face to face. He walked on, his heart beating,\r\nfeeling that they were just behind him now, and he said to himself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now is the time. Courage! courage! Now is the moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round. They were all three sitting on the grass, at the foot\r\nof a huge tree, and were still chatting. He made up his mind, and walked\r\nback rapidly; stopping in front of them in the middle of the road, he\r\nsaid abruptly, in a voice broken by emotion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I! Here I am! I suppose you did not expect me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all three stared at this man, who seemed to be insane. He\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would suppose that you did not know me again. Just look at me! I am\r\nParent, Henri Parent. You thought it was all over, and that you would\r\nnever see me again. Ah! but here I am once more, you see, and now we\r\nwill have an explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenriette, terrified, hid her face in her hands, murmuring: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Good\r\nheavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing this stranger, who seemed to be threatening his mother, George\r\nsprang up, ready to seize him by the collar. Limousin, thunderstruck,\r\nlooked in horror at this apparition, who, after gasping for breath,\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo now we will have an explanation; the proper moment has come! Ah! you\r\ndeceived me, you condemned me to the life of a convict, and you thought\r\nthat I should never catch you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man took him by the shoulders and pushed him back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want? Go on your way immediately,\r\nor I shall give you a thrashing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Parent. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you who these people\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge, however, was in a rage, and shook him; and was even going to\r\nstrike him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Parent. \xe2\x80\x9cI am your father. There, see whether they\r\nrecognize me now, the wretches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man, thunderstruck, unclenched his fists and turned toward his\r\nmother. Parent, as soon as he was released, approached her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctell him yourself who I am! Tell him that my name is\r\nHenri Parent, that I am his father because his name is George Parent,\r\nbecause you are my wife, because you are all three living on my money,\r\non the allowance of ten thousand francs which I have made you since I\r\ndrove you out of my house. Will you tell him also why I drove you out?\r\nBecause I surprised you with this beggar, this wretch, your lover! Tell\r\nhim what I was, an honorable man, whom you married for money, and whom\r\nyou deceived from the very first day. Tell him who you are, and who I\r\nam\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stammered and gasped for breath in his rage. The woman exclaimed in a\r\nheartrending voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaul, Paul, stop him; make him be quiet! Do not let him say this before\r\nmy son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLimousin had also risen to his feet. He said in a very low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cHold\r\nyour tongue! Hold your tongue! Do you understand what you are doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite know what I am doing,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Parent, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is not all.\r\nThere is one thing that I will know, something that has tormented me for\r\ntwenty years.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, turning to George, who was leaning against a tree\r\nin consternation, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me. When she left my house she thought it was not enough to\r\nhave deceived me, but she also wanted to drive me to despair. You were\r\nmy only consolation, and she took you with her, swearing that I was not\r\nyour father, but, that he was your father. Was she lying? I do not know.\r\nI have been asking myself the question for the last twenty years.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwent close up to her, tragic and terrible, and, pulling away her hands,\r\nwith which she had covered her face, he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now! I call upon you to tell me which of us two is the father of\r\nthis young man; he or I, your husband or your lover. Come! Come! tell\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLimousin rushed at him. Parent pushed him back, and, sneering in his\r\nfury, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are brave now! You are braver than you were that\r\nday when you ran downstairs because you thought I was going to murder\r\nyou. Very well! If she will not reply, tell me yourself. You ought to\r\nknow as well as she. Tell me, are you this young fellow's father? Come!\r\nCome! Tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to his wife again. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will not tell me, at any rate tell\r\nyour son. He is a man, now, and he has the right to know who his father\r\nis. I do not know, and I never did know, never, never! I cannot tell\r\nyou, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be losing his senses; his voice grew shrill and he worked\r\nhis arms about as if he had an epileptic 'fit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! . . . Give me an answer. She does not know . . . I will make a\r\nbet that she does not know . . . No . . . she does not know, by Jove!\r\nHa! ha! ha! Nobody knows . . . nobody . . . How can one know such\r\nthings?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not know either, my boy, you will not know any more than I do\r\n. . . never. . . . Look here . . . Ask her you will find that she does\r\nnot know . . . I do not know either . . . nor does he, nor do you,\r\nnobody knows. You can choose . . . You can choose . . . yes, you can\r\nchoose him or me. . . Choose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening . . . It is all over. If she makes up her mind to tell\r\nyou, you will come and let me know, will you not? I am living at the\r\nHotel des Continents . . . I should be glad to know . . . Good evening .\r\n. . I hope you will enjoy yourselves very much . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went away gesticulating, talking to himself under the tall trees,\r\nin the quiet, the cool air, which was full of the fragrance of growing\r\nplants. He did not turn round to look at them, but went straight on,\r\nwalking under the stimulus of his rage, under a storm of passion, with\r\nthat one fixed idea in his mind. All at once he found himself outside\r\nthe station. A train was about to start and he got in. During the\r\njourney his anger calmed down, he regained his senses and returned to\r\nParis, astonished at his own boldness, full of aches and pains as if he\r\nhad broken some bones. Nevertheless, he went to have a \xe2\x80\x9cbock\xe2\x80\x9d at his\r\nbrewery.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw him come in, Mademoiselle Zoe asked in surprise: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\r\nback already? are you tired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes, I am tired . . . very tired . . . You know, when one is not\r\nused to going out. . . I've had enough of it. I shall not go into the\r\ncountry again. It would have been better to have stayed here. For the\r\nfuture, I shall not stir out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not persuade him to tell her about his little excursion, much\r\nas she wished to.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life he got thoroughly drunk that night, and\r\nhad to be carried home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN HORTENSE\r\n\r\nIn Argenteuil she was called Queen Hortense. No one knew why. Perhaps it\r\nwas because she had a commanding tone of voice; perhaps because she was\r\ntall, bony, imperious; perhaps because she governed a kingdom of\r\nservants, chickens, dogs, cats, canaries, parrots, all so dear to an old\r\nmaid's heart. But she did not spoil these familiar friends; she had for\r\nthem none of those endearing names, none of the foolish tenderness which\r\nwomen seem to lavish on the soft fur of a purring cat. She governed\r\nthese beasts with authority; she reigned.\r\n\r\nShe was indeed an old maid\xe2\x80\x94one of those old maids with a harsh voice and\r\nangular motions, whose very soul seems to be hard. She never would stand\r\ncontradiction, argument, hesitation, indifference, laziness nor fatigue.\r\nShe had never been heard to complain, to regret anything, to envy\r\nanyone. She would say: \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has his share,\xe2\x80\x9d with the conviction of\r\na fatalist. She did not go to church, she had no use for priests, she\r\nhardly believed in God, calling all religious things \xe2\x80\x9cweeper's wares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor thirty years she had lived in her little house, with its tiny garden\r\nrunning along the street; she had never changed her habits, only\r\nchanging her servants pitilessly, as soon as they reached twenty-one\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nWhen her dogs, cats and birds would die of old age, or from an accident,\r\nshe would replace them without tears and without regret; with a little\r\nspade she would bury the dead animal in a strip of ground, throwing a\r\nfew shovelfuls of earth over it and stamping it down with her feet in an\r\nindifferent manner.\r\n\r\nShe had a few friends in town, families of clerks who went to Paris\r\nevery day. Once in a while she would be invited out, in the evening, to\r\ntea. She would inevitably fall asleep, and she would have to be\r\nawakened, when it was time for her to go home. She never allowed anyone\r\nto accompany her, fearing neither light nor darkness. She did not appear\r\nto like children.\r\n\r\nShe kept herself busy doing countless masculine tasks\xe2\x80\x94carpentering,\r\ngardening, sawing or chopping wood, even laying bricks when it was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nShe had relatives who came to see her twice a year, the Cimmes and the\r\nColombels, her two sisters having married, one of them a florist and the\r\nother a retired merchant. The Cimmes had no children; the Colombels had\r\nthree: Henri, Pauline and Joseph. Henri was twenty, Pauline seventeen\r\nand Joseph only three.\r\n\r\nThere was no love lost between the old maid and her relatives.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1882 Queen Hortense suddenly fell sick. The\r\nneighbors called in a physician, whom she immediately drove out. A\r\npriest then having presented himself, she jumped out of bed, in order to\r\nthrow him out of the house.\r\n\r\nThe young servant, in despair, was brewing her some tea.\r\n\r\nAfter lying in bed for three days the situation appeared so serious that\r\nthe barrel-maker, who lived next door, to the right, acting on advice\r\nfrom the doctor, who had forcibly returned to the house, took it upon\r\nhimself to call together the two families.\r\n\r\nThey arrived by the same train, towards ten in the morning, the\r\nColombels bringing little Joseph with them.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the garden gate, they saw the servant seated in the\r\nchair against the wall, crying.\r\n\r\nThe dog was sleeping on the door mat in the broiling sun; two cats,\r\nwhich looked as though they might be dead, were stretched out in front\r\nof the two windows, their eyes closed, their paws and tails stretched\r\nout at full length.\r\n\r\nA big clucking hen was parading through the garden with a whole regiment\r\nof yellow, downy chicks, and a big cage hanging from the wall and\r\ncovered with pimpernel, contained a population of birds which were\r\nchirping away in the warmth of this beautiful spring morning.\r\n\r\nIn another cage, shaped like a chalet, two lovebirds sat motionless side\r\nby side on their perch.\r\n\r\nM. Cimme, a fat, puffing person, who always entered first everywhere,\r\npushing aside everyone else, whether man or woman, when it was\r\nnecessary, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Celeste, aren't things going well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little servant moaned through her tears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn't even recognize me any more. The doctor says it's the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody looked around.\r\n\r\nMme. Cimme and Mme. Colombel immediately embraced each other, without\r\nsaying a word. They looked very much alike, having always worn their\r\nhair in Madonna bands, and loud red French cashmere shawls.\r\n\r\nCimme turned to his brother-in-law, a pale, sallow-complexioned, thin\r\nman, wasted by stomach complaints, who limped badly, and said in a\r\nserious tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad! It was high time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no one dared to enter the dying woman's room on the ground floor.\r\nEven Cimme made way for the others. Colombel was the first to make up\r\nhis mind, and, swaying from side to side like the mast of a ship, the\r\niron ferule of his cane clattering on the paved hall, he entered.\r\n\r\nThe two women were the next to venture, and M. Cimmes closed the\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nLittle Joseph had remained outside, pleased at the sight of the dog.\r\n\r\nA ray of sunlight seemed to cut the bed in two, shining just on the\r\nhands, which were moving nervously, continually opening and closing. The\r\nfingers were twitching as though moved by some thought, as though trying\r\nto point out a meaning or idea, as though obeying the dictates of a\r\nwill. The rest of the body lay motionless under the sheets. The angular\r\nframe showed not a single movement. The eyes remained closed.\r\n\r\nThe family spread out in a semi-circle and, without a word, they began\r\nto watch the contracted chest and the short, gasping breathing. The\r\nlittle servant had followed them and was still crying.\r\n\r\nAt last Cimme asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly what did the doctor say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said to leave her alone, that nothing more could be done for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the old woman's lips began to move. She seemed to be\r\nuttering silent words, words hidden in the brain of this dying being,\r\nand her hands quickened their peculiar movements.\r\n\r\nThen she began to speak in a thin, high voice, which no one had ever\r\nheard, a voice which seemed to come from the distance, perhaps from the\r\ndepths of this heart which had always been closed.\r\n\r\nCimme, finding this scene painful, walked away on tiptoe. Colombel,\r\nwhose crippled leg was growing tired, sat down.\r\n\r\nThe two women remained standing.\r\n\r\nQueen Hortense was now babbling away, and no one could understand a\r\nword. She was pronouncing names, many names, tenderly calling imaginary\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Philippe, kiss your mother. Tell me, child, do you love your\r\nmamma? You, Rose, take care of your little sister while I am away. And\r\ndon't leave her alone. Don't play with matches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped for a while, then, in a louder voice, as though she were\r\ncalling someone: \xe2\x80\x9cHenriette!\xe2\x80\x9d then waited a moment and continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your father that I wish to speak to him before he goes to\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d And suddenly: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not feeling very well to-day, darling;\r\npromise not to come home late. Tell your employer that I am sick. You\r\nknow, it isn't safe to leave the children alone when I am in bed. For\r\ndinner I will fix you up a nice dish of rice. The little ones like that\r\nvery much. Won't Claire be happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she broke into a happy, joyous laugh, such as they had never heard:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Jean, how funny he looks! He has smeared jam all over his face,\r\nthe little pig! Look, sweetheart, look; isn't he funny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColombel, who was continually lifting his tired leg from place to place,\r\nmuttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is dreaming that she has children and a husband; it is the\r\nbeginning of the death agony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two sisters had not yet moved, surprised, astounded.\r\n\r\nThe little maid exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must take off your shawls and your hats! Would you like to go into\r\nthe parlor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went out without having said a word. And Colombel followed them,\r\nlimping, once more leaving the dying woman alone.\r\n\r\nWhen they were relieved of their travelling garments, the women finally\r\nsat down. Then one of the cats left its window, stretched, jumped into\r\nthe room and on to Mme. Cimme's knees. She began to pet it.\r\n\r\nIn the next room could be heard the voice of the dying woman, living, in\r\nthis last hour, the life for which she had doubtless hoped, living her\r\ndreams themselves just when all was over for her.\r\n\r\nCimme, in the garden, was playing with little Joseph and the dog,\r\nenjoying himself in the whole hearted manner of a countryman, having\r\ncompletely forgotten the dying woman.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he entered the house and said to the girl:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, my girl, are we not going to have luncheon? What do you ladies\r\nwish to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey finally agreed on an omelet, a piece of steak with new potatoes,\r\ncheese and coffee.\r\n\r\nAs Mme. Colombel was fumbling in her pocket for her purse, Cimme stopped\r\nher, and, turning to the maid: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's enough. Hustle, my girl, because I am beginning to get very\r\nhungry:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Cimme, looking out over the climbing vines bathed in sunlight, and\r\nat the two turtle-doves on the roof opposite, said in an annoyed tone of\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity to have had to come for such a sad occasion. It is so nice\r\nin the country to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sister sighed without answering, and Colombel mumbled, thinking\r\nperhaps of the walk ahead of him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy leg certainly is bothering me to-day:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Joseph and the dog were making a terrible noise; one was\r\nshrieking with pleasure, the other was barking wildly. They were playing\r\nhide-and-seek around the three flower beds, running after each other\r\nlike mad.\r\n\r\nThe dying woman continued to call her children, talking with each one,\r\nimagining that she was dressing them, fondling them, teaching them how\r\nto read: \xe2\x80\x9cCome on! Simon repeat: A, B, C, D. You are not paying\r\nattention, listen\xe2\x80\x94D, D, D; do you hear me? Now repeat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCimme exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cFunny what people say when in that condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Colombel then asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn't it be better if we were to return to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Cimme dissuaded her from the idea:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the use? You can't change anything. We are just as comfortable\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody insisted. Mme. Cimme observed the two green birds called love-\r\nbirds. In a few words she praised this singular faithfulness and blamed\r\nthe men for not imitating these animals. Cimme began to laugh, looked at\r\nhis wife and hummed in a teasing way: \xe2\x80\x9cTra-la-la, tra-la-la\xe2\x80\x9d as though\r\nto cast a good deal of doubt on his own, Cimme's, faithfulness:\r\n\r\nColombel was suffering from cramps and was rapping the floor with his\r\ncane.\r\n\r\nThe other cat, its tail pointing upright to the sky, now came in.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to luncheon at one o'clock.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had tasted the wine, Colombel, for whom only the best of\r\nBordeaux had been prescribed, called the servant back:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, my girl, is this the best stuff that you have in the cellar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur; there is some better wine, which was only brought out\r\nwhen you came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, bring us three bottles of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey tasted the wine and found it excellent, not because it was of a\r\nremarkable vintage, but because it had been in the cellar fifteen years.\r\nCimme declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is regular invalid's wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColombel, filled with an ardent desire to gain possession of this\r\nBordeaux, once more questioned the girl:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much of it is left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Almost all, monsieur; mamz'elle never touched it. It's in the\r\nbottom stack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he turned to his brother-in-law:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish, Cimme, I would be willing to exchange something else for\r\nthis wine; it suits my stomach marvellously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chicken had now appeared with its regiment of young ones. The two\r\nwomen were enjoying themselves throwing crumbs to them.\r\n\r\nJoseph and the dog, who had eaten enough, were sent back to the garden.\r\n\r\nQueen Hortense was still talking, but in a low, hushed voice, so that\r\nthe words could no longer be distinguished.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished their coffee all went in to observe the condition\r\nof the sick woman. She seemed calm.\r\n\r\nThey went outside again and seated themselves in a circle in the garden,\r\nin order to complete their digestion.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the dog, who was carrying something in his mouth, began to run\r\naround the chairs at full speed. The child was chasing him wildly. Both\r\ndisappeared into the house.\r\n\r\nCimme fell asleep, his well-rounded paunch bathed in the glow of the\r\nshining sun.\r\n\r\nThe dying woman once more began to talk in a loud voice. Then suddenly\r\nshe shrieked.\r\n\r\nThe two women and Colombel rushed in to see what was the matter. Cimme,\r\nwaking up, did not budge, because, he did not wish to witness such a\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting up, with haggard eyes. Her dog, in order to escape being\r\npursued by little Joseph, had jumped up on the bed, run over the sick\r\nwoman, and entrenched behind the pillow, was looking down at his\r\nplaymate with snapping eyes, ready to jump down and begin the game\r\nagain. He was holding in his mouth one of his mistress' slippers, which\r\nhe had torn to pieces and with which he had been playing for the last\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe child, frightened by this woman who had suddenly risen in front of\r\nhim, stood motionless before the bed.\r\n\r\nThe hen had also come in, and frightened by the noise, had jumped up on\r\na chair and was wildly calling her chicks, who were chirping\r\ndistractedly around the four legs of the chair.\r\n\r\nQueen Hortense was shrieking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I don't want to die, I don't want to! I don't want to! Who will\r\nbring up my children? Who will take care of them? Who will love them?\r\nNo, I don't want to!\xe2\x80\x94I don't\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fell back. All was over.\r\n\r\nThe dog, wild with excitement, jumped about the room, barking.\r\n\r\nColombel ran to the window, calling his brother-in-law:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry up, hurry up! I think that she has just gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Cimme, resigned, arose and entered the room, mumbling\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt didn't take as long as I thought it would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMBUCTOO\r\n\r\nThe boulevard, that river of humanity, was alive with people in the\r\ngolden light of the setting sun. The whole sky was red, blinding, and\r\nbehind the Madeleine an immense bank of flaming clouds cast a shower of\r\nlight the whole length of the boulevard, vibrant as the heat from a\r\nbrazier.\r\n\r\nThe gay, animated crowd went by in this golden mist and seemed to be\r\nglorified. Their faces were gilded, their black hats and clothes took on\r\npurple tints, the patent leather of their shoes cast bright reflections\r\non the asphalt of the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nBefore the cafes a mass of men were drinking opalescent liquids that\r\nlooked like precious stones dissolved in the glasses.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the drinkers two officers in full uniform dazzled all\r\neyes with their glittering gold lace. They chatted, happy without asking\r\nwhy, in this glory of life, in this radiant light of sunset, and they\r\nlooked at the crowd, the leisurely men and the hurrying women who left a\r\nbewildering odor of perfume as they passed by.\r\n\r\nAll at once an enormous negro, dressed in black, with a paunch beneath\r\nhis jean waistcoat, which was covered with charms, his face shining as\r\nif it had been polished, passed before them with a triumphant air. He\r\nlaughed at the passers-by, at the news venders, at the dazzling sky, at\r\nthe whole of Paris. He was so tall that he overtopped everyone else, and\r\nwhen he passed all the loungers turned round to look at his back.\r\n\r\nBut he suddenly perceived the officers and darted towards them, jostling\r\nthe drinkers in his path. As soon as he reached their table he fixed his\r\ngleaming and delighted eyes upon them and the corners of his mouth\r\nexpanded to his ears, showing his dazzling white teeth like a crescent\r\nmoon in a black sky. The two men looked in astonishment at this ebony\r\ngiant, unable to understand his delight.\r\n\r\nWith a voice that made all the guests laugh, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, my lieutenant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the officers was commander of a battalion, the other was a\r\ncolonel. The former said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know you, sir. I am at a loss to know what you want of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe like you much, Lieutenant Vedie, siege of Bezi, much grapes, find\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer, utterly bewildered, looked at the man intently, trying to\r\nrefresh his memory. Then he cried abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimbuctoo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe negro, radiant, slapped his thigh as he uttered a tremendous laugh\r\nand roared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, my lieutenant; you remember Timbuctoo, ya. How do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commandant held out his hand, laughing heartily as he did so. Then\r\nTimbuctoo became serious. He seized the officer's hand and, before the\r\nother could prevent it, he kissed it, according to negro and Arab\r\ncustom. The officer embarrassed, said in a severe tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, Timbuctoo, we are not in Africa. Sit down there and tell me\r\nhow it is I find you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTimbuctoo swelled himself out and, his words falling over one another,\r\nreplied hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake much money, much, big restaurant, good food; Prussians, me, much\r\nsteal, much, French cooking; Timbuctoo cook to the emperor; two thousand\r\nfrancs mine. Ha, ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed, doubling himself up, roaring, with wild delight in his\r\nglances.\r\n\r\nWhen the officer, who understood his strange manner of expressing\r\nhimself, had questioned him he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, au revoir, Timbuctoo. I will see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe negro rose, this time shaking the hand that was extended to him and,\r\nsmiling still, cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, good-day, my lieutenant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went off so happy that he gesticulated as he walked, and people\r\nthought he was crazy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that brute?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine fellow and a brave soldier. I will tell you what I know about\r\nhim. It is funny enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that at the commencement of the war of 1870 I was shut up in\r\nBezieres, that this negro calls Bezi. We were not besieged, but\r\nblockaded. The Prussian lines surrounded us on all sides, outside the\r\nreach of cannon, not firing on us, but slowly starving us out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was then lieutenant. Our garrison consisted of soldier of all\r\ndescriptions, fragments of slaughtered regiments, some that had run\r\naway, freebooters separated from the main army, etc. We had all kinds,\r\nin fact even eleven Turcos [Algerian soldiers in the service of France],\r\nwho arrived one evening no one knew whence or how. They appeared at the\r\ngates of the city, exhausted, in rags, starving and dirty. They were\r\nhanded over to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw very soon that they were absolutely undisciplined, always in the\r\nstreet and always drunk. I tried putting them in the police station,\r\neven in prison, but nothing was of any use. They would disappear,\r\nsometimes for days at a time, as if they had been swallowed up by the\r\nearth, and then come back staggering drunk. They had no money. Where did\r\nthey buy drink and how and with what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis began to worry me greatly, all the more as these savages\r\ninterested me with their everlasting laugh and their characteristics of\r\novergrown frolicsome children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI then noticed that they blindly obeyed the largest among them, the one\r\nyou have just seen. He made them do as he pleased, planned their\r\nmysterious expeditions with the all-powerful and undisputed authority of\r\na leader. I sent for him and questioned him. Our conversation lasted\r\nfully three hours, for it was hard for me to understand his remarkable\r\ngibberish. As for him, poor devil, he made unheard-of efforts to make\r\nhimself intelligible, invented words, gesticulated, perspired in his\r\nanxiety, mopping his forehead, puffing, stopping and abruptly beginning\r\nagain when he thought he had found a new method of explaining what he\r\nwanted to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gathered finally that he was the son of a big chief, a sort of negro\r\nking of the region around Timbuctoo. I asked him his name. He repeated\r\nsomething like 'Chavaharibouhalikranafotapolara.' It seemed simpler to\r\nme to give him the name of his native place, 'Timbuctoo.' And a week\r\nlater he was known by no other name in the garrison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we were all wildly anxious to find out where this African ex-prince\r\nprocured his drinks. I discovered it in a singular manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was on the ramparts one morning, watching the horizon, when I\r\nperceived something moving about in a vineyard. It was near the time of\r\nvintage, the grapes were ripe, but I was not thinking of that. I thought\r\nthat a spy was approaching the town, and I organized a complete\r\nexpedition to catch the prowler. I took command myself, after obtaining\r\npermission from the general.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent out by three different gates three little companies, which were\r\nto meet at the suspected vineyard and form a cordon round it. In order\r\nto cut off the spy's retreat, one of these detachments had to make at\r\nleast an hour's march. A watch on the walls signalled to me that the\r\nperson I had seen had not left the place. We went along in profound\r\nsilence, creeping, almost crawling, along the ditches. At last we\r\nreached the spot assigned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI abruptly disbanded my soldiers, who darted into the vineyard and\r\nfound Timbuctoo on hands and knees travelling around among the vines and\r\neating grapes, or rather devouring them as a dog eats his sop, snatching\r\nthem in mouthfuls from the vine with his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted him to get up, but he could not think of it. I then understood\r\nwhy he was crawling on his hands and knees. As soon as we stood him on\r\nhis feet he began to wabble, then stretched out his arms and fell down\r\non his nose. He was more drunk than I have ever seen anyone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey brought him home on two poles. He never stopped laughing all the\r\nway back, gesticulating with his arms and legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis explained the mystery. My men also drank the juice of the grapes,\r\nand when they were so intoxicated they could not stir they went to sleep\r\nin the vineyard. As for Timbuctoo, his love of the vineyard was beyond\r\nall belief and all bounds. He lived in it as did the thrushes, whom he\r\nhated with the jealous hate of a rival. He repeated incessantly: 'The\r\nthrushes eat all the grapes, captain!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening I was sent for. Something had been seen on the plain coming\r\nin our direction. I had not brought my field-glass and I could not\r\ndistinguish things clearly. It looked like a great serpent uncoiling\r\nitself\xe2\x80\x94a convoy. How could I tell?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent some men to meet this strange caravan, which presently made its\r\ntriumphal entry. Timbuctoo and nine of his comrades were carrying on a\r\nsort of altar made of camp stools eight severed, grinning and bleeding\r\nheads. The African was dragging along a horse to whose tail another head\r\nwas fastened, and six other animals followed, adorned in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I learned: Having started out to the vineyard, my Africans\r\nhad suddenly perceived a detachment of Prussians approaching a village.\r\nInstead of taking to their heels, they hid themselves, and as soon as\r\nthe Prussian officers dismounted at an inn to refresh themselves, the\r\neleven rascals rushed on them, put to flight the lancers, who thought\r\nthey were being attacked by the main army, killed the two sentries, then\r\nthe colonel and the five officers of his escort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat day I kissed Timbuctoo. I saw, however, that he walked with\r\ndifficulty and thought he was wounded. He laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Me provisions for my country.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimbuctoo was not fighting for glory, but for gain. Everything he found\r\nthat seemed to him to be of the slightest value, especially anything\r\nthat glistened, he put in his pocket. What a pocket! An abyss that began\r\nat his hips and reached to his ankles. He had retained an old term used\r\nby the troopers and called it his 'profonde,' and it was his 'profonde'\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had taken the gold lace off the Prussian uniforms, the brass off\r\ntheir helmets, detached their buttons, etc., and had thrown them all\r\ninto his 'profonde,' which was full to overflowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach day he pocketed every glistening object that came beneath his\r\nobservation, pieces of tin or pieces of silver, and sometimes his\r\ncontour was very comical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe intended to carry all that back to the land of ostriches, whose\r\nbrother he might have been, this son of a king, tormented with the\r\nlonging to gobble up all objects that glistened. If he had not had his\r\n'profonde' what would he have done? He doubtless would have swallowed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach morning his pocket was empty. He had, then, some general store\r\nwhere his riches were piled up. But where? I could not discover it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe general, on being informed of Timbuctoo's mighty act of valor, had\r\nthe headless bodies that had been left in the neighboring village\r\ninterred at once, that it might not be discovered that they were\r\ndecapitated. The Prussians returned thither the following day. The mayor\r\nand seven prominent inhabitants were shot on the spot, by way of\r\nreprisal, as having denounced the Prussians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWinter was here. We were exhausted and desperate. There were skirmishes\r\nnow every day. The famished men could no longer march. The eight\r\n'Turcos' alone (three had been killed) remained fat and shiny, vigorous\r\nand always ready to fight. Timbuctoo was even getting fatter. He said to\r\nme one day:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You much hungry; me good meat.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he brought me an excellent filet. But of what? We had no more\r\ncattle, nor sheep, nor goats, nor donkeys, nor pigs. It was impossible\r\nto get a horse. I thought of all this after I had devoured my meat. Then\r\na horrible idea came to me. These negroes were born close to a country\r\nwhere they eat human beings! And each day such a number of soldiers were\r\nkilled around the town! I questioned Timbuctoo. He would not answer. I\r\ndid not insist, but from that time on I declined his presents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe worshipped me. One night snow took us by surprise at the outposts.\r\nWe were seated, on the ground. I looked with pity at those poor negroes\r\nshivering beneath this white frozen shower. I was very cold and began to\r\ncough. At once I felt something fall on me like a large warm quilt. It\r\nwas Timbuctoo's cape that he had thrown on my shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rose and returned his garment, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Keep it, my boy; you need it more than I do.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Non, my lieutenant, for you; me no need. Me hot, hot!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he looked at me entreatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come, obey orders. Keep your cape; I insist,' I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe then stood up, drew his sword, which he had sharpened to an edge\r\nlike a scythe, and holding in his other hand the large cape which I had\r\nrefused, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'If you not keep cape, me cut. No one cape.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he would have done it. So I yielded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight days later we capitulated. Some of us had been able to escape,\r\nthe rest were to march out of the town and give themselves up to the\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went towards the exercising ground, where we were all to meet, when I\r\nwas dumfounded at the sight of a gigantic negro dressed in white duck\r\nand wearing a straw hat. It was Timbuctoo. He was beaming and was\r\nwalking with his hands in his pockets in front of a little shop where\r\ntwo plates and two glasses were displayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What are you doing?' I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Me not go. Me good cook; me make food for Colonel Algeria. Me eat\r\nPrussians; much steal, much.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were ten degrees of frost. I shivered at sight of this negro in\r\nwhite duck. He took me by the arm and made me go inside. I noticed an\r\nimmense flag that he was going to place outside his door as soon as we\r\nhad left, for he had some shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI read this sign, traced by the hand of some accomplice\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'ARMY KITCHEN OF M. TIMBUCTOO, \xe2\x80\x9c'Formerly Cook to H. M. the Emperor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A Parisian Artist. Moderate Prices.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of the despair that was gnawing at my heart, I could not help\r\nlaughing, and I left my negro to his new enterprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas not that better than taking him prisoner?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have just seen that he made a success of it, the rascal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBezieres to-day belongs to the Germans. The 'Restaurant Timbuctoo' is\r\nthe beginning of a retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMBSTONES\r\n\r\nThe five friends had finished dinner, five men of the world, mature,\r\nrich, three married, the two others bachelors. They met like this every\r\nmonth in memory of their youth, and after dinner they chatted until two\r\no'clock in the morning. Having remained intimate friends, and enjoying\r\neach other's society, they probably considered these the pleasantest\r\nevenings of their lives. They talked on every subject, especially of\r\nwhat interested and amused Parisians. Their conversation was, as in the\r\nmajority of salons elsewhere, a verbal rehash of what they had read in\r\nthe morning papers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most lively of them was Joseph de Bardon, a celibate living\r\nthe Parisian life in its fullest and most whimsical manner. He was not a\r\ndebauche nor depraved, but a singular, happy fellow, still young, for he\r\nwas scarcely forty. A man of the world in its widest and best sense,\r\ngifted with a brilliant, but not profound, mind, with much varied\r\nknowledge, but no true erudition, ready comprehension without true\r\nunderstanding, he drew from his observations, his adventures, from\r\neverything he saw, met with and found, anecdotes at once comical and\r\nphilosophical, and made humorous remarks that gave him a great\r\nreputation for cleverness in society.\r\n\r\nHe was the after dinner speaker and had his own story each time, upon\r\nwhich they counted, and he talked without having to be coaxed.\r\n\r\nAs he sat smoking, his elbows on the table, a petit verre half full\r\nbeside his plate, half torpid in an atmosphere of tobacco blended with\r\nsteaming coffee, he seemed to be perfectly at home. He said between two\r\nwhiffs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA curious thing happened to me some time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell it to us,\xe2\x80\x9d they all exclaimed at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure. You know that I wander about Paris a great deal, like\r\nbook collectors who ransack book stalls. I just look at the sights, at\r\nthe people, at all that is passing by and all that is going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward the middle of September\xe2\x80\x94it was beautiful weather\xe2\x80\x94I went out one\r\nafternoon, not knowing where I was going. One always has a vague wish to\r\ncall on some pretty woman or other. One chooses among them in one's\r\nmental picture gallery, compares them in one's mind, weighs the interest\r\nwith which they inspire you, their comparative charms and finally\r\ndecides according to the influence of the day. But when the sun is very\r\nbright and the air warm, it takes away from you all desire to make\r\ncalls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun was bright, the air warm. I lighted a cigar and sauntered\r\naimlessly along the outer boulevard. Then, as I strolled on, it occurred\r\nto me to walk as far as Montmartre and go into the cemetery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very fond of cemeteries. They rest me and give me a feeling of\r\nsadness; I need it. And, besides, I have good friends in there, those\r\nthat one no longer goes to call on, and I go there from time to time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in this cemetery of Montmartre that is buried a romance of my\r\nlife, a sweetheart who made a great impression on me, a very emotional,\r\ncharming little woman whose memory, although it causes me great sorrow,\r\nalso fills me with regrets\xe2\x80\x94regrets of all kinds. And I go to dream\r\nbeside her grave. She has finished with life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I like cemeteries because they are immense cities filled to\r\noverflowing with inhabitants. Think how many dead people there are in\r\nthis small space, think of all the generations of Parisians who are\r\nhoused there forever, veritable troglodytes enclosed in their little\r\nvaults, in their little graves covered with a stone or marked by a\r\ncross, while living beings take up so much room and make so much noise\r\n\xe2\x80\x94imbeciles that they are!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, again, in cemeteries there are monuments almost as interesting as\r\nin museums. The tomb of Cavaignac reminded me, I must confess without\r\nmaking any comparison, of the chef d'oeuvre of Jean Goujon: the\r\nrecumbent statue of Louis de Breze in the subterranean chapel of the\r\nCathedral of Rouen. All modern and realistic art has originated there,\r\nmessieurs. This dead man, Louis de Breze, is more real, more terrible,\r\nmore like inanimate flesh still convulsed with the death agony than all\r\nthe tortured corpses that are distorted to-day in funeral monuments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in Montmartre one can yet admire Baudin's monument, which has a\r\ndegree of grandeur; that of Gautier, of Murger, on which I saw the other\r\nday a simple, paltry wreath of immortelles, yellow immortelles, brought\r\nthither by whom? Possibly by the last grisette, very old and now\r\njanitress in the neighborhood. It is a pretty little statue by Millet,\r\nbut ruined by dirt and neglect. Sing of youth, O Murger!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there I was in Montmartre Cemetery, and was all at once filled\r\nwith sadness, a sadness that is not all pain, a kind of sadness that\r\nmakes you think when you are in good health, 'This place is not amusing,\r\nbut my time has not come yet.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe feeling of autumn, of the warm moisture which is redolent of the\r\ndeath of the leaves, and the weakened, weary, anaemic sun increased,\r\nwhile rendering it poetical, the sensation of solitude and of finality\r\nthat hovered over this spot which savors of human mortality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked along slowly amid these streets of tombs, where the neighbors\r\ndo not visit each other, do not sleep together and do not read the\r\nnewspapers. And I began to read the epitaphs. That is the most amusing\r\nthing in the world. Never did Labiche or Meilhac make me laugh as I have\r\nlaughed at the comical inscriptions on tombstones. Oh, how much superior\r\nto the books of Paul de Kock for getting rid of the spleen are these\r\nmarble slabs and these crosses where the relatives of the deceased have\r\nunburdened their sorrow, their desires for the happiness of the vanished\r\nones and their hope of rejoining them\xe2\x80\x94humbugs!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I love above all in this cemetery the deserted portion, solitary,\r\nfull of great yews and cypresses, the older portion, belonging to those\r\ndead long since, and which will soon be taken into use again; the\r\ngrowing trees nourished by the human corpses cut down in order to bury\r\nin rows beneath little slabs of marble those who have died more\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had sauntered about long enough to refresh my mind I felt that I\r\nwould soon have had enough of it and that I must place the faithful\r\nhomage of my remembrance on my little friend's last resting place. I\r\nfelt a tightening of the heart as I reached her grave. Poor dear, she\r\nwas so dainty, so loving and so white and fresh\xe2\x80\x94and now\xe2\x80\x94if one should\r\nopen the grave\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaning over the iron grating, I told her of my sorrow in a low tone,\r\nwhich she doubtless did not hear, and was moving away when I saw a woman\r\nin black, in deep mourning, kneeling on the next grave. Her crape veil\r\nwas turned back, uncovering a pretty fair head, the hair in Madonna\r\nbands looking like rays of dawn beneath her sombre headdress. I stayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely she must be in profound grief. She had covered her face with her\r\nhands and, standing there in meditation, rigid as a statue, given up to\r\nher grief, telling the sad rosary of her remembrances within the shadow\r\nof her concealed and closed eyes, she herself seemed like a dead person\r\nmourning another who was dead. All at once a little motion of her back,\r\nlike a flutter of wind through a willow, led me to suppose that she was\r\ngoing to cry. She wept softly at first, then louder, with quick motions\r\nof her neck and shoulders. Suddenly she uncovered her eyes. They were\r\nfull of tears and charming, the eyes of a bewildered woman, with which\r\nshe glanced about her as if awaking from a nightmare. She looked at me,\r\nseemed abashed and hid her face completely in her hands. Then she sobbed\r\nconvulsively, and her head slowly bent down toward the marble. She\r\nleaned her forehead on it, and her veil spreading around her, covered\r\nthe white corners of the beloved tomb, like a fresh token of mourning. I\r\nheard her sigh, then she sank down with her cheek on the marble slab and\r\nremained motionless, unconscious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI darted toward her, slapped her hands, blew on her eyelids, while I\r\nread this simple epitaph: 'Here lies Louis-Theodore Carrel, Captain of\r\nMarine Infantry, killed by the enemy at Tonquin. Pray for him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had died some months before. I was affected to tears and redoubled\r\nmy attentions. They were successful. She regained consciousness. I\r\nappeared very much moved. I am not bad looking, I am not forty. I saw by\r\nher first glance that she would be polite and grateful. She was, and\r\namid more tears she told me her history in detached fragments as well as\r\nher gasping breath would allow, how the officer was killed at Tonquin\r\nwhen they had been married a year, how she had married him for love, and\r\nbeing an orphan, she had only the usual dowry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consoled her, I comforted her, raised her and lifted her on her feet.\r\nThen I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Do not stay here. Come.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am unable to walk,' she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I will support you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Thank you, sir; you are good. Did you also come to mourn for some\r\none?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, madame.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A dead friend?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, madame.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Your wife?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A friend.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'One may love a friend as much as they love their wife. Love has no\r\nlaw.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, madame.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we set off together, she leaning on my arm, while I almost carried\r\nher along the paths of the cemetery. When we got outside she faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I feel as if I were going to be ill.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Would you like to go in anywhere, to take something?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, monsieur.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceived a restaurant, one of those places where the mourners of the\r\ndead go to celebrate the funeral. We went in. I made her drink a cup of\r\nhot tea, which seemed to revive her. A faint smile came to her lips. She\r\nbegan to talk about herself. It was sad, so sad to be always alone in\r\nlife, alone in one's home, night and day, to have no one on whom one can\r\nbestow affection, confidence, intimacy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounded sincere. It sounded pretty from her mouth. I was touched.\r\nShe was very young, perhaps twenty. I paid her compliments, which she\r\ntook in good part. Then, as time was passing, I suggested taking her\r\nhome in a carriage. She accepted, and in the cab we sat so close that\r\nour shoulders touched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the cab stopped at her house she murmured: 'I do not feel equal to\r\ngoing upstairs alone, for I live on the fourth floor. You have been so\r\ngood. Will you let me take your arm as far as my own door?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agreed with eagerness. She ascended the stairs slowly, breathing\r\nhard. Then, as we stood at her door, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come in a few moments so that I may thank you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, by Jove, I went in. Everything was modest, even rather poor, but\r\nsimple and in good taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sat down side by side on a little sofa and she began to talk again\r\nabout her loneliness. She rang for her maid, in order to offer me some\r\nwine. The maid did not come. I was delighted, thinking that this maid\r\nprobably came in the morning only, what one calls a charwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had taken off her hat. She was really pretty, and she gazed at me\r\nwith her clear eyes, gazed so hard and her eyes were so clear that I was\r\nterribly tempted. I caught her in my arms and rained kisses on her\r\neyelids, which she closed suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe freed herself and pushed me away, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Have done, have done.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I next kissed her on the mouth and she did not resist, and as our\r\nglances met after thus outraging the memory of the captain killed in\r\nTonquin, I saw that she had a languid, resigned expression that set my\r\nmind at rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI became very attentive and, after chatting for some time, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Where do you dine?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'In a little restaurant in the neighborhood:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'All alone?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why, yes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Will you dine with me?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Where?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'In a good restaurant on the Boulevard.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe demurred a little. I insisted. She yielded, saying by way of\r\napology to herself: 'I am so lonely\xe2\x80\x94so lonely.' Then she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I must put on something less sombre, and went into her bedroom. When\r\nshe reappeared she was dressed in half-mourning, charming, dainty and\r\nslender in a very simple gray dress. She evidently had a costume for the\r\ncemetery and one for the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dinner was very enjoyable. She drank some champagne, brightened up,\r\ngrew lively and I went home with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis friendship, begun amid the tombs, lasted about three weeks. But\r\none gets tired of everything, especially of women. I left her under\r\npretext of an imperative journey. She made me promise that I would come\r\nand see her on my return. She seemed to be really rather attached to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther things occupied my attention, and it was about a month before I\r\nthought much about this little cemetery friend. However, I did not\r\nforget her. The recollection of her haunted me like a mystery, like a\r\npsychological problem, one of those inexplicable questions whose\r\nsolution baffles us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know why, but one day I thought I might possibly meet her in\r\nthe Montmartre Cemetery, and I went there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked about a long time without meeting any but the ordinary\r\nvisitors to this spot, those who have not yet broken off all relations\r\nwith their dead. The grave of the captain killed at Tonquin had no\r\nmourner on its marble slab, no flowers, no wreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as I wandered in another direction of this great city of the dead I\r\nperceived suddenly, at the end of a narrow avenue of crosses, a couple\r\nin deep mourning walking toward me, a man and a woman. Oh, horrors! As\r\nthey approached I recognized her. It was she!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe saw me, blushed, and as I brushed past her she gave me a little\r\nsignal, a tiny little signal with her eye, which meant: 'Do not\r\nrecognize me!' and also seemed to say, 'Come back to see me again, my\r\ndear!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man was a gentleman, distingue, chic, an officer of the Legion of\r\nHonor, about fifty years old. He was supporting her as I had supported\r\nher myself when we were leaving the cemetery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went my way, filled with amazement, asking myself what this all\r\nmeant, to what race of beings belonged this huntress of the tombs? Was\r\nshe just a common girl, one who went to seek among the tombs for men who\r\nwere in sorrow, haunted by the recollection of some woman, a wife or a\r\nsweetheart, and still troubled by the memory of vanished caresses? Was\r\nshe unique? Are there many such? Is it a profession? Do they parade the\r\ncemetery as they parade the street? Or else was she only impressed with\r\nthe admirable, profoundly philosophical idea of exploiting love\r\nrecollections, which are revived in these funereal places?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I would have liked to know whose widow she was on that special\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADEMOISELLE PEARL\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhat a strange idea it was for me to choose Mademoiselle Pearl for queen\r\nthat evening!\r\n\r\nEvery year I celebrate Twelfth Night with my old friend Chantal. My\r\nfather, who was his most intimate friend, used to take me round there\r\nwhen I was a child. I continued the custom, and I doubtless shall\r\ncontinue it as long as I live and as long as there is a Chantal in this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Chantals lead a peculiar existence; they live in Paris as though\r\nthey were in Grasse, Evetot, or Pont-a-Mousson.\r\n\r\nThey have a house with a little garden near the observatory. They live\r\nthere as though they were in the country. Of Paris, the real Paris, they\r\nknow nothing at all, they suspect nothing; they are so far, so far away!\r\nHowever, from time to time, they take a trip into it. Mademoiselle\r\nChantal goes to lay in her provisions, as it is called in the family.\r\nThis is how they go to purchase their provisions:\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Pearl, who has the keys to the kitchen closet (for the\r\nlinen closets are administered by the mistress herself), Mademoiselle\r\nPearl gives warning that the supply of sugar is low, that the preserves\r\nare giving out, that there is not much left in the bottom of the coffee\r\nbag. Thus warned against famine, Mademoiselle Chantal passes everything\r\nin review, taking notes on a pad. Then she puts down a lot of figures\r\nand goes through lengthy calculations and long discussions with\r\nMademoiselle Pearl. At last they manage to agree, and they decide upon\r\nthe quantity of each thing of which they will lay in a three months'\r\nprovision; sugar, rice, prunes, coffee, preserves, cans of peas, beans,\r\nlobster, salt or smoked fish, etc., etc. After which the day for the\r\npurchasing is determined on and they go in a cab with a railing round\r\nthe top and drive to a large grocery store on the other side of the\r\nriver in the new sections of the town.\r\n\r\nMadame Chantal and Mademoiselle Pearl make this trip together,\r\nmysteriously, and only return at dinner time, tired out, although still\r\nexcited, and shaken up by the cab, the roof of which is covered with\r\nbundles and bags, like an express wagon.\r\n\r\nFor the Chantals all that part of Paris situated on the other side of\r\nthe Seine constitutes the new quarter, a section inhabited by a strange,\r\nnoisy population, which cares little for honor, spends its days in\r\ndissipation, its nights in revelry, and which throws money out of the\r\nwindows. From time to time, however, the young girls are taken to the\r\nOpera-Comique or the Theatre Francais, when the play is recommended by\r\nthe paper which is read by M. Chantal.\r\n\r\nAt present the young ladies are respectively nineteen and seventeen.\r\nThey are two pretty girls, tall and fresh, very well brought up, in\r\nfact, too well brought up, so much so that they pass by unperceived like\r\ntwo pretty dolls. Never would the idea come to me to pay the slightest\r\nattention or to pay court to one of the young Chantal ladies; they are\r\nso immaculate that one hardly dares speak to them; one almost feels\r\nindecent when bowing to them.\r\n\r\nAs for the father, he is a charming man, well educated, frank, cordial,\r\nbut he likes calm and quiet above all else, and has thus contributed\r\ngreatly to the mummifying of his family in order to live as he pleased\r\nin stagnant quiescence. He reads a lot, loves to talk and is readily\r\naffected. Lack of contact and of elbowing with the world has made his\r\nmoral skin very tender and sensitive. The slightest thing moves him,\r\nexcites him, and makes him suffer.\r\n\r\nThe Chantals have limited connections carefully chosen in the\r\nneighborhood. They also exchange two or three yearly visits with\r\nrelatives who live in the distance.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I take dinner with them on the fifteenth of August and on\r\nTwelfth Night. That is as much one of my duties as Easter communion is\r\nfor a Catholic.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of August a few friends are invited, but on Twelfth\r\nNight I am the only stranger.\r\n\r\nWell, this year, as every former year, I went to the Chantals' for my\r\nEpiphany dinner.\r\n\r\nAccording to my usual custom, I kissed M. Chantal, Madame Chantal and\r\nMademoiselle Pearl, and I made a deep bow to the Misses Louise and\r\nPauline. I was questioned about a thousand and one things, about what\r\nhad happened on the boulevards, about politics, about how matters stood\r\nin Tong-King, and about our representatives in Parliament. Madame\r\nChantal, a fat lady, whose ideas always gave me the impression of being\r\ncarved out square like building stones, was accustomed to exclaiming at\r\nthe end of every political discussion: \xe2\x80\x9cAll that is seed which does not\r\npromise much for the future!\xe2\x80\x9d Why have I always imagined that Madame\r\nChantal's ideas are square? I don't know; but everything that she says\r\ntakes that shape in my head: a big square, with four symmetrical angles.\r\nThere are other people whose ideas always strike me as being round and\r\nrolling like a hoop. As soon as they begin a sentence on any subject it\r\nrolls on and on, coming out in ten, twenty, fifty round ideas, large and\r\nsmall, which I see rolling along, one behind the other, to the end of\r\nthe horizon. Other people have pointed ideas\xe2\x80\x94but enough of this.\r\n\r\nWe sat down as usual and finished our dinner without anything out of the\r\nordinary being said. At dessert the Twelfth Night cake was brought on.\r\nNow, M. Chantal had been king every year. I don't know whether this was\r\nthe result of continued chance or a family convention, but he\r\nunfailingly found the bean in his piece of cake, and he would proclaim\r\nMadame Chantal to be queen. Therefore, I was greatly surprised to find\r\nsomething very hard, which almost made me break a tooth, in a mouthful\r\nof cake. Gently I took this thing from my mouth and I saw that it was a\r\nlittle porcelain doll, no bigger than a bean. Surprise caused me to\r\nexclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d All looked at me, and Chantal clapped his hands and cried: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's\r\nGaston! It's Gaston! Long live the king! Long live the king!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll took up the chorus: \xe2\x80\x9cLong live the king!\xe2\x80\x9d And I blushed to the tip\r\nof my ears, as one often does, without any reason at all, in situations\r\nwhich are a little foolish. I sat there looking at my plate, with this\r\nabsurd little bit of pottery in my fingers, forcing myself to laugh and\r\nnot knowing what to do or say, when Chantal once more cried out: \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nyou must choose a queen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I was thunderstruck. In a second a thousand thoughts and\r\nsuppositions flashed through my mind. Did they expect me to pick out one\r\nof the young Chantal ladies? Was that a trick to make me say which one I\r\nprefer? Was it a gentle, light, direct hint of the parents toward a\r\npossible marriage? The idea of marriage roams continually in houses with\r\ngrown-up girls, and takes every shape and disguise, and employs every\r\nsubterfuge. A dread of compromising myself took hold of me as well as an\r\nextreme timidity before the obstinately correct and reserved attitude of\r\nthe Misses Louise and Pauline. To choose one of them in preference to\r\nthe other seemed to me as difficult as choosing between two drops of\r\nwater; and then the fear of launching myself into an affair which might,\r\nin spite of me, lead me gently into matrimonial ties, by means as wary\r\nand imperceptible and as calm as this insignificant royalty\xe2\x80\x94the fear of\r\nall this haunted me.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I had an inspiration, and I held out to Mademoiselle Pearl the\r\nsymbolical emblem. At first every one was surprised, then they doubtless\r\nappreciated my delicacy and discretion, for they applauded furiously.\r\nEverybody was crying: \xe2\x80\x9cLong live the queen! Long live the queen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs for herself, poor old maid, she was so amazed that she completely\r\nlost control of herself; she was trembling and stammering: \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94oh!\r\nno\xe2\x80\x94not me\xe2\x80\x94please\xe2\x80\x94not me\xe2\x80\x94I beg of you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen for the first time in my life I looked at Mademoiselle Pearl and\r\nwondered what she was.\r\n\r\nI was accustomed to seeing her in this house, just as one sees old\r\nupholstered armchairs on which one has been sitting since childhood\r\nwithout ever noticing them. One day, with no reason at all, because a\r\nray of sunshine happens to strike the seat, you suddenly think: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nthat chair is very curious\xe2\x80\x9d; and then you discover that the wood has\r\nbeen worked by a real artist and that the material is remarkable. I had\r\nnever taken any notice of Mademoiselle Pearl.\r\n\r\nShe was a part of the Chantal family, that was all. But how? By what\r\nright? She was a tall, thin person who tried to remain in the\r\nbackground, but who was by no means insignificant. She was treated in a\r\nfriendly manner, better than a housekeeper, not so well as a relative. I\r\nsuddenly observed several shades of distinction which I had never\r\nnoticed before. Madame Chantal said: \xe2\x80\x9cPearl.\xe2\x80\x9d The young ladies:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Pearl,\xe2\x80\x9d and Chantal only addressed her as \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith an air of greater respect, perhaps.\r\n\r\nI began to observe her. How old could she be? Forty? Yes, forty. She was\r\nnot old, she made herself old. I was suddenly struck by this fact. She\r\nfixed her hair and dressed in a ridiculous manner, and, notwithstanding\r\nall that, she was not in the least ridiculous, she had such simple,\r\nnatural gracefulness, veiled and hidden. Truly, what a strange creature!\r\nHow was it I had never observed her before? She dressed her hair in a\r\ngrotesque manner with little old maid curls, most absurd; but beneath\r\nthis one could see a large, calm brow, cut by two deep lines, two\r\nwrinkles of long sadness, then two blue eyes, large and tender, so\r\ntimid, so bashful, so humble, two beautiful eyes which had kept the\r\nexpression of naive wonder of a young girl, of youthful sensations, and\r\nalso of sorrow, which had softened without spoiling them.\r\n\r\nHer whole face was refined and discreet, a face the expression of which\r\nseemed to have gone out without being used up or faded by the fatigues\r\nand great emotions of life.\r\n\r\nWhat a dainty mouth! and such pretty teeth! But one would have thought\r\nthat she did not dare smile.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I compared her to Madame Chantal! Undoubtedly Mademoiselle\r\nPearl was the better of the two, a hundred times better, daintier,\r\nprouder, more noble. I was surprised at my observation. They were\r\npouring out champagne. I held my glass up to the queen and, with a well-\r\nturned compliment, I drank to her health. I could see that she felt\r\ninclined to hide her head in her napkin. Then, as she was dipping her\r\nlips in the clear wine, everybody cried: \xe2\x80\x9cThe queen drinks! the queen\r\ndrinks!\xe2\x80\x9d She almost turned purple and choked. Everybody was laughing;\r\nbut I could see that all loved her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as dinner was over Chantal took me by the arm. It was time for\r\nhis cigar, a sacred hour. When alone he would smoke it out in the\r\nstreet; when guests came to dinner he would take them to the billiard\r\nroom and smoke while playing. That evening they had built a fire to\r\ncelebrate Twelfth Night; my old friend took his cue, a very fine one,\r\nand chalked it with great care; then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou break, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe called me \xe2\x80\x9cmy boy,\xe2\x80\x9d although I was twenty-five, but he had known me\r\nas a young child.\r\n\r\nI started the game and made a few carroms. I missed some others, but as\r\nthe thought of Mademoiselle Pearl kept returning to my mind, I suddenly\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Monsieur Chantal, is Mademoiselle Pearl a relative of\r\nyours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreatly surprised, he stopped playing and looked at me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Don't you know? Haven't you heard about Mademoiselle Pearl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn't your father ever tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, that's funny! That certainly is funny! Why, it's a regular\r\nromance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you only knew how peculiar it is that you should ask me that to-\r\nday, on Twelfth Night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Well, listen. Forty-one years ago to day, the day of the Epiphany,\r\nthe following events occurred: We were then living at Roily-le-Tors, on\r\nthe ramparts; but in order that you may understand, I must first explain\r\nthe house. Roily is built on a hill, or, rather, on a mound which\r\noverlooks a great stretch of prairie. We had a house there with a\r\nbeautiful hanging garden supported by the old battlemented wall; so that\r\nthe house was in the town on the streets, while the garden overlooked\r\nthe plain. There was a door leading from the garden to the open country,\r\nat the bottom of a secret stairway in the thick wall\xe2\x80\x94the kind you read\r\nabout in novels. A road passed in front of this door, which was provided\r\nwith a big bell; for the peasants, in order to avoid the roundabout way,\r\nwould bring their provisions up this way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou now understand the place, don't you? Well, this year, at Epiphany,\r\nit had been snowing for a week. One might have thought that the world\r\nwas coming to an end. When we went to the ramparts to look over the\r\nplain, this immense white, frozen country, which shone like varnish,\r\nwould chill our very souls. One might have thought that the Lord had\r\npacked the world in cotton to put it away in the storeroom for old\r\nworlds. I can assure you that it was dreary looking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were a very numerous family at that time my father, my mother, my\r\nuncle and aunt, my two brothers and four cousins; they were pretty\r\nlittle girls; I married the youngest. Of all that crowd, there are only\r\nthree of us left: my wife, I, and my sister-in-law, who lives in\r\nMarseilles. Zounds! how quickly a family like that dwindles away! I\r\ntremble when I think of it! I was fifteen years old then, since I am\r\nfifty-six now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were going to celebrate the Epiphany, and we were all happy, very\r\nhappy! Everybody was in the parlor, awaiting dinner, and my oldest\r\nbrother, Jacques, said: 'There has been a dog howling out in the plain\r\nfor about ten minutes; the poor beast must be lost.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had hardly stopped talking when the garden bell began to ring. It\r\nhad the deep sound of a church bell, which made one think of death. A\r\nshiver ran through everybody. My father called the servant and told him\r\nto go outside and look. We waited in complete silence; we were thinking\r\nof the snow which covered the ground. When the man returned he declared\r\nthat he had seen nothing. The dog kept up its ceaseless howling, and\r\nalways from the same spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sat down to dinner; but we were all uneasy, especially the young\r\npeople. Everything went well up to the roast, then the bell began to\r\nring again, three times in succession, three heavy, long strokes which\r\nvibrated to the tips of our fingers and which stopped our conversation\r\nshort. We sat there looking at each other, fork in the air, still\r\nlistening, and shaken by a kind of supernatural fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last my mother spoke: 'It's surprising that they should have waited\r\nso long to come back. Do not go alone, Baptiste; one of these gentlemen\r\nwill accompany you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Uncle Francois arose. He was a kind of Hercules, very proud of his\r\nstrength, and feared nothing in the world. My father said to him: 'Take\r\na gun. There is no telling what it might be.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my uncle only took a cane and went out with the servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe others remained there trembling with fear and apprehension, without\r\neating or speaking. My father tried to reassure us: 'Just wait and see,'\r\nhe said; 'it will be some beggar or some traveller lost in the snow.\r\nAfter ringing once, seeing that the door was not immediately opened, he\r\nattempted again to find his way, and being unable to, he has returned to\r\nour door.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur uncle seemed to stay away an hour. At last he came back, furious,\r\nswearing: 'Nothing at all; it's some practical joker! There is nothing\r\nbut that damned dog howling away at about a hundred yards from the\r\nwalls. If I had taken a gun I would have killed him to make him keep\r\nquiet.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sat down to dinner again, but every one was excited; we felt that\r\nall was not over, that something was going to happen, that the bell\r\nwould soon ring again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt rang just as the Twelfth Night cake was being cut. All the men\r\njumped up together. My Uncle, Francois, who had been drinking champagne,\r\nswore so furiously that he would murder it, whatever it might be, that\r\nmy mother and my aunt threw themselves on him to prevent his going. My\r\nfather, although very calm and a little helpless (he limped ever since\r\nhe had broken his leg when thrown by a horse), declared, in turn, that\r\nhe wished to find out what was the matter and that he was going. My\r\nbrothers, aged eighteen and twenty, ran to get their guns; and as no one\r\nwas paying any attention to me I snatched up a little rifle that was\r\nused in the garden and got ready to accompany the expedition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt started out immediately. My father and uncle were walking ahead with\r\nBaptiste, who was carrying a lantern. My brothers, Jacques and Paul,\r\nfollowed, and I trailed on behind in spite of the prayers of my mother,\r\nwho stood in front of the house with her sister and my cousins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had been snowing again for the last hour, and the trees were\r\nweighted down. The pines were bending under this heavy, white garment,\r\nand looked like white pyramids or enormous sugar cones, and through the\r\ngray curtains of small hurrying flakes could be seen the lighter bushes\r\nwhich stood out pale in the shadow. The snow was falling so thick that\r\nwe could hardly see ten feet ahead of us. But the lantern threw a bright\r\nlight around us. When we began to go down the winding stairway in the\r\nwall I really grew frightened. I felt as though some one were walking\r\nbehind me, were going to grab me by the shoulders and carry me away, and\r\nI felt a strong desire to return; but, as I would have had to cross the\r\ngarden all alone, I did not dare. I heard some one opening the door\r\nleading to the plain; my uncle began to swear again, exclaiming: 'By\xe2\x80\x94-!\r\nHe has gone again! If I can catch sight of even his shadow, I'll take\r\ncare not to miss him, the swine!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a discouraging thing to see this great expanse of plain, or,\r\nrather, to feel it before us, for we could not see it; we could only see\r\na thick, endless veil of snow, above, below, opposite us, to the right,\r\nto the left, everywhere. My uncle continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Listen! There is the dog howling again; I will teach him how I shoot.\r\nThat will be something gained, anyhow.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my father, who was kind-hearted, went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It will be much better to go on and get the poor animal, who is crying\r\nfor hunger. The poor fellow is barking for help; he is calling like a\r\nman in distress. Let us go to him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we started out through this mist, through this thick continuous fall\r\nof snow, which filled the air, which moved, floated, fell, and chilled\r\nthe skin with a burning sensation like a sharp, rapid pain as each flake\r\nmelted. We were sinking in up to our knees in this soft, cold mass, and\r\nwe had to lift our feet very high in order to walk. As we advanced the\r\ndog's voice became clearer and stronger. My uncle cried: 'Here he is!'\r\nWe stopped to observe him as one does when he meets an enemy at night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could see nothing, so I ran up to the others, and I caught sight of\r\nhim; he was frightful and weird-looking; he was a big black shepherd's\r\ndog with long hair and a wolf's head, standing just within the gleam of\r\nlight cast by our lantern on the snow. He did not move; he was silently\r\nwatching us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle said: 'That's peculiar, he is neither advancing nor\r\nretreating. I feel like taking a shot at him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father answered in a firm voice: 'No, we must capture him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my brother Jacques added: 'But he is not alone. There is something\r\nbehind him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was indeed something behind him, something gray, impossible to\r\ndistinguish. We started out again cautiously. When he saw us approaching\r\nthe dog sat down. He did not look wicked. Instead, he seemed pleased at\r\nhaving been able to attract the attention of some one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father went straight to him and petted him. The dog licked his\r\nhands. We saw that he was tied to the wheel of a little carriage, a sort\r\nof toy carriage entirely wrapped up in three or four woolen blankets. We\r\ncarefully took off these coverings, and as Baptiste approached his\r\nlantern to the front of this little vehicle, which looked like a rolling\r\nkennel, we saw in it a little baby sleeping peacefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were so astonished that we couldn't speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was the first to collect his wits, and as he had a warm heart\r\nand a broad mind, he stretched his hand over the roof of the carriage\r\nand said: 'Poor little waif, you shall be one of us!' And he ordered my\r\nbrother Jacques to roll the foundling ahead of us. Thinking out loud, my\r\nfather continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Some child of love whose poor mother rang at my door on this night of\r\nEpiphany in memory of the Child of God.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe once more stopped and called at the top of his lungs through the\r\nnight to the four corners of the heavens: 'We have found it!' Then,\r\nputting his hand on his brother's shoulder, he murmured: 'What if you\r\nhad shot the dog, Francois?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle did not answer, but in the darkness he crossed himself, for,\r\nnotwithstanding his blustering manner, he was very religious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dog, which had been untied, was following us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! But you should have seen us when we got to the house! At first we\r\nhad a lot of trouble in getting the carriage up through the winding\r\nstairway; but we succeeded and even rolled it into the vestibule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow funny mamma was! How happy and astonished! And my four little\r\ncousins (the youngest was only six), they looked like four chickens\r\naround a nest. At last we took the child from the carriage. It was still\r\nsleeping. It was a girl about six weeks old. In its clothes we found ten\r\nthousand francs in gold, yes, my boy, ten thousand francs!\xe2\x80\x94which papa\r\nsaved for her dowry. Therefore, it was not a child of poor people, but,\r\nperhaps, the child of some nobleman and a little bourgeoise of the\r\ntown\xe2\x80\x94or again\xe2\x80\x94we made a thousand suppositions, but we never found out\r\nanything-never the slightest clue. The dog himself was recognized by no\r\none. He was a stranger in the country. At any rate, the person who rang\r\nthree times at our door must have known my parents well, to have chosen\r\nthem thus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is how, at the age of six weeks, Mademoiselle Pearl entered the\r\nChantal household.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not until later that she was called Mademoiselle Pearl. She was\r\nat first baptized 'Marie Simonne Claire,' Claire being intended, for her\r\nfamily name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can assure you that our return to the diningroom was amusing, with\r\nthis baby now awake and looking round her at these people and these\r\nlights with her vague blue questioning eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sat down to dinner again and the cake was cut. I was king, and for\r\nqueen I took Mademoiselle Pearl, just as you did to-day. On that day she\r\ndid not appreciate the honor that was being shown her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the child was adopted and brought up in the family. She grew, and\r\nthe years flew by. She was so gentle and loving and minded so well that\r\nevery one would have spoiled her abominably had not my mother prevented\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother was an orderly woman with a great respect for class\r\ndistinctions. She consented to treat little Claire as she did her own\r\nsons, but, nevertheless, she wished the distance which separated us to\r\nbe well marked, and our positions well established. Therefore, as soon\r\nas the child could understand, she acquainted her with her story and\r\ngently, even tenderly, impressed on the little one's mind that, for the\r\nChantals, she was an adopted daughter, taken in, but, nevertheless, a\r\nstranger. Claire understood the situation with peculiar intelligence and\r\nwith surprising instinct; she knew how to take the place which was\r\nallotted her, and to keep it with so much tact, gracefulness and\r\ngentleness that she often brought tears to my father's eyes. My mother\r\nherself was often moved by the passionate gratitude and timid devotion\r\nof this dainty and loving little creature that she began calling her:\r\n'My daughter.' At times, when the little one had done something kind and\r\ngood, my mother would raise her spectacles on her forehead, a thing\r\nwhich always indicated emotion with her, and she would repeat: 'This\r\nchild is a pearl, a perfect pearl!' This name stuck to the little\r\nClaire, who became and remained for us Mademoiselle Pearl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nM. Chantal stopped. He was sitting on the edge of the billiard table,\r\nhis feet hanging, and was playing with a ball with his left hand, while\r\nwith his right he crumpled a rag which served to rub the chalk marks\r\nfrom the slate. A little red in the face, his voice thick, he was\r\ntalking away to himself now, lost in his memories, gently drifting\r\nthrough the old scenes and events which awoke in his mind, just as we\r\nwalk through old family gardens where we were brought up and where each\r\ntree, each walk, each hedge reminds us of some occurrence.\r\n\r\nI stood opposite him leaning against the wall, my hands resting on my\r\nidle cue.\r\n\r\nAfter a slight pause he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! She was pretty at eighteen\xe2\x80\x94and graceful\xe2\x80\x94and perfect. Ah! She\r\nwas so sweet\xe2\x80\x94and good and true\xe2\x80\x94and charming! She had such eyes\xe2\x80\x94blue-\r\ntransparent\xe2\x80\x94clear\xe2\x80\x94such eyes as I have never seen since!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was once more silent. I asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did she never marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered, not to me, but to the word \xe2\x80\x9cmarry\xe2\x80\x9d which had caught his\r\near: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? why? She never would\xe2\x80\x94she never would! She had a dowry of\r\nthirty thousand francs, and she received several offers\xe2\x80\x94but she never\r\nwould! She seemed sad at that time. That was when I married my cousin,\r\nlittle Charlotte, my wife, to whom I had been engaged for six years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at M. Chantal, and it seemed to me that I was looking into his\r\nvery soul, and I was suddenly witnessing one of those humble and cruel\r\ntragedies of honest, straightforward, blameless hearts, one of those\r\nsecret tragedies known to no one, not even the silent and resigned\r\nvictims. A rash curiosity suddenly impelled me to exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have married her, Monsieur Chantal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started, looked at me, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Marry whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Pearl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you loved her more than your cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared at me with strange, round, bewildered eyes and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved her\xe2\x80\x94I? How? Who told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, anyone can see that\xe2\x80\x94and it's even on account of her that you\r\ndelayed for so long your marriage to your cousin who had been waiting\r\nfor you for six years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped the ball which he was holding in his left hand, and, seizing\r\nthe chalk rag in both hands, he buried his face in it and began to sob.\r\nHe was weeping with his eyes, nose and mouth in a heartbreaking yet\r\nridiculous manner, like a sponge which one squeezes. He was coughing,\r\nspitting and blowing his nose in the chalk rag, wiping his eyes and\r\nsneezing; then the tears would again begin to flow down the wrinkles on\r\nhis face and he would make a strange gurgling noise in his throat. I\r\nfelt bewildered, ashamed; I wanted to run away, and I no longer knew\r\nwhat to say, do, or attempt.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Madame Chantal's voice sounded on the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven't you men\r\nalmost finished smoking your cigars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI opened the door and cried: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame, we are coming right down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I rushed to her husband, and, seizing him by the shoulders, I\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Chantal, my friend Chantal, listen to me; your wife is\r\ncalling; pull yourself together, we must go downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94I am coming\xe2\x80\x94poor girl! I am coming\xe2\x80\x94tell her that\r\nI am coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began conscientiously to wipe his face on the cloth which, for the\r\nlast two or three years, had been used for marking off the chalk from\r\nthe slate; then he appeared, half white and half red, his forehead,\r\nnose, cheeks and chin covered with chalk, and his eyes swollen, still\r\nfull of tears.\r\n\r\nI caught him by the hands and dragged him into his bedroom, muttering:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, I beg your pardon, Monsieur Chantal, for having\r\ncaused you such sorrow\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94I did not know\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe squeezed my hand, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94there are difficult moments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he plunged his face into a bowl of water. When he emerged from it\r\nhe did not yet seem to me to be presentable; but I thought of a little\r\nstratagem. As he was growing worried, looking at himself in the mirror,\r\nI said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cAll you have to do is to say that a little dust flew\r\ninto your eye and you can cry before everybody to your heart's content.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs rubbing his eyes with his handkerchief. All were\r\nworried; each one wished to look for the speck, which could not be\r\nfound; and stories were told of similar cases where it had been\r\nnecessary to call in a physician.\r\n\r\nI went over to Mademoiselle Pearl and watched her, tormented by an\r\nardent curiosity, which was turning to positive suffering. She must\r\nindeed have been pretty, with her gentle, calm eyes, so large that it\r\nlooked as though she never closed them like other mortals. Her gown was\r\na little ridiculous, a real old maid's gown, which was unbecoming\r\nwithout appearing clumsy.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me as though I were looking into her soul, just as I had\r\ninto Monsieur Chantal's; that I was looking right from one end to the\r\nother of this humble life, so simple and devoted. I felt an irresistible\r\nlonging to question her, to find out whether she, too, had loved him;\r\nwhether she also had suffered, as he had, from this long, secret,\r\npoignant grief, which one cannot see, know, or guess, but which breaks\r\nforth at night in the loneliness of the dark room. I was watching her,\r\nand I could observe her heart beating under her waist, and I wondered\r\nwhether this sweet, candid face had wept on the soft pillow and she had\r\nsobbed, her whole body shaken by the violence of her anguish.\r\n\r\nI said to her in a low voice, like a child who is breaking a toy to see\r\nwhat is inside: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could have seen Monsieur Chantal crying a while\r\nago it would have moved you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started, asking: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? He was weeping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, he was indeed weeping!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed deeply moved. I answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my account?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He was telling me how much he had loved you in the days gone by;\r\nand what a pang it had given him to marry his cousin instead of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer pale face seemed to grow a little longer; her calm eyes, which\r\nalways remained open, suddenly closed so quickly that they seemed shut\r\nforever. She slipped from her chair to the floor, and slowly, gently\r\nsank down as would a fallen garment.\r\n\r\nI cried: \xe2\x80\x9cHelp! help! Mademoiselle Pearl is ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Chantal and her daughters rushed forward, and while they were\r\nlooking for towels, water and vinegar, I grabbed my hat and ran away.\r\n\r\nI walked away with rapid strides, my heart heavy, my mind full of\r\nremorse and regret. And yet sometimes I felt pleased; I felt as though I\r\nhad done a praiseworthy and necessary act. I was asking myself: \xe2\x80\x9cDid I\r\ndo wrong or right?\xe2\x80\x9d They had that shut up in their hearts, just as some\r\npeople carry a bullet in a closed wound. Will they not be happier now?\r\nIt was too late for their torture to begin over again and early enough\r\nfor them to remember it with tenderness.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps some evening next spring, moved by a beam of moonlight\r\nfalling through the branches on the grass at their feet, they will join\r\nand press their hands in memory of all this cruel and suppressed\r\nsuffering; and, perhaps, also this short embrace may infuse in their\r\nveins a little of this thrill which they would not have known without\r\nit, and will give to those two dead souls, brought to life in a second,\r\nthe rapid and divine sensation of this intoxication, of this madness\r\nwhich gives to lovers more happiness in an instant than other men can\r\ngather during a whole lifetime!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIEF\r\n\r\nWhile apparently thinking of something else, Dr. Sorbier had been\r\nlistening quietly to those amazing accounts of burglaries and daring\r\ndeeds that might have been taken from the trial of Cartouche.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cassuredly, I know of no viler fault nor any\r\nmeaner action than to attack a girl's innocence, to corrupt her, to\r\nprofit by a moment of unconscious weakness and of madness, when her\r\nheart is beating like that of a frightened fawn, and her pure lips seek\r\nthose of her tempter; when she abandons herself without thinking of the\r\nirremediable stain, nor of her fall, nor of the morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who has brought this about slowly, viciously, who can tell with\r\nwhat science of evil, and who, in such a case, has not steadiness and\r\nself-restraint enough to quench that flame by some icy words, who has\r\nnot sense enough for two, who cannot recover his self-possession and\r\nmaster the runaway brute within him, and who loses his head on the edge\r\nof the precipice over which she is going to fall, is as contemptible as\r\nany man who breaks open a lock, or as any rascal on the lookout for a\r\nhouse left defenceless and unprotected or for some easy and dishonest\r\nstroke of business, or as that thief whose various exploits you have\r\njust related to us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, for my part, utterly refuse to absolve him, even when extenuating\r\ncircumstances plead in his favor, even when he is carrying on a\r\ndangerous flirtation, in which a man tries in vain to keep his balance,\r\nnot to exceed the limits of the game, any more than at lawn tennis; even\r\nwhen the parts are inverted and a man's adversary is some precocious,\r\ncurious, seductive girl, who shows you immediately that she has nothing\r\nto learn and nothing to experience, except the last chapter of love, one\r\nof those girls from whom may fate always preserve our sons, and whom a\r\npsychological novel writer has christened 'The Semi-Virgins.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, of course, difficult and painful for that coarse and\r\nunfathomable vanity which is characteristic of every man, and which\r\nmight be called 'malism', not to stir such a charming fire, difficult to\r\nact the Joseph and the fool, to turn away his eyes, and, as it were, to\r\nput wax into his ears, like the companions of Ulysses when they were\r\nattracted by the divine, seductive songs of the Sirens, difficult only\r\nto touch that pretty table covered with a perfectly new cloth, at which\r\nyou are invited to take a seat before any one else, in such a suggestive\r\nvoice, and are requested to quench your thirst and to taste that new\r\nwine, whose fresh and strange flavor you will never forget. But who\r\nwould hesitate to exercise such self-restraint if, when he rapidly\r\nexamines his conscience, in one of those instinctive returns to his\r\nsober self in which a man thinks clearly and recovers his head, he were\r\nto measure the gravity of his fault, consider it, think of its\r\nconsequences, of the reprisals, of the uneasiness which he would always\r\nfeel in the future, and which would destroy the repose and happiness of\r\nhis life?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may guess that behind all these moral reflections, such as a\r\ngraybeard like myself may indulge in, there is a story hidden, and, sad\r\nas it is, I am sure it will interest you on account of the strange\r\nheroism it shows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a few moments, as if to classify his recollections,\r\nand, with his elbows resting on the arms of his easy-chair and his eyes\r\nlooking into space, he continued in the slow voice of a hospital\r\nprofessor who is explaining a case to his class of medical students, at\r\na bedside:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was one of those men who, as our grandfathers used to say, never met\r\nwith a cruel woman, the type of the adventurous knight who was always\r\nforaging, who had something of the scamp about him, but who despised\r\ndanger and was bold even to rashness. He was ardent in the pursuit of\r\npleasure, and had an irresistible charm about him, one of those men in\r\nwhom we excuse the greatest excesses as the most natural things in the\r\nworld. He had run through all his money at gambling and with pretty\r\ngirls, and so became, as it were, a soldier of fortune. He amused\r\nhimself whenever and however he could, and was at that time quartered at\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew him to the very depths of his childlike heart, which was only\r\ntoo easily seen through and sounded, and I loved him as some old\r\nbachelor uncle loves a nephew who plays him tricks, but who knows how to\r\ncoax him. He had made me his confidant rather than his adviser, kept me\r\ninformed of his slightest pranks, though he always pretended to be\r\nspeaking about one of his friends, and not about himself; and I must\r\nconfess that his youthful impetuosity, his careless gaiety, and his\r\namorous ardor sometimes distracted my thoughts and made me envy the\r\nhandsome, vigorous young fellow who was so happy at being alive, that I\r\nhad not the courage to check him, to show him the right road, and to\r\ncall out to him: 'Take care!' as children do at blind man's buff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd one day, after one of those interminable cotillons, where the\r\ncouples do not leave each other for hours, and can disappear together\r\nwithout anybody thinking of noticing them, the poor fellow at last\r\ndiscovered what love was, that real love which takes up its abode in the\r\nvery centre of the heart and in the brain, and is proud of being there,\r\nand which rules like a sovereign and a tyrannous master, and he became\r\ndesperately enamored of a pretty but badly brought up girl, who was as\r\ndisquieting and wayward as she was pretty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe loved him, however, or rather she idolized him despotically, madly,\r\nwith all her enraptured soul and all her being. Left to do as she\r\npleased by imprudent and frivolous parents, suffering from neurosis, in\r\nconsequence of the unwholesome friendships which she contracted at the\r\nconvent school, instructed by what she saw and heard and knew was going\r\non around her, in spite of her deceitful and artificial conduct, knowing\r\nthat neither her father nor her mother, who were very proud of their\r\nrace as well as avaricious, would ever agree to let her marry the man\r\nwhom she had taken a liking to, that handsome fellow who had little\r\nbesides vision, ideas and debts, and who belonged to the middle-class,\r\nshe laid aside all scruples, thought of nothing but of becoming his, no\r\nmatter what might be the cost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy degrees, the unfortunate man's strength gave way, his heart\r\nsoftened, and he allowed himself to be carried away by that current\r\nwhich buffeted him, surrounded him, and left him on the shore like a\r\nwaif and a stray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wrote letters full of madness to each other, and not a day passed\r\nwithout their meeting, either accidentally, as it seemed, or at parties\r\nand balls. She had yielded her lips to him in long, ardent caresses,\r\nwhich had sealed their compact of mutual passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor stopped, and his eyes suddenly filled with tears, as these\r\nformer troubles came back to his mind; and then, in a hoarse voice, he\r\nwent on, full of the horror of what he was going to relate:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor months he scaled the garden wall, and, holding his breath and\r\nlistening for the slightest noise, like a burglar who is going to break\r\ninto a house, he went in by the servants' entrance, which she had left\r\nopen, slunk barefoot down a long passage and up the broad staircase,\r\nwhich creaked occasionally, to the second story, where his sweetheart's\r\nroom was, and stayed there for hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night, when it was darker than usual, and he was hurrying lest he\r\nshould be later than the time agreed on, he knocked up against a piece\r\nof furniture in the anteroom and upset it. It so happened that the\r\ngirl's mother had not gone to sleep, either because she had a sick\r\nheadache, or else because she had sat up late over some novel, and,\r\nfrightened at that unusual noise which disturbed the silence of the\r\nhouse, she jumped out of bed, opened the door, saw some one indistinctly\r\nrunning away and keeping close to the wall, and, immediately thinking\r\nthat there were burglars in the house, she aroused her husband and the\r\nservants by her frantic screams. The unfortunate man understood the\r\nsituation; and, seeing what a terrible fix he was in, and preferring to\r\nbe taken for a common thief to dishonoring his adored one's name, he ran\r\ninto the drawing-room, felt on the tables and what-nots, filled his\r\npockets at random with valuable bric-a-brac, and then cowered down\r\nbehind the grand piano, which barred the corner of a large room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants, who had run in with lighted candles, found him, and,\r\noverwhelming him with abuse, seized him by the collar and dragged him,\r\npanting and apparently half dead with shame and terror, to the nearest\r\npolice station. He defended himself with intentional awkwardness when he\r\nwas brought up for trial, kept up his part with the most perfect self-\r\npossession and without any signs of the despair and anguish that he felt\r\nin his heart, and, condemned and degraded and made to suffer martyrdom\r\nin his honor as a man and a soldier\xe2\x80\x94he was an officer\xe2\x80\x94he did not\r\nprotest, but went to prison as one of those criminals whom society gets\r\nrid of like noxious vermin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe died there of misery and of bitterness of spirit, with the name of\r\nthe fair-haired idol, for whom he had sacrificed himself, on his lips,\r\nas if it had been an ecstatic prayer, and he intrusted his will 'to the\r\npriest who administered extreme unction to him, and requested him to\r\ngive it to me. In it, without mentioning anybody, and without in the\r\nleast lifting the veil, he at last explained the enigma, and cleared\r\nhimself of those accusations the terrible burden of which he had borne\r\nuntil his last breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always thought myself, though I do not know why, that the girl\r\nmarried and had several charming children, whom she brought up with the\r\naustere strictness and in the serious piety of former days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAIR DE LUNE\r\n\r\nAbbe Marignan's martial name suited him well. He was a tall, thin\r\npriest, fanatic, excitable, yet upright. All his beliefs were fixed,\r\nnever varying. He believed sincerely that he knew his God, understood\r\nHis plans, desires and intentions.\r\n\r\nWhen he walked with long strides along the garden walk of his little\r\ncountry parsonage, he would sometimes ask himself the question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy has\r\nGod done this?\xe2\x80\x9d And he would dwell on this continually, putting himself\r\nin the place of God, and he almost invariably found an answer. He would\r\nnever have cried out in an outburst of pious humility: \xe2\x80\x9cThy ways, O\r\nLord, are past finding out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI am the servant of God; it is right for me to know\r\nthe reason of His deeds, or to guess it if I do not know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything in nature seemed to him to have been created in accordance\r\nwith an admirable and absolute logic. The \xe2\x80\x9cwhys\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbecauses\xe2\x80\x9d always\r\nbalanced. Dawn was given to make our awakening pleasant, the days to\r\nripen the harvest, the rains to moisten it, the evenings for preparation\r\nfor slumber, and the dark nights for sleep.\r\n\r\nThe four seasons corresponded perfectly to the needs of agriculture, and\r\nno suspicion had ever come to the priest of the fact that nature has no\r\nintentions; that, on the contrary, everything which exists must conform\r\nto the hard demands of seasons, climates and matter.\r\n\r\nBut he hated woman\xe2\x80\x94hated her unconsciously, and despised her by\r\ninstinct. He often repeated the words of Christ: \xe2\x80\x9cWoman, what have I to\r\ndo with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d and he would add: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems as though God, Himself, were\r\ndissatisfied with this work of His.\xe2\x80\x9d She was the tempter who led the\r\nfirst man astray, and who since then had ever been busy with her work of\r\ndamnation, the feeble creature, dangerous and mysteriously affecting\r\none. And even more than their sinful bodies, he hated their loving\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nHe had often felt their tenderness directed toward himself, and though\r\nhe knew that he was invulnerable, he grew angry at this need of love\r\nthat is always vibrating in them.\r\n\r\nAccording to his belief, God had created woman for the sole purpose of\r\ntempting and testing man. One must not approach her without defensive\r\nprecautions and fear of possible snares. She was, indeed, just like a\r\nsnare, with her lips open and her arms stretched out to man.\r\n\r\nHe had no indulgence except for nuns, whom their vows had rendered\r\ninoffensive; but he was stern with them, nevertheless, because he felt\r\nthat at the bottom of their fettered and humble hearts the everlasting\r\ntenderness was burning brightly\xe2\x80\x94that tenderness which was shown even to\r\nhim, a priest.\r\n\r\nHe felt this cursed tenderness, even in their docility, in the low tones\r\nof their voices when speaking to him, in their lowered eyes, and in\r\ntheir resigned tears when he reproved them roughly. And he would shake\r\nhis cassock on leaving the convent doors, and walk off, lengthening his\r\nstride as though flying from danger.\r\n\r\nHe had a niece who lived with her mother in a little house near him. He\r\nwas bent upon making a sister of charity of her.\r\n\r\nShe was a pretty, brainless madcap. When the abbe preached she laughed,\r\nand when he was angry with her she would give him a hug, drawing him to\r\nher heart, while he sought unconsciously to release himself from this\r\nembrace which nevertheless filled him with a sweet pleasure, awakening\r\nin his depths the sensation of paternity which slumbers in every man.\r\n\r\nOften, when walking by her side, along the country road, he would speak\r\nto her of God, of his God. She never listened to him, but looked about\r\nher at the sky, the grass and flowers, and one could see the joy of life\r\nsparkling in her eyes. Sometimes she would dart forward to catch some\r\nflying creature, crying out as she brought it back: \xe2\x80\x9cLook, uncle, how\r\npretty it is! I want to hug it!\xe2\x80\x9d And this desire to \xe2\x80\x9chug\xe2\x80\x9d flies or lilac\r\nblossoms disquieted, angered, and roused the priest, who saw, even in\r\nthis, the ineradicable tenderness that is always budding in women's\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nThen there came a day when the sexton's wife, who kept house for Abbe\r\nMarignan, told him, with caution, that his niece had a lover.\r\n\r\nAlmost suffocated by the fearful emotion this news roused in him, he\r\nstood there, his face covered with soap, for he was in the act of\r\nshaving.\r\n\r\nWhen he had sufficiently recovered to think and speak he cried: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nnot true; you lie, Melanie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the peasant woman put her hand on her heart, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cMay our Lord\r\njudge me if I lie, Monsieur le Cure! I tell you, she goes there every\r\nnight when your sister has gone to bed. They meet by the river side; you\r\nhave only to go there and see, between ten o'clock and midnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased scraping his chin, and began to walk up and down impetuously,\r\nas he always did when he was in deep thought. When he began shaving\r\nagain he cut himself three times from his nose to his ear.\r\n\r\nAll day long he was silent, full of anger and indignation. To his\r\npriestly hatred of this invincible love was added the exasperation of\r\nher spiritual father, of her guardian and pastor, deceived and tricked\r\nby a child, and the selfish emotion shown by parents when their daughter\r\nannounces that she has chosen a husband without them, and in spite of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he tried to read a little, but could not, growing more and,\r\nmore angry. When ten o'clock struck he seized his cane, a formidable oak\r\nstick, which he was accustomed to carry in his nocturnal walks when\r\nvisiting the sick. And he smiled at the enormous club which he twirled\r\nin a threatening manner in his strong, country fist. Then he raised it\r\nsuddenly and, gritting his teeth, brought it down on a chair, the broken\r\nback of which fell over on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door to go out, but stopped on the sill, surprised by the\r\nsplendid moonlight, of such brilliance as is seldom seen.\r\n\r\nAnd, as he was gifted with an emotional nature, one such as had all\r\nthose poetic dreamers, the Fathers of the Church, he felt suddenly\r\ndistracted and moved by all the grand and serene beauty of this pale\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIn his little garden, all bathed in soft light, his fruit trees in a row\r\ncast on the ground the shadow of their slender branches, scarcely in\r\nfull leaf, while the giant honeysuckle, clinging to the wall of his\r\nhouse, exhaled a delicious sweetness, filling the warm moonlit\r\natmosphere with a kind of perfumed soul.\r\n\r\nHe began to take long breaths, drinking in the air as drunkards drink\r\nwine, and he walked along slowly, delighted, marveling, almost\r\nforgetting his niece.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was outside of the garden, he stopped to gaze upon the\r\nplain all flooded with the caressing light, bathed in that tender,\r\nlanguishing charm of serene nights. At each moment was heard the short,\r\nmetallic note of the cricket, and distant nightingales shook out their\r\nscattered notes\xe2\x80\x94their light, vibrant music that sets one dreaming,\r\nwithout thinking, a music made for kisses, for the seduction of\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nThe abbe walked on again, his heart failing, though he knew not why. He\r\nseemed weakened, suddenly exhausted; he wanted to sit down, to rest\r\nthere, to think, to admire God in His works.\r\n\r\nDown yonder, following the undulations of the little river, a great line\r\nof poplars wound in and out. A fine mist, a white haze through which the\r\nmoonbeams passed, silvering it and making it gleam, hung around and\r\nabove the mountains, covering all the tortuous course of the water with\r\na kind of light and transparent cotton.\r\n\r\nThe priest stopped once again, his soul filled with a growing and\r\nirresistible tenderness.\r\n\r\nAnd a doubt, a vague feeling of disquiet came over him; he was asking\r\none of those questions that he sometimes put to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did God make this? Since the night is destined for sleep,\r\nunconsciousness, repose, forgetfulness of everything, why make it more\r\ncharming than day, softer than dawn or evening? And why does this\r\nseductive planet, more poetic than the sun, that seems destined, so\r\ndiscreet is it, to illuminate things too delicate and mysterious for the\r\nlight of day, make the darkness so transparent?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does not the greatest of feathered songsters sleep like the others?\r\nWhy does it pour forth its voice in the mysterious night?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy this half-veil cast over the world? Why these tremblings of the\r\nheart, this emotion of the spirit, this enervation of the body? Why this\r\ndisplay of enchantments that human beings do not see, since they are\r\nlying in their beds? For whom is destined this sublime spectacle, this\r\nabundance of poetry cast from heaven to earth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the abbe could not understand.\r\n\r\nBut see, out there, on the edge of the meadow, under the arch of trees\r\nbathed in a shining mist, two figures are walking side by side.\r\n\r\nThe man was the taller, and held his arm about his sweetheart's neck and\r\nkissed her brow every little while. They imparted life, all at once, to\r\nthe placid landscape in which they were framed as by a heavenly hand.\r\nThe two seemed but a single being, the being for whom was destined this\r\ncalm and silent night, and they came toward the priest as a living\r\nanswer, the response his Master sent to his questionings.\r\n\r\nHe stood still, his heart beating, all upset; and it seemed to him that\r\nhe saw before him some biblical scene, like the loves of Ruth and Boaz,\r\nthe accomplishment of the will of the Lord, in some of those glorious\r\nstories of which the sacred books tell. The verses of the Song of Songs\r\nbegan to ring in his ears, the appeal of passion, all the poetry of this\r\npoem replete with tenderness.\r\n\r\nAnd he said unto himself: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps God has made such nights as these to\r\nidealize the love of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrank back from this couple that still advanced with arms\r\nintertwined. Yet it was his niece. But he asked himself now if he would\r\nnot be disobeying God. And does not God permit love, since He surrounds\r\nit with such visible splendor?\r\n\r\nAnd he went back musing, almost ashamed, as if he had intruded into a\r\ntemple where he had, no right to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAITER, A \xe2\x80\x9cBOCK\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy did I go into that beer hall on that particular evening? I do not\r\nknow. It was cold; a fine rain, a flying mist, veiled the gas lamps with\r\na transparent fog, made the side walks reflect the light that streamed\r\nfrom the shop windows\xe2\x80\x94lighting up the soft slush and the muddy feet of\r\nthe passers-by.\r\n\r\nI was going nowhere in particular; was simply having a short walk after\r\ndinner. I had passed the Credit Lyonnais, the Rue Vivienne, and several\r\nother streets. I suddenly descried a large beer hall which was more than\r\nhalf full. I walked inside, with no object in view. I was not the least\r\nthirsty.\r\n\r\nI glanced round to find a place that was not too crowded, and went and\r\nsat down by the side of a man who seemed to me to be old, and who was\r\nsmoking a two-sous clay pipe, which was as black as coal. From six to\r\neight glasses piled up on the table in front of him indicated the number\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cbocks\xe2\x80\x9d he had already absorbed. At a glance I recognized a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cregular,\xe2\x80\x9d one of those frequenters of beer houses who come in the\r\nmorning when the place opens, and do not leave till evening when it is\r\nabout to close. He was dirty, bald on top of his head, with a fringe of\r\niron-gray hair falling on the collar of his frock coat. His clothes,\r\nmuch too large for him, appeared to have been made for him at a time\r\nwhen he was corpulent. One could guess that he did not wear suspenders,\r\nfor he could not take ten steps without having to stop to pull up his\r\ntrousers. Did he wear a vest? The mere thought of his boots and of that\r\nwhich they covered filled me with horror. The frayed cuffs were\r\nperfectly black at the edges, as were his nails.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had seated myself beside him, this individual said to me in\r\na quiet tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow goes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned sharply round and closely scanned his features, whereupon he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you do not recognize me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDes Barrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was stupefied. It was Count Jean des Barrets, my old college chum.\r\n\r\nI seized him by the hand, and was so dumbfounded that I could find\r\nnothing to say. At length I managed to stammer out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, how goes it with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe responded placidly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI get along as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing now?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see what I am doing,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered quit resignedly.\r\n\r\nI felt my face getting red. I insisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut every day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery day it is the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply, accompanied with a\r\nthick puff of tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\nHe then tapped with a sou on the top of the marble table, to attract the\r\nattention of the waiter, and called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiter, two 'bocks.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA voice in the distance repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo bocks for the fourth table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother voice, more distant still, shouted out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately a man with a white apron appeared, carrying two \xe2\x80\x9cbocks,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich he set down, foaming, on the table, spilling some of the yellow\r\nliquid on the sandy floor in his haste.\r\n\r\nDes Barrets emptied his glass at a single draught and replaced it on the\r\ntable, while he sucked in the foam that had been left on his mustache.\r\nHe next asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there new?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI really had nothing new to tell him. I stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, old man. I am a business man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his monotonous tone of voice he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, does it amuse you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but what can I do? One must do something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo as to have occupation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the use of an occupation? For my part, I do nothing at all, as\r\nyou see, never anything. When one has not a sou I can understand why one\r\nshould work. But when one has enough to live on, what's the use? What is\r\nthe good of working? Do you work for yourself, or for others? If you\r\nwork for yourself, you do it for your own amusement, which is all right;\r\nif you work for others, you are a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, laying his pipe on the marble table, he called out anew:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiter, a 'bock.'\xe2\x80\x9d And continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me thirsty to keep calling\r\nso. I am not accustomed to that sort of thing. Yes, yes, I do nothing. I\r\nlet things slide, and I am growing old. In dying I shall have nothing to\r\nregret. My only remembrance will be this beer hall. No wife, no\r\nchildren, no cares, no sorrows, nothing. That is best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then emptied the glass which had been brought him, passed his tongue\r\nover his lips, and resumed his pipe.\r\n\r\nI looked at him in astonishment, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have not always been like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me; ever since I left college.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not a proper life to lead, my dear fellow; it is simply\r\nhorrible. Come, you must have something to do, you must love something,\r\nyou must have friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I get up at noon, I come here, I have my breakfast, I drink my\r\nbeer, I remain until the evening, I have my dinner, I drink beer. Then\r\nabout half-past one in the morning, I go home to bed, because the place\r\ncloses up; that annoys me more than anything. In the last ten years I\r\nhave passed fully six years on this bench, in my corner; and the other\r\nfour in my bed, nowhere else. I sometimes chat with the regular\r\ncustomers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when you came to Paris what did you do at first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI paid my devoirs to the Cafe de Medicis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext I crossed the water and came here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you take that trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? One cannot remain all one's life in the Latin\r\nQuarter. The students make too much noise. Now I shall not move again.\r\nWaiter, a 'bock.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to think that he was making fun of me, and I continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, be frank. You have been the victim of some great sorrow; some\r\ndisappointment in love, no doubt! It is easy to see that you are a man\r\nwho has had some trouble. What age are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thirty, but I look forty-five, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked him straight in the face. His wrinkled, ill-shaven face gave\r\none the impression that he was an old man. On the top of his head a few\r\nlong hairs waved over a skin of doubtful cleanliness. He had enormous\r\neyelashes, a heavy mustache, and a thick beard. Suddenly I had a kind of\r\nvision, I know not why, of a basin filled with dirty water in which all\r\nthat hair had been washed. I said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly look older than your age. You surely must have\r\nexperienced some great sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you that I have not. I am old because I never go out into the\r\nair. Nothing makes a man deteriorate more than the life of a cafe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI still could not believe him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must surely also have been married? One could not get as bald-\r\nheaded as you are without having been in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, shaking dandruff down on his coat as he did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have always been virtuous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, raising his eyes toward the chandelier which heated our heads, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am bald, it is the fault of the gas. It destroys the hair. Waiter,\r\na 'bock.' Are you not thirsty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you. But you really interest me. Since when have you been so\r\nmorbid? Your life is not normal, it is not natural. There is something\r\nbeneath it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and it dates from my infancy. I received a great shock when I was\r\nvery young, and that turned my life into darkness which will last to the\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to know about it? Well, then, listen. You recall, of course,\r\nthe castle in which I was brought up, for you used to spend five or six\r\nmonths there during vacation. You remember that large gray building, in\r\nthe middle of a great park, and the long avenues of oaks which opened to\r\nthe four points of the compass. You remember my father and mother, both\r\nof whom were ceremonious, solemn, and severe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI worshipped my mother; I was afraid of my father; but I respected\r\nboth, accustomed always as I was to see every one bow before them. They\r\nwere Monsieur le Comte and Madame la Comtesse to all the country round,\r\nand our neighbors, the Tannemares, the Ravelets, the Brennevilles,\r\nshowed them the utmost consideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was then thirteen years old. I was happy, pleased with everything, as\r\none is at that age, full of the joy of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, toward the end of September, a few days before returning to\r\ncollege, as I was playing about in the shrubbery of the park, among the\r\nbranches and leaves, as I was crossing a path, I saw my father and\r\nmother, who were walking along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recall it as though it were yesterday. It was a very windy day. The\r\nwhole line of trees swayed beneath the gusts of wind, groaning, and\r\nseeming to utter cries-those dull, deep cries that forests give out\r\nduring a tempest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe falling leaves, turning yellow, flew away like birds, circling and\r\nfalling, and then running along the path like swift animals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvening came on. It was dark in the thickets. The motion of the wind\r\nand of the branches excited me, made me tear about as if I were crazy,\r\nand howl in imitation of the wolves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I perceived my parents, I crept furtively toward them, under\r\nthe branches, in order to surprise them, as though I had been a\r\nveritable prowler. But I stopped in fear a few paces from them. My\r\nfather, who was in a terrible passion, cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Your mother is a fool; moreover, it is not a question of your mother.\r\nIt is you. I tell you that I need this money, and I want you to sign\r\nthis.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother replied in a firm voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I will not sign it. It is Jean's fortune. I shall guard it for him and\r\nI will not allow you to squander it with strange women, as you have your\r\nown heritage.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my father, trembling with rage, wheeled round and, seizing his\r\nwife by the throat, began to slap her with all his might full in the\r\nface with his disengaged hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother's hat fell off, her hair became loosened and fell over her\r\nshoulders; she tried to parry the blows, but she could not do so. And my\r\nfather, like a madman, kept on striking her. My mother rolled over on\r\nthe ground, covering her face with her hands. Then he turned her over on\r\nher back in order to slap her still more, pulling away her hands, which\r\nwere covering her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for me, my friend, it seemed as though the world was coming to an\r\nend, that the eternal laws had changed. I experienced the overwhelming\r\ndread that one has in presence of things supernatural, in presence of\r\nirreparable disasters. My childish mind was bewildered, distracted. I\r\nbegan to cry with all my might, without knowing why; a prey to a fearful\r\ndread, sorrow, and astonishment. My father heard me, turned round, and,\r\non seeing me, started toward me. I believe that he wanted to kill me,\r\nand I fled like a hunted animal, running straight ahead into the\r\nthicket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ran perhaps for an hour, perhaps for two. I know not. Darkness set\r\nin. I sank on the grass, exhausted, and lay there dismayed, frantic with\r\nfear, and devoured by a sorrow capable of breaking forever the heart of\r\na poor child. I was cold, hungry, perhaps. At length day broke. I was\r\nafraid to get up, to walk, to return home, to run farther, fearing to\r\nencounter my father, whom I did not wish to see again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should probably have died of misery and of hunger at the foot of a\r\ntree if the park guard had not discovered me and led me home by force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found my parents looking as usual. My mother alone spoke to me \xe2\x80\x9c'How\r\nyou frightened me, you naughty boy. I lay awake the whole night.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not answer, but began to weep. My father did not utter a single\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight days later I returned to school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friend, it was all over with me. I had witnessed the other\r\nside of things, the bad side. I have not been able to perceive the good\r\nside since that day. What has taken place in my mind, what strange\r\nphenomenon has warped my ideas, I do not know. But I no longer had a\r\ntaste for anything, a wish for anything, a love for anybody, a desire\r\nfor anything whatever, any ambition, or any hope. And I always see my\r\npoor mother on the ground, in the park, my father beating her. My mother\r\ndied some years later; my, father still lives. I have not seen him\r\nsince. Waiter, a 'bock.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA waiter brought him his \xe2\x80\x9cbock,\xe2\x80\x9d which he swallowed at a gulp. But, in\r\ntaking up his pipe again, trembling as he was, he broke it. \xe2\x80\x9cConfound\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a gesture of annoyance. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a real sorrow. It\r\nwill take me a month to color another!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he called out across the vast hall, now reeking with smoke and full\r\nof men drinking, his everlasting: \xe2\x80\x9cGarcon, un 'bock'\xe2\x80\x94and a new pipe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER \xe2\x80\x9cMy darlings,\xe2\x80\x9d said the comtesse, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three children, two girls and a boy, rose and kissed their\r\ngrandmother. Then they said good-night to M. le Cure, who had dined at\r\nthe chateau, as was his custom every Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Mauduit lifted two of the children on his knees, passing his\r\nlong arms clad in black round their necks, and kissing them tenderly on\r\nthe forehead as he drew their heads toward him as a father might.\r\n\r\nThen he set them down on the ground, and the little beings went off, the\r\nboy ahead, and the girls following.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are fond of children, M. le Cure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the comtesse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery fond, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman raised her bright eyes toward the priest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94has your solitude never weighed too heavily on you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe became silent, hesitated, and then added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I was never made for\r\nordinary life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know very well. I was made to be a priest; I followed my\r\nvocation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe comtesse kept staring at him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, M. le Cure, tell me this\xe2\x80\x94tell me how it was you resolved to\r\nrenounce forever all that makes the rest of us love life\xe2\x80\x94all that\r\nconsoles and sustains us? What is it that drove you, impelled you, to\r\nseparate yourself from the great natural path of marriage and the\r\nfamily? You are neither an enthusiast nor a fanatic, neither a gloomy\r\nperson nor a sad person. Was it some incident, some sorrow, that led you\r\nto take life vows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Mauduit rose and approached the fire, then, holding toward the\r\nflame his big shoes, such as country priests generally wear, he seemed\r\nstill hesitating as to what reply he should make.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall old man with white hair, and for the last twenty years had\r\nbeen pastor of the parish of Saint-Antoine-du-Rocher. The peasants said\r\nof him: \xe2\x80\x9cThere's a good man for you!\xe2\x80\x9d And indeed he was a good man,\r\nbenevolent, friendly to all, gentle, and, to crown all, generous. Like\r\nSaint Martin, he would have cut his cloak in two. He laughed readily,\r\nand wept also, on slight provocation, just like a woman\xe2\x80\x94which prejudiced\r\nhim more or less in the hard minds of the country folk.\r\n\r\nThe old Comtesse de Saville, living in retirement in her chateau of\r\nRocher, in order to bring up her grandchildren, after the successive\r\ndeaths of her son and her daughter-in-law, was very much attached to her\r\ncure, and used to say of him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a heart he has!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came every Thursday to spend the evening with the comtesse, and they\r\nwere close friends, with the frank and honest friendship of old people.\r\n\r\nShe persisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, M. le Cure! it is your turn now to make a confession!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cI was not made for ordinary life. I saw it fortunately in\r\ntime, and I have had many proofs since that I made no mistake on the\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy parents, who were mercers in Verdiers, and were quite well to do,\r\nhad great ambitions for me. They sent me to a boarding school while I\r\nwas very young. No one knows what a boy may suffer at school through the\r\nmere fact of separation, of isolation. This monotonous life without\r\naffection is good for some, and detestable for others. Young people are\r\noften more sensitive than one supposes, and by shutting them up thus too\r\nsoon, far from those they love, we may develop to an exaggerated extent\r\na sensitiveness which is overwrought and may become sickly and\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely ever played; I had no companions; I passed my hours in\r\nhomesickness; I spent the whole night weeping in my bed. I sought to\r\nbring before my mind recollections of home, trifling memories of little\r\nthings, little events. I thought incessantly of all I had left behind\r\nthere. I became almost imperceptibly an over-sensitive youth to whom the\r\nslightest annoyances were terrible griefs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way I remained taciturn, self-absorbed, without expansion,\r\nwithout confidants. This mental excitement was going on secretly and\r\nsurely. The nerves of children are quickly affected, and one should see\r\nto it that they live a tranquil life until they are almost fully\r\ndeveloped. But who ever reflects that, for certain boys, an unjust\r\nimposition may be as great a pang as the death of a friend in later\r\nyears? Who can explain why certain young temperaments are liable to\r\nterrible emotions for the slightest cause, and may eventually become\r\nmorbid and incurable?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was my case. This faculty of regret developed in me to such an\r\nextent that my existence became a martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not speak about it; I said nothing about it; but gradually I\r\nbecame so sensitive that my soul resembled an open wound. Everything\r\nthat affected me gave me painful twitchings, frightful shocks, and\r\nconsequently impaired my health. Happy are the men whom nature has\r\nbuttressed with indifference and armed with stoicism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reached my sixteenth year. An excessive timidity had arisen from this\r\nabnormal sensitiveness. Feeling myself unprotected from all the attacks\r\nof chance or fate, I feared every contact, every approach, every\r\ncurrent. I lived as though I were threatened by an unknown and always\r\nexpected misfortune. I did not venture either to speak or do anything in\r\npublic. I had, indeed, the feeling that life, is a battle, a dreadful\r\nconflict in which one receives terrible blows, grievous, mortal wounds.\r\nIn place of cherishing, like all men, a cheerful anticipation of the\r\nmorrow, I had only a confused fear of it, and felt in my own mind a\r\ndesire to conceal myself to avoid that combat in which I would be\r\nvanquished and slain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as my studies were finished, they gave me six months' time to\r\nchoose a career. A very simple occurrence showed me clearly, all of a\r\nsudden, the diseased condition of my mind, made me understand the\r\ndanger, and determined me to flee from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerdiers is a little town surrounded with plains and woods. In the\r\ncentral street stands my parents' house. I now passed my days far from\r\nthis dwelling which I had so much regretted, so much desired. Dreams had\r\nreawakened in me, and I walked alone in the fields in order to let them\r\nescape and fly away. My father and mother, quite occupied with business,\r\nand anxious about my future, talked to me only about their profits or\r\nabout my possible plans. They were fond of me after the manner of\r\nhardheaded, practical people; they had more reason than heart in their\r\naffection for me. I lived imprisoned in my thoughts, and vibrating with\r\nmy eternal sensitiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, one evening, after a long walk, as I was making my way home with\r\ngreat strides so as not to be late, I saw a dog trotting toward me. He\r\nwas a species of red spaniel, very lean, with long curly ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he was ten paces away from me he stopped. I did the same. Then he\r\nbegan wagging his tail, and came over to me with short steps and nervous\r\nmovements of his whole body, bending down on his paws as if appealing to\r\nme, and softly shaking his head. I spoke to him. He then began to crawl\r\nalong in such a sad, humble, suppliant manner that I felt the tears\r\ncoming into my eyes. I approached him; he ran away, then he came back\r\nagain; and I bent down on one knee trying to coax him to approach me,\r\nwith soft words. At last, he was within reach of my hands, and I gently\r\nand very carefully stroked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gained courage, gradually rose and, placing his paws on my\r\nshoulders, began to lick my face. He followed me to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was really the first being I had passionately loved, because he\r\nreturned my affection. My attachment to this animal was certainly\r\nexaggerated and ridiculous. It seemed to me in a confused sort of way\r\nthat we were two brothers, lost on this earth, and therefore isolated\r\nand without defense, one as well as the other. He never again quitted my\r\nside. He slept at the foot of my bed, ate at the table in spite of the\r\nobjections of my parents, and followed me in my solitary walks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often stopped at the side of a ditch, and sat down in the grass. Sam\r\nimmediately rushed up, lay down at my feet, and lifted up my hand with\r\nhis muzzle that I might caress him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day toward the end of June, as we were on the road from Saint-\r\nPierre de Chavrol, I saw the diligence from Pavereau coming along. Its\r\nfour horses were going at a gallop, with its yellow body, and its\r\nimperial with the black leather hood. The coachman cracked his whip; a\r\ncloud of dust rose up under the wheels of the heavy vehicle, then\r\nfloated behind, just as a cloud would do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly, as the vehicle came close to me, Sam, perhaps frightened by\r\nthe noise and wishing to join me, jumped in front of it. A horse's hoof\r\nknocked him down. I saw him roll over, turn round, fall back again\r\nbeneath the horses' feet, then the coach gave two jolts, and behind it I\r\nsaw something quivering in the dust on the road. He was nearly cut in\r\ntwo; all his intestines were hanging out and blood was spurting from the\r\nwound. He tried to get up, to walk, but he could only move his two front\r\npaws, and scratch the ground with them, as if to make a hole. The two\r\nothers were already dead. And he howled dreadfully, mad with pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe died in a few minutes. I cannot describe how much I felt and\r\nsuffered. I was confined to my room for a month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night, my father, enraged at seeing me so affected by such a\r\ntrifling occurrence, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How will it be when you have real griefs\xe2\x80\x94if you lose your wife or\r\nchildren?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis words haunted me and I began to see my condition clearly. I\r\nunderstood why all the small miseries of each day assumed in my eyes the\r\nimportance of a catastrophe; I saw that I was organized in such a way\r\nthat I suffered dreadfully from everything, that every painful\r\nimpression was multiplied by my diseased sensibility, and an atrocious\r\nfear of life took possession of me. I was without passions, without\r\nambitions; I resolved to sacrifice possible joys in order to avoid sure\r\nsorrows. Existence is short, but I made up my mind to spend it in the\r\nservice of others, in relieving their troubles and enjoying their\r\nhappiness. Having no direct experience of either one or the other, I\r\nshould only experience a milder form of emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you only knew how, in spite of this, misery tortures me, ravages\r\nme! But what would formerly have been an intolerable affliction has\r\nbecome commiseration, pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese sorrows which cross my path at every moment, I could not endure\r\nif they affected me directly. I could not have seen one of my children\r\ndie without dying myself. And I have, in spite of everything, preserved\r\nsuch a mysterious, overwhelming fear of events that the sight of the\r\npostman entering my house makes a shiver pass every day through my\r\nveins, and yet I have nothing to be afraid of now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Mauduit ceased speaking. He stared into the fire in the huge\r\ngrate, as if he saw there mysterious things, all the unknown of the\r\nexistence he might have passed had he been more fearless in the face of\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nHe added, then, in a subdued tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was right. I was not made for this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe comtesse said nothing at first; but at length, after a long silence,\r\nshe remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, if I had not my grandchildren, I believe I would not have\r\nthe courage to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the cure rose up without saying another word.\r\n\r\nAs the servants were asleep in the kitchen, she accompanied him herself\r\nto the door, which looked out on the garden, and she saw his tall\r\nshadow, lit up by the reflection of the lamp, disappearing through the\r\ngloom of night.\r\n\r\nThen she came back and sat down before the fire, and pondered over many\r\nthings we never think of when we are young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGIVENESS\r\n\r\nShe had been brought up in one of those families who live entirely to\r\nthemselves, apart from all the rest of the world. Such families know\r\nnothing of political events, although they are discussed at table; for\r\nchanges in the Government take place at such a distance from them that\r\nthey are spoken of as one speaks of a historical event, such as the\r\ndeath of Louis XVI or the landing of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nCustoms are modified in course of time, fashions succeed one another,\r\nbut such variations are taken no account of in the placid family circle\r\nwhere traditional usages prevail year after year. And if some scandalous\r\nepisode or other occurs in the neighborhood, the disreputable story dies\r\na natural death when it reaches the threshold of the house. The father\r\nand mother may, perhaps, exchange a few words on the subject when alone\r\ntogether some evening, but they speak in hushed tones\xe2\x80\x94for even walls\r\nhave ears. The father says, with bated breath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou've heard of that terrible affair in the Rivoil family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the mother answers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho would have dreamed of such a thing? It's dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children suspected nothing, and arrive in their turn at years of\r\ndiscretion with eyes and mind blindfolded, ignorant of the real side of\r\nlife, not knowing that people do not think as they speak, and do not\r\nspeak as they act; or aware that they should live at war, or at all\r\nevents, in a state of armed peace, with the rest of mankind; not\r\nsuspecting the fact that the simple are always deceived, the sincere\r\nmade sport of, the good maltreated.\r\n\r\nSome go on till the day of their death in this blind probity and loyalty\r\nand honor, so pure-minded that nothing can open their eyes.\r\n\r\nOthers, undeceived, but without fully understanding, make mistakes, are\r\ndismayed, and become desperate, believing themselves the playthings of a\r\ncruel fate, the wretched victims of adverse circumstances, and\r\nexceptionally wicked men.\r\n\r\nThe Savignols married their daughter Bertha at the age of eighteen. She\r\nwedded a young Parisian, George Baron by name, who had dealings on the\r\nStock Exchange. He was handsome, well-mannered, and apparently all that\r\ncould be desired. But in the depths of his heart he somewhat despised\r\nhis old-fashioned parents-in-law, whom he spoke of among his intimates\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear old fossils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe belonged to a good family, and the girl was rich. They settled down\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nShe became one of those provincial Parisians whose name is legion. She\r\nremained in complete ignorance of the great city, of its social side,\r\nits pleasures and its customs\xe2\x80\x94just as she remained ignorant also of\r\nlife, its perfidy and its mysteries.\r\n\r\nDevoted to her house, she knew scarcely anything beyond her own street;\r\nand when she ventured into another part of Paris it seemed to her that\r\nshe had accomplished a long and arduous journey into some unknown,\r\nunexplored city. She would then say to her husband in the evening:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been through the boulevards to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo or three times a year her husband took her to the theatre. These\r\nwere events the remembrance of which never grew dim; they provided\r\nsubjects of conversation for long afterward.\r\n\r\nSometimes three months afterward she would suddenly burst into laughter,\r\nand exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that actor dressed up as a general, who crowed like a\r\ncock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friends were limited to two families related to her own. She spoke\r\nof them as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Martinets\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe Michelins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer husband lived as he pleased, coming home when it suited him\r\n\xe2\x80\x94sometimes not until dawn\xe2\x80\x94alleging business, but not putting himself out\r\novermuch to account for his movements, well aware that no suspicion\r\nwould ever enter his wife's guileless soul.\r\n\r\nBut one morning she received an anonymous letter.\r\n\r\nShe was thunderstruck\xe2\x80\x94too simple-minded to understand the infamy of\r\nunsigned information and to despise the letter, the writer of which\r\ndeclared himself inspired by interest in her happiness, hatred of evil,\r\nand love of truth.\r\n\r\nThis missive told her that her husband had had for two years past, a\r\nsweetheart, a young widow named Madame Rosset, with whom he spent all\r\nhis evenings.\r\n\r\nBertha knew neither how to dissemble her grief nor how to spy on her\r\nhusband. When he came in for lunch she threw the letter down before him,\r\nburst into tears, and fled to her room.\r\n\r\nHe had time to take in the situation and to prepare his reply. He\r\nknocked at his wife's door. She opened it at once, but dared not look at\r\nhim. He smiled, sat down, drew her to his knee, and in a tone of light\r\nraillery began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, as a matter of fact, I have a friend named Madame\r\nRosset, whom I have known for the last ten years, and of whom I have a\r\nvery high opinion. I may add that I know scores of other people whose\r\nnames I have never mentioned to you, seeing that you do not care for\r\nsociety, or fresh acquaintances, or functions of any sort. But, to make\r\nshort work of such vile accusations as this, I want you to put on your\r\nthings after lunch, and we'll go together and call on this lady, who\r\nwill very soon become a friend of yours, too, I am quite sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe embraced her husband warmly, and, moved by that feminine spirit of\r\ncuriosity which will not be lulled once it is aroused, consented to go\r\nand see this unknown widow, of whom she was, in spite of everything,\r\njust the least bit jealous. She felt instinctively that to know a danger\r\nis to be already armed against it.\r\n\r\nShe entered a small, tastefully furnished flat on the fourth floor of an\r\nattractive house. After waiting five minutes in a drawing-room rendered\r\nsomewhat dark by its many curtains and hangings, a door opened, and a\r\nvery dark, short, rather plump young woman appeared, surprised and\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nGeorge introduced them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife\xe2\x80\x94Madame Julie Rosset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young widow uttered a half-suppressed cry of astonishment and joy,\r\nand ran forward with hands outstretched. She had not hoped, she said, to\r\nhave this pleasure, knowing that Madame Baron never saw any one, but she\r\nwas delighted to make her acquaintance. She was so fond of George (she\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge\xe2\x80\x9d in a familiar, sisterly sort of way) that, she had been\r\nmost anxious to know his young wife and to make friends with her, too.\r\n\r\nBy the end of a month the two new friends were inseparable. They saw\r\neach other every day, sometimes twice a day, and dined together every\r\nevening, sometimes at one house, sometimes at the other. George no\r\nlonger deserted his home, no longer talked of pressing business. He\r\nadored his own fireside, he said.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a time, a flat in the house where Madame Rosset lived became\r\nvacant Madame Baron hastened to take it, in order to be near her friend\r\nand spend even more time with her than hitherto.\r\n\r\nAnd for two whole years their friendship was without a cloud, a\r\nfriendship of heart and mind\xe2\x80\x94absolute, tender, devoted. Bertha could\r\nhardly speak without bringing in Julie's name. To her Madame Rosset\r\nrepresented perfection.\r\n\r\nShe was utterly happy, calm and contented.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Rosset fell ill. Bertha hardly left her side. She spent her\r\nnights with her, distracted with grief; even her husband seemed\r\ninconsolable.\r\n\r\nOne morning the doctor, after leaving the invalid's bedside, took George\r\nand his wife aside, and told them that he considered Julie's condition\r\nvery grave.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had gone the grief-stricken husband and wife sat down\r\nopposite each other and gave way to tears. That night they both sat up\r\nwith the patient. Bertha tenderly kissed her friend from time to time,\r\nwhile George stood at the foot of the bed, his eyes gazing steadfastly\r\non the invalid's face.\r\n\r\nThe next day she was worse.\r\n\r\nBut toward evening she declared she felt better, and insisted that her\r\nfriends should go back to their own apartment to dinner.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting sadly in the dining-room, scarcely even attempting to\r\neat, when the maid gave George a note. He opened it, turned pale as\r\ndeath, and, rising from the table, said to his wife in a constrained\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait for me. I must leave you a moment. I shall be back in ten minutes.\r\nDon't go away on any account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he hurried to his room to get his hat.\r\n\r\nBertha waited for him, a prey to fresh anxiety. But, docile in\r\neverything, she would not go back to her friend till he returned.\r\n\r\nAt length, as he did not reappear, it occurred to her to visit his room\r\nand see if he had taken his gloves. This would show whether or not he\r\nhad had a call to make.\r\n\r\nShe saw them at the first glance. Beside them lay a crumpled paper,\r\nevidently thrown down in haste.\r\n\r\nShe recognized it at once as the note George had received.\r\n\r\nAnd a burning temptation, the first that had ever assailed her urged her\r\nto read it and discover the cause of her husband's abrupt departure. Her\r\nrebellious conscience protested but a devouring and fearful curiosity\r\nprevailed. She seized the paper, smoothed it out, recognized the\r\ntremulous, penciled writing as Julie's, and read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome alone and kiss me, my poor dear. I am dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first she did not understand, the idea of Julie's death being her\r\nuppermost thought. But all at once the true meaning of what she read\r\nburst in a flash upon her; this penciled note threw a lurid light upon\r\nher whole existence, revealed the whole infamous truth, all the\r\ntreachery and perfidy of which she had been the victim. She understood\r\nthe long years of deceit, the way in which she had been made their\r\npuppet. She saw them again, sitting side by side in the evening, reading\r\nby lamplight out of the same book, glancing at each other at the end of\r\neach page.\r\n\r\nAnd her poor, indignant, suffering, bleeding heart was cast into the\r\ndepths of a despair which knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nFootsteps drew near; she fled, and shut herself in her own room.\r\n\r\nPresently her husband called her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome quickly! Madame Rosset is dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBertha appeared at her door, and with trembling lips replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to her alone; she does not need me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her stupidly, dazed with grief, and repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome at once! She's dying, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBertha answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would rather it were I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen at last he understood, and returned alone to the dying woman's\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\nHe mourned her openly, shamelessly, indifferent to the sorrow of the\r\nwife who no longer spoke to him, no longer looked at him; who passed her\r\nlife in solitude, hedged round with disgust, with indignant anger, and\r\npraying night and day to God.\r\n\r\nThey still lived in the same house, however, and sat opposite each other\r\nat table, in silence and despair.\r\n\r\nGradually his sorrow grew less acute; but she did not forgive him.\r\n\r\nAnd so their life went on, hard and bitter for them both.\r\n\r\nFor a whole year they remained as complete strangers to each other as if\r\nthey had never met. Bertha nearly lost her reason.\r\n\r\nAt last one morning she went out very early, and returned about eight\r\no'clock bearing in her hands an enormous bouquet of white roses. And she\r\nsent word to her husband that she wanted to speak to him. He came-\r\nanxious and uneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going out together,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease carry these flowers; they\r\nare too heavy for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA carriage took them to the gate of the cemetery, where they alighted.\r\nThen, her eyes filling with tears, she said to George:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me to her grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe trembled, and could not understand her motive; but he led the way,\r\nstill carrying the flowers. At last he stopped before a white marble\r\nslab, to which he pointed without a word.\r\n\r\nShe took the bouquet from him, and, kneeling down, placed it on the\r\ngrave. Then she offered up a silent, heartfelt prayer.\r\n\r\nBehind her stood her husband, overcome by recollections of the past.\r\n\r\nShe rose, and held out her hands to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish it, we will be friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE SPRING\r\n\r\nWith the first day of spring, when the awakening earth puts on its\r\ngarment of green, and the warm, fragrant air fans our faces and fills\r\nour lungs and appears even to penetrate to our hearts, we experience a\r\nvague, undefined longing for freedom, for happiness, a desire to run, to\r\nwander aimlessly, to breathe in the spring. The previous winter having\r\nbeen unusually severe, this spring feeling was like a form of\r\nintoxication in May, as if there were an overabundant supply of sap.\r\n\r\nOne morning on waking I saw from my window the blue sky glowing in the\r\nsun above the neighboring houses. The canaries hanging in the windows\r\nwere singing loudly, and so were the servants on every floor; a cheerful\r\nnoise rose up from the streets, and I went out, my spirits as bright as\r\nthe day, to go\xe2\x80\x94I did not exactly know where. Everybody I met seemed to\r\nbe smiling; an air of happiness appeared to pervade everything in the\r\nwarm light of returning spring. One might almost have said that a breeze\r\nof love was blowing through the city, and the sight of the young women\r\nwhom I saw in the streets in their morning toilets, in the depths of\r\nwhose eyes there lurked a hidden tenderness, and who walked with languid\r\ngrace, filled my heart with agitation.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing how or why, I found myself on the banks of the Seine.\r\nSteamboats were starting for Suresnes, and suddenly I was seized by an\r\nunconquerable desire to take a walk through the woods. The deck of the\r\nMouche was covered with passengers, for the sun in early spring draws\r\none out of the house, in spite of themselves, and everybody moves about,\r\ngoes and comes and talks to his neighbor.\r\n\r\nI had a girl neighbor; a little work-girl, no doubt, who possessed the\r\ntrue Parisian charm: a little head, with light curly hair, which looked\r\nlike a shimmer of light as it danced in the wind, came down to her ears,\r\nand descended to the nape of her neck, where it became such fine, light-\r\ncolored clown that one could scarcely see it, but felt an irresistible\r\ndesire to shower kisses on it.\r\n\r\nUnder my persistent gaze, she turned her head toward me, and then\r\nimmediately looked down, while a slight crease at the side of her mouth,\r\nthat was ready to break out into a smile, also showed a fine, silky,\r\npale down which the sun was gilding a little.\r\n\r\nThe calm river grew wider; the atmosphere was warm and perfectly still,\r\nbut a murmur of life seemed to fill all space.\r\n\r\nMy neighbor raised her eyes again, and this time, as I was still looking\r\nat her, she smiled decidedly. She was charming, and in her passing\r\nglance I saw a thousand things, which I had hitherto been ignorant of,\r\nfor I perceived unknown depths, all the charm of tenderness, all the\r\npoetry which we dream of, all the happiness which we are continually in\r\nsearch of. I felt an insane longing to open my arms and to carry her off\r\nsomewhere, so as to whisper the sweet music of words of love into her\r\nears.\r\n\r\nI was just about to address her when somebody touched me on the\r\nshoulder, and as I turned round in some surprise, I saw an ordinary-\r\nlooking man, who was neither young nor old, and who gazed at me sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI made a grimace, which he no doubt saw, for he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a matter of importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got up, therefore, and followed him to the other end of the boat and\r\nthen he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, when winter comes, with its cold, wet and snowy weather, your\r\ndoctor says to you constantly: 'Keep your feet warm, guard against\r\nchills, colds, bronchitis, rheumatism and pleurisy.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are very careful, you wear flannel, a heavy greatcoat and\r\nthick shoes, but all this does not prevent you from passing two months\r\nin bed. But when spring returns, with its leaves and flowers, its warm,\r\nsoft breezes and its smell of the fields, all of which causes you vague\r\ndisquiet and causeless emotion, nobody says to you:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Monsieur, beware of love! It is lying in ambush everywhere; it is\r\nwatching for you at every corner; all its snares are laid, all its\r\nweapons are sharpened, all its guiles are prepared! Beware of love!\r\nBeware of love! It is more dangerous than brandy, bronchitis or\r\npleurisy! It never forgives and makes everybody commit irreparable\r\nfollies.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, I say that the French Government ought to put large\r\npublic notices on the walls, with these words: 'Return of spring. French\r\ncitizens, beware of love!' just as they put: 'Beware of paint:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, as the government will not do this, I must supply its place,\r\nand I say to you: 'Beware of love!' for it is just going to seize you,\r\nand it is my duty to inform you of it, just as in Russia they inform any\r\none that his nose is frozen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was much astonished at this individual, and assuming a dignified\r\nmanner, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, monsieur, you appear to me to be interfering in a matter which\r\nis no concern of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made an abrupt movement and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! monsieur, monsieur! If I see that a man is in danger of being\r\ndrowned at a dangerous spot, ought I to let him perish? So just listen\r\nto my story and you will see why I ventured to speak to you like this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was about this time last year that it occurred. But, first of all, I\r\nmust tell you that I am a clerk in the Admiralty, where our chiefs, the\r\ncommissioners, take their gold lace as quill-driving officials\r\nseriously, and treat us like forecastle men on board a ship. Well, from\r\nmy office I could see a small bit of blue sky and the swallows, and I\r\nfelt inclined to dance among my portfolios.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy yearning for freedom grew so intense that, in spite of my\r\nrepugnance, I went to see my chief, a short, bad-tempered man, who was\r\nalways in a rage. When I told him that I was not well, he looked at me\r\nand said: 'I do not believe it, monsieur, but be off with you! Do you\r\nthink that any office can go on with clerks like you?' I started at once\r\nand went down the Seine. It was a day like this, and I took the Mouche,\r\nto go as far as Saint Cloud. Ah! what a good thing it would have been if\r\nmy chief had refused me permission to leave the office that day!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seemed to myself to expand in the sun. I loved everything\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsteamer, the river, the trees, the houses and my fellow-passengers. I\r\nfelt inclined to kiss something, no matter what; it was love, laying its\r\nsnare. Presently, at the Trocadero, a girl, with a small parcel in her\r\nhand, came on board and sat down opposite me. She was decidedly pretty,\r\nbut it is surprising, monsieur, how much prettier women seem to us when\r\nthe day is fine at the beginning of the spring. Then they have an\r\nintoxicating charm, something quite peculiar about them. It is just like\r\ndrinking wine after cheese.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at her and she also looked at me, but only occasionally, as\r\nthat girl did at you, just now; but at last, by dint of looking at each\r\nother constantly, it seemed to me that we knew each other well enough to\r\nenter into conversation, and I spoke to her and she replied. She was\r\ndecidedly pretty and nice and she intoxicated me, monsieur!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe got out at Saint-Cloud, and I followed her. She went and delivered\r\nher parcel, and when she returned the boat had just started. I walked by\r\nher side, and the warmth of the 'air made us both sigh. 'It would be\r\nvery nice in the woods,' I said. 'Indeed, it would!' she replied. 'Shall\r\nwe go there for a walk, mademoiselie?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gave me a quick upward look, as if to see exactly what I was like,\r\nand then, after a little hesitation, she accepted my proposal, and soon\r\nwe were there, walking side by side. Under the foliage, which was still\r\nrather scanty, the tall, thick, bright green grass was inundated by the\r\nsun, and the air was full of insects that were also making love to one\r\nanother, and birds were singing in all directions. My companion began to\r\njump and to run, intoxicated by the air and the smell of the country,\r\nand I ran and jumped, following her example. How silly we are at times,\r\nmonsieur!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she sang unrestrainedly a thousand things, opera airs and the song\r\nof Musette! The song of Musette! How poetical it seemed to me, then! I\r\nalmost cried over it. Ah! Those silly songs make us lose our heads; and,\r\nbelieve me, never marry a woman who sings in the country, especially if\r\nshe sings the song of Musette!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe soon grew tired, and sat down on a grassy slope, and I sat at her\r\nfeet and took her hands, her little hands, that were so marked with the\r\nneedle, and that filled me with emotion. I said to myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'These are the sacred marks of toil.' Oh! monsieur, do you know what\r\nthose sacred marks of toil mean? They mean all the gossip of the\r\nworkroom, the whispered scandal, the mind soiled by all the filth that\r\nis talked; they mean lost chastity, foolish chatter, all the\r\nwretchedness of their everyday life, all the narrowness of ideas which\r\nbelongs to women of the lower orders, combined to their fullest extent\r\nin the girl whose fingers bear the sacred marks of toil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we looked into each other's eyes for a long while. Oh! what power\r\na woman's eye has! How it agitates us, how it invades our very being,\r\ntakes possession of us, and dominates us! How profound it seems, how\r\nfull of infinite promises! People call that looking into each other's\r\nsouls! Oh! monsieur, what humbug! If we could see into each other's\r\nsouls, we should be more careful of what we did. However, I was\r\ncaptivated and was crazy about her and tried to take her into my arms,\r\nbut she said: 'Paws off!'. Then I knelt down and opened my heart to her\r\nand poured out all the affection that was suffocating me. She seemed\r\nsurprised at my change of manner and gave me a sidelong glance, as if to\r\nsay, 'Ah! so that is the way women make a fool of you, old fellow! Very\r\nwell, we will see.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn love, monsieur, we are always novices, and women artful dealers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt I could have had her, and I saw my own stupidity later, but\r\nwhat I wanted was not a woman's person, it was love, it was the ideal. I\r\nwas sentimental, when I ought to have been using my time to a better\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as she had had enough of my declarations of affection, she got\r\nup, and we returned to Saint-Cloud, and I did not leave her until we got\r\nto Paris; but she had looked so sad as we were returning, that at last I\r\nasked her what was the matter. 'I am thinking,' she replied, 'that this\r\nhas been one of those days of which we have but few in life.' My heart\r\nbeat so that it felt as if it would break my ribs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her on the following Sunday, and the next Sunday, and every\r\nSunday. I took her to Bougival, Saint-Germain, Maisons-Lafitte, Poissy;\r\nto every suburban resort of lovers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little jade, in turn, pretended to love me, until, at last, I\r\naltogether lost my head, and three months later I married her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you expect, monsieur, when a man is a clerk, living alone,\r\nwithout any relations, or any one to advise him? One says to one's self:\r\n'How sweet life would be with a wife!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so one gets married and she calls you names from morning till\r\nnight, understands nothing, knows nothing, chatters continually, sings\r\nthe song of Musette at the, top of her voice (oh! that song of Musette,\r\nhow tired one gets of it!); quarrels with the charcoal dealer, tells the\r\njanitor all her domestic details, confides all the secrets of her\r\nbedroom to the neighbor's servant, discusses her husband with the\r\ntradespeople and has her head so stuffed with stupid stories, with\r\nidiotic superstitions, with extraordinary ideas and monstrous\r\nprejudices, that I\xe2\x80\x94for what I have said applies more particularly to\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94shed tears of discouragement every time I talk to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, as he was rather out of breath and very much moved, and I\r\nlooked at him, for I felt pity for this poor, artless devil, and I was\r\njust going to give him some sort of answer, when the boat stopped. We\r\nwere at Saint-Cloud.\r\n\r\nThe little woman who had so taken my fancy rose from her seat in order\r\nto land. She passed close to me, and gave me a sidelong glance and a\r\nfurtive smile, one of those smiles that drive you wild. Then she jumped\r\non the landing-stage. I sprang forward to follow her, but my neighbor\r\nlaid hold of my arm. I shook myself loose, however, whereupon he seized\r\nthe skirt of my coat and pulled me back, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not go!\r\nyou shall not go!\xe2\x80\x9d in such a loud voice that everybody turned round and\r\nlaughed, and I remained standing motionless and furious, but without\r\nventuring to face scandal and ridicule, and the steamboat started.\r\n\r\nThe little woman on the landing-stage looked at me as I went off with an\r\nair of disappointment, while my persecutor rubbed his hands and\r\nwhispered to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must acknowledge that I have done you a great service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUEER NIGHT IN PARIS\r\n\r\nMattre Saval, notary at Vernon, was passionately fond of music. Although\r\nstill young he was already bald; he was always carefully shaven, was\r\nsomewhat corpulent as was suitable, and wore a gold pince-nez instead of\r\nspectacles. He was active, gallant and cheerful and was considered quite\r\nan artist in Vernon. He played the piano and the violin, and gave\r\nmusicals where the new operas were interpreted.\r\n\r\nHe had even what is called a bit of a voice; nothing but a bit, very\r\nlittle bit of a voice; but he managed it with so much taste that cries\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cExquisite!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSurprising!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAdorable!\xe2\x80\x9d issued from every\r\nthroat as soon as he had murmured the last note.\r\n\r\nHe subscribed to a music publishing house in Paris, and they sent him\r\nthe latest music, and from time to time he sent invitations after this\r\nfashion to the elite of the town:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are invited to be present on Monday evening at the house of M.\r\nSaval, notary, Vernon, at the first rendering of 'Sais.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few officers, gifted with good voices, formed the chorus. Two or three\r\nlady amateurs also sang. The notary filled the part of leader of the\r\norchestra with so much correctness that the bandmaster of the 190th\r\nregiment of the line said of him, one day, at the Cafe de l'Europe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! M. Saval is a master. It is a great pity that he did not adopt the\r\ncareer of an artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen his name was mentioned in a drawing-room, there was always somebody\r\nfound to declare: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not an amateur; he is an artist, a genuine\r\nartist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd two or three persons repeated, in a tone of profound conviction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, a genuine artist,\xe2\x80\x9d laying particular stress on the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgenuine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery time that a new work was interpreted at a big Parisian theatre M.\r\nSaval paid a visit to the capital.\r\n\r\nNow, last year, according to his custom, he went to hear Henri VIII. He\r\nthen took the express which arrives in Paris at 4:30 P.M., intending to\r\nreturn by the 12:35 A.M. train, so as not to have to sleep at a hotel.\r\nHe had put on evening dress, a black coat and white tie, which he\r\nconcealed under his overcoat with the collar turned up.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he set foot on the Rue d'Amsterdam, he felt himself in quite\r\njovial mood. He said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, the air of Paris does not resemble any other air. It has in\r\nit something indescribably stimulating, exciting, intoxicating, which\r\nfills you with a strange longing to dance about and to do many other\r\nthings. As soon as I arrive here, it seems to me, all of a sudden, that\r\nI have taken a bottle of champagne. What a life one can lead in this\r\ncity in the midst of artists! Happy are the elect, the great men who\r\nmake themselves a reputation in such a city! What an existence is\r\ntheirs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he made plans; he would have liked to know some of these celebrated\r\nmen, to talk about them in Vernon, and to spend an evening with them\r\nfrom time to time in Paris.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly an idea struck him. He had heard allusions to little cafes\r\nin the outer boulevards at which well-known painters, men of letters,\r\nand even musicians gathered, and he proceeded to go up to Montmartre at\r\na slow pace.\r\n\r\nHe had two hours before him. He wanted to look about him. He passed in\r\nfront of taverns frequented by belated bohemians, gazing at the\r\ndifferent faces, seeking to discover the artists. Finally, he came to\r\nthe sign of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dead Rat,\xe2\x80\x9d and, allured by the name, he entered.\r\n\r\nFive or six women, with their elbows resting on the marble tables, were\r\ntalking in low tones about their love affairs, the quarrels of Lucie and\r\nHortense, and the scoundrelism of Octave. They were no longer young,\r\nwere too fat or too thin, tired out, used up. You could see that they\r\nwere almost bald; and they drank beer like men.\r\n\r\nM. Saval sat down at some distance from them and waited, for the hour\r\nfor taking absinthe was at hand.\r\n\r\nA tall young man soon came in and took a seat beside him. The landlady\r\ncalled him M. \xe2\x80\x9cRomantin.\xe2\x80\x9d The notary quivered. Was this the Romantin who\r\nhad taken a medal at the last Salon?\r\n\r\nThe young man made a sign to the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will bring up my dinner at once, and then carry to my new studio,\r\n15 Boulevard de Clichy, thirty bottles of beer, and the ham I ordered\r\nthis morning. We are going to have a housewarming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Saval immediately ordered dinner. Then, he took off his overcoat, so\r\nthat his dress suit and his white tie could be seen. His neighbor did\r\nnot seem to notice him. He had taken up a newspaper, and was reading it.\r\nM. Saval glanced sideways at him, burning with the desire to speak to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTwo young men entered, in red vests and with peaked beards, in the\r\nfashion of Henry III. They sat down opposite Romantin.\r\n\r\nThe first of the pair said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it for this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomantin pressed his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you, old chap, and everyone will be there. I have Bonnat,\r\nGuillemet, Gervex, Beraud, Hebert, Duez, Clairin, and Jean-Paul Laurens.\r\nIt will be a stunning affair! And women, too! Wait till you see! Every\r\nactress without exception\xe2\x80\x94of course I mean, you know, all those who have\r\nnothing to do this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the establishment came across.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you often have this housewarming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe painter replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you, every three months, each quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Saval could not restrain himself any longer, and in a hesitating\r\nvoice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon for intruding on you, monsieur, but I heard your name\r\nmentioned, and I would be very glad to know if you really are M.\r\nRomantin, whose work in the last Salon I have so much admired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe painter answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the very person, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notary then paid the artist a very well-turned compliment, showing\r\nthat he was a man of culture.\r\n\r\nThe painter, gratified, thanked him politely in reply.\r\n\r\nThen they chattered. Romantin returned to the subject of his house-\r\nwarming, going into details as to the magnificence of the forthcoming\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nM. Saval questioned him as to all the men he was going to receive,\r\nadding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be an extraordinary piece of good fortune for a stranger to\r\nmeet at one time so many celebrities assembled in the studio of an\r\nartist of your rank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomantin, vanquished, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it would be agreeable to you, come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Saval accepted the invitation with enthusiasm, reflecting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have time enough to see Henri VIII.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth of them had finished their meal. The notary insisted on paying the\r\ntwo bills, wishing to repay his neighbor's civilities. He also paid for\r\nthe drinks of the young fellows in red velvet; then he left the\r\nestablishment with the painter.\r\n\r\nThey stopped in front of a very long, low house, the first story having\r\nthe appearance of an interminable conservatory. Six studios stood in a\r\nrow with their fronts facing the boulevards.\r\n\r\nRomantin was the first to enter, and, ascending the stairs, he opened a\r\ndoor, and lighted a match and then a candle.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves in an immense apartment, the furniture of which\r\nconsisted of three chairs, two easels, and a few sketches standing on\r\nthe ground along the walls. M. Saval remained standing at the door\r\nsomewhat astonished.\r\n\r\nThe painter remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you are! we've got to the spot; but everything has yet to be\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, examining the high, bare apartment, its ceiling disappearing in\r\nthe darkness, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might make a great deal out of this studio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked round it, surveying it with the utmost attention, then went\r\non:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know someone who might easily give a helping hand. Women are\r\nincomparable for hanging drapery. But I sent her to the country for to-\r\nday in order to get her off my hands this evening. It is not that she\r\nbores me, but she is too much lacking in the ways of good society. It\r\nwould be embarrassing to my guests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reflected for a few seconds, and then added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a good girl, but not easy to deal with. If she knew that I was\r\nholding a reception, she would tear out my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Saval had not even moved; he did not understand.\r\n\r\nThe artist came over to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince I have invited you, you will assist me about something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notary said emphatically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake any use of me you please. I am at your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomantin took off his jacket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, citizen, to work!' We are first going to clean up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to the back of the easel, on which there was a canvas\r\nrepresenting a cat, and seized a very worn-out broom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say! Just brush up while I look after the lighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Saval took the broom, inspected it, and then began to sweep the floor\r\nvery awkwardly, raising a whirlwind of dust.\r\n\r\nRomantin, disgusted, stopped him: \xe2\x80\x9cDeuce take it! you don't know how to\r\nsweep the floor! Look at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he began to roll before him a heap of grayish sweepings, as if he\r\nhad done nothing else all his life. Then, he gave bark the broom to the\r\nnotary, who imitated him.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes, such a cloud of dust filled the studio that Rormantin\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you? I can't see you any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Saval, who was coughing, came near to him. The painter said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would you set about making a chandelier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, surprised, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat chandelier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a chandelier to light the room\xe2\x80\x94a chandelier with wax-candles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notary did not understand.\r\n\r\nHe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe painter began to jump about, cracking his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monseigneur, I have found out a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went on more calmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got five francs about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Saval replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe artist said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell! you'll go out and buy for me five francs' worth\r\nof wax-candles while I go and see the cooper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he pushed the notary in his evening coat into the street. At the end\r\nof five minutes, they had returned, one of them with the wax-candles and\r\nthe other with the hoop of a cask. Then Romantin plunged his hand into a\r\ncupboard, and drew forth twenty empty bottles, which he fixed in the\r\nform of a crown around the hoop.\r\n\r\nHe then went downstairs to borrow a ladder from the janitress, after\r\nhaving explained that he had made interest with the old woman by\r\npainting the portrait of her cat, exhibited on the easel.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned with the ladder, he said to M. Saval:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you active?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, without understanding, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you just climb up there, and fasten this chandelier for me to the\r\nring of the ceiling. Then, you put a wax-candle in each bottle, and\r\nlight it. I tell you I have a genius for lighting up. But off with your\r\ncoat, damn it! You are just like a Jeames.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was opened brusquely. A woman appeared, her eyes flashing, and\r\nremained standing on the threshold.\r\n\r\nRomantin gazed at her with a look of terror.\r\n\r\nShe waited some seconds, crossing her arms over her breast, and then in\r\na shrill, vibrating, exasperated voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! you dirty scoundrel, is this the way you leave me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomantin made no reply. She went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! you scoundrel! You did a nice thing in parking me off to the\r\ncountry. You'll soon see the way I'll settle your jollification. Yes,\r\nI'm going to receive your friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe grew warmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to slap their faces with the bottles and the wax-candles\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomantin said in a soft tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMathilde\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she did not pay any attention to him; she went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, my fine fellow! wait a little!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRomantin went over to her, and tried to take her by the hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMathilde\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she was now fairly under way; and on she went, emptying the vials of\r\nher wrath with strong words and reproaches. They flowed out of her mouth\r\nlike, a stream sweeping a heap of filth along with it. The words pouring\r\nforth seemed struggling for exit. She stuttered, stammered, yelled,\r\nsuddenly recovering her voice to cast forth an insult or a curse.\r\n\r\nHe seized her hands without her having noticed it. She did not seem to\r\nsee anything, so taken up was she in scolding and relieving her\r\nfeelings. And suddenly she began to weep. The tears flowed from her\r\neyes, but this did not stop her complaints. But her words were uttered\r\nin a screaming falsetto voice with tears in it and interrupted by sobs.\r\nShe commenced afresh twice or three times, till she stopped as if\r\nsomething were choking her, and at last she ceased with a regular flood\r\nof tears.\r\n\r\nThen he clasped her in his arms and kissed her hair, affected himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMathilde, my little Mathilde, listen. You must be reasonable. You know,\r\nif I give a supper-party to my friends, it is to thank these gentlemen\r\nfor the medal I got at the Salon. I cannot receive women. You ought to\r\nunderstand that. It is not the same with artists as with other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stammered, in the midst of her tears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn't you tell me this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in order not to annoy you, not to give you pain. Listen, I'm\r\ngoing to see you home. You will be very sensible, very nice; you will\r\nremain quietly waiting for me in bed, and I'll come back as soon as it's\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you will not begin over again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I swear to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned towards M. Saval, who had at last hooked on the chandelier:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, I am coming back in five minutes. If anyone arrives in\r\nmy absence, do the honors for me, will you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he carried off Mathilde, who kept drying her eyes with her\r\nhandkerchief as she went along.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, M. Saval succeeded in putting everything around him in\r\norder. Then he lighted the wax-candles, and waited.\r\n\r\nHe waited for a quarter of an hour, half an hour, an hour. Romantin did\r\nnot return. Then, suddenly there was a dreadful noise on the stairs, a\r\nsong shouted out in chorus by twenty mouths and a regular march like\r\nthat of a Prussian regiment. The whole house was shaken by the steady\r\ntramp of feet. The door flew open, and a motley throng appeared\xe2\x80\x94men and\r\nwomen in file, two and two holding each other by the arm and stamping\r\ntheir heels on the ground to mark time, advanced into the studio like a\r\nsnake uncoiling itself. They howled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, and let us all be merry, Pretty maids and soldiers gay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Saval, thunderstruck, remained standing in evening dress under the\r\nchandelier. The procession of revellers caught sight of him, and uttered\r\na shout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Jeames! A Jeames!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they began whirling round him, surrounding him with a circle of\r\nvociferations. Then they took each other by the hand and went dancing\r\nabout madly.\r\n\r\nHe attempted to explain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMessieurs\xe2\x80\x94messieurs\xe2\x80\x94mesdames\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they did not listen to him. They whirled about, they jumped, they\r\nbrawled.\r\n\r\nAt last, the dancing ceased. M. Saval said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tall young fellow, fair-haired and bearded to the nose, interrupted\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's your name, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notary, quite scared, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am M. Saval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA voice exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean Baptiste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA woman said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the poor waiter alone! You'll end by making him get angry. He's\r\npaid to wait on us, and not to be laughed at by us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, M. Saval noticed that each guest had brought his own provisions.\r\nOne held a bottle of wine, and the other a pie. This one had a loaf of\r\nbread, and one a ham.\r\n\r\nThe tall, fair young fellow placed in his hands an enormous sausage, and\r\ngave orders:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, go and arrange the sideboard in the corner over there. Put the\r\nbottles at the left and the provisions at the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaval, getting quite distracted, exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, messieurs, I am a\r\nnotary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence and then a wild outburst of laughter. One\r\nsuspicious gentleman asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came you to be here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe explained, telling about his project of going to the opera, his\r\ndeparture from Vernon, his arrival in Paris, and the way in which he had\r\nspent the evening.\r\n\r\nThey sat around him to listen to him; they greeted him with words of\r\napplause, and called him Scheherazade.\r\n\r\nRomantin did not return. Other guests arrived. M. Saval was presented to\r\nthem so that he might begin his story over again. He declined; they\r\nforced him to relate it. They seated and tied him on one of three chairs\r\nbetween two women who kept constantly filling his glass. He drank; he\r\nlaughed; he talked; he sang, too. He tried to waltz with his chair, and\r\nfell on the ground.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, he forgot everything. It seemed to him, however, that\r\nthey undressed him, put him to bed, and that he was nauseated.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, it was broad daylight, and he lay stretched with his feet\r\nagainst a cupboard, in a strange bed.\r\n\r\nAn old woman with a broom in her hand was glaring angrily at him. At\r\nlast, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear out, you blackguard! Clear out! What right has anyone to get\r\ndrunk like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat up in bed, feeling very ill at ease. He asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you, you dirty scamp? You are drunk. Take your rotten carcass\r\nout of here as quick as you can\xe2\x80\x94and lose no time about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wanted to get up. He found that he was in no condition to do so. His\r\nclothes had disappeared. He blurted out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Then he remembered. What was he to do? He asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Monsieur Romantin come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doorkeeper shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take your dirty carcass out of this, so that he at any rate\r\nmay not catch you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Saval said, in a state of confusion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven't got my clothes; they have been taken away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had to wait, to explain his situation, give notice to his friends,\r\nand borrow some money to buy clothes. He did not leave Paris till\r\nevening. And when people talk about music to him in his beautiful\r\ndrawing-room in Vernon, he declares with an air of authority that\r\npainting is a very inferior art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 6.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT COSTLY RIDE\r\n\r\nThe household lived frugally on the meager income derived from the\r\nhusband's insignificant appointments. Two children had been born of the\r\nmarriage, and the earlier condition of the strictest economy had become\r\none of quiet, concealed, shamefaced misery, the poverty of a noble\r\nfamily\xe2\x80\x94which in spite of misfortune never forgets its rank.\r\n\r\nHector de Gribelin had been educated in the provinces, under the\r\npaternal roof, by an aged priest. His people were not rich, but they\r\nmanaged to live and to keep up appearances.\r\n\r\nAt twenty years of age they tried to find him a position, and he entered\r\nthe Ministry of Marine as a clerk at sixty pounds a year. He foundered\r\non the rock of life like all those who have not been early prepared for\r\nits rude struggles, who look at life through a mist, who do not know how\r\nto protect themselves, whose special aptitudes and faculties have not\r\nbeen developed from childhood, whose early training has not developed\r\nthe rough energy needed for the battle of life or furnished them with\r\ntool or weapon.\r\n\r\nHis first three years of office work were a martyrdom.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, renewed the acquaintance of a few friends of his family\r\n\xe2\x80\x94elderly people, far behind the times, and poor like himself, who lived\r\nin aristocratic streets, the gloomy thoroughfares of the Faubourg Saint-\r\nGermain; and he had created a social circle for himself.\r\n\r\nStrangers to modern life, humble yet proud, these needy aristocrats\r\nlived in the upper stories of sleepy, old-world houses. From top to\r\nbottom of their dwellings the tenants were titled, but money seemed just\r\nas scarce on the ground floor as in the attics.\r\n\r\nTheir eternal prejudices, absorption in their rank, anxiety lest they\r\nshould lose caste, filled the minds and thoughts of these families once\r\nso brilliant, now ruined by the idleness of the men of the family.\r\nHector de Gribelin met in this circle a young girl as well born and as\r\npoor as himself and married her.\r\n\r\nThey had two children in four years.\r\n\r\nFor four years more the husband and wife, harassed by poverty, knew no\r\nother distraction than the Sunday walk in the Champs-Elysees and a few\r\nevenings at the theatre (amounting in all to one or two in the course of\r\nthe winter) which they owed to free passes presented by some comrade or\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBut in the spring of the following year some overtime work was entrusted\r\nto Hector de Gribelin by his chief, for which he received the large sum\r\nof three hundred francs.\r\n\r\nThe day he brought the money home he said to his wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Henrietta, we must indulge in some sort of festivity\xe2\x80\x94say an\r\nouting for the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd after a long discussion it was decided that they should go and lunch\r\none day in the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hector, \xe2\x80\x9conce will not break us, so we'll hire a wagonette\r\nfor you, the children and the maid. And I'll have a saddle horse; the\r\nexercise will do me good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole week long they talked of nothing but the projected excursion.\r\n\r\nEvery evening, on his return from the office, Hector caught up his elder\r\nson, put him astride his leg, and, making him bounce up and down as hard\r\nas he could, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's how daddy will gallop next Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the youngster amused himself all day long by bestriding chairs,\r\ndragging them round the room and shouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is daddy on horseback!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant herself gazed at her master with awestruck eyes as she\r\nthought of him riding alongside the carriage, and at meal-times she\r\nlistened with all her ears while he spoke of riding and recounted the\r\nexploits of his youth, when he lived at home with his father. Oh, he had\r\nlearned in a good school, and once he felt his steed between his legs he\r\nfeared nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing whatever!\r\n\r\nRubbing his hands, he repeated gaily to his wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only they would give me a restive animal I should be all the better\r\npleased. You'll see how well I can ride; and if you like we'll come back\r\nby the Champs-Elysees just as all the people are returning from the\r\nBois. As we shall make a good appearance, I shouldn't at all object to\r\nmeeting some one from the ministry. That is all that is necessary to\r\ninsure the respect of one's chiefs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed the carriage and the riding horse arrived at the\r\nsame moment before the door. Hector went down immediately to examine his\r\nmount. He had had straps sewn to his trousers and flourished in his hand\r\na whip he had bought the evening before.\r\n\r\nHe raised the horse's legs and felt them one after another, passed his\r\nhand over the animal's neck, flank and hocks, opened his mouth, examined\r\nhis teeth, declared his age; and then, the whole household having\r\ncollected round him, he delivered a discourse on the horse in general\r\nand the specimen before him in particular, pronouncing the latter\r\nexcellent in every respect.\r\n\r\nWhen the rest of the party had taken their seats in the carriage he\r\nexamined the saddle-girth; then, putting his foot in the stirrup, he\r\nsprang to the saddle. The animal began to curvet and nearly threw his\r\nrider.\r\n\r\nHector, not altogether at his ease, tried to soothe him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, good horse, gently now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, when the horse had recovered his equanimity and the rider his\r\nnerve, the latter asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the carriage replied with one voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded.\r\n\r\nAnd the cavalcade set out.\r\n\r\nAll looks were centered on him. He trotted in the English style, rising\r\nunnecessarily high in the saddle; looking at times as if he were\r\nmounting into space. Sometimes he seemed on the point of falling forward\r\non the horse's mane; his eyes were fixed, his face drawn, his cheeks\r\npale.\r\n\r\nHis wife, holding one of the children on her knees, and the servant, who\r\nwas carrying the other, continually cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at papa! look at papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the two boys, intoxicated by the motion of the carriage, by their\r\ndelight and by the keen air, uttered shrill cries. The horse, frightened\r\nby the noise they made, started off at a gallop, and while Hector was\r\ntrying to control his steed his hat fell off, and the driver had to get\r\ndown and pick it up. When the equestrian had recovered it he called to\r\nhis wife from a distance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't let the children shout like that! They'll make the horse bolt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey lunched on the grass in the Vesinet woods, having brought\r\nprovisions with them in the carriage.\r\n\r\nAlthough the driver was looking after the three horses, Hector rose\r\nevery minute to see if his own lacked anything; he patted him on the\r\nneck and fed him with bread, cakes and sugar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's an unequal trotter,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly shook me up a\r\nlittle at first, but, as you saw, I soon got used to it. He knows his\r\nmaster now and won't give any more trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs had been decided, they returned by the Champs-Elysees.\r\n\r\nThat spacious thoroughfare literally swarmed with vehicles of every\r\nkind, and on the sidewalks the pedestrians were so numerous that they\r\nlooked like two indeterminate black ribbons unfurling their length from\r\nthe Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde. A flood of sunlight\r\nplayed on this gay scene, making the varnish of the carriages, the steel\r\nof the harness and the handles of the carriage doors shine with dazzling\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\nAn intoxication of life and motion seemed to have invaded this\r\nassemblage of human beings, carriages and horses. In the distance the\r\noutlines of the Obelisk could be discerned in a cloud of golden vapor.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hector's horse had passed the Arc de Triomphe he became\r\nsuddenly imbued with fresh energy, and, realizing that his stable was\r\nnot far off, began to trot rapidly through the maze of wheels, despite\r\nall his rider's efforts to restrain him.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was now far behind. When the horse arrived opposite the\r\nPalais de l'Industrie he saw a clear field before him, and, turning to\r\nthe right, set off at a gallop.\r\n\r\nAn old woman wearing an apron was crossing the road in leisurely\r\nfashion. She happened to be just in Hector's way as he arrived on the\r\nscene riding at full speed. Powerless to control his mount, he shouted\r\nat the top of his voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! Look out there! Hi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe must have been deaf, for she continued peacefully on her way until\r\nthe awful moment when, struck by the horse's chest as by a locomotive\r\nunder full steam, she rolled ten paces off, turning three somersaults on\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nVoices yelled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHector, frantic with terror, clung to the horse's mane and shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp! help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA terrible jolt hurled him, as if shot from a gun, over his horse's ears\r\nand cast him into the arms of a policeman who was running up to stop\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the space of a second a furious, gesticulating, vociferating group\r\nhad gathered round him. An old gentleman with a white mustache, wearing\r\na large round decoration, seemed particularly exasperated. He repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it! When a man is as awkward as all that he should remain at\r\nhome and not come killing people in the streets, if he doesn't know how\r\nto handle a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFour men arrived on the scene, carrying the old woman. She appeared to\r\nbe dead. Her skin was like parchment, her cap on one side and she was\r\ncovered with dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake her to a druggist's,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cand let us go to\r\nthe commissary of police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHector started on his way with a policeman on either side of him, a\r\nthird was leading his horse. A crowd followed them\xe2\x80\x94and suddenly the\r\nwagonette appeared in sight. His wife alighted in consternation, the\r\nservant lost her head, the children whimpered. He explained that he\r\nwould soon be at home, that he had knocked a woman down and that there\r\nwas not much the matter. And his family, distracted with anxiety, went\r\non their way.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived before the commissary the explanation took place in\r\nfew words. He gave his name\xe2\x80\x94Hector de Gribelin, employed at the Ministry\r\nof Marine; and then they awaited news of the injured woman. A policeman\r\nwho had been sent to obtain information returned, saying that she had\r\nrecovered consciousness, but was complaining of frightful internal pain.\r\nShe was a charwoman, sixty-five years of age, named Madame Simon.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard that she was not dead Hector regained hope and promised to\r\ndefray her doctor's bill. Then he hastened to the druggist's. The door\r\nway was thronged; the injured woman, huddled in an armchair, was\r\ngroaning. Her arms hung at her sides, her face was drawn. Two doctors\r\nwere still engaged in examining her. No bones were broken, but they\r\nfeared some internal lesion.\r\n\r\nHector addressed her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suffer much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the pain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if my stomach were on fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA doctor approached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the gentleman who caused the accident?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman ought to be sent to a home. I know one where they would take\r\nher at six francs a day. Would you like me to send her there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHector was delighted at the idea, thanked him and returned home much\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nHis wife, dissolved in tears, was awaiting him. He reassured her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's all right. This Madame Simon is better already and will be quite\r\nwell in two or three days. I have sent her to a home. It's all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he left his office the next day he went to inquire for Madame\r\nSimon. He found her eating rich soup with an air of great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI'm just the same. I feel sort of crushed\xe2\x80\x94not a\r\nbit better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor declared they must wait and see; some complication or other\r\nmight arise.\r\n\r\nHector waited three days, then he returned. The old woman, fresh-faced\r\nand clear-eyed, began to whine when she saw him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't move, sir; I can't move a bit. I shall be like this for the\r\nrest of my days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shudder passed through Hector's frame. He asked for the doctor, who\r\nmerely shrugged his shoulders and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do? I can't tell what's wrong with her. She shrieks when\r\nthey try to raise her. They can't even move her chair from one place to\r\nanother without her uttering the most distressing cries. I am bound to\r\nbelieve what she tells me; I can't look into her inside. So long as I\r\nhave no chance of seeing her walk I am not justified in supposing her to\r\nbe telling lies about herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman listened, motionless, a malicious gleam in her eyes.\r\n\r\nA week passed, then a fortnight, then a month. Madame Simon did not\r\nleave her armchair. She ate from morning to night, grew fat, chatted\r\ngaily with the other patients and seemed to enjoy her immobility as if\r\nit were the rest to which she was entitled after fifty years of going up\r\nand down stairs, of turning mattresses, of carrying coal from one story\r\nto another, of sweeping and dusting.\r\n\r\nHector, at his wits' end, came to see her every day. Every day he found\r\nher calm and serene, declaring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't move, sir; I shall never be able to move again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery evening Madame de Gribelin, devoured with anxiety, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Madame Simon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd every time he replied with a resignation born of despair:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the same; no change whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey dismissed the servant, whose wages they could no longer afford.\r\nThey economized more rigidly than ever. The whole of the extra pay had\r\nbeen swallowed up.\r\n\r\nThen Hector summoned four noted doctors, who met in consultation over\r\nthe old woman. She let them examine her, feel her, sound her, watching\r\nthem the while with a cunning eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must make her walk,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sirs, I can't!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI can't move!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they took hold of her, raised her and dragged her a short distance,\r\nbut she slipped from their grasp and fell to the floor, groaning and\r\ngiving vent to such heartrending cries that they carried her back to her\r\nseat with infinite care and precaution.\r\n\r\nThey pronounced a guarded opinion\xe2\x80\x94agreeing, however, that work was an\r\nimpossibility to her.\r\n\r\nAnd when Hector brought this news to his wife she sank on a chair,\r\nmurmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better to bring her here; it would cost us less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere? In our own house? How can you think of such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she, resigned now to anything, replied with tears in her eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can we do, my love? It's not my fault!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSELESS BEAUTY I\r\n\r\nAbout half-past five one afternoon at the end of June when the sun was\r\nshining warm and bright into the large courtyard, a very elegant\r\nvictoria with two beautiful black horses drew up in front of the\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse de Mascaret came down the steps just as her husband, who\r\nwas coming home, appeared in the carriage entrance. He stopped for a few\r\nmoments to look at his wife and turned rather pale. The countess was\r\nvery beautiful, graceful and distinguished looking, with her long oval\r\nface, her complexion like yellow ivory, her large gray eyes and her\r\nblack hair; and she got into her carriage without looking at him,\r\nwithout even seeming to have noticed him, with such a particularly high-\r\nbred air, that the furious jealousy by which he had been devoured for so\r\nlong again gnawed at his heart. He went up to her and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\ngoing for a drive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe merely replied disdainfully: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Bois de Boulogne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost probably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe carriage belongs to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout being surprised at the tone in which she answered him, he got in\r\nand sat down by his wife's side and said: \xe2\x80\x9cBois de Boulogne.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nfootman jumped up beside the coachman, and the horses as usual pranced\r\nand tossed their heads until they were in the street. Husband and wife\r\nsat side by side without speaking. He was thinking how to begin a\r\nconversation, but she maintained such an obstinately hard look that he\r\ndid not venture to make the attempt. At last, however, he cunningly,\r\naccidentally as it were, touched the countess' gloved hand with his own,\r\nbut she drew her arm away with a movement which was so expressive of\r\ndisgust that he remained thoughtful, in spite of his usual authoritative\r\nand despotic character, and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cGabrielle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are looking adorable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, but remained lying back in the carriage, looking like\r\nan irritated queen. By that time they were driving up the Champs\r\nElysees, toward the Arc de Triomphe. That immense monument, at the end\r\nof the long avenue, raised its colossal arch against the red sky and the\r\nsun seemed to be descending on it, showering fiery dust on it from the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe stream of carriages, with dashes of sunlight reflected in the silver\r\ntrappings of the harness and the glass of the lamps, flowed on in a\r\ndouble current toward the town and toward the Bois, and the Comte de\r\nMascaret continued: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Gabrielle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnable to control herself any longer, she replied in an exasperated\r\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! do leave me in peace, pray! I am not even allowed to have my\r\ncarriage to myself now.\xe2\x80\x9d He pretended not to hear her and continued:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never have looked so pretty as you do to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer patience had come to an end, and she replied with irrepressible\r\nanger: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong to notice it, for I swear to you that I will never\r\nhave anything to do with you in that way again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe count was decidedly stupefied and upset, and, his violent nature\r\ngaining the upper hand, he exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d in a\r\ntone that betrayed rather the brutal master than the lover. She replied\r\nin a low voice, so that the servants might not hear amid the deafening\r\nnoise of the wheels: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! What do I mean by that? What do I mean by\r\nthat? Now I recognize you again! Do you want me to tell everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything that has weighed on my heart since I have been the victim of\r\nyour terrible selfishness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had grown red with surprise and anger and he growled between his\r\nclosed teeth: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, tell me everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a big red beard, a handsome\r\nman, a nobleman, a man of the world, who passed as a perfect husband and\r\nan excellent father, and now, for the first time since they had started,\r\nshe turned toward him and looked him full in the face: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! You will\r\nhear some disagreeable things, but you must know that I am prepared for\r\neverything, that I fear nothing, and you less than any one to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe also was looking into her eyes and was already shaking with rage as\r\nhe said in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I will no longer be the victim of the hateful penalty of\r\nmaternity, which you have inflicted on me for eleven years! I wish to\r\ntake my place in society as I have the right to do, as all women have\r\nthe right to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe suddenly grew pale again and stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes; you understand me well enough. It is now three months since I\r\nhad my last child, and as I am still very beautiful, and as, in spite of\r\nall your efforts you cannot spoil my figure, as you just now perceived,\r\nwhen you saw me on the doorstep, you think it is time that I should\r\nthink of having another child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are talking nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not, I am thirty, and I have had seven children, and we have\r\nbeen married eleven years, and you hope that this will go on for ten\r\nyears longer, after which you will leave off being jealous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized her arm and squeezed it, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI will not allow you to talk\r\nto me like that much longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall talk to you till the end, until I have finished all I have\r\nto say to you, and if you try to prevent me, I shall raise my voice so\r\nthat the two servants, who are on the box, may hear. I only allowed you\r\nto come with me for that object, for I have these witnesses who will\r\noblige you to listen to me and to contain yourself, so now pay attention\r\nto what I say. I have always felt an antipathy to you, and I have always\r\nlet you see it, for I have never lied, monsieur. You married me in spite\r\nof myself; you forced my parents, who were in embarrassed circumstances,\r\nto give me to you, because you were rich, and they obliged me to marry\r\nyou in spite of my tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you bought me, and as soon as I was in your power, as soon as I had\r\nbecome your companion, ready to attach myself to you, to forget your\r\ncoercive and threatening proceedings, in order that I might only\r\nremember that I ought to be a devoted wife and to love you as much as it\r\nmight be possible for me to love you, you became jealous, you, as no man\r\nhas ever been before, with the base, ignoble jealousy of a spy, which\r\nwas as degrading to you as it was to me. I had not been married eight\r\nmonths when you suspected me of every perfidiousness, and you even told\r\nme so. What a disgrace! And as you could not prevent me from being\r\nbeautiful and from pleasing people, from being called in drawing-rooms\r\nand also in the newspapers one of the most beautiful women in Paris, you\r\ntried everything you could think of to keep admirers from me, and you\r\nhit upon the abominable idea of making me spend my life in a constant\r\nstate of motherhood, until the time should come when I should disgust\r\nevery man. Oh, do not deny it. I did not understand it for some time,\r\nbut then I guessed it. You even boasted about it to your sister, who\r\ntold me of it, for she is fond of me and was disgusted at your boorish\r\ncoarseness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Remember how you have behaved in the past! How for eleven years you\r\nhave compelled me to give up all society and simply be a mother to your\r\nchildren. And then you would grow disgusted with me and I was sent into\r\nthe country, the family chateau, among fields and meadows. And when I\r\nreappeared, fresh, pretty and unspoiled, still seductive and constantly\r\nsurrounded by admirers, hoping that at last I should live a little more\r\nlike a rich young society woman, you were seized with jealousy again,\r\nand you began once more to persecute me with that infamous and hateful\r\ndesire from which you are suffering at this moment by my side. And it is\r\nnot the desire of possessing me\xe2\x80\x94for I should never have refused myself\r\nto you, but it is the wish to make me unsightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then that abominable and mysterious thing occurred which I was a\r\nlong time in understanding (but I grew sharp by dint of watching your\r\nthoughts and actions): You attached yourself to your children with all\r\nthe security which they gave you while I bore them. You felt affection\r\nfor them, with all your aversion to me, and in spite of your ignoble\r\nfears, which were momentarily allayed by your pleasure in seeing me lose\r\nmy symmetry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how often have I noticed that joy in you! I have seen it in your\r\neyes and guessed it. You loved your children as victories, and not\r\nbecause they were of your own blood. They were victories over me, over\r\nmy youth, over my beauty, over my charms, over the compliments which\r\nwere paid me and over those that were whispered around me without being\r\npaid to me personally. And you are proud of them, you make a parade of\r\nthem, you take them out for drives in your break in the Bois de Boulogne\r\nand you give them donkey rides at Montmorency. You take them to\r\ntheatrical matinees so that you may be seen in the midst of them, so\r\nthat the people may say: 'What a kind father' and that it may be\r\nrepeated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had seized her wrist with savage brutality, and he squeezed it so\r\nviolently that she was quiet and nearly cried out with the pain and he\r\nsaid to her in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love my children, do you hear? What you have just told me is\r\ndisgraceful in a mother. But you belong to me; I am master\xe2\x80\x94your master\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan exact from you what I like and when I like\xe2\x80\x94and I have the law-on my\r\nside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was trying to crush her fingers in the strong grip of his large,\r\nmuscular hand, and she, livid with pain, tried in vain to free them from\r\nthat vise which was crushing them. The agony made her breathe hard and\r\nthe tears came into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see that I am the master and the\r\nstronger,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. When he somewhat loosened his grip, she asked him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that I am a religious woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was surprised and stammered \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that I could lie if I swore to the truth of anything to\r\nyou before an altar on which Christ's body is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go with me to some church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see. Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you absolutely wish it, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her voice and said: \xe2\x80\x9cPhilippe!\xe2\x80\x9d And the coachman, bending\r\ndown a little, without taking his eyes from his horses, seemed to turn\r\nhis ear alone toward his mistress, who continued: \xe2\x80\x9cDrive to St.\r\nPhilippe-du-Roule.\xe2\x80\x9d And the victoria, which had reached the entrance of\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne returned to Paris.\r\n\r\nHusband and wife did not exchange a word further during the drive, and\r\nwhen the carriage stopped before the church Madame de Mascaret jumped\r\nout and entered it, followed by the count, a few yards distant. She\r\nwent, without stopping, as far as the choir-screen, and falling on her\r\nknees at a chair, she buried her face in her hands. She prayed for a\r\nlong time, and he, standing behind her could see that she was crying.\r\nShe wept noiselessly, as women weep when they are in great, poignant\r\ngrief. There was a kind of undulation in her body, which ended in a\r\nlittle sob, which was hidden and stifled by her fingers.\r\n\r\nBut the Comte de Mascaret thought that the situation was lasting too\r\nlong, and he touched her on the shoulder. That contact recalled her to\r\nherself, as if she had been burned, and getting up, she looked straight\r\ninto his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I have to say to you. I am afraid of\r\nnothing, whatever you may do to me. You may kill me if you like. One of\r\nyour children is not yours, and one only; that I swear to you before\r\nGod, who hears me here. That was the only revenge that was possible for\r\nme in return for all your abominable masculine tyrannies, in return for\r\nthe penal servitude of childbearing to which you have condemned me. Who\r\nwas my lover? That you never will know! You may suspect every one, but\r\nyou never will find out. I gave myself to him, without love and without\r\npleasure, only for the sake of betraying you, and he also made me a\r\nmother. Which is the child? That also you never will know. I have seven;\r\ntry to find out! I intended to tell you this later, for one has not\r\navenged oneself on a man by deceiving him, unless he knows it. You have\r\ndriven me to confess it today. I have now finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hurried through the church toward the open door, expecting to hear\r\nbehind her the quick step: of her husband whom she had defied and to be\r\nknocked to the ground by a blow of his fist, but she heard nothing and\r\nreached her carriage. She jumped into it at a bound, overwhelmed with\r\nanguish and breathless with fear. So she called out to the coachman:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome!\xe2\x80\x9d and the horses set off at a quick trot.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse de Mascaret was waiting in her room for dinner time as a\r\ncriminal sentenced to death awaits the hour of his execution. What was\r\nher husband going to do? Had he come home? Despotic, passionate, ready\r\nfor any violence as he was, what was he meditating, what had he made up\r\nhis mind to do? There was no sound in the house, and every moment she\r\nlooked at the clock. Her lady's maid had come and dressed her for the\r\nevening and had then left the room again. Eight o'clock struck and\r\nalmost at the same moment there were two knocks at the door, and the\r\nbutler came in and announced dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the count come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Madame la Comtesse. He is in the diningroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a little moment she felt inclined to arm herself with a small\r\nrevolver which she had bought some time before, foreseeing the tragedy\r\nwhich was being rehearsed in her heart. But she remembered that all the\r\nchildren would be there, and she took nothing except a bottle of\r\nsmelling salts. He rose somewhat ceremoniously from his chair. They\r\nexchanged a slight bow and sat down. The three boys with their tutor,\r\nAbbe Martin, were on her right and the three girls, with Miss Smith,\r\ntheir English governess, were on her left. The youngest child, who was\r\nonly three months old, remained upstairs with his nurse.\r\n\r\nThe abbe said grace as usual when there was no company, for the children\r\ndid not come down to dinner when guests were present. Then they began\r\ndinner. The countess, suffering from emotion, which she had not\r\ncalculated upon, remained with her eyes cast down, while the count\r\nscrutinized now the three boys and now the three girls with an\r\nuncertain, unhappy expression, which travelled from one to the other.\r\nSuddenly pushing his wineglass from him, it broke, and the wine was\r\nspilt on the tablecloth, and at the slight noise caused by this little\r\naccident the countess started up from her chair; and for the first time\r\nthey looked at each other. Then, in spite of themselves, in spite of the\r\nirritation of their nerves caused by every glance, they continued to\r\nexchange looks, rapid as pistol shots.\r\n\r\nThe abbe, who felt that there was some cause for embarrassment which he\r\ncould not divine, attempted to begin a conversation and tried various\r\nsubjects, but his useless efforts gave rise to no ideas and did not\r\nbring out a word. The countess, with feminine tact and obeying her\r\ninstincts of a woman of the world, attempted to answer him two or three\r\ntimes, but in vain. She could not find words, in the perplexity of her\r\nmind, and her own voice almost frightened her in the silence of the\r\nlarge room, where nothing was heard except the slight sound of plates\r\nand knives and forks.\r\n\r\nSuddenly her husband said to her, bending forward: \xe2\x80\x9cHere, amid your\r\nchildren, will you swear to me that what you told me just now is true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hatred which was fermenting in her veins suddenly roused her, and\r\nreplying to that question with the same firmness with which she had\r\nreplied to his looks, she raised both her hands, the right pointing\r\ntoward the boys and the left toward the girls, and said in a firm,\r\nresolute voice and without any hesitation: \xe2\x80\x9cOn the head of my children,\r\nI swear that I have told you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up and throwing his table napkin on the table with a movement of\r\nexasperation, he turned round and flung his chair against the wall, and\r\nthen went out without another word, while she, uttering a deep sigh, as\r\nif after a first victory, went on in a calm voice: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not pay any\r\nattention to what your father has just said, my darlings; he was very\r\nmuch upset a short time ago, but he will be all right again in a few\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she talked with the abbe and Miss Smith and had tender, pretty\r\nwords for all her children, those sweet, tender mother's ways which\r\nunfold little hearts.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over she went into the drawing-room, all her children\r\nfollowing her. She made the elder ones chatter, and when their bedtime\r\ncame she kissed them for a long time and then went alone into her room.\r\n\r\nShe waited, for she had no doubt that the count would come, and she made\r\nup her mind then, as her children were not with her, to protect herself\r\nas a woman of the world as she would protect her life, and in the pocket\r\nof her dress she put the little loaded revolver which she had bought a\r\nfew days previously. The hours went by, the hours struck, and every\r\nsound was hushed in the house. Only the cabs, continued to rumble\r\nthrough the streets, but their noise was only heard vaguely through the\r\nshuttered and curtained windows.\r\n\r\nShe waited, full of nervous energy, without any fear of him now, ready\r\nfor anything, and almost triumphant, for she had found means of\r\ntorturing him continually during every moment of his life.\r\n\r\nBut the first gleam of dawn came in through the fringe at the bottom of\r\nher curtain without his having come into her room, and then she awoke to\r\nthe fact, with much amazement, that he was not coming. Having locked and\r\nbolted her door, for greater security, she went to bed at last and\r\nremained there, with her eyes open, thinking and barely understanding it\r\nall, without being able to guess what he was going to do.\r\n\r\nWhen her maid brought her tea she at the same time handed her a letter\r\nfrom her husband. He told her that he was going to undertake a longish\r\njourney and in a postscript added that his lawyer would provide her with\r\nany sums of money she might require for all her expenses.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was at the opera, between two acts of \xe2\x80\x9cRobert the Devil.\xe2\x80\x9d In the\r\nstalls the men were standing up, with their hats on, their waistcoats\r\ncut very low so as to show a large amount of white shirt front, in which\r\ngold and jewelled studs glistened, and were looking at the boxes full of\r\nladies in low dresses covered with diamonds and pearls, who were\r\nexpanding like flowers in that illuminated hothouse, where the beauty of\r\ntheir faces and the whiteness of their shoulders seemed to bloom in\r\norder to be gazed at, amid the sound of the music and of human voices.\r\n\r\nTwo friends, with their backs to the orchestra, were scanning those rows\r\nof elegance, that exhibition of real or false charms, of jewels, of\r\nluxury and of pretension which displayed itself in all parts of the\r\nGrand Theatre, and one of them, Roger de Salnis, said to his companion,\r\nBernard Grandin:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look how beautiful the Comtesse de Mascaret still is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe older man in turn looked through his opera glasses at a tall lady in\r\na box opposite. She appeared to be still very young, and her striking\r\nbeauty seemed to attract all eyes in every corner of the house. Her pale\r\ncomplexion, of an ivory tint, gave her the appearance of a statue, while\r\na small diamond coronet glistened on her black hair like a streak of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWhen he had looked at her for some time, Bernard Grandin replied with a\r\njocular accent of sincere conviction: \xe2\x80\x9cYou may well call her beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old do you think she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment. I can tell you exactly, for I have known her since she\r\nwas a child and I saw her make her debut into society when she was quite\r\na girl. She is\xe2\x80\x94she is\xe2\x80\x94thirty\xe2\x80\x94thirty-six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looks twenty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has had seven children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is more, they are all seven alive, as she is a very good\r\nmother. I occasionally go to the house, which is a very quiet and\r\npleasant one, where one may see the phenomenon of the family in the\r\nmidst of society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very strange! And have there never been any reports about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about her husband? He is peculiar, is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes and no. Very likely there has been a little drama between them, one\r\nof those little domestic dramas which one suspects, never finds out\r\nexactly, but guesses at pretty closely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know anything about it. Mascaret leads a very fast life now,\r\nafter being a model husband. As long as he remained a good spouse he had\r\na shocking temper, was crabbed and easily took offence, but since he has\r\nbeen leading his present wild life he has become quite different, But\r\none might surmise that he has some trouble, a worm gnawing somewhere,\r\nfor he has aged very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon the two friends talked philosophically for some minutes about\r\nthe secret, unknowable troubles which differences of character or\r\nperhaps physical antipathies, which were not perceived at first, give\r\nrise to in families, and then Roger de Salnis, who was still looking at\r\nMadame de Mascaret through his opera glasses, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is almost\r\nincredible that that woman can have had seven children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in eleven years; after which, when she was thirty, she refused to\r\nhave any more, in order to take her place in society, which she seems\r\nlikely to do for many years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you pity them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Ah! my dear fellow, just consider! Eleven years in a condition of\r\nmotherhood for such a woman! What a hell! All her youth, all her beauty,\r\nevery hope of success, every poetical ideal of a brilliant life\r\nsacrificed to that abominable law of reproduction which turns the normal\r\nwoman into a mere machine for bringing children into the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have? It is only Nature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I say that Nature is our enemy, that we must always fight\r\nagainst Nature, for she is continually bringing us back to an animal\r\nstate. You may be sure that God has not put anything on this earth that\r\nis clean, pretty, elegant or accessory to our ideal; the human brain has\r\ndone it. It is man who has introduced a little grace, beauty, unknown\r\ncharm and mystery into creation by singing about it, interpreting it, by\r\nadmiring it as a poet, idealizing it as an artist and by explaining it\r\nthrough science, doubtless making mistakes, but finding ingenious\r\nreasons, hidden grace and beauty, unknown charm and mystery in the\r\nvarious phenomena of Nature. God created only coarse beings, full of the\r\ngerms of disease, who, after a few years of bestial enjoyment, grow old\r\nand infirm, with all the ugliness and all the want of power of human\r\ndecrepitude. He seems to have made them only in order that they may\r\nreproduce their species in an ignoble manner and then die like ephemeral\r\ninsects. I said reproduce their species in an ignoble manner and I\r\nadhere to that expression. What is there as a matter of fact more\r\nignoble and more repugnant than that act of reproduction of living\r\nbeings, against which all delicate minds always have revolted and always\r\nwill revolt? Since all the organs which have been invented by this\r\neconomical and malicious Creator serve two purposes, why did He not\r\nchoose another method of performing that sacred mission, which is the\r\nnoblest and the most exalted of all human functions? The mouth, which\r\nnourishes the body by means of material food, also diffuses abroad\r\nspeech and thought. Our flesh renews itself of its own accord, while we\r\nare thinking about it. The olfactory organs, through which the vital air\r\nreaches the lungs, communicate all the perfumes of the world to the\r\nbrain: the smell of flowers, of woods, of trees, of the sea. The ear,\r\nwhich enables us to communicate with our fellow men, has also allowed us\r\nto invent music, to create dreams, happiness, infinite and even physical\r\npleasure by means of sound! But one might say that the cynical and\r\ncunning Creator wished to prohibit man from ever ennobling and\r\nidealizing his intercourse with women. Nevertheless man has found love,\r\nwhich is not a bad reply to that sly Deity, and he has adorned it with\r\nso much poetry that woman often forgets the sensual part of it. Those\r\namong us who are unable to deceive themselves have invented vice and\r\nrefined debauchery, which is another way of laughing at God and paying\r\nhomage, immodest homage, to beauty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the normal man begets children just like an animal coupled with\r\nanother by law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that woman! Is it not abominable to think that such a jewel,\r\nsuch a pearl, born to be beautiful, admired, feted and adored, has spent\r\neleven years of her life in providing heirs for the Comte de Mascaret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBernard Grandin replied with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal of truth in\r\nall that, but very few people would understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSalnis became more and more animated. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how I picture God\r\nmyself?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs an enormous, creative organ beyond our ken, who\r\nscatters millions of worlds into space, just as one single fish would\r\ndeposit its spawn in the sea. He creates because it is His function as\r\nGod to do so, but He does not know what He is doing and is stupidly\r\nprolific in His work and is ignorant of the combinations of all kinds\r\nwhich are produced by His scattered germs. The human mind is a lucky\r\nlittle local, passing accident which was totally unforeseen, and\r\ncondemned to disappear with this earth and to recommence perhaps here or\r\nelsewhere the same or different with fresh combinations of eternally new\r\nbeginnings. We owe it to this little lapse of intelligence on His part\r\nthat we are very uncomfortable in this world which was not made for us,\r\nwhich had not been prepared to receive us, to lodge and feed us or to\r\nsatisfy reflecting beings, and we owe it to Him also that we have to\r\nstruggle without ceasing against what are still called the designs of\r\nProvidence, when we are really refined and civilized beings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrandin, who was listening to him attentively as he had long known the\r\nsurprising outbursts of his imagination, asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cThen you believe\r\nthat human thought is the spontaneous product of blind divine\r\ngeneration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally! A fortuitous function of the nerve centres of our brain,\r\nlike the unforeseen chemical action due to new mixtures and similar also\r\nto a charge of electricity, caused by friction or the unexpected\r\nproximity of some substance, similar to all phenomena caused by the\r\ninfinite and fruitful fermentation of living matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear fellow, the truth of this must be evident to any one who\r\nlooks about him. If the human mind, ordained by an omniscient Creator,\r\nhad been intended to be what it has become, exacting, inquiring,\r\nagitated, tormented\xe2\x80\x94so different from mere animal thought and\r\nresignation\xe2\x80\x94would the world which was created to receive the beings\r\nwhich we now are have been this unpleasant little park for small game,\r\nthis salad patch, this wooded, rocky and spherical kitchen garden where\r\nyour improvident Providence had destined us to live naked, in caves or\r\nunder trees, nourished on the flesh of slaughtered animals, our\r\nbrethren, or on raw vegetables nourished by the sun and the rain?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is sufficient to reflect for a moment, in order to understand\r\nthat this world was not made for such creatures as we are. Thought,\r\nwhich is developed by a miracle in the nerves of the cells in our brain,\r\npowerless, ignorant and confused as it is, and as it will always remain,\r\nmakes all of us who are intellectual beings eternal and wretched exiles\r\non earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at this earth, as God has given it to those who inhabit it. Is it\r\nnot visibly and solely made, planted and covered with forests for the\r\nsake of animals? What is there for us? Nothing. And for them,\r\neverything, and they have nothing to do but to eat or go hunting and eat\r\neach other, according to their instincts, for God never foresaw\r\ngentleness and peaceable manners; He only foresaw the death of creatures\r\nwhich were bent on destroying and devouring each other. Are not the\r\nquail, the pigeon and the partridge the natural prey of the hawk? the\r\nsheep, the stag and the ox that of the great flesh-eating animals,\r\nrather than meat to be fattened and served up to us with truffles, which\r\nhave been unearthed by pigs for our special benefit?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to ourselves, the more civilized, intellectual and refined we are,\r\nthe more we ought to conquer and subdue that animal instinct, which\r\nrepresents the will of God in us. And so, in order to mitigate our lot\r\nas brutes, we have discovered and made everything, beginning with\r\nhouses, then exquisite food, sauces, sweetmeats, pastry, drink, stuffs,\r\nclothes, ornaments, beds, mattresses, carriages, railways and\r\ninnumerable machines, besides arts and sciences, writing and poetry.\r\nEvery ideal comes from us as do all the amenities of life, in order to\r\nmake our existence as simple reproducers, for which divine Providence\r\nsolely intended us, less monotonous and less hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at this theatre. Is there not here a human world created by us,\r\nunforeseen and unknown to eternal fate, intelligible to our minds alone,\r\na sensual and intellectual distraction, which has been invented solely\r\nby and for that discontented and restless little animal, man?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that woman, Madame de Mascaret. God intended her to live in a\r\ncave, naked or wrapped up in the skins of wild animals. But is she not\r\nbetter as she is? But, speaking of her, does any one know why and how\r\nher brute of a husband, having such a companion by his side, and\r\nespecially after having been boorish enough to make her a mother seven\r\ntimes, has suddenly left her, to run after bad women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrandin replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear fellow, this is probably the only reason.\r\nHe found that raising a family was becoming too expensive, and from\r\nreasons of domestic economy he has arrived at the same principles which\r\nyou lay down as a philosopher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then the curtain rose for the third act, and they turned round,\r\ntook off their hats and sat down.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe Comte and Comtesse Mascaret were sitting side by side in the\r\ncarriage which was taking them home from the Opera, without speaking but\r\nsuddenly the husband said to his wife: \xe2\x80\x9cGabrielle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you think that this has lasted long enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe horrible punishment to which you have condemned me for the last six\r\nyears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want? I cannot help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell me which of them it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink that I can no longer see my children or feel them round me,\r\nwithout having my heart burdened with this doubt. Tell me which of them\r\nit is, and I swear that I will forgive you and treat it like the\r\nothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not the right to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not see that I can no longer endure this life, this thought\r\nwhich is wearing me out, or this question which I am constantly asking\r\nmyself, this question which tortures me each time I look at them? It is\r\ndriving me mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have suffered a great deal?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerribly. Should I, without that, have accepted the horror of living by\r\nyour side, and the still greater horror of feeling and knowing that\r\nthere is one among them whom I cannot recognize and who prevents me from\r\nloving the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have really suffered very much?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nAnd he replied in a constrained and sorrowful voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for do I not tell you every day that it is intolerable torture to\r\nme? Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did\r\nnot love them? Oh! You have behaved abominably toward me. All the\r\naffection of my heart I have bestowed upon my children, and that you\r\nknow. I am for them a father of the olden time, as I was for you a\r\nhusband of one of the families of old, for by instinct I have remained a\r\nnatural man, a man of former days. Yes, I will confess it, you have made\r\nme terribly jealous, because you are a woman of another race, of another\r\nsoul, with other requirements. Oh! I shall never forget the things you\r\nsaid to me, but from that day I troubled myself no more about you. I did\r\nnot kill you, because then I should have had no means on earth of ever\r\ndiscovering which of our\xe2\x80\x94of your children is not mine. I have waited,\r\nbut I have suffered more than you would believe, for I can no longer\r\nventure to love them, except, perhaps, the two eldest; I no longer\r\nventure to look at them, to call them to me, to kiss them; I cannot take\r\nthem on my knee without asking myself, 'Can it be this one?' I have been\r\ncorrect in my behavior toward you for six years, and even kind and\r\ncomplaisant. Tell me the truth, and I swear that I will do nothing\r\nunkind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought, in spite of the darkness of the carriage, that he could\r\nperceive that she was moved, and feeling certain that she was going to\r\nspeak at last, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you, I beseech you to tell me\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been more guilty than you think perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\ncould no longer endure that life of continual motherhood, and I had only\r\none means of driving you from me. I lied before God and I lied, with my\r\nhand raised to my children's head, for I never have wronged you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized her arm in the darkness, and squeezing it as he had done on\r\nthat terrible day of their drive in the Bois de Boulogne, he stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, wild with grief, he said with a groan: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have fresh doubts\r\nthat will never end! When did you lie, the last time or now? How am I to\r\nbelieve you at present? How can one believe a woman after that? I shall\r\nnever again know what I am to think. I would rather you had said to me,\r\n'It is Jacques or it is Jeanne.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carriage drove into the courtyard of the house and when it had drawn\r\nup in front of the steps the count alighted first, as usual, and offered\r\nhis wife his arm to mount the stairs. As soon as they reached the first\r\nfloor he said: \xe2\x80\x9cMay I speak to you for a few moments longer?\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cI am quite willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went into a small drawing-room and a footman, in some surprise,\r\nlighted the wax candles. As soon as he had left the room and they were\r\nalone the count continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to know the truth? I have begged\r\nyou a thousand times to speak, but you have remained dumb, impenetrable,\r\ninflexible, inexorable, and now to-day you tell me that you have been\r\nlying. For six years you have actually allowed me to believe such a\r\nthing! No, you are lying now, I do not know why, but out of pity for me,\r\nperhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied in a sincere and convincing manner: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had not done so, I\r\nshould have had four more children in the last six years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan a mother speak like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not feel that I am the mother of children who\r\nnever have been born; it is enough for me to be the mother of those that\r\nI have and to love them with all my heart. I am a woman of the civilized\r\nworld, monsieur\xe2\x80\x94we all are\xe2\x80\x94and we are no longer, and we refuse to be,\r\nmere females to restock the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up, but he seized her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly one word, Gabrielle. Tell me\r\nthe truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just told you. I never have dishonored you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked her full in the face, and how beautiful she was, with her gray\r\neyes, like the cold sky. In her dark hair sparkled the diamond coronet,\r\nlike a radiance. He suddenly felt, felt by a kind of intuition, that\r\nthis grand creature was not merely a being destined to perpetuate the\r\nrace, but the strange and mysterious product of all our complicated\r\ndesires which have been accumulating in us for centuries but which have\r\nbeen turned aside from their primitive and divine object and have\r\nwandered after a mystic, imperfectly perceived and intangible beauty.\r\nThere are some women like that, who blossom only for our dreams, adorned\r\nwith every poetical attribute of civilization, with that ideal luxury,\r\ncoquetry and esthetic charm which surround woman, a living statue that\r\nbrightens our life.\r\n\r\nHer husband remained standing before her, stupefied at his tardy and\r\nobscure discovery, confusedly hitting on the cause of his former\r\njealousy and understanding it all very imperfectly, and at last he said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you, for I feel at this moment that you are not lying, and\r\nbefore I really thought that you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand to him: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are friends then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and kissed it and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are friends. Thank you,\r\nGabrielle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went out, still looking at her, and surprised that she was still\r\nso beautiful and feeling a strange emotion arising in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATHER I\r\n\r\nHe was a clerk in the Bureau of Public Education and lived at\r\nBatignolles. He took the omnibus to Paris every morning and always sat\r\nopposite a girl, with whom he fell in love.\r\n\r\nShe was employed in a shop and went in at the same time every day. She\r\nwas a little brunette, one of those girls whose eyes are so dark that\r\nthey look like black spots, on a complexion like ivory. He always saw\r\nher coming at the corner of the same street, and she generally had to\r\nrun to catch the heavy vehicle, and sprang upon the steps before the\r\nhorses had quite stopped. Then she got inside, out of breath, and,\r\nsitting down, looked round her.\r\n\r\nThe first time that he saw her, Francois Tessier liked the face. One\r\nsometimes meets a woman whom one longs to clasp in one's arms without\r\neven knowing her. That girl seemed to respond to some chord in his\r\nbeing, to that sort of ideal of love which one cherishes in the depths\r\nof the heart, without knowing it.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her intently, not meaning to be rude, and she became\r\nembarrassed and blushed. He noticed it, and tried to turn away his eyes;\r\nbut he involuntarily fixed them upon her again every moment, although he\r\ntried to look in another direction; and, in a few days, they seemed to\r\nknow each other without having spoken. He gave up his place to her when\r\nthe omnibus was full, and got outside, though he was very sorry to do\r\nit. By this time she had got so far as to greet him with a little smile;\r\nand, although she always dropped her eyes under his looks, which she\r\nfelt were too ardent, yet she did not appear offended at being looked at\r\nin such a manner.\r\n\r\nThey ended by speaking. A kind of rapid friendship had become\r\nestablished between them, a daily freemasonry of half an hour, and that\r\nwas certainly one of the most charming half hours in his life to him. He\r\nthought of her all the rest of the day, saw her image continually during\r\nthe long office hours. He was haunted and bewitched by that floating and\r\nyet tenacious recollection which the form of a beloved woman leaves in\r\nus, and it seemed to him that if he could win that little person it\r\nwould be maddening happiness to him, almost above human realization.\r\n\r\nEvery morning she now shook hands with him, and he preserved the sense\r\nof that touch and the recollection of the gentle pressure of her little\r\nfingers until the next day, and he almost fancied that he preserved the\r\nimprint on his palm. He anxiously waited for this short omnibus ride,\r\nwhile Sundays seemed to him heartbreaking days. However, there was no\r\ndoubt that she loved him, for one Saturday, in spring, she promised to\r\ngo and lunch with him at Maisons-Laffitte the next day.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nShe was at the railway station first, which surprised him, but she said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore going, I want to speak to you. We have twenty minutes, and that\r\nis more than I shall take for what I have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe trembled as she hung on his arm, and looked down, her cheeks pale,\r\nas she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not want you to be deceived in me, and I shall\r\nnot go there with you, unless you promise, unless you swear\xe2\x80\x94not to\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94not to do anything\xe2\x80\x94that is at all improper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had suddenly become as red as a poppy, and said no more. He did not\r\nknow what to reply, for he was happy and disappointed at the same time.\r\nHe should love her less, certainly, if he knew that her conduct was\r\nlight, but then it would be so charming, so delicious to have a little\r\nflirtation.\r\n\r\nAs he did not say anything, she began to speak again in an agitated\r\nvoice and with tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not promise to respect me\r\naltogether, I shall return home.\xe2\x80\x9d And so he squeezed her arm tenderly\r\nand replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI promise, you shall only do what you like.\xe2\x80\x9d She appeared\r\nrelieved in mind, and asked, with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really mean it?\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe looked into her eyes and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI swear it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNow you may take the\r\ntickets,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nDuring the journey they could hardly speak, as the carriage was full,\r\nand when they reached Maisons-Laffite they went toward the Seine. The\r\nsun, which shone full on the river, on the leaves and the grass, seemed\r\nto be reflected in their hearts, and they went, hand in hand, along the\r\nbank, looking at the shoals of little fish swimming near the bank, and\r\nthey walked on, brimming over with happiness, as if they were walking on\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAt last she said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow foolish you must think me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cTo come out like this, all alone with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not; it is quite natural.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; it is not natural for me\r\n\xe2\x80\x94because I do not wish to commit a fault, and yet this is how girls\r\nfall. But if you only knew how wretched it is, every day the same thing,\r\nevery day in the month and every month in the year. I live quite alone\r\nwith mamma, and as she has had a great deal of trouble, she is not very\r\ncheerful. I do the best I can, and try to laugh in spite of everything,\r\nbut I do not always succeed. But, all the same, it was wrong in me to\r\ncome, though you, at any rate, will not be sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy way of an answer, he kissed her ardently on the ear that was nearest\r\nhim, but she moved from him with an abrupt movement, and, getting\r\nsuddenly angry, exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Monsieur Francois, after what you swore\r\nto me!\xe2\x80\x9d And they went back to Maisons-Laffitte.\r\n\r\nThey had lunch at the Petit-Havre, a low house, buried under four\r\nenormous poplar trees, by the side of the river. The air, the heat, the\r\nweak white wine and the sensation of being so close together made them\r\nsilent; their faces were flushed and they had a feeling of oppression;\r\nbut, after the coffee, they regained their high spirits, and, having\r\ncrossed the Seine, started off along the bank, toward the village of La\r\nFrette. Suddenly he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat-is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouise,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated and said nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe girl picked daisies and made them into a great bunch, while he sang\r\nvigorously, as unrestrained as a colt that has been turned into a\r\nmeadow. On their left a vine-covered slope followed the river. Francois\r\nstopped motionless with astonishment: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, look there!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe vines had come to an end, and the whole slope was covered with lilac\r\nbushes in flower. It was a purple wood! A kind of great carpet of\r\nflowers stretched over the earth, reaching as far as the village, more\r\nthan two miles off. She also stood, surprised and delighted, and\r\nmurmured: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! how pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d And, crossing a meadow, they ran toward that\r\ncurious low hill, which, every year, furnishes all the lilac that is\r\ndrawn through Paris on the carts of the flower venders.\r\n\r\nThere was a narrow path beneath the trees, so they took it, and when\r\nthey came to a small clearing, sat down.\r\n\r\nSwarms of flies were buzzing around them and making a continuous, gentle\r\nsound, and the sun, the bright sun of a perfectly still day, shone over\r\nthe bright slopes and from that forest of blossoms a powerful fragrance\r\nwas borne toward them, a breath of perfume, the breath of the flowers.\r\n\r\nA church clock struck in the distance, and they embraced gently, then,\r\nwithout the knowledge of anything but that kiss, lay down on the grass.\r\nBut she soon came to herself with the feeling of a great misfortune, and\r\nbegan to cry and sob with grief, with her face buried in her hands.\r\n\r\nHe tried to console her, but she wanted to start to return and to go\r\nhome immediately; and she kept saying, as she walked along quickly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! good heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said to her: \xe2\x80\x9cLouise! Louise! Please let us stop here.\xe2\x80\x9d But now her\r\ncheeks were red and her eyes hollow, and, as soon as they got to the\r\nrailway station in Paris, she left him without even saying good-by. III\r\n\r\nWhen he met her in the omnibus, next day, she appeared to him to be\r\nchanged and thinner, and she said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you; we\r\nwill get down at the Boulevard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were on the pavement, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must bid each other good-by; I cannot meet you again.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I cannot; I have been culpable, and I will not be so\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he implored her, tortured by his love, but she replied firmly: \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nI cannot, I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d He, however, only grew all the more excited and\r\npromised to marry her, but she said again: \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d and left him.\r\n\r\nFor a week he did not see her. He could not manage to meet her, and, as\r\nhe did not know her address, he thought that he had lost her altogether.\r\nOn the ninth day, however, there was a ring at his bell, and when he\r\nopened the door, she was there. She threw herself into his arms and did\r\nnot resist any longer, and for three months they were close friends. He\r\nwas beginning to grow tired of her, when she whispered something to him,\r\nand then he had one idea and wish: to break with her at any price. As,\r\nhowever, he could not do that, not knowing how to begin, or what to say,\r\nfull of anxiety through fear of the consequences of his rash\r\nindiscretion, he took a decisive step: one night he changed his lodgings\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe blow was so heavy that she did not look, for the man who had\r\nabandoned her, but threw herself at her mother's knees and confessed her\r\nmisfortune, and, some months after, gave birth to a boy. IV\r\n\r\nYears passed, and Francois Tessier grew old, without there having been\r\nany alteration in his life. He led the dull, monotonous life of an\r\noffice clerk, without hope and without expectation. Every day he got up\r\nat the same time, went through the same streets, went through the same\r\ndoor, past the same porter, went into the same office, sat in the same\r\nchair, and did the same work. He was alone in the world, alone during\r\nthe day in the midst of his different colleagues, and alone at night in\r\nhis bachelor's lodgings, and he laid by a hundred francs a month against\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday he went to the Champs-Elysees, to watch the elegant people,\r\nthe carriages and the pretty women, and the next day he used to say to\r\none of his colleagues: \xe2\x80\x9cThe return of the carriages from the Bois du\r\nBoulogne was very brilliant yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d One fine Sunday morning,\r\nhowever, he went into the Parc Monceau, where the mothers and nurses,\r\nsitting on the sides of the walks, watched the children playing, and\r\nsuddenly Francois Tessier started. A woman passed by, holding two\r\nchildren by the hand, a little boy of about ten and a little girl of\r\nfour. It was she!\r\n\r\nHe walked another hundred yards anti then fell into a chair, choking\r\nwith emotion. She had not recognized him, and so he came back, wishing\r\nto see her again. She was sitting down now, and the boy was standing by\r\nher side very quietly, while the little girl was making sand castles. It\r\nwas she, it was certainly she, but she had the reserved appearance of a\r\nlady, was dressed simply, and looked self-possessed and dignified. He\r\nlooked at her from a distance, for he did not venture to go near; but\r\nthe little boy raised his head, and Francois Tessier felt himself\r\ntremble. It was his own son, there could be no doubt of that. And, as he\r\nlooked at him, he thought he could recognize himself as he appeared in\r\nan old photograph taken years ago. He remained hidden behind a tree,\r\nwaiting for her to go that he might follow her.\r\n\r\nHe did not sleep that night. The idea of the child especially tormented\r\nhim. His son! Oh, if he could only have known, have been sure! But what\r\ncould he have done? However, he went to the house where she lived and\r\nasked about her. He was told that a neighbor, an honorable man of strict\r\nmorals, had been touched by her distress and had married her; he knew\r\nthe fault she had committed and had married her, and had even recognized\r\nthe child, his, Francois Tessier's child, as his own.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the Parc Monceau every Sunday, for then he always saw\r\nher, and each time he was seized with a mad, an irresistible longing to\r\ntake his son into his arms, to cover him with kisses and to steal him,\r\nto carry him off.\r\n\r\nHe suffered horribly in his wretched isolation as an old bachelor, with\r\nnobody to care for him, and he also suffered atrocious mental torture,\r\ntorn by paternal tenderness springing from remorse, longing and jealousy\r\nand from that need of loving one's own children which nature has\r\nimplanted in all. At last he determined to make a despairing attempt,\r\nand, going up to her, as she entered the park, he said, standing in the\r\nmiddle of the path, pale and with trembling lips: \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not recognize\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d She raised her eyes, looked at him, uttered an exclamation of\r\nhorror, of terror, and, taking the two children by the hand, she rushed\r\naway, dragging them after her, while he went home and wept inconsolably.\r\n\r\nMonths passed without his seeing her again, but he suffered, day and\r\nnight, for he was a prey to his paternal love. He would gladly have\r\ndied, if he could only have kissed his son; he would have committed\r\nmurder, performed any task, braved any danger, ventured anything. He\r\nwrote to her, but she did not reply, and, after writing her some twenty\r\nletters, he saw that there was no hope of altering her determination,\r\nand then he formed the desperate resolution of writing to her husband,\r\nbeing quite prepared to receive a bullet from a revolver, if need be.\r\nHis letter only consisted of a few lines, as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur: You must have a perfect horror of my name, but I am so\r\nwretched, so overcome by misery that my only hope is in you, and,\r\ntherefore, I venture to request you to grant me an interview of only\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day he received the reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur: I shall expect you to-morrow, Tuesday, at five o'clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he went up the staircase, Francois Tessier's heart beat so violently\r\nthat he had to stop several times. There was a dull and violent thumping\r\nnoise in his breast, as of some animal galloping; and he could breathe\r\nonly with difficulty, and had to hold on to the banisters, in order not\r\nto fall.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell on the third floor, and when a maid servant had opened\r\nthe door, he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Monsieur Flamel live here?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\r\nKindly come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was shown into the drawing-room; he was alone, and waited, feeling\r\nbewildered, as in the midst of a catastrophe, until a door opened, and a\r\nman came in. He was tall, serious and rather stout, and wore a black\r\nfrock coat, and pointed to a chair with his hand. Francois Tessier sat\r\ndown, and then said, with choking breath: \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur\xe2\x80\x94monsieur\xe2\x80\x94I do not\r\nknow whether you know my name\xe2\x80\x94whether you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Flamel interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need not tell it me, monsieur, I\r\nknow it. My wife has spoken to me about you.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke in the dignified\r\ntone of voice of a good man who wishes to be severe, and with the\r\ncommonplace stateliness of an honorable man, and Francois Tessier\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, I want to say this: I am dying of grief, of remorse, of\r\nshame, and I would like once, only once to kiss the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Flamel got up and rang the bell, and when the servant came in,\r\nhe said: \xe2\x80\x9cWill you bring Louis here?\xe2\x80\x9d When she had gone out, they\r\nremained face to face, without speaking, as they had nothing more to say\r\nto one another, and waited. Then, suddenly, a little boy of ten rushed\r\ninto the room and ran up to the man whom he believed to be his father,\r\nbut he stopped when he saw the stranger, and Monsieur Flamel kissed him\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, go and kiss that gentleman, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d And the child went\r\nup to the stranger and looked at him.\r\n\r\nFrancois Tessier had risen. He let his hat fall, and was ready to fall\r\nhimself as he looked at his son, while Monsieur Flamel had turned away,\r\nfrom a feeling of delicacy, and was looking out of the window.\r\n\r\nThe child waited in surprise; but he picked up the hat and gave it to\r\nthe stranger. Then Francois, taking the child up in his arms, began to\r\nkiss him wildly all over his face; on his eyes, his cheeks, his mouth,\r\nhis hair; and the youngster, frightened at the shower of kisses, tried\r\nto avoid them, turned away his head, and pushed away the man's face with\r\nhis little hands. But suddenly Francois Tessier put him down and cried:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by! good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d And he rushed out of the room as if he had been a\r\nthief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY UNCLE SOSTHENES\r\n\r\nSome people are Freethinkers from sheer stupidity. My Uncle Sosthenes\r\nwas one of these. Some people are often religious for the same reason.\r\nThe very sight of a priest threw my uncle into a violent rage. He would\r\nshake his fist and make grimaces at him, and would then touch a piece of\r\niron when the priest's back was turned, forgetting that the latter\r\naction showed a belief after all, the belief in the evil eye. Now, when\r\nbeliefs are unreasonable, one should have all or none at all. I myself\r\nam a Freethinker; I revolt at all dogmas, but feel no anger toward\r\nplaces of worship, be they Catholic, Apostolic, Roman, Protestant,\r\nGreek, Russian, Buddhist, Jewish, or Mohammedan.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was a Freemason, and I used to declare that they are stupider\r\nthan old women devotees. That is my opinion, and I maintain it; if we\r\nmust have any religion at all, the old one is good enough for me.\r\n\r\nWhat is their object? Mutual help to be obtained by tickling the palms\r\nof each other's hands. I see no harm in it, for they put into practice\r\nthe Christian precept: \xe2\x80\x9cDo unto others as ye would they should do unto\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d The only difference consists in the tickling, but it does not seem\r\nworth while to make such a fuss about lending a poor devil half a crown.\r\n\r\nTo all my arguments my uncle's reply used to be:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are raising up a religion against a religion; Free Thought will kill\r\nclericalism. Freemasonry is the stronghold, of those who are demolishing\r\nall deities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, my dear uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d I would reply\xe2\x80\x94in my heart I felt inclined to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cYou old idiot! it is just that which I am blaming you for. Instead\r\nof destroying, you are organizing competition; it is only a case of\r\nlowering prices. And then, if you admitted only Freethinkers among you,\r\nI could understand it, but you admit anybody. You have a number of\r\nCatholics among you, even the leaders of the party. Pius IX is said to\r\nhave been one of you before he became pope. If you call a society with\r\nsuch an organization a bulwark against clericalism, I think it is an\r\nextremely weak one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d my uncle would reply, with a wink, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are most to be\r\ndreaded in politics; slowly and surely we are everywhere undermining the\r\nmonarchical spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I broke out: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are very clever! If you tell me that\r\nFreemasonry is an election machine, I will grant it. I will never deny\r\nthat it is used as a machine to control candidates of all shades; if you\r\nsay that it is only used to hoodwink people, to drill them to go to the\r\npolls as soldiers are sent under fire, I agree with you; if you declare\r\nthat it is indispensable to all political ambitions because it changes\r\nall its members into electoral agents, I should say to you: 'That is as\r\nclear as the sun.' But when you tell me that it serves to undermine the\r\nmonarchical spirit, I can only laugh in your face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust consider that gigantic and secret democratic association which had\r\nPrince Napoleon for its grand master under the Empire; which has the\r\nCrown Prince for its grand master in Germany, the Czar's brother in\r\nRussia, and to which the Prince of Wales and King Humbert, and nearly\r\nall the crowned heads of the globe belong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d my uncle said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut all these persons are serving\r\nour projects without guessing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt inclined to tell him he was talking a pack of nonsense.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, indeed a sight to see my uncle when he had a Freemason\r\nto dinner.\r\n\r\nOn meeting they shook hands in a manner that was irresistibly funny; one\r\ncould see that they were going through a series of secret, mysterious\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\nThen my uncle would take his friend into a corner to tell him something\r\nimportant, and at dinner they had a peculiar way of looking at each\r\nother, and of drinking to each other, in a manner as if to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know\r\nall about it, don't we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd to think that there are millions on the face of the globe who are\r\namused at such monkey tricks! I would sooner be a Jesuit.\r\n\r\nNow, in our town there really was an old Jesuit who was my uncle's\r\ndetestation. Every time he met him, or if he only saw him at a distance,\r\nhe used to say: \xe2\x80\x9cGet away, you toad.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, taking my arm, he would\r\nwhisper to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, that fellow will play me a trick some day or other, I feel\r\nsure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle spoke quite truly, and this was how it happened, and through my\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nIt was close on Holy Week, and my uncle made up his mind to give a\r\ndinner on Good Friday, a real dinner, with his favorite chitterlings and\r\nblack puddings. I resisted as much as I could, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall eat meat on that day, but at home, quite by myself. Your\r\nmanifestation, as you call it, is an idiotic idea. Why should you\r\nmanifest? What does it matter to you if people do not eat any meat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut my uncle would not be persuaded. He asked three of his friends to\r\ndine with him at one of the best restaurants in the town, and as he was\r\ngoing to pay the bill I had certainly, after all, no scruples about\r\nmanifesting.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock we took a conspicuous place in the most frequented\r\nrestaurant in the town, and my uncle ordered dinner in a loud voice for\r\nsix o'clock.\r\n\r\nWe sat down punctually, and at ten o'clock we had not yet finished. Five\r\nof us had drunk eighteen bottles of choice, still wine and four of\r\nchampagne. Then my uncle proposed what he was in the habit of calling\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe archbishop's circuit.\xe2\x80\x9d Each man put six small glasses in front of\r\nhim, each of them filled with a different liqueur, and they had all to\r\nbe emptied at one gulp, one after another, while one of the waiters\r\ncounted twenty. It was very stupid, but my uncle thought it was very\r\nsuitable to the occasion.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock he was as drunk as a fly. So we had to take him home\r\nin a cab and put him to bed, and one could easily foresee that his anti-\r\nclerical demonstration would end in a terrible fit of indigestion.\r\n\r\nAs I was going back to my lodgings, being rather drunk myself, with a\r\ncheerful drunkenness, a Machiavellian idea struck me which satisfied all\r\nmy sceptical instincts.\r\n\r\nI arranged my necktie, put on a look of great distress, and went and,\r\nrang loudly at the old Jesuit's door. As he was deaf he made me wait a\r\nlongish while, but at length appeared at his window in a cotton nightcap\r\nand asked what I wanted.\r\n\r\nI shouted out at the top of my voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake haste, reverend sir, and open the door; a poor, despairing, sick\r\nman is in need of your spiritual ministrations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good, kind man put on his trousers as quickly as he could, and came\r\ndown without his cassock. I told him in a breathless voice that my\r\nuncle, the Freethinker, had been taken suddenly ill, and fearing it was\r\ngoing to be something serious, he had been seized with a sudden dread of\r\ndeath, and wished to see the priest and talk to him; to have his advice\r\nand comfort, to make his peace with the Church, and to confess, so as to\r\nbe able to cross the dreaded threshold at peace with himself; and I\r\nadded in a mocking tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, he wishes it, and if it does him no good it can do him no\r\nharm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old Jesuit, who was startled, delighted, and almost trembling, said\r\nto me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, my son; I will come with you.\xe2\x80\x9d But I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon\r\nme, reverend father, if I do not go with you; but my convictions will\r\nnot allow me to do so. I even refused to come and fetch you, so I beg\r\nyou not to say that you have seen me, but to declare that you had a\r\npresentiment\xe2\x80\x94a sort of revelation of his illness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest consented and went off quickly; knocked at my uncle's door,\r\nand was soon let in; and I saw the black cassock disappear within that\r\nstronghold of Free Thought.\r\n\r\nI hid under a neighboring gateway to wait results. Had he been well, my\r\nuncle would have half-murdered the Jesuit, but I knew that he would\r\nscarcely be able to move an arm, and I asked myself gleefully what sort\r\nof a scene would take place between these antagonists, what disputes,\r\nwhat arguments, what a hubbub, and what would be the issue of the\r\nsituation, which my uncle's indignation would render still more tragic?\r\n\r\nI laughed till my sides ached, and said half aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a joke,\r\nwhat a joke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it was getting very cold, and I noticed that the Jesuit stayed\r\na long time, and I thought: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are having an argument, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne, two, three hours passed, and still the reverend father did not come\r\nout. What had happened? Had my uncle died in a fit when he saw him, or\r\nhad he killed the cassocked gentleman? Perhaps they had mutually\r\ndevoured each other? This last supposition appeared very unlikely, for I\r\nfancied that my uncle was quite incapable of swallowing a grain more\r\nnourishment at that moment.\r\n\r\nAt last the day broke.\r\n\r\nI was very uneasy, and, not venturing to go into the house myself, went\r\nto one of my friends who lived opposite. I woke him up, explained\r\nmatters to him, much to his amusement and astonishment, and took\r\npossession of his window.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock he relieved me, and I got a little sleep. At two o'clock\r\nI, in my turn, replaced him. We were utterly astonished.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock the Jesuit left, with a very happy and satisfied look on\r\nhis face, and we saw him go away with a quiet step.\r\n\r\nThen, timid and ashamed, I went and knocked at the door of my uncle's\r\nhouse; and when the servant opened it I did not dare to ask her any\r\nquestions, but went upstairs without saying a word.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was lying, pale and exhausted, with weary, sorrowful eyes and\r\nheavy arms, on his bed. A little religious picture was fastened to one\r\nof the bed curtains with a pin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cin bed still? Are you not well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied in a feeble voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear boy, I have been very ill, nearly dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was that, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know; it was most surprising. But what is stranger still is\r\nthat the Jesuit priest who has just left\xe2\x80\x94you know, that excellent man\r\nwhom I have made such fun of\xe2\x80\x94had a divine revelation of my state, and\r\ncame to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was seized with an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh, and with\r\ndifficulty said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, really!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he came. He heard a voice telling him to get up and come to me,\r\nbecause I was going to die. I was a revelation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pretended to sneeze, so as not to burst out laughing; I felt inclined\r\nto roll on the ground with amusement.\r\n\r\nIn about a minute I managed to say indignantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you received him, uncle? You, a Freethinker, a Freemason? You did\r\nnot have him thrown out of doors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed confused, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen a moment, it is so astonishing\xe2\x80\x94so astonishing and providential!\r\nHe also spoke to me about my father; it seems he knew him formerly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father, uncle? But that is no reason for receiving a Jesuit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that, but I was very ill, and he looked after me most devotedly\r\nall night long. He was perfect; no doubt he saved my life; those men all\r\nknow a little of medicine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! he looked after you all night? But you said just now that he had\r\nonly been gone a very short time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite true; I kept him to breakfast after all his kindness. He\r\nhad it at a table by my bedside while I drank a cup of tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he ate meat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle looked vexed, as if I had said something very uncalled for, and\r\nthen added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't joke, Gaston; such things are out of place at times. He has shown\r\nme more devotion than many a relation would have done, and I expect to\r\nhave his convictions respected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis rather upset me, but I answered, nevertheless: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, uncle;\r\nand what did you do after breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe played a game of bezique, and then he repeated his breviary while I\r\nread a little book which he happened to have in his pocket, and which\r\nwas not by any means badly written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA religious book, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and no, or, rather\xe2\x80\x94no. It is the history of their missions in\r\nCentral Africa, and is rather a book of travels and adventures. What\r\nthese men have done is very grand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to feel that matters were going badly, so I got up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-\r\nby, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI see you are going to give up Freemasonry for\r\nreligion; you are a renegade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still rather confused, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but religion is a sort of Freemasonry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is your Jesuit coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't\xe2\x80\x94I don't know exactly; to-morrow, perhaps; but it is not\r\ncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went out, altogether overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nMy joke turned out very badly for me! My uncle became thoroughly\r\nconverted, and if that had been all I should not have cared so much.\r\nClerical or Freemason, to me it is all the same; six of one and half a\r\ndozen of the other; but the worst of it is that he has just made his\r\nwill\xe2\x80\x94yes, made his will\xe2\x80\x94and he has disinherited me in favor of that\r\nrascally Jesuit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARONESS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend Boisrene, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will see some very\r\ninteresting bric-a-brac and works of art there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe conducted me to the first floor of an elegant house in one of the big\r\nstreets of Paris. We were welcomed by a very pleasing man, with\r\nexcellent manners, who led us from room to room, showing us rare things,\r\nthe price of which he mentioned carelessly. Large sums, ten, twenty,\r\nthirty, fifty thousand francs, dropped from his lips with such grace and\r\nease that one could not doubt that this gentleman-merchant had millions\r\nshut up in his safe.\r\n\r\nI had known him by reputation for a long time. Very bright, clever,\r\nintelligent, he acted as intermediary in all sorts of transactions. He\r\nkept in touch with all the richest art amateurs in Paris, and even of\r\nEurope and America, knowing their tastes and preferences; he apprised\r\nthem by letter, or by wire if they lived in a distant city, as soon as\r\nhe knew of some work of art which might suit them.\r\n\r\nMen of the best society had had recourse to him in times of difficulty,\r\neither to find money for gambling, or to pay off a debt, or to sell a\r\npicture, a family jewel, or a tapestry.\r\n\r\nIt was said that he never refused his services when he saw a chance of\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nBoisrene seemed very intimate with this strange merchant. They must have\r\nworked together in many a deal. I observed the man with great interest.\r\n\r\nHe was tall, thin, bald, and very elegant. His soft, insinuating voice\r\nhad a peculiar, tempting charm which seemed to give the objects a\r\nspecial value. When he held anything in his hands, he turned it round\r\nand round, looking at it with such skill, refinement, and sympathy that\r\nthe object seemed immediately to be beautiful and transformed by his\r\nlook and touch. And its value increased in one's estimation, after the\r\nobject had passed from the showcase into his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your Crucifix,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boisrene, \xe2\x80\x9cthat beautiful Renaissance Crucifix\r\nwhich you showed me last year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man smiled and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been sold, and in a very peculiar manner. There is a real\r\nParisian story for you! Would you like to hear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the Baroness Samoris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes and no. I have seen her once, but I know what she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know\xe2\x80\x94everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind telling me, so that I can see whether you are not\r\nmistaken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Mme. Samoris is a woman of the world who has a daughter,\r\nwithout anyone having known her husband. At any rate, she is received in\r\na certain tolerant, or blind society. She goes to church and devoutly\r\npartakes of Communion, so that everyone may know it, and she never\r\ncompromises herself. She expects her daughter to marry well. Is that\r\ncorrect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I will complete your information. She is a woman who makes\r\nherself respected by her admirers in spite of everything. That is a rare\r\nquality, for in this manner she can get what she wishes from a man. The\r\nman whom she has chosen without his suspecting it courts her for a long\r\ntime, longs for her timidly, wins her with astonishment and possesses\r\nher with consideration. He does not notice that he is paying, she is so\r\ntactful; and she maintains her relations on such a footing of reserve\r\nand dignity that he would slap the first man who dared doubt her in the\r\nleast. And all this in the best of faith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral times I have been able to render little services to this woman.\r\nShe has no secrets from me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward the beginning of January she came to me in order to borrow\r\nthirty thousand francs. Naturally, I did not lend them to her; but, as I\r\nwished to oblige her, I told her to explain her situation to me\r\ncompletely, so that I might see whether there was not something I could\r\ndo for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me her troubles in such cautious language that she could not\r\nhave spoken more delicately of her child's first communion. I finally\r\nmanaged to understand that times were hard, and that she was penniless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe commercial crisis, political unrest, rumors of war, had made money\r\nscarce even in the hands of her clients. And then, of course, she was\r\nvery particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would associate only with a man in the best of society, who could\r\nstrengthen her reputation as well as help her financially. A reveller,\r\nno matter how rich, would have compromised her forever, and would have\r\nmade the marriage of her daughter quite doubtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had to maintain her household expenses and continue to entertain,\r\nin order not to lose the opportunity of finding, among her numerous\r\nvisitors, the discreet and distinguished friend for whom she was\r\nwaiting, and whom she would choose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI showed her that my thirty thousand francs would have but little\r\nlikelihood of returning to me; for, after spending them all, she would\r\nhave to find at least sixty thousand more, in a lump, to pay me back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed very disheartened when she heard this. I did not know just\r\nwhat to do, when an idea, a really fine idea, struck me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had just bought this Renaissance Crucifix which I showed you, an\r\nadmirable piece of workmanship, one of the finest of its land that I\r\nhave ever seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My dear friend,' I said to her, 'I am going to send you that piece of\r\nivory. You will invent some ingenious, touching, poetic story, anything\r\nthat you wish, to explain your desire for parting with it. It is, of\r\ncourse, a family heirloom left you by your father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I myself will send you amateurs, or will bring them to you. The rest\r\nconcerns you. Before they come I will drop you a line about their\r\nposition, both social and financial. This Crucifix is worth fifty\r\nthousand francs; but I will let it go for thirty thousand. The\r\ndifference will belong to you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe considered the matter seriously for several minutes, and then\r\nanswered: 'Yes, it is, perhaps, a good idea. I thank you very-much.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day I sent her my Crucifix, and the same evening the Baron de\r\nSaint-Hospital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor three months I sent her my best clients, from a business point of\r\nview. But I heard nothing more from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day I received a visit from a foreigner who spoke very little\r\nFrench. I decided to introduce him personally to the baroness, in order\r\nto see how she was getting along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA footman in black livery received us and ushered us into a quiet\r\nlittle parlor, furnished with taste, where we waited for several\r\nminutes. She appeared, charming as usual, extended her hand to me and\r\ninvited us to be seated; and when I had explained the reason of my\r\nvisit, she rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe footman appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'See if Mlle. Isabelle can let us go into her oratory.' The young girl\r\nherself brought the answer. She was about fifteen years of age, modest\r\nand good to look upon in the sweet freshness of her youth. She wished to\r\nconduct us herself to her chapel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a kind of religious boudoir where a silver lamp was burning\r\nbefore the Crucifix, my Crucifix, on a background of black velvet. The\r\nsetting was charming and very clever. The child crossed herself and then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Look, gentlemen. Isn't it beautiful?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the object, examined it and declared it to be remarkable. The\r\nforeigner also examined it, but he seemed much more interested in the\r\ntwo women than in the crucifix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA delicate odor of incense, flowers and perfume pervaded the whole\r\nhouse. One felt at home there. This really was a comfortable home, where\r\none would have liked to linger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we had returned to the parlor I delicately broached the subject of\r\nthe price. Mme. Samoris, lowering her eyes, asked fifty thousand francs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she added: 'If you wish to see it again, monsieur, I very seldom\r\ngo out before three o'clock; and I can be found at home every day.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the street the stranger asked me for some details about the\r\nbaroness, whom he had found charming. But I did not hear anything more\r\nfrom either of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree months passed by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne morning, hardly two weeks ago, she came here at about lunch time,\r\nand, placing a roll of bills in my hand, said: 'My dear, you are an\r\nangel! Here are fifty thousand francs; I am buying your crucifix, and I\r\nam paying twenty thousand francs more for it than the price agreed upon,\r\non condition that you always\xe2\x80\x94always send your clients to me\xe2\x80\x94for it is\r\nstill for sale.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER AND SON\r\n\r\nA party of men were chatting in the smoking room after dinner. We were\r\ntalking of unexpected legacies, strange inheritances. Then M. le\r\nBrument, who was sometimes called \xe2\x80\x9cthe illustrious judge\xe2\x80\x9d and at other\r\ntimes \xe2\x80\x9cthe illustrious lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d went and stood with his back to the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto search for an heir who disappeared under\r\npeculiarly distressing circumstances. It is one of those simple and\r\nterrible dramas of ordinary life, a thing which possibly happens every\r\nday, and which is nevertheless one of the most dreadful things I know.\r\nHere are the facts:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly six months ago I was called to the bedside of a dying woman. She\r\nsaid to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Monsieur, I want to intrust to you the most delicate, the most\r\ndifficult, and the most wearisome mission that can be conceived. Be good\r\nenough to notice my will, which is there on the table. A sum of five\r\nthousand francs is left to you as a fee if you do not succeed, and of a\r\nhundred thousand francs if you do succeed. I want you to find my son\r\nafter my death.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe asked me to assist her to sit up in bed, in order that she might\r\ntalk with greater ease, for her voice, broken and gasping, was whistling\r\nin her throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very wealthy establishment. The luxurious apartment, of an\r\nelegant simplicity, was upholstered with materials as thick as walls,\r\nwith a soft inviting surface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dying woman continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are the first to hear my horrible story. I will try to have\r\nstrength enough to finish it. You must know all, in order that you, whom\r\nI know to be a kind-hearted man as well as a man of the world, may have\r\na sincere desire to aid me with all your power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Listen to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Before my marriage, I loved a young man, whose suit was rejected by my\r\nfamily because he was not rich enough. Not long afterward, I married a\r\nman of great wealth. I married him through ignorance, through obedience,\r\nthrough indifference, as young girls do marry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I had a child, a boy. My husband died in the course of a few years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He whom I had loved had married, in his turn. When he saw that I was a\r\nwidow, he was crushed by grief at knowing he was not free. He came to\r\nsee me; he wept and sobbed so bitterly, that it was enough to break my\r\nheart. He came to see me at first as a friend. Perhaps I ought not to\r\nhave received him. What could I do? I was alone, so sad, so solitary, so\r\nhopeless! And I loved him still. What sufferings we women have sometimes\r\nto endure!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I had only him in the world, my parents being dead. He came\r\nfrequently; he spent whole evenings with me. I should not have let him\r\ncome so often, seeing that he was married. But I had not enough will-\r\npower to prevent him from coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How can I tell it?\xe2\x80\x94he became my lover. How did this come about? Can I\r\nexplain it? Can any one explain such things? Do you think it could be\r\notherwise when two human beings are drawn to each other by the\r\nirresistible force of mutual affection? Do you believe, monsieur, that\r\nit is always in our power to resist, that we can keep up the struggle\r\nforever, and refuse to yield to the prayers, the supplications, the\r\ntears, the frenzied words, the appeals on bended knees, the transports\r\nof passion, with which we are pursued by the man we adore, whom we want\r\nto gratify even in his slightest wishes, whom we desire to crown with\r\nevery possible happiness, and whom, if we are to be guided by a worldly\r\ncode of honor, we must drive to despair? What strength would it not\r\nrequire? What a renunciation of happiness? what self-denial? and even\r\nwhat virtuous selfishness?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'In short, monsieur, I was his mistress; and I was happy. I became\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthis was my greatest weakness and my greatest piece of cowardice-I\r\nbecame his wife's friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'We brought up my son together; we made a man of him, a thorough man,\r\nintelligent, full of sense and resolution, of large and generous ideas.\r\nThe boy reached the age of seventeen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He, the young man, was fond of my\xe2\x80\x94my lover, almost as fond of him as I\r\nwas myself, for he had been equally cherished and cared for by both of\r\nus. He used to call him his 'dear friend,' and respected him immensely,\r\nhaving never received from him anything but wise counsels and an example\r\nof integrity, honor, and probity. He looked upon him as an old loyal and\r\ndevoted comrade of his mother, as a sort of moral father, guardian,\r\nprotector\xe2\x80\x94how am I to describe it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Perhaps the reason why he never asked any questions was that he had\r\nbeen accustomed from his earliest years to see this man in my house, at\r\nmy side, and at his side, always concerned about us both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'One evening the three of us were to dine together\xe2\x80\x94this was my chief\r\namusement\xe2\x80\x94and I waited for the two men, asking myself which of them\r\nwould be the first to arrive. The door opened; it was my old friend. I\r\nwent toward him, with outstretched arms; and he pressed my lips in a\r\nlong, delicious kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'All of a sudden, a slight sound, a faint rustling, that mysterious\r\nsensation which indicates the presence of another person, made us start\r\nand turn round abruptly. Jean, my son, stood there, livid, staring at\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'There was a moment of atrocious confusion. I drew back, holding out my\r\nhand toward my son as if in supplication; but I could not see him. He\r\nhad gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'We remained facing each other\xe2\x80\x94my lover and I\xe2\x80\x94crushed, unable to utter\r\na word. I sank into an armchair, and I felt a desire, a vague, powerful\r\ndesire, to flee, to go out into the night, and to disappear forever.\r\nThen convulsive sobs rose in my throat, and I wept, shaken with spasms,\r\nmy heart breaking, all my nerves writhing with the horrible sensation of\r\nan irreparable misfortune, and with that dreadful sense of shame which,\r\nin such moments as this, fills a mother's heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He looked at me in a terrified manner, not venturing to approach, to\r\nspeak to me, or to touch me, for fear of the boy's return. At last he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am going to follow him-to talk to him\xe2\x80\x94to explain matters to him. In\r\nshort, I must see him and let him know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And he hurried away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I waited\xe2\x80\x94waited in a distracted frame of mind, trembling at the least\r\nsound, starting with fear and with some unutterably strange and\r\nintolerable emotion at every slight crackling of the fire in the grate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I waited an hour, two hours, feeling my heart swell with a dread I had\r\nnever before experienced, such anguish that I would not wish the\r\ngreatest criminal to endure ten minutes of such misery. Where was my\r\nson? What was he doing?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'About midnight, a messenger brought me a note from my lover. I still\r\nknow its contents by heart:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Has your son returned? I did not find him. I am down here. I do not\r\nwant to go up at this hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I wrote in pencil on the same slip of paper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Jean has not returned. You must find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And I remained all night in the armchair, waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I felt as if I were going mad. I longed to run wildly about, to roll\r\non the ground. And yet I did not even stir, but kept waiting hour after\r\nhour. What was going to happen? I tried to imagine, to guess. But I\r\ncould form no conception, in spite of my efforts, in spite of the\r\ntortures of my soul!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And now I feared that they might meet. What would they do in that\r\ncase? What would my son do? My mind was torn with fearful doubts, with\r\nterrible suppositions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You can understand my feelings, can you not, monsieur? \xe2\x80\x9c'My\r\nchambermaid, who knew nothing, who understood nothing, came into the\r\nroom every moment, believing, naturally, that I had lost my reason. I\r\nsent her away with a word or a movement of the hand. She went for the\r\ndoctor, who found me in the throes of a nervous attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I was put to bed. I had brain fever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'When I regained consciousness, after a long illness, I saw beside my\r\nbed my\xe2\x80\x94lover\xe2\x80\x94alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My son? Where is my son?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He made no reply. I stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Dead-dead. Has he committed suicide?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, no, I swear it. But we have not found him in spite of all my\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then, becoming suddenly exasperated and even indignant\xe2\x80\x94for women are\r\nsubject to such outbursts of unaccountable and unreasoning anger\xe2\x80\x94I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I forbid you to come near me or to see me again unless you find him.\r\nGo away!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did go away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have never seen one or the other of them since, monsieur, and thus I\r\nhave lived for the last twenty years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Can you imagine what all this meant to me? Can you understand this\r\nmonstrous punishment, this slow, perpetual laceration of a mother's\r\nheart, this abominable, endless waiting? Endless, did I say? No; it is\r\nabout to end, for I am dying. I am dying without ever again seeing\r\neither of them\xe2\x80\x94either one or the other!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He\xe2\x80\x94the man I loved\xe2\x80\x94has written to me every day for the last twenty\r\nyears; and I\xe2\x80\x94I have never consented to see him, even for one second; for\r\nI had a strange feeling that, if he were to come back here, my son would\r\nmake his appearance at the same moment. Oh! my son! my son! Is he dead?\r\nIs he living? Where is he hiding? Over there, perhaps, beyond the great\r\nocean, in some country so far away that even its very name is unknown to\r\nme! Does he ever think of me? Ah! if he only knew! How cruel one's\r\nchildren are! Did he understand to what frightful suffering he condemned\r\nme, into what depths of despair, into what tortures, he cast me while I\r\nwas still in the prime of life, leaving me to suffer until this moment,\r\nwhen I am about to die\xe2\x80\x94me, his mother, who loved him with all the\r\nintensity of a mother's love? Oh! isn't it cruel, cruel?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You will tell him all this, monsieur\xe2\x80\x94will you not? You will repeat to\r\nhim my last words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My child, my dear, dear child, be less harsh toward poor women! Life\r\nis already brutal and savage enough in its dealings with them. My dear\r\nson, think of what the existence of your poor mother has been ever since\r\nthe day you left her. My dear child, forgive her, and love her, now that\r\nshe is dead, for she has had to endure the most frightful penance ever\r\ninflicted on a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gasped for breath, trembling, as if she had addressed the last\r\nwords to her son and as if he stood by her bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You will tell him also, monsieur, that I never again saw-the other.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more she ceased speaking, then, in a broken voice, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Leave me now, I beg of you. I want to die all alone, since they are\r\nnot with me.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaitre Le Brument added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I left the house, monsieurs, crying like a fool, so bitterly,\r\nindeed, that my coachman turned round to stare at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think that, every day, dramas like this are being enacted all\r\naround us!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not found the son\xe2\x80\x94that son\xe2\x80\x94well, say what you like about him,\r\nbut I call him that criminal son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAND\r\n\r\nAll were crowding around M. Bermutier, the judge, who was giving his\r\nopinion about the Saint-Cloud mystery. For a month this in explicable\r\ncrime had been the talk of Paris. Nobody could make head or tail of it.\r\n\r\nM. Bermutier, standing with his back to the fireplace, was talking,\r\nciting the evidence, discussing the various theories, but arriving at no\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nSome women had risen, in order to get nearer to him, and were standing\r\nwith their eyes fastened on the clean-shaven face of the judge, who was\r\nsaying such weighty things. They, were shaking and trembling, moved by\r\nfear and curiosity, and by the eager and insatiable desire for the\r\nhorrible, which haunts the soul of every woman. One of them, paler than\r\nthe others, said during a pause:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's terrible. It verges on the supernatural. The truth will never be\r\nknown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge turned to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, madame, it is likely that the actual facts will never be\r\ndiscovered. As for the word 'supernatural' which you have just used, it\r\nhas nothing to do with the matter. We are in the presence of a very\r\ncleverly conceived and executed crime, so well enshrouded in mystery\r\nthat we cannot disentangle it from the involved circumstances which\r\nsurround it. But once I had to take charge of an affair in which the\r\nuncanny seemed to play a part. In fact, the case became so confused that\r\nit had to be given up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral women exclaimed at once:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Tell us about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Bermutier smiled in a dignified manner, as a judge should, and went\r\non:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think, however, that I, for one minute, ascribed anything in the\r\ncase to supernatural influences. I believe only in normal causes. But\r\nif, instead of using the word 'supernatural' to express what we do not\r\nunderstand, we were simply to make use of the word 'inexplicable,' it\r\nwould be much better. At any rate, in the affair of which I am about to\r\ntell you, it is especially the surrounding, preliminary circumstances\r\nwhich impressed me. Here are the facts:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was, at that time, a judge at Ajaccio, a little white city on the\r\nedge of a bay which is surrounded by high mountains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe majority of the cases which came up before me concerned vendettas.\r\nThere are some that are superb, dramatic, ferocious, heroic. We find\r\nthere the most beautiful causes for revenge of which one could dream,\r\nenmities hundreds of years old, quieted for a time but never\r\nextinguished; abominable stratagems, murders becoming massacres and\r\nalmost deeds of glory. For two years I heard of nothing but the price of\r\nblood, of this terrible Corsican prejudice which compels revenge for\r\ninsults meted out to the offending person and all his descendants and\r\nrelatives. I had seen old men, children, cousins murdered; my head was\r\nfull of these stories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day I learned that an Englishman had just hired a little villa at\r\nthe end of the bay for several years. He had brought with him a French\r\nservant, whom he had engaged on the way at Marseilles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon this peculiar person, living alone, only going out to hunt and\r\nfish, aroused a widespread interest. He never spoke to any one, never\r\nwent to the town, and every morning he would practice for an hour or so\r\nwith his revolver and rifle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLegends were built up around him. It was said that he was some high\r\npersonage, fleeing from his fatherland for political reasons; then it\r\nwas affirmed that he was in hiding after having committed some\r\nabominable crime. Some particularly horrible circumstances were even\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my judicial position I thought it necessary to get some information\r\nabout this man, but it was impossible to learn anything. He called\r\nhimself Sir John Rowell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI therefore had to be satisfied with watching him as closely as I\r\ncould, but I could see nothing suspicious about his actions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, as rumors about him were growing and becoming more widespread,\r\nI decided to try to see this stranger myself, and I began to hunt\r\nregularly in the neighborhood of his grounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a long time I watched without finding an opportunity. At last it\r\ncame to me in the shape of a partridge which I shot and killed right in\r\nfront of the Englishman. My dog fetched it for me, but, taking the bird,\r\nI went at once to Sir John Rowell and, begging his pardon, asked him to\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a big man, with red hair and beard, very tall, very broad, a\r\nkind of calm and polite Hercules. He had nothing of the so-called\r\nBritish stiffness, and in a broad English accent he thanked me warmly\r\nfor my attention. At the end of a month we had had five or six\r\nconversations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night, at last, as I was passing before his door, I saw him in the\r\ngarden, seated astride a chair, smoking his pipe. I bowed and he invited\r\nme to come in and have a glass of beer. I needed no urging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe received me with the most punctilious English courtesy, sang the\r\npraises of France and of Corsica, and declared that he was quite in love\r\nwith this country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, with great caution and under the guise of a vivid interest, I\r\nasked him a few questions about his life and his plans. He answered\r\nwithout embarrassment, telling me that he had travelled a great deal in\r\nAfrica, in the Indies, in America. He added, laughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have had many adventures.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I turned the conversation on hunting, and he gave me the most\r\ncurious details on hunting the hippopotamus, the tiger, the elephant and\r\neven the gorilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Are all these animals dangerous?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe smiled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, no! Man is the worst.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he laughed a good broad laugh, the wholesome laugh of a contented\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have also frequently been man-hunting.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he began to talk about weapons, and he invited me to come in and\r\nsee different makes of guns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis parlor was draped in black, black silk embroidered in gold. Big\r\nyellow flowers, as brilliant as fire, were worked on the dark material.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is a Japanese material.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in the middle of the widest panel a strange thing attracted my\r\nattention. A black object stood out against a square of red velvet. I\r\nwent up to it; it was a hand, a human hand. Not the clean white hand of\r\na skeleton, but a dried black hand, with yellow nails, the muscles\r\nexposed and traces of old blood on the bones, which were cut off as\r\nclean as though it had been chopped off with an axe, near the middle of\r\nthe forearm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAround the wrist, an enormous iron chain, riveted and soldered to this\r\nunclean member, fastened it to the wall by a ring, strong enough to hold\r\nan elephant in leash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What is that?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman answered quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That is my best enemy. It comes from America, too. The bones were\r\nsevered by a sword and the skin cut off with a sharp stone and dried in\r\nthe sun for a week.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI touched these human remains, which must have belonged to a giant. The\r\nuncommonly long fingers were attached by enormous tendons which still\r\nhad pieces of skin hanging to them in places. This hand was terrible to\r\nsee; it made one think of some savage vengeance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This man must have been very strong.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman answered quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, but I was stronger than he. I put on this chain to hold him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that he was joking. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This chain is useless now, the hand won't run away.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir John Rowell answered seriously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It always wants to go away. This chain is needed.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI glanced at him quickly, questioning his face, and I asked myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Is he an insane man or a practical joker?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut his face remained inscrutable, calm and friendly. I turned to other\r\nsubjects, and admired his rifles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I noticed that he kept three loaded revolvers in the room, as\r\nthough constantly in fear of some attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI paid him several calls. Then I did not go any more. People had become\r\nused to his presence; everybody had lost interest in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA whole year rolled by. One morning, toward the end of November, my\r\nservant awoke me and announced that Sir John Rowell had been murdered\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour later I entered the Englishman's house, together with the\r\npolice commissioner and the captain of the gendarmes. The servant,\r\nbewildered and in despair, was crying before the door. At first I\r\nsuspected this man, but he was innocent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe guilty party could never be found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn entering Sir John's parlor, I noticed the body, stretched out on its\r\nback, in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis vest was torn, the sleeve of his jacket had been pulled off,\r\neverything pointed to, a violent struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman had been strangled! His face was black, swollen and\r\nfrightful, and seemed to express a terrible fear. He held something\r\nbetween his teeth, and his neck, pierced by five or six holes which\r\nlooked as though they had been made by some iron instrument, was covered\r\nwith blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA physician joined us. He examined the finger marks on the neck for a\r\nlong time and then made this strange announcement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It looks as though he had been strangled by a skeleton.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cold chill seemed to run down my back, and I looked over to where I\r\nhad formerly seen the terrible hand. It was no longer there. The chain\r\nwas hanging down, broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bent over the dead man and, in his contracted mouth, I found one of\r\nthe fingers of this vanished hand, cut\xe2\x80\x94or rather sawed off by the teeth\r\ndown to the second knuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the investigation began. Nothing could be discovered. No door,\r\nwindow or piece of furniture had been forced. The two watch dogs had not\r\nbeen aroused from their sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, in a few words, is the testimony of the servant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a month his master had seemed excited. He had received many\r\nletters, which he would immediately burn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften, in a fit of passion which approached madness, he had taken a\r\nswitch and struck wildly at this dried hand riveted to the wall, and\r\nwhich had disappeared, no one knows how, at the very hour of the crime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would go to bed very late and carefully lock himself in. He always\r\nkept weapons within reach. Often at night he would talk loudly, as\r\nthough he were quarrelling with some one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat night, somehow, he had made no noise, and it was only on going to\r\nopen the windows that the servant had found Sir John murdered. He\r\nsuspected no one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI communicated what I knew of the dead man to the judges and public\r\nofficials. Throughout the whole island a minute investigation was\r\ncarried on. Nothing could be found out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night, about three months after the crime, I had a terrible\r\nnightmare. I seemed to see the horrible hand running over my curtains\r\nand walls like an immense scorpion or spider. Three times I awoke, three\r\ntimes I went to sleep again; three times I saw the hideous object\r\ngalloping round my room and moving its fingers like legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe following day the hand was brought me, found in the cemetery, on\r\nthe grave of Sir John Rowell, who had been buried there because we had\r\nbeen unable to find his family. The first finger was missing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies, there is my story. I know nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe women, deeply stirred, were pale and trembling. One of them\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is neither a climax nor an explanation! We will be unable to\r\nsleep unless you give us your opinion of what had occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge smiled severely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Ladies, I shall certainly spoil your terrible dreams. I simply\r\nbelieve that the legitimate owner of the hand was not dead, that he came\r\nto get it with his remaining one. But I don't know how. It was a kind of\r\nvendetta.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the women murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it can't be that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the judge, still smiling, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn't I tell you that my explanation would not satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRESS OF HAIR\r\n\r\nThe walls of the cell were bare and white washed. A narrow grated\r\nwindow, placed so high that one could not reach it, lighted this\r\nsinister little room. The mad inmate, seated on a straw chair, looked at\r\nus with a fixed, vacant and haunted expression. He was very thin, with\r\nhollow cheeks and hair almost white, which one guessed might have turned\r\ngray in a few months. His clothes appeared to be too large for his\r\nshrunken limbs, his sunken chest and empty paunch. One felt that this\r\nman's mind was destroyed, eaten by his thoughts, by one thought, just as\r\na fruit is eaten by a worm. His craze, his idea was there in his brain,\r\ninsistent, harassing, destructive. It wasted his frame little by little.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x94the invisible, impalpable, intangible, immaterial idea\xe2\x80\x94was mining his\r\nhealth, drinking his blood, snuffing out his life.\r\n\r\nWhat a mystery was this man, being killed by an ideal! He aroused\r\nsorrow, fear and pity, this madman. What strange, tremendous and deadly\r\nthoughts dwelt within this forehead which they creased with deep\r\nwrinkles which were never still?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has terrible attacks of rage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor to me. \xe2\x80\x9cHis is one of\r\nthe most peculiar cases I have ever seen. He has seizures of erotic and\r\nmacaberesque madness. He is a sort of necrophile. He has kept a journal\r\nin which he sets forth his disease with the utmost clearness. In it you\r\ncan, as it were, put your finger on it. If it would interest you, you\r\nmay go over this document.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed the doctor into his office, where he handed me this wretched\r\nman's diary, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cRead it and tell me what you think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d I read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil the age of thirty-two I lived peacefully, without knowing love.\r\nLife appeared very simple, very pleasant and very easy. I was rich. I\r\nenjoyed so many things that I had no passion for anything in particular.\r\nIt was good to be alive! I awoke happy every morning and did those\r\nthings that pleased me during the day and went to bed at night\r\ncontented, in the expectation of a peaceful tomorrow and a future\r\nwithout anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had had a few flirtations without my heart being touched by any true\r\npassion or wounded by any of the sensations of true love. It is good to\r\nlive like that. It is better to love, but it is terrible. And yet those\r\nwho love in the ordinary way must experience ardent happiness, though\r\nless than mine possibly, for love came to me in a remarkable manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was wealthy, I bought all kinds of old furniture and old\r\ncuriosities, and I often thought of the unknown hands that had touched\r\nthese objects, of the eyes that had admired them, of the hearts that had\r\nloved them; for one does love things! I sometimes remained hours and\r\nhours looking at a little watch of the last century. It was so tiny, so\r\npretty with its enamel and gold chasing. And it kept time as on the day\r\nwhen a woman first bought it, enraptured at owning this dainty trinket.\r\nIt had not ceased to vibrate, to live its mechanical life, and it had\r\nkept up its regular tick-tock since the last century. Who had first worn\r\nit on her bosom amid the warmth of her clothing, the heart of the watch\r\nbeating beside the heart of the woman? What hand had held it in its warm\r\nfingers, had turned it over and then wiped the enamelled shepherds on\r\nthe case to remove the slight moisture from her fingers? What eyes had\r\nwatched the hands on its ornamental face for the expected, the beloved,\r\nthe sacred hour?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I wished I had known her, seen her, the woman who had selected this\r\nexquisite and rare object! She is dead! I am possessed with a longing\r\nfor women of former days. I love, from afar, all those who have loved.\r\nThe story of those dead and gone loves fills my heart with regrets. Oh,\r\nthe beauty, the smiles, the youthful caresses, the hopes! Should not all\r\nthat be eternal?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I have wept whole nights-thinking of those poor women of former\r\ndays, so beautiful, so loving, so sweet, whose arms were extended in an\r\nembrace, and who now are dead! A kiss is immortal! It goes from lips to\r\nlips, from century to century, from age to age. Men receive them, give\r\nthem and die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe past attracts me, the present terrifies me because the future means\r\ndeath. I regret all that has gone by. I mourn all who have lived; I\r\nshould like to check time, to stop the clock. But time goes, it goes, it\r\npasses, it takes from me each second a little of myself for the\r\nannihilation of to-morrow. And I shall never live again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, ye women of yesterday. I love you!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not to be pitied. I found her, the one I was waiting for, and\r\nthrough her I enjoyed inestimable pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sauntering in Paris on a bright, sunny morning, with a happy\r\nheart and a high step, looking in at the shop windows with the vague\r\ninterest of an idler. All at once I noticed in the shop of a dealer in\r\nantiques a piece of Italian furniture of the seventeenth century. It was\r\nvery handsome, very rare. I set it down as being the work of a Venetian\r\nartist named Vitelli, who was celebrated in his day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went on my way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did the remembrance of that piece of furniture haunt me with such\r\ninsistence that I retraced my steps? I again stopped before the shop, in\r\norder to take another look at it, and I felt that it tempted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a singular thing temptation is! One gazes at an object, and,\r\nlittle by little, it charms you, it disturbs you, it fills your thoughts\r\nas a woman's face might do. The enchantment of it penetrates your being,\r\na strange enchantment of form, color and appearance of an inanimate\r\nobject. And one loves it, one desires it, one wishes to have it. A\r\nlonging to own it takes possession of you, gently at first, as though it\r\nwere timid, but growing, becoming intense, irresistible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the dealers seem to guess, from your ardent gaze, your secret and\r\nincreasing longing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bought this piece of furniture and had it sent home at once. I placed\r\nit in my room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am sorry for those who do not know the honeymoon of the collector\r\nwith the antique he has just purchased. One looks at it tenderly and\r\npasses one's hand over it as if it were human flesh; one comes back to\r\nit every moment, one is always thinking of it, wherever one goes,\r\nwhatever one does. The dear recollection of it pursues you in the\r\nstreet, in society, everywhere; and when you return home at night,\r\nbefore taking off your gloves or your hat; you go and look at it with\r\nthe tenderness of a lover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly, for eight days I worshipped this piece of furniture. I opened\r\nits doors and pulled out the drawers every few moments. I handled it\r\nwith rapture, with all the intense joy of possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut one evening I surmised, while I was feeling the thickness of one of\r\nthe panels, that there must be a secret drawer in it: My heart began to\r\nbeat, and I spent the night trying to discover this secret cavity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI succeeded on the following day by driving a knife into a slit in the\r\nwood. A panel slid back and I saw, spread out on a piece of black\r\nvelvet, a magnificent tress of hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a woman's hair, an immense coil of fair hair, almost red, which\r\nmust have been cut off close to the head, tied with a golden cord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stood amazed, trembling, confused. An almost imperceptible perfume,\r\nso ancient that it seemed to be the spirit of a perfume, issued from\r\nthis mysterious drawer and this remarkable relic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lifted it gently, almost reverently, and took it out of its hiding\r\nplace. It at once unwound in a golden shower that reached to the floor,\r\ndense but light; soft and gleaming like the tail of a comet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange emotion filled me. What was this? When, how, why had this\r\nhair been shut up in this drawer? What adventure, what tragedy did this\r\nsouvenir conceal? Who had cut it off? A lover on a day of farewell, a\r\nhusband on a day of revenge, or the one whose head it had graced on the\r\nday of despair?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it as she was about to take the veil that they had cast thither\r\nthat love dowry as a pledge to the world of the living? Was it when they\r\nwere going to nail down the coffin of the beautiful young corpse that\r\nthe one who had adored her had cut off her tresses, the only thing that\r\nhe could retain of her, the only living part of her body that would not\r\nsuffer decay, the only thing he could still love, and caress, and kiss\r\nin his paroxysms of grief?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it not strange that this tress should have remained as it was in\r\nlife, when not an atom of the body on which it grew was in existence?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt fell over my fingers, tickled the skin with a singular caress, the\r\ncaress of a dead woman. It affected me so that I felt as though I should\r\nweep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI held it in my hands for a long time, then it seemed as if it\r\ndisturbed me, as though something of the soul had remained in it. And I\r\nput it back on the velvet, rusty from age, and pushed in the drawer,\r\nclosed the doors of the antique cabinet and went out for a walk to\r\nmeditate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked along, filled with sadness and also with unrest, that unrest\r\nthat one feels when in love. I felt as though I must have lived before,\r\nas though I must have known this woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Villon's lines came to my mind like a sob:\r\n\r\nTell me where, and in what place Is Flora, the beautiful Roman,\r\nHipparchia and Thais Who was her cousin-german?\r\n\r\nEcho answers in the breeze O'er river and lake that blows, Their beauty\r\nwas above all praise, But where are last year's snows?\r\n\r\nThe queen, white as lilies, Who sang as sing the birds, Bertha\r\nBroadfoot, Beatrice, Alice, Ermengarde, princess of Maine, And Joan, the\r\ngood Lorraine, Burned by the English at Rouen, Where are they, Virgin\r\nQueen? And where are last year's snows?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I got home again I felt an irresistible longing to see my singular\r\ntreasure, and I took it out and, as I touched it, I felt a shiver go all\r\nthrough me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor some days, however, I was in my ordinary condition, although the\r\nthought of that tress of hair was always present to my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I came into the house I had to see it and take it in my,\r\nhands. I turned the key of the cabinet with the same hesitation that one\r\nopens the door leading to one's beloved, for in my hands and my heart I\r\nfelt a confused, singular, constant sensual longing to plunge my hands\r\nin the enchanting golden flood of those dead tresses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, after I had finished caressing it and had locked the cabinet I\r\nfelt as if it were a living thing, shut up in there, imprisoned; and I\r\nlonged to see it again. I felt again the imperious desire to take it in\r\nmy hands, to touch it, to even feel uncomfortable at the cold, slippery,\r\nirritating, bewildering contact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lived thus for a month or two, I forget how long. It obsessed me,\r\nhaunted me. I was happy and tormented by turns, as when one falls in\r\nlove, and after the first vows have been exchanged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shut myself in the room with it to feel it on my skin, to bury my\r\nlips in it, to kiss it. I wound it round my face, covered my eyes with\r\nthe golden flood so as to see the day gleam through its gold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved it! Yes, I loved it. I could not be without it nor pass an hour\r\nwithout looking at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I waited\xe2\x80\x94I waited\xe2\x80\x94for what? I do not know\xe2\x80\x94For her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night I woke up suddenly, feeling as though I were not alone in my\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was alone, nevertheless, but I could not go to sleep again, and, as I\r\nwas tossing about feverishly, I got up to look at the golden tress. It\r\nseemed softer than usual, more life-like. Do the dead come back? I\r\nalmost lost consciousness as I kissed it. I took it back with me to bed\r\nand pressed it to my lips as if it were my sweetheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo the dead come back? She came back. Yes, I saw her; I held her in my\r\narms, just as she was in life, tall, fair and round. She came back every\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x94the dead woman, the beautiful, adorable, mysterious unknown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy happiness was so great that I could not conceal it. No lover ever\r\ntasted such intense, terrible enjoyment. I loved her so well that I\r\ncould not be separated from her. I took her with me always and\r\neverywhere. I walked about the town with her as if she were my wife, and\r\ntook her to the theatre, always to a private box. But they saw her\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nguessed\xe2\x80\x94they arrested me. They put me in prison like a criminal. They\r\ntook her. Oh, misery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the manuscript stopped. And as I suddenly raised my astonished eyes\r\nto the doctor a terrific cry, a howl of impotent rage and of exasperated\r\nlonging resounded through the asylum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to douse the obscene madman with\r\nwater five times a day. Sergeant Bertrand was the only one who was in\r\nlove with the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFilled with astonishment, horror and pity, I stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94that tress\xe2\x80\x94did it really exist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose, opened a cabinet full of phials and instruments and\r\ntossed over a long tress of fair hair which flew toward me like a golden\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nI shivered at feeling its soft, light touch on my hands. And I sat\r\nthere, my heart beating with disgust and desire, disgust as at the\r\ncontact of anything accessory to a crime and desire as at the temptation\r\nof some infamous and mysterious thing.\r\n\r\nThe doctor said as he shrugged his shoulders:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mind of man is capable of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE RIVER\r\n\r\nI rented a little country house last summer on the banks of the Seine,\r\nseveral leagues from Paris, and went out there to sleep every evening.\r\nAfter a few days I made the acquaintance of one of my neighbors, a man\r\nbetween thirty and forty, who certainly was the most curious specimen I\r\never met. He was an old boating man, and crazy about boating. He was\r\nalways beside the water, on the water, or in the water. He must have\r\nbeen born in a boat, and he will certainly die in a boat at the last.\r\n\r\nOne evening as we were walking along the banks of the Seine I asked him\r\nto tell me some stories about his life on the water. The good man at\r\nonce became animated, his whole expression changed, he became eloquent,\r\nalmost poetical. There was in his heart one great passion, an absorbing,\r\nirresistible passion-the river.\r\n\r\nAh, he said to me, how many memories I have, connected with that river\r\nthat you see flowing beside us! You people who live in streets know\r\nnothing about the river. But listen to a fisherman as he mentions the\r\nword. To him it is a mysterious thing, profound, unknown, a land of\r\nmirages and phantasmagoria, where one sees by night things that do not\r\nexist, hears sounds that one does not recognize, trembles without\r\nknowing why, as in passing through a cemetery\xe2\x80\x94and it is, in fact, the\r\nmost sinister of cemeteries, one in which one has no tomb.\r\n\r\nThe land seems limited to the river boatman, and on dark nights, when\r\nthere is no moon, the river seems limitless. A sailor has not the same\r\nfeeling for the sea. It is often remorseless and cruel, it is true; but\r\nit shrieks, it roars, it is honest, the great sea; while the river is\r\nsilent and perfidious. It does not speak, it flows along without a\r\nsound; and this eternal motion of flowing water is more terrible to me\r\nthan the high waves of the ocean.\r\n\r\nDreamers maintain that the sea hides in its bosom vast tracts of blue\r\nwhere those who are drowned roam among the big fishes, amid strange\r\nforests and crystal grottoes. The river has only black depths where one\r\nrots in the slime. It is beautiful, however, when it sparkles in the\r\nlight of the rising sun and gently laps its banks covered with\r\nwhispering reeds.\r\n\r\nThe poet says, speaking of the ocean,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO waves, what mournful tragedies ye know \xe2\x80\x94Deep waves, the dread of\r\nkneeling mothers' hearts! Ye tell them to each other as ye roll On\r\nflowing tide, and this it is that gives The sad despairing tones unto\r\nyour voice As on ye roll at eve by mounting tide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I think that the stories whispered by the slender reeds, with\r\ntheir little soft voices, must be more sinister than the lugubrious\r\ntragedies told by the roaring of the waves.\r\n\r\nBut as you have asked for some of my recollections, I will tell you of a\r\nsingular adventure that happened to me ten years ago.\r\n\r\nI was living, as I am now, in Mother Lafon's house, and one of my\r\nclosest friends, Louis Bernet who has now given up boating, his low\r\nshoes and his bare neck, to go into the Supreme Court, was living in the\r\nvillage of C., two leagues further down the river. We dined together\r\nevery day, sometimes at his house, sometimes at mine.\r\n\r\nOne evening as I was coming home along and was pretty tired, rowing with\r\ndifficulty my big boat, a twelve-footer, which I always took out at\r\nnight, I stopped a few moments to draw breath near the reed-covered\r\npoint yonder, about two hundred metres from the railway bridge.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent night, the moon shone brightly, the river gleamed,\r\nthe air was calm and soft. This peacefulness tempted me. I thought to\r\nmyself that it would be pleasant to smoke a pipe in this spot. I took up\r\nmy anchor and cast it into the river.\r\n\r\nThe boat floated downstream with the current, to the end of the chain,\r\nand then stopped, and I seated myself in the stern on my sheepskin and\r\nmade myself as comfortable as possible. There was not a sound to be\r\nheard, except that I occasionally thought I could perceive an almost\r\nimperceptible lapping of the water against the bank, and I noticed\r\ntaller groups of reeds which assumed strange shapes and seemed, at\r\ntimes, to move.\r\n\r\nThe river was perfectly calm, but I felt myself affected by the unusual\r\nsilence that surrounded me. All the creatures, frogs and toads, those\r\nnocturnal singers of the marsh, were silent.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a frog croaked to my right, and close beside me. I shuddered.\r\nIt ceased, and I heard nothing more, and resolved to smoke, to soothe my\r\nmind. But, although I was a noted colorer of pipes, I could not smoke;\r\nat the second draw I was nauseated, and gave up trying. I began to sing.\r\nThe sound of my voice was distressing to me. So I lay still, but\r\npresently the slight motion of the boat disturbed me. It seemed to me as\r\nif she were making huge lurches, from bank to bank of the river,\r\ntouching each bank alternately. Then I felt as though an invisible\r\nforce, or being, were drawing her to the surface of the water and\r\nlifting her out, to let her fall again. I was tossed about as in a\r\ntempest. I heard noises around me. I sprang to my feet with a single\r\nbound. The water was glistening, all was calm.\r\n\r\nI saw that my nerves were somewhat shaky, and I resolved to leave the\r\nspot. I pulled the anchor chain, the boat began to move; then I felt a\r\nresistance. I pulled harder, the anchor did not come up; it had caught\r\non something at the bottom of the river and I could not raise it. I\r\nbegan pulling again, but all in vain. Then, with my oars, I turned the\r\nboat with its head up stream to change the position of the anchor. It\r\nwas no use, it was still caught. I flew into a rage and shook the chain\r\nfuriously. Nothing budged. I sat down, disheartened, and began to\r\nreflect on my situation. I could not dream of breaking this chain, or\r\ndetaching it from the boat, for it was massive and was riveted at the\r\nbows to a piece of wood as thick as my arm. However, as the weather was\r\nso fine I thought that it probably would not be long before some\r\nfisherman came to my aid. My ill-luck had quieted me. I sat down and was\r\nable, at length, to smoke my pipe. I had a bottle of rum; I drank two or\r\nthree glasses, and was able to laugh at the situation. It was very warm;\r\nso that, if need be, I could sleep out under the stars without any great\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a little knock at the side of the boat. I gave a\r\nstart, and a cold sweat broke out all over me. The noise was, doubtless,\r\ncaused by some piece of wood borne along by the current, but that was\r\nenough, and I again became a prey to a strange nervous agitation. I\r\nseized the chain and tensed my muscles in a desperate effort. The anchor\r\nheld firm. I sat down again, exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe river had slowly become enveloped in a thick white fog which lay\r\nclose to the water, so that when I stood up I could see neither the\r\nriver, nor my feet, nor my boat; but could perceive only the tops of the\r\nreeds, and farther off in the distance the plain, lying white in the\r\nmoonlight, with big black patches rising up from it towards the sky,\r\nwhich were formed by groups of Italian poplars. I was as if buried to\r\nthe waist in a cloud of cotton of singular whiteness, and all sorts of\r\nstrange fancies came into my mind. I thought that someone was trying to\r\nclimb into my boat which I could no longer distinguish, and that the\r\nriver, hidden by the thick fog, was full of strange creatures which were\r\nswimming all around me. I felt horribly uncomfortable, my forehead felt\r\nas if it had a tight band round it, my heart beat so that it almost\r\nsuffocated me, and, almost beside myself, I thought of swimming away\r\nfrom the place. But then, again, the very idea made me tremble with\r\nfear. I saw myself, lost, going by guesswork in this heavy fog,\r\nstruggling about amid the grasses and reeds which I could not escape, my\r\nbreath rattling with fear, neither seeing the bank, nor finding my boat;\r\nand it seemed as if I would feel myself dragged down by the feet to the\r\nbottom of these black waters.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as I should have had to ascend the stream at least five hundred\r\nmetres before finding a spot free from grasses and rushes where I could\r\nland, there were nine chances to one that I could not find my way in the\r\nfog and that I should drown, no matter how well I could swim.\r\n\r\nI tried to reason with myself. My will made me resolve not to be afraid,\r\nbut there was something in me besides my will, and that other thing was\r\nafraid. I asked myself what there was to be afraid of. My brave \xe2\x80\x9cego\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nridiculed my coward \xe2\x80\x9cego,\xe2\x80\x9d and never did I realize, as on that day, the\r\nexistence in us of two rival personalities, one desiring a thing, the\r\nother resisting, and each winning the day in turn.\r\n\r\nThis stupid, inexplicable fear increased, and became terror. I remained\r\nmotionless, my eyes staring, my ears on the stretch with expectation. Of\r\nwhat? I did not know, but it must be something terrible. I believe if it\r\nhad occurred to a fish to jump out of the water, as often happens,\r\nnothing more would have been required to make me fall over, stiff and\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nHowever, by a violent effort I succeeded in becoming almost rational\r\nagain. I took up my bottle of rum and took several pulls. Then an idea\r\ncame to me, and I began to shout with all my might towards all the\r\npoints of the compass in succession. When my throat was absolutely\r\nparalyzed I listened. A dog was howling, at a great distance.\r\n\r\nI drank some more rum and stretched myself out at the bottom of the\r\nboat. I remained there about an hour, perhaps two, not sleeping, my eyes\r\nwide open, with nightmares all about me. I did not dare to rise, and yet\r\nI intensely longed to do so. I delayed it from moment to moment. I said\r\nto myself: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, get up!\xe2\x80\x9d and I was afraid to move. At last I raised\r\nmyself with infinite caution as though my life depended on the slightest\r\nsound that I might make; and looked over the edge of the boat. I was\r\ndazzled by the most marvellous, the most astonishing sight that it is\r\npossible to see. It was one of those phantasmagoria of fairyland, one of\r\nthose sights described by travellers on their return from distant lands,\r\nwhom we listen to without believing.\r\n\r\nThe fog which, two hours before, had floated on the water, had gradually\r\ncleared off and massed on the banks, leaving the river absolutely clear;\r\nwhile it formed on either bank an uninterrupted wall six or seven metres\r\nhigh, which shone in the moonlight with the dazzling brilliance of snow.\r\nOne saw nothing but the river gleaming with light between these two\r\nwhite mountains; and high above my head sailed the great full moon, in\r\nthe midst of a bluish, milky sky.\r\n\r\nAll the creatures in the water were awake. The frogs croaked furiously,\r\nwhile every few moments I heard, first to the right and then to the\r\nleft, the abrupt, monotonous and mournful metallic note of the\r\nbullfrogs. Strange to say, I was no longer afraid. I was in the midst of\r\nsuch an unusual landscape that the most remarkable things would not have\r\nastonished me.\r\n\r\nHow long this lasted I do not know, for I ended by falling asleep. When\r\nI opened my eyes the moon had gone down and the sky was full of clouds.\r\nThe water lapped mournfully, the wind was blowing, it was pitch dark. I\r\ndrank the rest of the rum, then listened, while I trembled, to the\r\nrustling of the reeds and the foreboding sound of the river. I tried to\r\nsee, but could not distinguish my boat, nor even my hands, which I held\r\nup close to my eyes.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, however, the blackness became less intense. All at\r\nonce I thought I noticed a shadow gliding past, quite near me. I\r\nshouted, a voice replied; it was a fisherman. I called him; he came near\r\nand I told him of my ill-luck. He rowed his boat alongside of mine and,\r\ntogether, we pulled at the anchor chain. The anchor did not move. Day\r\ncame, gloomy gray, rainy and cold, one of those days that bring one\r\nsorrows and misfortunes. I saw another boat. We hailed it. The man on\r\nboard of her joined his efforts to ours, and gradually the anchor\r\nyielded. It rose, but slowly, slowly, loaded down by a considerable\r\nweight. At length we perceived a black mass and we drew it on board. It\r\nwas the corpse of an old women with a big stone round her neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRIPPLE\r\n\r\nThe following adventure happened to me about 1882. I had just taken the\r\ntrain and settled down in a corner, hoping that I should be left alone,\r\nwhen the door suddenly opened again and I heard a voice say: \xe2\x80\x9cTake care,\r\nmonsieur, we are just at a crossing; the step is very high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother voice answered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat's all right, Laurent, I have a firm hold\r\non the handle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen a head appeared, and two hands seized the leather straps hanging on\r\neither side of the door and slowly pulled up an enormous body, whose\r\nfeet striking on the step, sounded like two canes. When the man had\r\nhoisted his torso into the compartment I noticed, at the loose edge of\r\nhis trousers, the end of a wooden leg, which was soon followed by its\r\nmate. A head appeared behind this traveller and asked; \xe2\x80\x9cAre you all\r\nright, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen here are your packages and crutches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a servant, who looked like an old soldier, climbed in, carrying in\r\nhis arms a stack of bundles wrapped in black and yellow papers and\r\ncarefully tied; he placed one after the other in the net over his\r\nmaster's head. Then he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, monsieur, that is all. There are\r\nfive of them\xe2\x80\x94the candy, the doll the drum, the gun, and the pate de\r\nfoies gras.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Laurent; good health!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man closed the door and walked away, and I looked at my neighbor. He\r\nwas about thirty-five, although his hair was almost white; he wore the\r\nribbon of the Legion of Honor; he had a heavy mustache and was quite\r\nstout, with the stoutness of a strong and active man who is kept\r\nmotionless on account of some infirmity. He wiped his brow, sighed, and,\r\nlooking me full in the face, he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes smoking annoy you,\r\nmonsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurely I knew that eye, that voice, that face. But when and where had I\r\nseen them? I had certainly met that man, spoken to him, shaken his hand.\r\nThat was a long, long time ago. It was lost in the haze wherein the mind\r\nseems to feel around blindly for memories and pursues them like fleeing\r\nphantoms without being able to seize them. He, too, was observing me,\r\nstaring me out of countenance, with the persistence of a man who\r\nremembers slightly but not completely. Our eyes, embarrassed by this\r\npersistent contact, turned away; then, after a few minutes, drawn\r\ntogether again by the obscure and tenacious will of working memory, they\r\nmet once more, and I said: \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, instead of staring at each other\r\nfor an hour or so, would it not be better to try to discover where we\r\nhave known each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy neighbor answered graciously: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI named myself: \xe2\x80\x9cI am Henri Bonclair, a magistrate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for a few minutes; then, with the vague look and voice\r\nwhich accompany great mental tension, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I remember\r\nperfectly. I met you twelve years ago, before the war, at the Poincels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur. Ah! Ah! You are Lieutenant Revaliere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I was Captain Revaliere even up to the time when I lost my feet\r\n\xe2\x80\x94both of them together from one cannon ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow that we knew each other's identity we looked at each other again. I\r\nremembered perfectly the handsome, slender youth who led the cotillons\r\nwith such frenzied agility and gracefulness that he had been nicknamed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe fury.\xe2\x80\x9d Going back into the dim, distant past, I recalled a story\r\nwhich I had heard and forgotten, one of those stories to which one\r\nlistens but forgets, and which leave but a faint impression upon the\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThere was something about love in it. Little by little the shadows\r\ncleared up, and the face of a young girl appeared before my eyes. Then\r\nher name struck me with the force of an explosion: Mademoiselle de\r\nMandel. I remembered everything now. It was indeed a love story, but\r\nquite commonplace. The young girl loved this young man, and when I had\r\nmet them there was already talk of the approaching wedding. The youth\r\nseemed to be very much in love, very happy.\r\n\r\nI raised my eye to the net, where all the packages which had been\r\nbrought in by the servant were trembling from the motion of the train,\r\nand the voice of the servant came back to me, as if he had just finished\r\nspeaking. He had said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, monsieur, that is all. There are five of\r\nthem: the candy, the doll, the drum, the gun, and the pate de foies\r\ngras.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, in a second, a whole romance unfolded itself in my head. It was\r\nlike all those which I had already read, where the young lady married\r\nnotwithstanding the catastrophe, whether physical or financial;\r\ntherefore, this officer who had been maimed in the war had returned,\r\nafter the campaign, to the young girl who had given him her promise, and\r\nshe had kept her word.\r\n\r\nI considered that very beautiful, but simple, just as one, considers\r\nsimple all devotions and climaxes in books or in plays. It always seems,\r\nwhen one reads or listens to these stories of magnanimity, that one\r\ncould sacrifice one's self with enthusiastic pleasure and overwhelming\r\njoy. But the following day, when an unfortunate friend comes to borrow\r\nsome money, there is a strange revulsion of feeling.\r\n\r\nBut, suddenly, another supposition, less poetic and more realistic,\r\nreplaced the first one. Perhaps he had married before the war, before\r\nthis frightful accident, and she, in despair and resignation, had been\r\nforced to receive, care for, cheer, and support this husband, who had\r\ndeparted, a handsome man, and had returned without his feet, a frightful\r\nwreck, forced into immobility, powerless anger, and fatal obesity.\r\n\r\nWas he happy or in torture? I was seized with an irresistible desire to\r\nknow his story, or, at least, the principal points, which would permit\r\nme to guess that which he could not or would not tell me. Still thinking\r\nthe matter over, I began talking to him. We had exchanged a few\r\ncommonplace words; and I raised my eyes to the net, and thought: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nmust have three children: the bonbons are for his wife, the doll for his\r\nlittle girl, the drum and the gun for his sons, and this pate de foies\r\ngras for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly I asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a father, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI suddenly felt confused, as if I had been guilty of some breach of\r\netiquette, and I continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. I had thought that you\r\nwere when I heard your servant speaking about the toys. One listens and\r\ndraws conclusions unconsciously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled and then murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not even married. I am still at\r\nthe preliminary stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pretended suddenly to remember, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that's true! When I knew you, you were engaged to Mademoiselle de\r\nMandel, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, your memory is excellent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI grew very bold and added: \xe2\x80\x9cI also seem to remember hearing that\r\nMademoiselle de Mandel married Monsieur\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe calmly mentioned the name: \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Fleurel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that's it! I remember it was on that occasion that I heard of your\r\nwound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked him full in the face, and he blushed. His full face, which was\r\nalready red from the oversupply of blood, turned crimson. He answered\r\nquickly, with a sudden ardor of a man who is pleading a cause which is\r\nlost in his mind and in his heart, but which he does not wish to admit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is wrong, monsieur, to couple my name with that of Madame de\r\nFleurel. When I returned from the war-without my feet, alas! I never\r\nwould have permitted her to become my wife. Was it possible? When one\r\nmarries, monsieur, it is not in order to parade one's generosity; it is\r\nin order to live every day, every hour, every minute, every second\r\nbeside a man; and if this man is disfigured, as I am, it is a death\r\nsentence to marry him! Oh, I understand, I admire all sacrifices and\r\ndevotions when they have a limit, but I do not admit that a woman should\r\ngive up her whole life, all joy, all her dreams, in order to satisfy the\r\nadmiration of the gallery. When I hear, on the floor of my room, the\r\ntapping of my wooden legs and of my crutches, I grow angry enough to\r\nstrangle my servant. Do you think that I would permit a woman to do what\r\nI myself am unable to tolerate? And, then, do you think that my stumps\r\nare pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent. What could I say? He certainly was right. Could I blame\r\nher, hold her in contempt, even say that she was wrong? No. However, the\r\nend which conformed to the rule, to the truth, did not satisfy my poetic\r\nappetite. These heroic deeds demand a beautiful sacrifice, which seemed\r\nto be lacking, and I felt a certain disappointment. I suddenly asked:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Madame de Fleurel any children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one girl and two boys. It is for them that I am bringing these\r\ntoys. She and her husband are very kind to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train was going up the incline to Saint-Germain. It passed through\r\nthe tunnels, entered the station, and stopped. I was about to offer my\r\narm to the wounded officer, in order to help him descend, when two hands\r\nwere stretched up to him through the open door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello! my dear Revaliere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Hello, Fleurel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStanding behind the man, the woman, still beautiful, was smiling and\r\nwaving her hands to him. A little girl, standing beside her, was jumping\r\nfor joy, and two young boys were eagerly watching the drum and the gun,\r\nwhich were passing from the car into their father's hands.\r\n\r\nWhen the cripple was on the ground, all the children kissed him. Then\r\nthey set off, the little girl holding in her hand the small varnished\r\nrung of a crutch, just as she might walk beside her big friend and hold\r\nhis thumb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STROLL\r\n\r\nWhen Old Man Leras, bookkeeper for Messieurs Labuze and Company, left\r\nthe store, he stood for a minute bewildered at the glory of the setting\r\nsun. He had worked all day in the yellow light of a small jet of gas,\r\nfar in the back of the store, on a narrow court, as deep as a well. The\r\nlittle room where he had been spending his days for forty years was so\r\ndark that even in the middle of summer one could hardly see without\r\ngaslight from eleven until three.\r\n\r\nIt was always damp and cold, and from this hole on which his window\r\nopened came the musty odor of a sewer.\r\n\r\nFor forty years Monsieur Leras had been arriving every morning in this\r\nprison at eight o'clock, and he would remain there until seven at night,\r\nbending over his books, writing with the industry of a good clerk.\r\n\r\nHe was now making three thousand francs a year, having started at\r\nfifteen hundred. He had remained a bachelor, as his means did not allow\r\nhim the luxury of a wife, and as he had never enjoyed anything, he\r\ndesired nothing. From time to time, however, tired of this continuous\r\nand monotonous work, he formed a platonic wish: \xe2\x80\x9cGad! If I only had an\r\nincome of fifteen thousand francs, I would take life easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had never taken life easy, as he had never had anything but his\r\nmonthly salary. His life had been uneventful, without emotions, without\r\nhopes. The faculty of dreaming with which every one is blessed had never\r\ndeveloped in the mediocrity of his ambitions.\r\n\r\nWhen he was twenty-one he entered the employ of Messieurs Labuze and\r\nCompany. And he had never left them.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 he had lost his father and then his mother in 1859. Since then\r\nthe only incident in his life was when he moved, in 1868, because his\r\nlandlord had tried to raise his rent.\r\n\r\nEvery day his alarm clock, with a frightful noise of rattling chains,\r\nmade him spring out of bed at 6 o'clock precisely.\r\n\r\nTwice, however, this piece of mechanism had been out of order\xe2\x80\x94once in\r\n1866 and again in 1874; he had never been able to find out the reason\r\nwhy. He would dress, make his bed, sweep his room, dust his chair and\r\nthe top of his bureau. All this took him an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nThen he would go out, buy a roll at the Lahure Bakery, in which he had\r\nseen eleven different owners without the name ever changing, and he\r\nwould eat this roll on the way to the office.\r\n\r\nHis entire existence had been spent in the narrow, dark office, which\r\nwas still decorated with the same wall paper. He had entered there as a\r\nyoung man, as assistant to Monsieur Brument, and with the desire to\r\nreplace him.\r\n\r\nHe had taken his place and wished for nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe whole harvest of memories which other men reap in their span of\r\nyears, the unexpected events, sweet or tragic loves, adventurous\r\njourneys, all the occurrences of a free existence, all these things had\r\nremained unknown to him.\r\n\r\nDays, weeks, months, seasons, years, all were alike to him. He got up\r\nevery day at the same hour, started out, arrived at the office, ate\r\nluncheon, went away, had dinner and went to bed without ever\r\ninterrupting the regular monotony of similar actions, deeds and\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nFormerly he used to look at his blond mustache and wavy hair in the\r\nlittle round mirror left by his predecessor. Now, every evening before\r\nleaving, he would look at his white mustache and bald head in the same\r\nmirror. Forty years had rolled by, long and rapid, dreary as a day of\r\nsadness and as similar as the hours of a sleepless night. Forty years of\r\nwhich nothing remained, not even a memory, not even a misfortune, since\r\nthe death of his parents. Nothing.\r\n\r\nThat day Monsieur Leras stood by the door, dazzled at the brilliancy of\r\nthe setting sun; and instead of returning home he decided to take a\r\nlittle stroll before dinner, a thing which happened to him four or five\r\ntimes a year.\r\n\r\nHe reached the boulevards, where people were streaming along under the\r\ngreen trees. It was a spring evening, one of those first warm and\r\npleasant evenings which fill the heart with the joy of life.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Leras went along with his mincing old man's step; he was going\r\nalong with joy in his heart, at peace with the world. He reached the\r\nChamps-Elysees, and he continued to walk, enlivened by the sight of the\r\nyoung people trotting along.\r\n\r\nThe whole sky was aflame; the Arc de Triomphe stood out against the\r\nbrilliant background of the horizon, like a giant surrounded by fire. As\r\nhe approached the immense monument, the old bookkeeper noticed that he\r\nwas hungry, and he went into a wine dealer's for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe meal was served in front of the store, on the sidewalk. It consisted\r\nof some mutton, salad and asparagus. It was the best dinner that\r\nMonsieur Leras had had in a long time. He washed down his cheese with a\r\nsmall bottle of burgundy, had his after-dinner cup of coffee, a thing\r\nwhich he rarely took, and finally a little pony of brandy.\r\n\r\nWhen he had paid he felt quite youthful, even a little moved. And he\r\nsaid to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine evening! I will continue my stroll as far\r\nas the entrance to the Bois de Boulogne. It will do me good.\xe2\x80\x9d He set\r\nout. An old tune which one of his neighbors used to sing kept returning\r\nto his mind. He kept on humming it over and over again. A hot, still\r\nnight had fallen over Paris. Monsieur Leras walked along the Avenue du\r\nBois de Boulogne and watched the cabs drive by. They kept coming with\r\ntheir shining lights, one behind the other, giving him a glimpse of the\r\ncouples inside, the women in their light dresses and the men dressed in\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nIt was one long procession of lovers, riding under the warm, starlit\r\nsky. They kept on coming in rapid succession. They passed by in the\r\ncarriages, silent, side by side, lost in their dreams, in the emotion of\r\ndesire, in the anticipation of the approaching embrace. The warm shadows\r\nseemed to be full of floating kisses. A sensation of tenderness filled\r\nthe air. All these carriages full of tender couples, all these people\r\nintoxicated with the same idea, with the same thought, seemed to give\r\nout a disturbing, subtle emanation.\r\n\r\nAt last Monsieur Leras grew a little tired of walking, and he sat down\r\non a bench to watch these carriages pass by with their burdens of love.\r\nAlmost immediately a woman walked up to him and sat down beside him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cMadame, you are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slipped her arm through his, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, now; don't be\r\nfoolish. Listen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe arose and walked away, with sadness in his heart. A few yards away\r\nanother woman walked up to him and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWon't you sit down beside\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d He said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you take up this life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood before him and in an altered, hoarse, angry voice exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it isn't for the fun of it, anyhow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe insisted in a gentle voice: \xe2\x80\x9cThen what makes you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe grumbled: \xe2\x80\x9cI've got to live! Foolish question!\xe2\x80\x9d And she walked away,\r\nhumming.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Leras stood there bewildered. Other women were passing near\r\nhim, speaking to him and calling to him. He felt as though he were\r\nenveloped in darkness by something disagreeable.\r\n\r\nHe sat down again on a bench. The carriages were still rolling by. He\r\nthought: \xe2\x80\x9cI should have done better not to come here; I feel all upset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe began to think of all this venal or passionate love, of all these\r\nkisses, sold or given, which were passing by in front of him. Love! He\r\nscarcely knew it. In his lifetime he had only known two or three women,\r\nhis means forcing him to live a quiet life, and he looked back at the\r\nlife which he had led, so different from everybody else, so dreary, so\r\nmournful, so empty.\r\n\r\nSome people are really unfortunate. And suddenly, as though a veil had\r\nbeen torn from his eyes, he perceived the infinite misery, the monotony\r\nof his existence: the past, present and future misery; his last day\r\nsimilar to his first one, with nothing before him, behind him or about\r\nhim, nothing in his heart or any place.\r\n\r\nThe stream of carriages was still going by. In the rapid passage of the\r\nopen carriage he still saw the two silent, loving creatures. It seemed\r\nto him that the whole of humanity was flowing on before him, intoxicated\r\nwith joy, pleasure and happiness. He alone was looking on. To-morrow he\r\nwould again be alone, always alone, more so than any one else. He stood\r\nup, took a few steps, and suddenly he felt as tired as though he had\r\ntaken a long journey on foot, and he sat down on the next bench.\r\n\r\nWhat was he waiting for? What was he hoping for? Nothing. He was\r\nthinking of how pleasant it must be in old age to return home and find\r\nthe little children. It is pleasant to grow old when one is surrounded\r\nby those beings who owe their life to you, who love you, who caress you,\r\nwho tell you charming and foolish little things which warm your heart\r\nand console you for everything.\r\n\r\nAnd, thinking of his empty room, clean and sad, where no one but himself\r\never entered, a feeling of distress filled his soul; and the place\r\nseemed to him more mournful even than his little office. Nobody ever\r\ncame there; no one ever spoke in it. It was dead, silent, without the\r\necho of a human voice. It seems as though walls retain something of the\r\npeople who live within them, something of their manner, face and voice.\r\nThe very houses inhabited by happy families are gayer than the dwellings\r\nof the unhappy. His room was as barren of memories as his life. And the\r\nthought of returning to this place, all alone, of getting into his bed,\r\nof again repeating all the duties and actions of every evening, this\r\nthought terrified him. As though to escape farther from this sinister\r\nhome, and from the time when he would have to return to it, he arose and\r\nwalked along a path to a wooded corner, where he sat down on the grass.\r\n\r\nAbout him, above him, everywhere, he heard a continuous, tremendous,\r\nconfused rumble, composed of countless and different noises, a vague and\r\nthrobbing pulsation of life: the life breath of Paris, breathing like a\r\ngiant.\r\n\r\nThe sun was already high and shed a flood of light on the Bois de\r\nBoulogne. A few carriages were beginning to drive about and people were\r\nappearing on horseback.\r\n\r\nA couple was walking through a deserted alley.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the young woman raised her eyes and saw something brown in the\r\nbranches. Surprised and anxious, she raised her hand, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cLook!\r\nwhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she shrieked and fell into the arms of her companion, who was\r\nforced to lay her on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe policeman who had been called cut down an old man who had hung\r\nhimself with his suspenders.\r\n\r\nExamination showed that he had died the evening before. Papers found on\r\nhim showed that he was a bookkeeper for Messieurs Labuze and Company and\r\nthat his name was Leras.\r\n\r\nHis death was attributed to suicide, the cause of which could not be\r\nsuspected. Perhaps a sudden access of madness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDRE\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock that day, as on every other day, Alexandre rolled the\r\nthree-wheeled chair for cripples up to the door of the little house;\r\nthen, in obedience to the doctor's orders, he would push his old and\r\ninfirm mistress about until six o'clock.\r\n\r\nWhen he had placed the light vehicle against the step, just at the place\r\nwhere the old lady could most easily enter it, he went into the house;\r\nand soon a furious, hoarse old soldier's voice was heard cursing inside\r\nthe house: it issued from the master, the retired ex-captain of\r\ninfantry, Joseph Maramballe.\r\n\r\nThen could be heard the noise of doors being slammed, chairs being\r\npushed about, and hasty footsteps; then nothing more. After a few\r\nseconds, Alexandre reappeared on the threshold, supporting with all his\r\nstrength Madame Maramballe, who was exhausted from the exertion of\r\ndescending the stairs. When she was at last settled in the rolling\r\nchair, Alexandre passed behind it, grasped the handle, and set out\r\ntoward the river.\r\n\r\nThus they crossed the little town every day amid the respectful\r\ngreeting, of all. These bows were perhaps meant as much for the servant\r\nas for the mistress, for if she was loved and esteemed by all, this old\r\ntrooper, with his long, white, patriarchal beard, was considered a model\r\ndomestic.\r\n\r\nThe July sun was beating down unmercifully on the street, bathing the\r\nlow houses in its crude and burning light. Dogs were sleeping on the\r\nsidewalk in the shade of the houses, and Alexandre, a little out of\r\nbreath, hastened his footsteps in order sooner to arrive at the avenue\r\nwhich leads to the water.\r\n\r\nMadame Maramballe was already slumbering under her white parasol, the\r\npoint of which sometimes grazed along the man's impassive face. As soon\r\nas they had reached the Allee des Tilleuls, she awoke in the shade of\r\nthe trees, and she said in a kindly voice: \xe2\x80\x9cGo more slowly, my poor boy;\r\nyou will kill yourself in this heat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlong this path, completely covered by arched linden trees, the Mavettek\r\nflowed in its winding bed bordered by willows.\r\n\r\nThe gurgling of the eddies and the splashing of the little waves against\r\nthe rocks lent to the walk the charming music of babbling water and the\r\nfreshness of damp air. Madame Maramballe inhaled with deep delight the\r\nhumid charm of this spot and then murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! I feel better now! But\r\nhe wasn't in a good humor to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlexandre answered: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor thirty-five years he had been in the service of this couple, first\r\nas officer's orderly, then as simple valet who did not wish to leave his\r\nmasters; and for the last six years, every afternoon, he had been\r\nwheeling his mistress about through the narrow streets of the town. From\r\nthis long and devoted service, and then from this daily tete-a-tete, a\r\nkind of familiarity arose between the old lady and the devoted servant,\r\naffectionate on her part, deferential on his.\r\n\r\nThey talked over the affairs of the house exactly as if they were\r\nequals. Their principal subject of conversation and of worry was the bad\r\ndisposition of the captain, soured by a long career which had begun with\r\npromise, run along without promotion, end ended without glory.\r\n\r\nMadame Maramballe continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly was not in a good humor\r\ntoday. This happens too often since he has left the service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Alexandre, with a sigh, completed his mistress's thoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nmadame might say that it happens every day and that it also happened\r\nbefore leaving the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true. But the poor man has been so unfortunate. He began with a\r\nbrave deed, which obtained for him the Legion of Honor at the age of\r\ntwenty; and then from twenty to fifty he was not able to rise higher\r\nthan captain, whereas at the beginning he expected to retire with at\r\nleast the rank of colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame might also admit that it was his fault. If he had not always\r\nbeen as cutting as a whip, his superiors would have loved and protected\r\nhim better. Harshness is of no use; one should try to please if one\r\nwishes to advance. As far as his treatment of us is concerned, it is\r\nalso our fault, since we are willing to remain with him, but with others\r\nit's different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Maramballe was thinking. Oh, for how many years had she thus been\r\nthinking of the brutality of her husband, whom she had married long ago\r\nbecause he was a handsome officer, decorated quite young, and full of\r\npromise, so they said! What mistakes one makes in life!\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us stop a while, my poor Alexandre, and you rest on\r\nthat bench:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a little worm-eaten bench, placed at a turn in the alley. Every\r\ntime they came in this direction Alexandre was accustomed to making a\r\nshort pause on this seat.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and with a proud and familiar gesture he took his beautiful\r\nwhite beard in his hand, and, closing his, fingers over it, ran them\r\ndown to the point, which he held for a minute at the pit of his stomach,\r\nas if once more to verify the length of this growth.\r\n\r\nMadame Maramballe continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI married him; it is only just and natural\r\nthat I should bear his injustice; but what I do not understand is why\r\nyou also should have supported it, my good Alexandre!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe merely shrugged his shoulders and answered: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I\xe2\x80\x94madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe added: \xe2\x80\x9cReally. I have often wondered. When I married him you were\r\nhis orderly and you could hardly do otherwise than endure him. But why\r\ndid you remain with us, who pay you so little and who treat you so\r\nbadly, when you could have done as every one else does, settle down,\r\nmarry, have a family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, madame! with me it's different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he was silent; but he kept pulling his beard as if he were ringing\r\na bell within him, as if he were trying to pull it out, and he rolled\r\nhis eyes like a man who is greatly embarrassed.\r\n\r\nMadame Maramballe was following her own train of thought: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not a\r\npeasant. You have an education\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe interrupted her proudly: \xe2\x80\x9cI studied surveying, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you stay with us, and blast your prospects?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat's it! that's it! it's the fault of my dispositton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, of your disposition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when I become attached to a person I become attached to him,\r\nthat's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going to try to tell me that\r\nMaramballe's sweet disposition caused you to become attached to him for\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was fidgeting about on his bench visibly embarrassed, and he muttered\r\nbehind his long beard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not he, it was you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady, who had a sweet face, with a snowy line of curly white\r\nhair between her forehead and her bonnet, turned around in her chair and\r\nobserved her servant with a surprised look, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cI, my poor\r\nAlexandre! How so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to look up in the air, then to one side, then toward the\r\ndistance, turning his head as do timid people when forced to admit\r\nshameful secrets. At last he exclaimed, with the courage of a trooper\r\nwho is ordered to the line of fire: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, it's this way\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\ntime I brought a letter to mademoiselle from the lieutenant,\r\nmademoiselle gave me a franc and a smile, and that settled it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot understanding well, she questioned him \xe2\x80\x9cExplain yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he cried out, like a malefactor who is admitting a fatal crime: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhad a sentiment for madame! There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered nothing, stopped looking at him, hung her head, and\r\nthought. She was good, full of justice, gentleness, reason, and\r\ntenderness. In a second she saw the immense devotion of this poor\r\ncreature, who had given up everything in order to live beside her,\r\nwithout saying anything. And she felt as if she could cry. Then, with a\r\nsad but not angry expression, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us return home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose and began to push the wheeled chair.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the village they saw Captain Maramballe coming toward\r\nthem. As soon as he joined them he asked his wife, with a visible desire\r\nof getting angry: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have we for dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome chicken with flageolets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lost his temper: \xe2\x80\x9cChicken! chicken! always chicken! By all that's\r\nholy, I've had enough chicken! Have you no ideas in your head, that you\r\nmake me eat chicken every day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered, in a resigned tone: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, you know that the\r\ndoctor has ordered it for you. It's the best thing for your stomach. If\r\nyour stomach were well, I could give you many things which I do not dare\r\nset before you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, exasperated, he planted himself in front of Alexandre, exclaiming:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if my stomach is out of order it's the fault of that brute. For\r\nthirty-five years he has been poisoning me with his abominable cooking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Maramballe suddenly turned about completely, in order to see the\r\nold domestic. Their eyes met, and in this single glance they both said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOG\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was small, full of heavy draperies and discreetly\r\nfragrant. A large fire burned in the grate and a solitary lamp at one\r\nend of the mantelpiece threw a soft light on the two persons who were\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\nShe, the mistress of the house, was an old lady with white hair, but one\r\nof those old ladies whose unwrinkled skin is as smooth as the finest\r\npaper, and scented, impregnated with perfume, with the delicate essences\r\nwhich she had used in her bath for so many years.\r\n\r\nHe was a very old friend, who had never married, a constant friend, a\r\ncompanion in the journey of life, but nothing more.\r\n\r\nThey had not spoken for about a minute, and were both looking at the\r\nfire, dreaming of no matter what, in one of those moments of friendly\r\nsilence between people who have no need to be constantly talking in\r\norder to be happy together, when suddenly a large log, a stump covered\r\nwith burning roots, fell out. It fell over the firedogs into the\r\ndrawing-room and rolled on to the carpet, scattering great sparks around\r\nit. The old lady, with a little scream, sprang to her feet to run away,\r\nwhile he kicked the log back on to the hearth and stamped out all the\r\nburning sparks with his boots.\r\n\r\nWhen the disaster was remedied, there was a strong smell of burning,\r\nand, sitting down opposite to his friend, the man looked at her with a\r\nsmile and said, as he pointed to the log:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the reason why I never married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in astonishment, with the inquisitive gaze of women\r\nwho wish to know everything, that eye which women have who are no longer\r\nvery young,\xe2\x80\x94in which a complex, and often roguish, curiosity is\r\nreflected, and she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is a long story,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9ca rather sad and unpleasant\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy old friends were often surprised at the coldness which suddenly\r\nsprang up between one of my best friends whose Christian name was\r\nJulien, and myself. They could not understand how two such intimate and\r\ninseparable friends, as we had been, could suddenly become almost\r\nstrangers to one another, and I will tell you the reason of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and I used to live together at one time. We were never apart, and\r\nthe friendship that united us seemed so strong that nothing could break\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening when he came home, he told me that he was going to get\r\nmarried, and it gave me a shock as if he had robbed me or betrayed me.\r\nWhen a man's friend marries, it is all over between them. The jealous\r\naffection of a woman, that suspicious, uneasy and carnal affection, will\r\nnot tolerate the sturdy and frank attachment, that attachment of the\r\nmind, of the heart, and that mutual confidence which exists between two\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, however great the love may be that unites them a man and a\r\nwoman are always strangers in mind and intellect; they remain\r\nbelligerents, they belong to different races. There must always be a\r\nconqueror and a conquered, a master and a slave; now the one, now the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94they are never two equals. They press each other's hands, those\r\nhands trembling with amorous passion; but they never press them with a\r\nlong, strong, loyal pressure, with that pressure which seems to open\r\nhearts and to lay them bare in a burst of sincere, strong, manly\r\naffection. Philosophers of old, instead of marrying, and procreating as\r\na consolation for their old age children, who would abandon them, sought\r\nfor a good, reliable friend, and grew old with him in that communion of\r\nthought which can only exist between men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friend Julien married. His wife was pretty, charming, a\r\nlittle, curly-haired blonde, plump and lively, who seemed to worship\r\nhim. At first I went but rarely to their house, feeling myself de trop.\r\nBut, somehow, they attracted me to their home; they were constantly\r\ninviting me, and seemed very fond of me. Consequently, by degrees, I\r\nallowed myself to be allured by the charm of their life. I often dined\r\nwith them, and frequently, when I returned home at night, thought that I\r\nwould do as he had done, and get married, as my empty house now seemed\r\nvery dull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey appeared to be very much in love, and were never apart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one evening Julien wrote and asked me to go to dinner, and I\r\nnaturally went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My dear fellow,' he said, 'I must go out directly afterward on\r\nbusiness, and I shall not be back until eleven o'clock; but I shall be\r\nback at eleven precisely, and I reckon on you to keep Bertha company.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young woman smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It was my idea,' she said, 'to send for you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI held out my hand to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are as nice as ever, I said, and I felt a long, friendly pressure\r\nof my fingers, but I paid no attention to it; so we sat down to dinner,\r\nand at eight o'clock Julien went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as he had gone, a kind of strange embarrassment immediately\r\nseemed to arise between his wife and me. We had never been alone\r\ntogether yet, and in spite of our daily increasing intimacy, this tete-\r\na-tete placed us in a new position. At first I spoke vaguely of those\r\nindifferent matters with which one fills up an embarrassing silence, but\r\nshe did not reply, and remained opposite to me with her head down in an\r\nundecided manner, as if she were thinking over some difficult subject,\r\nand as I was at a loss for small talk, I held my tongue. It is\r\nsurprising how hard it is at times to find anything to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then also I felt something in the air, something I could not\r\nexpress, one of those mysterious premonitions that warn one of another\r\nperson's secret intentions in regard to yourself, whether they be good\r\nor evil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat painful silence lasted some time, and then Bertha said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Will you kindly put a log on the fire for it is going out.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I opened the box where the wood was kept, which was placed just\r\nwhere yours is, took out the largest log and put it on top of the\r\nothers, which were three parts burned, and then silence again reigned in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a few minutes the log was burning so brightly that it scorched our\r\nfaces, and the young woman raised her eyes to mine\xe2\x80\x94eyes that had a\r\nstrange look to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is too hot now,' she said; 'let us go and sit on the sofa over\r\nthere.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we went and sat on the sofa, and then she said suddenly, looking me\r\nfull in the face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What would you do if a woman were to tell you that she was in love\r\nwith you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Upon my word,' I replied, very much at a loss for an answer, 'I cannot\r\nforesee such a case; but it would depend very much upon the woman.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gave a hard, nervous, vibrating laugh; one of those false laughs\r\nwhich seem as if they must break thin glass, and then she added: 'Men\r\nare never either venturesome or spiteful.' And, after a moment's\r\nsilence, she continued: 'Have you ever been in love, Monsieur Paul?' I\r\nwas obliged to acknowledge that I certainly had, and she asked me to\r\ntell her all about it. Whereupon I made up some story or other. She\r\nlistened to me attentively, with frequent signs of disapproval and\r\ncontempt, and then suddenly she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, you understand nothing about the subject. It seems to me that real\r\nlove must unsettle the mind, upset the nerves and distract the head;\r\nthat it must\xe2\x80\x94how shall I express it?\xe2\x80\x94be dangerous, even terrible, almost\r\ncriminal and sacrilegious; that it must be a kind of treason; I mean to\r\nsay that it is bound to break laws, fraternal bonds, sacred obligations;\r\nwhen love is tranquil, easy, lawful and without dangers, is it really\r\nlove?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know what answer to give her, and I made this philosophical\r\nreflection to myself: 'Oh! female brain, here; indeed, you show\r\nyourself!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile speaking, she had assumed a demure saintly air; and, resting on\r\nthe cushions, she stretched herself out at full length, with her head on\r\nmy shoulder, and her dress pulled up a little so as to show her red\r\nstockings, which the firelight made look still brighter. In a minute or\r\ntwo she continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I suppose I have frightened you?' I protested against such a notion,\r\nand she leaned against my breast altogether, and without looking at me,\r\nshe said: 'If I were to tell you that I love you, what would you do?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd before I could think of an answer, she had thrown her arms around\r\nmy neck, had quickly drawn my head down, and put her lips to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! My dear friend, I can tell you that I did not feel at all happy!\r\nWhat! deceive Julien? become the lover of this little, silly, wrong-\r\nheaded, deceitful woman, who was, no doubt, terribly sensual, and whom\r\nher husband no longer satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo betray him continually, to deceive him, to play at being in love\r\nmerely because I was attracted by forbidden fruit, by the danger\r\nincurred and the friendship betrayed! No, that did not suit me, but what\r\nwas I to do? To imitate Joseph would be acting a very stupid and,\r\nmoreover, difficult part, for this woman was enchanting in her perfidy,\r\ninflamed by audacity, palpitating and excited. Let the man who has never\r\nfelt on his lips the warm kiss of a woman who is ready to give herself\r\nto him throw the first stone at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a minute more\xe2\x80\x94you understand what I mean? A minute more, and\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshould have been\xe2\x80\x94no, she would have been!\xe2\x80\x94I beg your pardon, he would\r\nhave been\xe2\x80\x94when a loud noise made us both jump up. The log had fallen\r\ninto the room, knocking over the fire irons and the fender, and on to\r\nthe carpet, which it had scorched, and had rolled under an armchair,\r\nwhich it would certainly set alight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI jumped up like a madman, and, as I was replacing on the fire that log\r\nwhich had saved me, the door opened hastily, and Julien came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am free,' he said, with evident pleasure. 'The business was over two\r\nhours sooner than I expected!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear friend, without that log, I should have been caught in the\r\nvery act, and you know what the consequences would have been!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure that I took good care never to be found in a similar\r\nsituation again, never, never. Soon afterward I saw that Julien was\r\ngiving me the 'cold shoulder,' as they say. His wife was evidently\r\nundermining our friendship. By degrees he got rid of me, and we have\r\naltogether ceased to meet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never married, which ought not to surprise you, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULIE ROMAIN\r\n\r\nTwo years ago this spring I was making a walking tour along the shore of\r\nthe Mediterranean. Is there anything more pleasant than to meditate\r\nwhile walking at a good pace along a highway? One walks in the sunlight,\r\nthrough the caressing breeze, at the foot of the mountains, along the\r\ncoast of the sea. And one dreams! What a flood of illusions, loves,\r\nadventures pass through a pedestrian's mind during a two hours' march!\r\nWhat a crowd of confused and joyous hopes enter into you with the mild,\r\nlight air! You drink them in with the breeze, and they awaken in your\r\nheart a longing for happiness which increases with the hun ger induced\r\nby walking. The fleeting, charming ideas fly and sing like birds.\r\n\r\nI was following that long road which goes from Saint Raphael to Italy,\r\nor, rather, that long, splendid panoramic highway which seems made for\r\nthe representation of all the love-poems of earth. And I thought that\r\nfrom Cannes, where one poses, to Monaco, where one gambles, people come\r\nto this spot of the earth for hardly any other purpose than to get\r\nembroiled or to throw away money on chance games, displaying under this\r\ndelicious sky and in this garden of roses and oranges all base vanities\r\nand foolish pretensions and vile lusts, showing up the human mind such\r\nas it is, servile, ignorant, arrogant and full of cupidity.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I saw some villas in one of those ravishing bays that one meets\r\nat every turn of the mountain; there were only four or five fronting the\r\nsea at the foot of the mountains, and behind them a wild fir wood slopes\r\ninto two great valleys, that were untraversed by roads. I stopped short\r\nbefore one of these chalets, it was so pretty: a small white house with\r\nbrown trimmings, overrun with rambler roses up to the top.\r\n\r\nThe garden was a mass of flowers, of all colors and all kinds, mixed in\r\na coquettish, well-planned disorder. The lawn was full of them, big pots\r\nflanked each side of every step of the porch, pink or yellow clusters\r\nframed each window, and the terrace with the stone balustrade, which\r\nenclosed this pretty little dwelling, had a garland of enormous red\r\nbells, like drops of blood. Behind the house I saw a long avenue of\r\norange trees in blossom, which went up to the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\nOver the door appeared the name, \xe2\x80\x9cVilla d'Antan,\xe2\x80\x9d in small gold letters.\r\n\r\nI asked myself what poet or what fairy was living there, what inspired,\r\nsolitary being had discovered this spot and created this dream house,\r\nwhich seemed to nestle in a nosegay.\r\n\r\nA workman was breaking stones up the street, and I went to him to ask\r\nthe name of the proprietor of this jewel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Madame Julie Romain,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nJulie Romain! In my childhood, long ago, I had heard them speak of this\r\ngreat actress, the rival of Rachel.\r\n\r\nNo woman ever was more applauded and more loved\xe2\x80\x94especially more loved!\r\nWhat duets and suicides on her account and what sensational adventures!\r\nHow old was this seductive woman now? Sixty, seventy, seventy-five!\r\nJulie Romain here, in this house! The woman who had been adored by the\r\ngreatest musician and the most exquisite poet of our land! I still\r\nremember the sensation (I was then twelve years of age) which her flight\r\nto Sicily with the latter, after her rupture with the former, caused\r\nthroughout France.\r\n\r\nShe had left one evening, after a premiere, where the audience had\r\napplauded her for a whole half hour, and had recalled her eleven times\r\nin succession. She had gone away with the poet, in a post-chaise, as was\r\nthe fashion then; they had crossed the sea, to love each other in that\r\nantique island, the daughter of Greece, in that immense orange wood\r\nwhich surrounds Palermo, and which is called the \xe2\x80\x9cShell of Gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeople told of their ascension of Mount Etna and how they had leaned\r\nover the immense crater, arm in arm, cheek to cheek, as if to throw\r\nthemselves into the very abyss.\r\n\r\nNow he was dead, that maker of verses so touching and so profound that\r\nthey turned, the heads of a whole generation, so subtle and so\r\nmysterious that they opened a new world to the younger poets.\r\n\r\nThe other one also was dead\xe2\x80\x94the deserted one, who had attained through\r\nher musical periods that are alive in the memories of all, periods of\r\ntriumph and of despair, intoxicating triumph and heartrending despair.\r\n\r\nAnd she was there, in that house veiled by flowers.\r\n\r\nI did not hesitate, but rang the bell.\r\n\r\nA small servant answered, a boy of eighteen with awkward mien and clumsy\r\nhands. I wrote in pencil on my card a gallant compliment to the actress,\r\nbegging her to receive me. Perhaps, if she knew my name, she would open\r\nher door to me.\r\n\r\nThe little valet took it in, and then came back, asking me to follow\r\nhim. He led me to a neat and decorous salon, furnished in the Louis-\r\nPhilippe style, with stiff and heavy furniture, from which a little maid\r\nof sixteen, slender but not pretty, took off the covers in my honor.\r\n\r\nThen I was left alone.\r\n\r\nOn the walls hung three portraits, that of the actress in one of her\r\nroles, that of the poet in his close-fitting greatcoat and the ruffled\r\nshirt then in style, and that of the musician seated at a piano.\r\n\r\nShe, blond, charming, but affected, according to the fashion of her day,\r\nwas smiling, with her pretty mouth and blue eyes; the painting was\r\ncareful, fine, elegant, but lifeless.\r\n\r\nThose faces seemed to be already looking upon posterity.\r\n\r\nThe whole place had the air of a bygone time, of days that were done and\r\nmen who had vanished.\r\n\r\nA door opened and a little woman entered, old, very old, very small,\r\nwith white hair and white eyebrows, a veritable white mouse, and as\r\nquick and furtive of movement.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand to me, saying in a voice still fresh, sonorous and\r\nvibrant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, monsieur. How kind it is of the men of to-day to remember\r\nthe women of yesterday! Sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told her that her house had attracted me, that I had inquired for the\r\nproprietor's name, and that, on learning it, I could not resist the\r\ndesire to ring her bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis gives me all the more pleasure, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cas it is\r\nthe first time that such a thing has happened. When I received your\r\ncard, with the gracious note, I trembled as if an old friend who had\r\ndisappeared for twenty years had been announced to me. I am like a dead\r\nbody, whom no one remembers, of whom no one will think until the day\r\nwhen I shall actually die; then the newspapers will mention Julie Romain\r\nfor three days, relating anecdotes and details of my life, reviving\r\nmemories, and praising me greatly. Then all will be over with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments of silence, she continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this will not be so very long now. In a few months, in a few days,\r\nnothing will remain but a little skeleton of this little woman who is\r\nnow alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes toward her portrait, which smiled down upon this\r\ncaricature of herself; then she looked at those of the two men, the\r\ndisdainful poet and the inspired musician, who seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does\r\nthis ruin want of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn indefinable, poignant, irresistible sadness overwhelmed my heart, the\r\nsadness of existences that have had their day, but who are still\r\ndebating with their memories, like a person drowning in deep water.\r\n\r\nFrom my seat I could see on the highroad the handsome carriages that\r\nwere whirling from Nice to Monaco; inside them I saw young, pretty, rich\r\nand happy women and smiling, satisfied men. Following my eye, she\r\nunderstood my thought and murmured with a smile of resignation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne cannot both be and have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful life must have been for you!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nShe heaved a great sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful and sweet! And for that reason I regret it so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw that she was disposed to talk of herself, so I began to question\r\nher, gently and discreetly, as one might touch bruised flesh.\r\n\r\nShe spoke of her successes, her intoxications and her friends, of her\r\nwhole triumphant existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it on the stage that you found your most intense joys, your true\r\nhappiness?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied quickly.\r\n\r\nI smiled; then, raising her eyes to the two portraits, she said, with a\r\nsad glance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one?\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help asking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth. I even confuse them up a little now in my old woman's memory, and\r\nthen I feel remorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, madame, your acknowledgment is not to them, but to Love itself.\r\nThey were merely its interpreters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is possible. But what interpreters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that you have not been, or that you might not have been,\r\nloved as well or better by a simple man, but not a great man, who would\r\nhave offered to you his whole life and heart, all his thoughts, all his\r\ndays, his whole being, while these gave you two redoubtable rivals,\r\nMusic and Poetry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed emphatically, with that still youthful\r\nvoice, which caused the soul to vibrate. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother one might perhaps have\r\nloved me more, but he would not have loved me as these did. Ah! those\r\ntwo sang to me of the music of love as no one else in the world could\r\nhave sung of it. How they intoxicated me! Could any other man express\r\nwhat they knew so well how to express in tones and in words? Is it\r\nenough merely to love if one cannot put all the poetry and all the music\r\nof heaven and earth into love? And they knew how to make a woman\r\ndelirious with songs and with words. Yes, perhaps there was more of\r\nillusion than of reality in our passion; but these illusions lift you\r\ninto the clouds, while realities always leave you trailing in the dust.\r\nIf others have loved me more, through these two I have understood, felt\r\nand worshipped love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she began to weep.\r\n\r\nShe wept silently, shedding tears of despair.\r\n\r\nI pretended not to see, looking off into the distance. She resumed,\r\nafter a few minutes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, monsieur, with nearly every one the heart ages with the body.\r\nBut this has not happened with me. My body is sixty-nine years old,\r\nwhile my poor heart is only twenty. And that is the reason why I live\r\nall alone, with my flowers and my dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence between us. She grew calmer and continued,\r\nsmiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you would laugh at me, if you knew, if you knew how I pass my\r\nevenings, when the weather is fine. I am ashamed and I pity myself at\r\nthe same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeg as I might, she would not tell me what she did. Then I rose to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd as I said that I wished to dine at Monte Carlo, she asked timidly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not dine with me? It would give me a great deal of pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI accepted at once. She rang, delighted, and after giving some orders to\r\nthe little maid she took me over her house.\r\n\r\nA kind of glass-enclosed veranda, filled with shrubs, opened into the\r\ndining-room, revealing at the farther end the long avenue of orange\r\ntrees extending to the foot of the mountain. A low seat, hidden by\r\nplants, indicated that the old actress often came there to sit down.\r\n\r\nThen we went into the garden, to look at the flowers. Evening fell\r\nsoftly, one of those calm, moist evenings when the earth breathes forth\r\nall her perfumes. Daylight was almost gone when we sat down at table.\r\nThe dinner was good and it lasted a long time, and we became intimate\r\nfriends, she and I, when she understood what a profound sympathy she had\r\naroused in my heart. She had taken two thimblefuls of wine, as the\r\nphrase goes, and had grown more confiding and expansive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let us look at the moon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI adore the good moon. She\r\nhas been the witness of my most intense joys. It seems to me that all my\r\nmemories are there, and that I need only look at her to bring them all\r\nback to me. And even\xe2\x80\x94some times\xe2\x80\x94in the evening\xe2\x80\x94I offer to myself a\r\npretty play\xe2\x80\x94yes, pretty\xe2\x80\x94if you only knew! But no, you would laugh at me.\r\nI cannot\xe2\x80\x94I dare not\xe2\x80\x94no, no\xe2\x80\x94really\xe2\x80\x94no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI implored her to tell me what it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now! come, tell me; I promise you that I will not laugh. I swear\r\nit to you\xe2\x80\x94come, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. I took her hands\xe2\x80\x94those poor little hands, so thin and so\r\ncold!\xe2\x80\x94and I kissed them one after the other, several times, as her\r\nlovers had once kissed them. She was moved and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promise me not to laugh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I swear it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and as the little domestic, awkward in his green livery,\r\nremoved the chair behind her, she whispered quickly a few words into his\r\near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame, at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nShe took my arm and led me to the veranda.\r\n\r\nThe avenue of oranges was really splendid to see. The full moon made a\r\nnarrow path of silver, a long bright line, which fell on the yellow\r\nsand, between the round, opaque crowns of the dark trees.\r\n\r\nAs these trees were in bloom, their strong, sweet perfume filled the\r\nnight, and swarming among their dark foliage I saw thousands of\r\nfireflies, which looked like seeds fallen from the stars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a setting for a love scene!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not true? Is it not true? You will see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she made me sit down beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what makes one long for more life. But you hardly think of\r\nthese things, you men of to-day. You are speculators, merchants and men\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou no longer even know how to talk to us. When I say 'you,' I mean\r\nyoung men in general. Love has been turned into a liaison which very\r\noften begins with an unpaid dressmaker's bill. If you think the bill is\r\ndearer than the woman, you disappear; but if you hold the woman more\r\nhighly, you pay it. Nice morals\xe2\x80\x94and a nice kind of love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked, astonished and delighted. Down there at the end of the avenue,\r\nin the moonlight, were two young people, with their arms around each\r\nother's waist. They were walking along, interlaced, charming, with\r\nshort, little steps, crossing the flakes of light; which illuminated\r\nthem momentarily, and then sinking back into the shadow. The youth was\r\ndressed in a suit of white satin, such as men wore in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and had on a hat with an ostrich plume. The girl was arrayed in\r\na gown with panniers, and the high, powdered coiffure of the handsome\r\ndames of the time of the Regency.\r\n\r\nThey stopped a hundred paces from us, and standing in the middle of the\r\navenue, they kissed each other with graceful gestures.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I recognized the two little servants. Then one of those\r\ndreadful fits of laughter that convulse you made me writhe in my chair.\r\nBut I did not laugh aloud. I resisted, convulsed and feeling almost ill,\r\nas a man whose leg is cut off resists the impulse to cry out.\r\n\r\nAs the young pair turned toward the farther end of the avenue they again\r\nbecame delightful. They went farther and farther away, finally\r\ndisappearing as a dream disappears. I no longer saw them. The avenue\r\nseemed a sad place.\r\n\r\nI took my leave at once, so as not to see them again, for I guessed that\r\nthis little play would last a long time, awakening, as it did, a whole\r\npast of love and of stage scenery; the artificial past, deceitful and\r\nseductive, false but charming, which still stirred the heart of this\r\namorous old comedienne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RONDOLI SISTERS I\r\n\r\nI set out to see Italy thoroughly on two occasions, and each time I was\r\nstopped at the frontier and could not get any further. So I do not know\r\nItaly, said my friend, Charles Jouvent. And yet my two attempts gave me\r\na charming idea of the manners of that beautiful country. Some time,\r\nhowever, I must visit its cities, as well as the museums and works of\r\nart with which it abounds. I will make another attempt to penetrate into\r\nthe interior, which I have not yet succeeded in doing.\r\n\r\nYou don't understand me, so I will explain: In the spring of 1874 I was\r\nseized with an irresistible desire to see Venice, Florence, Rome and\r\nNaples. I am, as you know, not a great traveller; it appears to me a\r\nuseless and fatiguing business. Nights spent in a train, the disturbed\r\nslumbers of the railway carriage, with the attendant headache, and\r\nstiffness in every limb, the sudden waking in that rolling box, the\r\nunwashed feeling, with your eyes and hair full of dust, the smell of the\r\ncoal on which one's lungs feed, those bad dinners in the draughty\r\nrefreshment rooms are, according to my ideas, a horrible way of\r\nbeginning a pleasure trip.\r\n\r\nAfter this introduction, we have the miseries of the hotel; of some\r\ngreat hotel full of people, and yet so empty; the strange room and the\r\ndoubtful bed!\r\n\r\nI am most particular about my bed; it is the sanctuary of life. We\r\nentrust our almost naked and fatigued bodies to it so that they may be\r\nreanimated by reposing between soft sheets and feathers.\r\n\r\nThere we find the most delightful hours of our existence, the hours of\r\nlove and of sleep. The bed is sacred, and should be respected, venerated\r\nand loved by us as the best and most delightful of our earthly\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nI cannot lift up the sheets of a hotel bed without a shudder of disgust.\r\nWho has occupied it the night before? Perhaps dirty, revolting people\r\nhave slept in it. I begin, then, to think of all the horrible people\r\nwith whom one rubs shoulders every day, people with suspicious-looking\r\nskin which makes one think of the feet and all the rest! I call to mind\r\nthose who carry about with them the sickening smell of garlic or of\r\nhumanity. I think of those who are deformed and unhealthy, of the\r\nperspiration emanating from the sick, of everything that is ugly and\r\nfilthy in man.\r\n\r\nAnd all this, perhaps, in the bed in which I am about to sleep! The mere\r\nidea of it makes me feel ill as I get into it.\r\n\r\nAnd then the hotel dinners\xe2\x80\x94those dreary table d'hote dinners in the\r\nmidst of all sorts of extraordinary people, or else those terrible\r\nsolitary dinners at a small table in a restaurant, feebly lighted by a\r\nwretched composite candle under a shade.\r\n\r\nAgain, those terribly dull evenings in some unknown town! Do you know\r\nanything more wretched than the approach of dusk on such an occasion?\r\nOne goes about as if almost in a dream, looking at faces that one never\r\nhas seen before and never will see again; listening to people talking\r\nabout matters which are quite indifferent to you in a language that\r\nperhaps you do not understand. You have a terrible feeling, almost as if\r\nyou were lost, and you continue to walk on so as not to be obliged to\r\nreturn to the hotel, where you would feel more lost still because you\r\nare at home, in a home which belongs to anyone who can pay for it; and\r\nat last you sink into a chair of some well-lighted cafe, whose gilding\r\nand lights oppress you a thousand times more than the shadows in the\r\nstreets. Then you feel so abominably lonely sitting in front of the\r\nglass of flat bock beer that a kind of madness seizes you, the longing\r\nto go somewhere or other, no matter where, as long as you need not\r\nremain in front of that marble table amid those dazzling lights.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, you are aware that you are really alone in the\r\nworld, always and everywhere, and that in places which we know, the\r\nfamiliar jostlings give us the illusion only of human fraternity. At\r\nsuch moments of self-abandonment and sombre isolation in distant cities\r\none thinks broadly, clearly and profoundly. Then one suddenly sees the\r\nwhole of life outside the vision of eternal hope, apart from the\r\ndeceptions of our innate habits, and of our expectations of happiness,\r\nwhich we indulge in dreams never to be realized.\r\n\r\nIt is only by going a long distance from home that we can fully\r\nunderstand how short-lived and empty everything near at hand is; by\r\nsearching for the unknown, we perceive how commonplace and evanescent\r\neverything is; only by wandering over the face of the earth can we\r\nunderstand how small the world is, and how very much alike it is\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nHow well I know, and how I hate and almost fear, those haphazard walks\r\nthrough unknown streets; and this was the reason why, as nothing would\r\ninduce me to undertake a tour in Italy by myself, I made up my mind to\r\naccompany my friend Paul Pavilly.\r\n\r\nYou know Paul, and how he idealizes women. To him the earth is habitable\r\nonly because they are there; the sun gives light and is warm because it\r\nshines upon them; the air is soft and balmy because it blows upon their\r\nskin and ruffles the soft hair on their temples; and the moon is\r\ncharming because it makes them dream and imparts a languorous charm to\r\nlove. Every act and action of Paul's has woman for its motive; all his\r\nthoughts, all his efforts and hopes are centered in them.\r\n\r\nWhen I mentioned Italy to Paul he at first absolutely refused to leave\r\nParis. I, however, began to tell him of the adventures I had on my\r\ntravels. I assured him that all Italian women are charming, and I made\r\nhim hope for the most refined pleasures at Naples, thanks to certain\r\nletters of introduction which I had; and so at last he allowed himself\r\nto be persuaded.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe took the express one Thursday evening, Paul and I. Hardly anyone goes\r\nsouth at that time of the year, so that we had the carriages to\r\nourselves, and both of us were in a bad temper on leaving Paris, sorry\r\nfor having yielded to the temptation of this journey, and regretting\r\nMarly, the Seine, and our lazy boating excursions, and all those\r\npleasures in and near Paris which are so dear to every true Parisian.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the train started Paul stuck himself in his corner, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is most idiotic to go all that distance,\xe2\x80\x9d and as it was too late for\r\nhim to change his mind then, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you should not have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, and I felt very much inclined to laugh when I saw how\r\nfurious he looked. He is certainly always rather like a squirrel, but\r\nthen every one of us has retained the type of some animal or other as\r\nthe mark of his primitive origin. How many people have jaws like a\r\nbulldog, or heads like goats, rabbits, foxes, horses, or oxen. Paul is a\r\nsquirrel turned into a man. He has its bright, quick eyes, its hair, its\r\npointed nose, its small, fine, supple, active body, and a certain\r\nmysterious resemblance in his general bearing; in fact, a similarity of\r\nmovement, of gesture, and of bearing which might almost be taken for a\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nAt last we both went to sleep with that uncomfortable slumber of the\r\nrailway carriage, which is interrupted by horrible cramps in the arms\r\nand neck, and by the sudden stoppages of the train.\r\n\r\nWe woke up as we were passing along the Rhone. Soon the continued noise\r\nof crickets came in through the windows, that cry which seems to be the\r\nvoice of the warm earth, the song of Provence; and seemed to instill\r\ninto our looks, our breasts, and our souls the light and happy feeling\r\nof the south, that odor of the parched earth, of the stony and light\r\nsoil of the olive with its gray-green foliage.\r\n\r\nWhen the train stopped again a railway guard ran along the train calling\r\nout \xe2\x80\x9cValence\xe2\x80\x9d in a sonorous voice, with an accent that again gave us a\r\ntaste of that Provence which the shrill note of the crickets had already\r\nimparted to us.\r\n\r\nNothing fresh happened till we got to Marseilles, where we alighted for\r\nbreakfast, but when we returned to our carriage we found a woman\r\ninstalled there.\r\n\r\nPaul, with a delighted glance at me, gave his short mustache a\r\nmechanical twirl, and passed his fingers through his, hair, which had\r\nbecome slightly out of order with the night's journey. Then he sat down\r\nopposite the newcomer.\r\n\r\nWhenever I happen to see a striking new face, either in travelling or in\r\nsociety, I always have the strongest inclination to find out what\r\ncharacter, mind, and intellectual capacities are hidden beneath those\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nShe was a young and pretty woman, certainly a native of the south of\r\nFrance, with splendid eyes, beautiful wavy black hair, which was so\r\nthick and long that it seemed almost too heavy for her head. She was\r\ndressed with a certain southern bad taste which made her look a little\r\nvulgar. Her regular features had none of the grace and finish of the\r\nrefined races, of that slight delicacy which members of the aristocracy\r\ninherit from their birth, and which is the hereditary mark of thinner\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHer bracelets were too big to be of gold; she wore earrings with large\r\nwhite stones that were certainly not diamonds, and she belonged\r\nunmistakably to the People. One surmised that she would talk too loud,\r\nand shout on every occasion with exaggerated gestures.\r\n\r\nWhen the train started she remained motionless in her place, in the\r\nattitude of a woman who was indignant, without even looking at us.\r\n\r\nPaul began to talk to me, evidently with an eye to effect, trying to\r\nattract her attention, as shopkeepers expose their choice wares to catch\r\nthe notice of passersby.\r\n\r\nShe, however, did not appear to be paying the least attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToulon! Ten minutes to wait! Refreshment room!\xe2\x80\x9d the porters shouted.\r\n\r\nPaul motioned to me to get out, and as soon as we had done so, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who on earth she can be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I don't know, and I don't in the least\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was quite excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is an uncommonly fresh and pretty girl. What eyes she has, and how\r\ncross she looks. She must have been dreadfully worried, for she takes no\r\nnotice of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have all your trouble for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d I growled.\r\n\r\nHe began to lose his temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not taking any trouble, my dear fellow. I think her an extremely\r\npretty woman, that is all. If one could only speak to her! But I don't\r\nknow how to begin. Cannot you give me an idea? Can't you guess who she\r\nis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, I cannot. However, I should rather think she is some\r\nstrolling actress who is going to rejoin her company after a love\r\nadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed quite upset, as if I had said something insulting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think that? On the contrary, I think she looks most\r\nrespectable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at her bracelets,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cher earrings and her whole dress.\r\nI should not be the least surprised if she were a dancer or a circus\r\nrider, but most likely a dancer. Her whole style smacks very much of the\r\ntheatre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe evidently did not like the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is much too young, I am sure; why, she is hardly twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are many things which one can do before one is\r\ntwenty; dancing and elocution are among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your seats for Nice, Vintimiglia,\xe2\x80\x9d the guards and porters called.\r\n\r\nWe got in; our fellow passenger was eating an orange, and certainly she\r\ndid not do it elegantly. She had spread her pocket-handkerchief on her\r\nknees, and the way in which she tore off the peel and opened her mouth\r\nto put in the pieces, and then spat the pips out of the window, showed\r\nthat her training had been decidedly vulgar.\r\n\r\nShe seemed, also, more put out than ever, and swallowed the fruit with\r\nan exceedingly comic air of rage.\r\n\r\nPaul devoured her with his eyes, and tried to attract her attention and\r\nexcite her curiosity; but in spite of his talk, and of the manner in\r\nwhich he brought in well-known names, she did not pay the least\r\nattention to him.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Frejus and St. Raphael, the train passed through a\r\nveritable garden, a paradise of roses, and groves of oranges and lemons\r\ncovered with fruits and flowers at the same time. That delightful coast\r\nfrom Marseilles to Genoa is a kingdom of perfumes in a home of flowers.\r\n\r\nJune is the time to see it in all its beauty, when in every narrow\r\nvalley and on every slope, the most exquisite flowers are growing\r\nluxuriantly. And the roses! fields, hedges, groves of roses. They climb\r\nup the walls, blossom on the roofs, hang from the trees, peep out from\r\namong the bushes; they are white, red, yellow, large and small, single,\r\nwith a simple self-colored dress, or full and heavy in brilliant\r\ntoilettes.\r\n\r\nTheir breath makes the air heavy and relaxing, and the still more\r\npenetrating odor of the orange blossoms sweetens the atmosphere till it\r\nmight almost be called the refinement of odor.\r\n\r\nThe shore, with its brown rocks, was bathed by the motionless\r\nMediterranean. The hot summer sun stretched like a fiery cloth over the\r\nmountains, over the long expanses of sand, and over the motionless,\r\napparently solid blue sea. The train went on through the tunnels, along\r\nthe slopes, above the water, on straight, wall-like viaducts, and a\r\nsoft, vague, saltish smell, a smell of drying seaweed, mingled at times\r\nwith the strong, heavy perfume of the flowers.\r\n\r\nBut Paul neither saw, looked at, nor smelled anything, for our fellow\r\ntraveller engrossed all his attention.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Cannes, as he wished to speak to me he signed to me to\r\nget out, and as soon as I did so, he took me by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, she is really charming. Just look at her eyes; and I never\r\nsaw anything like her hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't excite yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cor else address her, if you have\r\nany intentions that way. She does not look unapproachable; I fancy,\r\nalthough she appear to be a little bit grumpy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't you speak to her?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know what to say, for I am always terribly stupid at first; I\r\ncan never make advances to a woman in the street. I follow them, go\r\nround and round them, and quite close to them, but never know what to\r\nsay at first. I only once tried to enter into conversation with a woman\r\nin that way. As I clearly saw that she was waiting for me to make\r\novertures, and as I felt bound to say something, I stammered out, 'I\r\nhope you are quite well, madame?' She laughed in my face, and I made my\r\nescape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI promised Paul to do all I could to bring about a conversation, and\r\nwhen we had taken our places again, I politely asked our neighbor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any objection to the smell of tobacco, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe merely replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNon capisco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she was an Italian! I felt an absurd inclination to laugh. As Paul\r\ndid not understand a word of that language, I was obliged to act as his\r\ninterpreter, so I said in Italian:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked you, madame, whether you had any objection to tobacco smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith an angry look she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cChe mi fa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had neither turned her head nor looked at me, and I really did not\r\nknow whether to take this \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care\xe2\x80\x9d for an authorization, a\r\nrefusal, a real sign of indifference, or for a mere \xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cif you mind the smell of tobacco in the least\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe again said, \xe2\x80\x9cMica,\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone which seemed to mean, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to\r\ngoodness you would leave me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d It was, however, a kind of\r\npermission, so I said to Paul:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in that curious sort of way that people have when they\r\ntry to understand others who are talking in a strange language before\r\nthem, and asked me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked whether we might smoke, and she said we might do whatever we\r\nliked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon I lighted my cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she say anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had counted her words you would have noticed that she used\r\nexactly six, two of which gave me to understand that she knew no French,\r\nso four remained, and much can be said in four words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul seemed quite unhappy, disappointed, and at sea, so to speak.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the Italian asked me, in that tone of discontent which\r\nseemed habitual to her, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know at what time we shall get to\r\nGenoa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt eleven o'clock,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. Then after a moment I went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend and I are also going to Genoa, and if we can be of any\r\nservice to you, we shall be very happy, as you are quite alone.\xe2\x80\x9d But she\r\ninterrupted with such a \xe2\x80\x9cMica!\xe2\x80\x9d that I did not venture on another word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d Paul asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said she thought you were charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was in no humor for joking, and begged me dryly not to make fun\r\nof him; so I translated her question and my polite offer, which had been\r\nso rudely rejected.\r\n\r\nThen he really became as restless as a caged squirrel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we only knew,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat hotel she was going to, we would go to\r\nthe same. Try to find out so as to have another opportunity to make her\r\ntalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not particularly easy, and I did not know what pretext to invent,\r\ndesirous as I was to make the acquaintance of this unapproachable\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nWe passed Nice, Monaco, Mentone, and the train stopped at the frontier\r\nfor the examination of luggage.\r\n\r\nAlthough I hate those ill-bred people who breakfast and dine in railway-\r\ncarriages, I went and bought a quantity of good things to make one last\r\nattack on her by their means. I felt sure that this girl must,\r\nordinarily, be by no means inaccessible. Something had put her out and\r\nmade her irritable, but very little would suffice, a mere word or some\r\nagreeable offer, to decide her and vanquish her.\r\n\r\nWe started again, and we three were still alone. I spread my eatables on\r\nthe seat. I cut up the fowl, put the slices of ham neatly on a piece of\r\npaper, and then carefully laid out our dessert, strawberries, plums,\r\ncherries and cakes, close to the girl.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw that we were about to eat she took a piece of chocolate and\r\ntwo little crisp cakes out of her pocket and began to munch them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk her to have some of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul said in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what I wish to do, but it is rather a difficult\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she, however, glanced from time to time at our provisions, I felt\r\nsure that she would still be hungry when she had finished what she had\r\nwith her; so, as soon as her frugal meal was over, I said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be very kind of you if you would take some of this fruit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she said \xe2\x80\x9cMica!\xe2\x80\x9d but less crossly than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I offer you a little wine? I see you have not\r\ndrunk anything. It is Italian wine, and as we are now in your own\r\ncountry, we should be very pleased to see such a pretty Italian mouth\r\naccept the offer of its French neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head slightly, evidently wishing to refuse, but very\r\ndesirous of accepting, and her mica this time was almost polite. I took\r\nthe flask, which was covered with straw in the Italian fashion, and\r\nfilling the glass, I offered it to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease drink it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cto bid us welcome to your country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the glass with her usual look, and emptied it at a draught,\r\nlike a woman consumed with thirst, and then gave it back to me without\r\neven saying \xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI then offered her the cherries. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease take some,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall\r\nbe so glad if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut of her corner she looked at all the fruit spread out beside her, and\r\nsaid so rapidly that I could scarcely follow her: \xe2\x80\x9cA me non piacciono ne\r\nle ciriegie ne le susine; amo soltano le fragole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she say?\xe2\x80\x9d Paul asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she does riot care for cherries or plums, but only for\r\nstrawberries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI put a newspaper full of wild strawberries on her lap, and she ate them\r\nquickly, tossing them into her mouth from some distance in a coquettish\r\nand charming manner.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished the little red heap, which soon disappeared under\r\nthe rapid action of her hands, I asked her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat may I offer you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take a little chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nShe certainly devoured half of it, tearing it to pieces with the rapid\r\nmovements of her jaws like some carnivorous animal. Then she made up her\r\nmind to have some cherries, which she \xe2\x80\x9cdid not like,\xe2\x80\x9d and then some\r\nplums, then some little cakes. Then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had enough,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsat back in her corner.\r\n\r\nI was much amused, and tried to make her eat more, insisting, in fact,\r\ntill she suddenly flew into a rage, and flung such a furious mica at me,\r\nthat I would no longer run the risk of spoiling her digestion.\r\n\r\nI turned to my friend. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid we have had\r\nour trouble for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe night came on, one of those hot summer nights which extend their\r\nwarm shade over the burning and exhausted earth. Here and there, in the\r\ndistance, by the sea, on capes and promontories, bright stars, which I\r\nwas, at times, almost inclined to confound with lighthouses, began to\r\nshine on the dark horizon:\r\n\r\nThe scent of the orange trees became more penetrating, and we breathed\r\nwith delight, distending our lungs to inhale it more deeply. The balmy\r\nair was soft, delicious, almost divine.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I noticed something like a shower of stars under the dense\r\nshade of the trees along the line, where it was quite dark. It might\r\nhave been taken for drops of light, leaping, flying, playing and running\r\namong the leaves, or for small stars fallen from the skies in order to\r\nhave an excursion on the earth; but they were only fireflies dancing a\r\nstrange fiery ballet in the perfumed air.\r\n\r\nOne of them happened to come into our carriage, and shed its\r\nintermittent light, which seemed to be extinguished one moment and to be\r\nburning the next. I covered the carriage-lamp with its blue shade and\r\nwatched the strange fly careering about in its fiery flight. Suddenly it\r\nsettled on the dark hair of our neighbor, who was half dozing after\r\ndinner. Paul seemed delighted, with his eyes fixed on the bright,\r\nsparkling spot, which looked like a living jewel on the forehead of the\r\nsleeping woman.\r\n\r\nThe Italian woke up about eleven o'clock, with the bright insect still\r\nin her hair. When I saw her move, I said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are just getting to Genoa,\r\nmadame,\xe2\x80\x9d and she murmured, without answering me, as if possessed by some\r\nobstinate and embarrassing thought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I going to do, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she suddenly asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to come with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so taken aback that I really did not understand her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith us? How do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe repeated, looking more and more furious:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to be your guide now, as soon as we get out of the\r\ntrain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite willing; but where do you want to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders with an air of supreme indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherever you like; what does it matter to me?\xe2\x80\x9d She repeated her \xe2\x80\x9cChe mi\r\nfa\xe2\x80\x9d twice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are going to the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, let us all go to the hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a contemptuous\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nI turned to Paul, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wishes to know whether we should like her to come with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friend's utter surprise restored my self-possession. He stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith us? Where to? What for? How?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know, but she made this strange proposal to me in a most\r\nirritated voice. I told her that we were going to the hotel, and she\r\nsaid: 'Very well, let us all go there!' I suppose she is without a\r\npenny. She certainly has a very strange way of making acquaintances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul, who 'was very much excited, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite agreeable. Tell her that we will go wherever she likes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen, after a moment's hesitation, he said uneasily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must know, however, with whom she wishes to go\xe2\x80\x94with you or with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned to the Italian, who did not even seem to be listening to us,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be very happy to have you with us, but my friend wishes to\r\nknow whether you will take my arm or his?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened her black eyes wide with vague surprise, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cChe ni\r\nfa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was obliged to explain myself. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Italy, I believe, when a man looks\r\nafter a woman, fulfils all her wishes, and satisfies all her caprices,\r\nhe is called a patito. Which of us two will you take for your patito?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout the slightest hesitation she replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned to Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my friend, she chooses me; you have no\r\nchance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the better for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in a rage. Then, after thinking for\r\na few moments, he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really care about taking this creature with you? She will spoil\r\nour journey. What are we to do with this woman, who looks like I don't\r\nknow what? They will not take us in at any decent hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI, however, just began to find the Italian much nicer than I had thought\r\nher at first, and I was now very desirous to take her with us. The idea\r\ndelighted me.\r\n\r\nI replied, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, we have accepted, and it is too late to\r\nrecede. You were the first to advise me to say 'Yes.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled, \xe2\x80\x9cbut do as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train whistled, slackened speed, and we ran into the station.\r\n\r\nI got out of the carriage, and offered my new companion my hand. She\r\njumped out lightly, and I gave her my arm, which she took with an air of\r\nseeming repugnance. As soon as we had claimed our luggage we set off\r\ninto the town, Paul walking in utter silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what hotel shall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be difficult to get\r\ninto the City of Paris with a woman, especially with this Italian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaul interrupted me. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, with an Italian who looks more like a dancer\r\nthan a duchess. However, that is no business of mine. Do just as you\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was in a state of perplexity. I had written to the City of Paris to\r\nretain our rooms, and now I did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nTwo commissionaires followed us with our luggage. I continued: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmight as well go on first, and say that we are coming; and give the\r\nlandlord to understand that I have a\xe2\x80\x94a friend with me and that we should\r\nlike rooms quite by themselves for us three, so as not to be brought in\r\ncontact with other travellers. He will understand, and we will decide\r\naccording to his answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Paul growled, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, such commissions and such parts do not\r\nsuit me, by any means. I did not come here to select your apartments or\r\nto minister to your pleasures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I was urgent: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, don't be angry. It is surely far better to\r\ngo to a good hotel than to a bad one, and it is not difficult to ask the\r\nlandlord for three separate bedrooms and a dining-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI put a stress on three, and that decided him.\r\n\r\nHe went on first, and I saw him go into a large hotel while I remained\r\non the other side of the street, with my fair Italian, who did not say a\r\nword, and followed the porters with the luggage.\r\n\r\nPaul came back at last, looking as dissatisfied as my companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is settled,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they will take us in; but here are only\r\ntwo bedrooms. You must settle it as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed him, rather ashamed of going in with such a strange\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThere were two bedrooms separated by a small sitting-room. I ordered a\r\ncold supper, and then I turned to the Italian with a perplexed look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have only been able to get two rooms, so you must choose which you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied with her eternal \xe2\x80\x9cChe mi fa!\xe2\x80\x9d I thereupon took up her little\r\nblack wooden trunk, such as servants use, and took it into the room on\r\nthe right, which I had chosen for her. A bit of paper was fastened to\r\nthe box, on which was written, Mademoiselle Francesca Rondoli, Genoa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name is Francesca?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, and she nodded her head, without\r\nreplying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have supper directly,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued. \xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, I dare say you\r\nwould like to arrange your toilette a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered with a 'mica', a word which she employed just as frequently\r\nas 'Che me fa', but I went on: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is always pleasant after a journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I suddenly remembered that she had not, perhaps, the necessary\r\nrequisites, for she appeared to me in a very singular position, as if\r\nshe had just escaped from some disagreeable adventure, and I brought her\r\nmy dressing-case.\r\n\r\nI put out all the little instruments for cleanliness and comfort which\r\nit contained: a nail-brush, a new toothbrush\xe2\x80\x94I always carry a selection\r\nof them about with me\xe2\x80\x94my nail-scissors, a nail-file, and sponges. I\r\nuncorked a bottle of eau de cologne, one of lavender-water, and a little\r\nbottle of new-mown hay, so that she might have a choice. Then I opened\r\nmy powder-box, and put out the powder-puff, placed my fine towels over\r\nthe water-jug, and a piece of new soap near the basin.\r\n\r\nShe watched my movements with a look of annoyance in her wide-open eyes,\r\nwithout appearing either astonished or pleased at my forethought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is all that you require,\xe2\x80\x9d I then said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you when\r\nsupper is ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the sitting-room I found that Paul had shut himself\r\nin the other room, so I sat down to wait.\r\n\r\nA waiter went to and fro, bringing plates and glasses. He laid the table\r\nslowly, then put a cold chicken on it, and told me that all was ready.\r\n\r\nI knocked gently at Mademoiselle Rondoli's door. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nand when I did so I was struck by a strong, heavy smell of perfumes, as\r\nif I were in a hairdresser's shop.\r\n\r\nThe Italian was sitting on her trunk in an attitude either of thoughtful\r\ndiscontent or absent-mindedness. The towel was still folded over the\r\nwaterjug that was full of water, and the soap, untouched and dry, was\r\nlying beside the empty basin; but one would have thought that the young\r\nwoman had used half the contents of the bottles of perfume. The eau de\r\ncologne, however, had been spared, as only about a third of it had gone;\r\nbut to make up for that she had used a surprising amount of lavender-\r\nwater and new-mown hay. A cloud of violet powder, a vague white mist,\r\nseemed still to be floating in the air, from the effects of her over-\r\npowdering her face and neck. It seemed to cover her eyelashes, eyebrows,\r\nand the hair on her temples like snow, while her cheeks were plastered\r\nwith it, and layers of it covered her nostrils, the corners of her eyes,\r\nand her chin.\r\n\r\nWhen she got up she exhaled such a strong odor of perfume that it almost\r\nmade me feel faint.\r\n\r\nWhen we sat down to supper, I found that Paul was in a most execrable\r\ntemper, and I could get nothing out of him but blame, irritable words,\r\nand disagreeable remarks.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Francesca ate like an ogre, and as soon as she had finished\r\nher meal she threw herself upon the sofa in the sitting-room. Sitting\r\ndown beside her, I said gallantly, kissing her hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I have the bed prepared, or will you sleep on the couch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all the same to me. 'Che mi fa'!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer indifference vexed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like to retire at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I am very sleepy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up, yawned, gave her hand to Paul, who took it with a furious\r\nlook, and I lighted her into the bedroom. A disquieting feeling haunted\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is all you want,\xe2\x80\x9d I said again.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she got up early, like a woman who is accustomed to\r\nwork. She woke me by doing so, and I watched her through my half-closed\r\neyelids.\r\n\r\nShe came and went without hurrying herself, as if she were astonished at\r\nhaving nothing to do. At length she went to the dressing-table, and in a\r\nmoment emptied all my bottles of perfume. She certainly also used some\r\nwater, but very little.\r\n\r\nWhen she was quite dressed, she sat down on her trunk again, and\r\nclasping one knee between her hands, she seemed to be thinking.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I pretended to first notice her, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Francesca.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout seeming in at all a better temper than the previous night, she\r\nmurmured, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I asked her whether she had slept well, she nodded her head, and\r\njumping out of bed, I went and kissed her.\r\n\r\nShe turned her face toward me like a child who is being kissed against\r\nits will; but I took her tenderly in my arms, and gently pressed my lips\r\non her eyelids, which she closed with evident distaste under my kisses\r\non her fresh cheek and full lips, which she turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't seem to like being kissed,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMica!\xe2\x80\x9d was her only answer.\r\n\r\nI sat down on the trunk by her side, and passing my arm through hers, I\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cMica! mica! mica! in reply to everything. I shall call you\r\nMademoiselle Mica, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time I fancied that I saw the shadow of a smile on her\r\nlips, but it passed by so quickly that I may have been mistaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you never say anything but Mica, I shall not know what to do to\r\nplease you. Let me see; what shall we do to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment, as if some fancy had flitted through her head,\r\nand then she said carelessly: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all the same to me; whatever you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Mademoiselle Mica, we will have a carriage and go for a\r\ndrive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nPaul was waiting for us in the dining-room, looking as bored as third\r\nparties usually do in love affairs. I assumed a delighted air, and shook\r\nhands with him with triumphant energy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, we will go and see a little of the town, and then we\r\nmight get a carriage and take a drive in the neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted almost in silence, and then set out. I dragged Francesca\r\nfrom palace to palace, and she either looked at nothing or merely\r\nglanced carelessly at the various masterpieces. Paul followed us,\r\ngrowling all sorts of disagreeable things. Then we all three took a\r\ndrive in silence into the country and returned to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe next day it was the same thing and the next day again; and on the\r\nthird Paul said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, I am going to leave you; I am not\r\ngoing to stop here for three weeks watching you make love to this\r\ncreature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was perplexed and annoyed, for to my great surprise I had become\r\nsingularly attached to Francesca. A man is but weak and foolish, carried\r\naway by the merest trifle, and a coward every time that his senses are\r\nexcited or mastered. I clung to this unknown girl, silent and\r\ndissatisfied as she always was. I liked her somewhat ill-tempered face,\r\nthe dissatisfied droop of her mouth, the weariness of her look; I liked\r\nher fatigued movements, the contemptuous way in which she let me kiss\r\nher, the very indifference of her caresses. A secret bond, that\r\nmysterious bond of physical love, which does not satisfy, bound me to\r\nher. I told Paul so, quite frankly. He treated me as if I were a fool,\r\nand then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, take her with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she obstinately refused to leave Genoa, without giving any reason. I\r\nbesought, I reasoned, I promised, but all was of no avail, and so I\r\nstayed on.\r\n\r\nPaul declared that he would go by himself, and went so far as to pack up\r\nhis portmanteau; but he remained all the same.\r\n\r\nThus a fortnight passed. Francesca was always silent and irritable,\r\nlived beside me rather than with me, responded to all my requirements\r\nand all my propositions with her perpetual Che mi fa, or with her no\r\nless perpetual Mica.\r\n\r\nMy friend became more and more furious, but my only answer was, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\ngo if you are tired of staying. I am not detaining you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he called me names, overwhelmed me with reproaches, and exclaimed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you think I can go now? We had three weeks at our disposal,\r\nand here is a fortnight gone! I cannot continue my journey now; and, in\r\nany case, I am not going to Venice, Florence and Rome all by myself. But\r\nyou will pay for it, and more dearly than you think, most likely. You\r\nare not going to bring a man all the way from Paris in order to shut him\r\nup at a hotel in Genoa with an Italian adventuress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I told him, very calmly, to return to Paris, he exclaimed that he\r\nintended to do so the very next day; but the next day he was still\r\nthere, still in a rage and swearing.\r\n\r\nBy this time we began to be known in the streets through which we\r\nwandered from morning till night. Sometimes French people would turn\r\nround astonished at meeting their fellow-countrymen in the company of\r\nthis girl with her striking costume, who looked singularly out of place,\r\nnot to say compromising, beside us.\r\n\r\nShe used to walk along, leaning on my arm, without looking at anything.\r\nWhy did she remain with me, with us, who seemed to do so little to amuse\r\nher? Who was she? Where did she come from? What was she doing? Had she\r\nany plan or idea? Where did she live? As an adventuress, or by chance\r\nmeetings? I tried in vain to find out and to explain it. The better I\r\nknew her the more enigmatical she became. She seemed to be a girl of\r\npoor family who had been taken away, and then cast aside and lost. What\r\ndid she think would become of her, or whom was she waiting for? She\r\ncertainly did not appear to be trying to make a conquest of me, or to\r\nmake any real profit out of me.\r\n\r\nI tried to question her, to speak to her of her childhood and family;\r\nbut she never gave me an answer. I stayed with her, my heart unfettered\r\nand my senses enchained, never wearied of holding her in my arms, that\r\nproud and quarrelsome woman, captivated by my senses, or rather carried\r\naway, overcome by a youthful, healthy, powerful charm, which emanated\r\nfrom her fragrant person and from the well-molded lines of her body.\r\n\r\nAnother week passed, and the term of my journey was drawing on, for I\r\nhad to be back in Paris by the eleventh of July. By this time Paul had\r\ncome to take his part in the adventure, though still grumbling at me,\r\nwhile I invented pleasures, distractions and excursions to amuse\r\nFrancesca and my friend; and in order to do this I gave myself a great\r\namount of trouble.\r\n\r\nOne day I proposed an excursion to Sta Margarita, that charming little\r\ntown in the midst of gardens, hidden at the foot of a slope which\r\nstretches far into the sea up to the village of Portofino. We three\r\nwalked along the excellent road which goes along the foot of the\r\nmountain. Suddenly Francesca said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be able to go with\r\nyou to-morrow; I must go and see some of my relatives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was all; I did not ask her any questions, as I was quite sure she\r\nwould not answer me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she got up very early. When she spoke to me it was in a\r\nconstrained and hesitating voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do not come back again, shall you come and fetch me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly I shall,\xe2\x80\x9d was my reply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall I go to find you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she explained: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must go into the Street Victor-Emmanuel, down\r\nthe Falcone road and the side street San-Rafael and into the furniture\r\nshop in the building at the right at the end of a court, and there you\r\nmust ask for Madame Rondoli. That is the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so she went away, leaving me rather astonished.\r\n\r\nWhen Paul saw that I was alone, he stammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere; is Francesca?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd when I told him what had happened, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, let us make use of our opportunity, and bolt; as it is,\r\nour time is up. Two days, more or less, make no difference. Let us go at\r\nonce; go and pack up your things. Off we go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I refused. I could not, as I told him, leave the girl in that manner\r\nafter such companionship for nearly three weeks. At any rate, I ought to\r\nsay good-by to her, and make her accept a present; I certainly had no\r\nintention of behaving badly to her.\r\n\r\nBut he would not listen; he pressed and worried me, but I would not give\r\nway.\r\n\r\nI remained indoors for several hours, expecting Francesca's return, but\r\nshe did not come, and at last, at dinner, Paul said with a triumphant\r\nair:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has flown, my dear fellow; it is certainly very strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge that I was surprised and rather vexed. He laughed in\r\nmy face, and made fun of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not exactly a bad way of getting rid of you, though rather\r\nprimitive. 'Just wait for me, I shall be back in a moment,' they often\r\nsay. How long are you going to wait? I should not wonder if you were\r\nfoolish enough to go and look for her at the address she gave you. 'Does\r\nMadame Rondoli live here, please?' 'No, monsieur.' I'll bet that you are\r\nlonging to go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested, \xe2\x80\x9cand I assure you that if she does not\r\ncome back to-morrow morning I shall leave by the express at eight\r\no'clock. I shall have waited twenty-four hours, and that is enough; my\r\nconscience will be quite clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spent an uneasy and unpleasant evening, for I really had at heart a\r\nvery tender feeling for her. I went to bed at twelve o'clock, and hardly\r\nslept at all. I got up at six, called Paul, packed up my things, and two\r\nhours later we set out for France together.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe next year, at just about the same period, I was seized as one is\r\nwith a periodical fever, with a new desire to go to Italy, and I\r\nimmediately made up my mind to carry it into effect. There is no doubt\r\nthat every really well-educated man ought to see Florence, Venice and\r\nRome. This travel has, also, the additional advantage of providing many\r\nsubjects of conversation in society, and of giving one an opportunity\r\nfor bringing forward artistic generalities which appear profound.\r\n\r\nThis time I went alone, and I arrived at Genoa at the same time as the\r\nyear before, but without any adventure on the road. I went to the same\r\nhotel, and actually happened to have the same room.\r\n\r\nI was hardly in bed when the recollection of Francesca which, since the\r\nevening before, had been floating vaguely through my mind, haunted me\r\nwith strange persistency. I thought of her nearly the whole night, and\r\nby degrees the wish to see her again seized me, a confused desire at\r\nfirst, which gradually grew stronger and more intense. At last I made up\r\nmy mind to spend the next day in Genoa to try to find her, and if I\r\nshould not succeed, to take the evening train.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning I set out on my search. I remembered the directions\r\nshe had given me when she left me, perfectly\xe2\x80\x94Victor-Emmanuel Street,\r\nhouse of the furniture-dealer, at the bottom of the yard on the right.\r\n\r\nI found it without the least difficulty, and I knocked at the door of a\r\nsomewhat dilapidated-looking dwelling. It was opened by a stout woman,\r\nwho must have been very handsome, but who actually was only very dirty.\r\nAlthough she had too much embonpoint, she still bore the lines of\r\nmajestic beauty; her untidy hair fell over her forehead and shoulders,\r\nand one fancied one could see her floating about in an enormous\r\ndressing-gown covered with spots of dirt and grease. Round her neck she\r\nwore a great gilt necklace, and on her wrists were splendid bracelets of\r\nGenoa filigree work.\r\n\r\nIn rather a hostile manner she asked me what I wanted, and I replied by\r\nrequesting her to tell me whether Francesca Rondoli lived there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with her?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the pleasure of meeting her last year, and I should like to see\r\nher again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked at me suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you meet her?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here in Genoa itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated a moment, and then I told her. I had hardly done so when the\r\nItalian put out her arms as if to embrace me. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! you are the Frenchman\r\nhow glad I am to see you! But what grief you caused the poor child! She\r\nwaited for you a month; yes, a whole month. At first she thought you\r\nwould come to fetch her. She wanted to see whether you loved her. If you\r\nonly knew how she cried when she saw that you were not coming! She cried\r\ntill she seemed to have no tears left. Then she went to the hotel, but\r\nyou had gone. She thought that most likely you were travelling in Italy,\r\nand that you would return by Genoa to fetch her, as she would not go\r\nwith you. And she waited more than a month, monsieur; and she was so\r\nunhappy; so unhappy. I am her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI really felt a little disconcerted, but I regained my self-possession,\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone to Paris with a painter, a delightful man, who loves her\r\nvery much, and who gives her everything that she wants. Just look at\r\nwhat she sent me; they are very pretty, are they not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she showed me, with quite southern animation, her heavy bracelets\r\nand necklace. \xe2\x80\x9cI have also,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cearrings with stones in\r\nthem, a silk dress, and some rings; but I only wear them on grand\r\noccasions. Oh! she is very happy, monsieur, very happy. She will be so\r\npleased when I tell her you have been here. But pray come in and sit\r\ndown. You will take something or other, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I refused, as I now wished to get away by the first train; but she\r\ntook me by the arm and pulled me in, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, come in; I must tell her that you have been in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found myself in a small, rather dark room, furnished with only a table\r\nand a few chairs.\r\n\r\nShe continued: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, she is very happy now, very happy. When you met her\r\nin the train she was very miserable; she had had an unfortunate love\r\naffair in Marseilles, and she was coming home, poor child. But she liked\r\nyou at once, though she was still rather sad, you understand. Now she\r\nhas all she wants, and she writes and tells me everything that she does.\r\nHis name is Bellemin, and they say he is a great painter in your\r\ncountry. He fell in love with her at first sight. But you will take a\r\nglass of sirup?-it is very good. Are you quite alone, this year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cquite alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt an increasing inclination to laugh, as my first disappointment\r\nwas dispelled by what Mother Rondoli said. I was obliged; however, to\r\ndrink a glass of her sirup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are quite alone?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cHow sorry I am that Francesca\r\nis not here now; she would have been company for you all the time you\r\nstayed. It is not very amusing to go about all by oneself, and she will\r\nbe very sorry also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as I was getting up to go, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would you not like Carlotta to go with you? She knows all the walks\r\nvery well. She is my second daughter, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo doubt she took my look of surprise for consent, for she opened the\r\ninner door and called out up the dark stairs which I could not see:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarlotta! Carlotta! make haste down, my dear child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried to protest, but she would not listen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she will be very glad to go with you; she is very nice, and much\r\nmore cheerful than her sister, and she is a good girl, a very good girl,\r\nwhom I love very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a tall, slender, dark girl appeared, her hair hanging\r\ndown, and her youthful figure showing unmistakably beneath an old dress\r\nof her mother's.\r\n\r\nThe latter at once told her how matters stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Francesca's Frenchman, you know, the one whom she knew last\r\nyear. He is quite alone, and has come to look for her, poor fellow; so I\r\ntold him that you would go with him to keep him company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at me with her handsome dark eyes, and said, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no objection, if he wishes it\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not possibly refuse, and merely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I shall be very glad of your company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mother pushed her out. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and get dressed directly; put on your\r\nblue dress and your hat with the flowers, and make haste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had left the room the old woman explained herself: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave two others, but they are much younger. It costs a lot of money to\r\nbring up four children. Luckily the eldest is off my hands at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she told all about herself, about her husband, who had been an\r\nemployee on the railway, but who was dead, and she expatiated on the\r\ngood qualities of Carlotta, her second girl, who soon returned, dressed,\r\nas her sister had been, in a striking, peculiar manner.\r\n\r\nHer mother examined her from head to foot, and, after finding everything\r\nright, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my children, you can go.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to the girl, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\nsure you are back by ten o'clock to-night; you know the door is locked\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d The answer was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, mamma; don't alarm yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took my arm and we went wandering about the streets, just as I had\r\nwandered the previous year with her sister.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the hotel for lunch, and then I took my new friend to\r\nSanta Margarita, just as I had taken her sister the year previously.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole fortnight which I had at my disposal, I took Carlotta\r\nto all the places of interest in and about Genoa. She gave me no cause\r\nto regret her sister.\r\n\r\nShe cried when I left her, and the morning of my departure I gave her\r\nfour bracelets for her mother, besides a substantial token of my\r\naffection for herself.\r\n\r\nOne of these days I intend to return to Italy, and I cannot help\r\nremembering with a certain amount of uneasiness, mingled with hope, that\r\nMadame Rondoli has two more daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 7.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALSE GEMS\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin had met the young girl at a reception at the house of\r\nthe second head of his department, and had fallen head over heels in\r\nlove with her.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of a provincial tax collector, who had been dead\r\nseveral years. She and her mother came to live in Paris, where the\r\nlatter, who made the acquaintance of some of the families in her\r\nneighborhood, hoped to find a husband for her daughter.\r\n\r\nThey had very moderate means, and were honorable, gentle, and quiet.\r\n\r\nThe young girl was a perfect type of the virtuous woman in whose hands\r\nevery sensible young man dreams of one day intrusting his happiness. Her\r\nsimple beauty had the charm of angelic modesty, and the imperceptible\r\nsmile which constantly hovered about the lips seemed to be the\r\nreflection of a pure and lovely soul. Her praises resounded on every\r\nside. People never tired of repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cHappy the man who wins her love!\r\nHe could not find a better wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin, then chief clerk in the Department of the Interior,\r\nenjoyed a snug little salary of three thousand five hundred francs, and\r\nhe proposed to this model young girl, and was accepted.\r\n\r\nHe was unspeakably happy with her. She governed his household with such\r\nclever economy that they seemed to live in luxury. She lavished the most\r\ndelicate attentions on her husband, coaxed and fondled him; and so great\r\nwas her charm that six years after their marriage, Monsieur Lantin\r\ndiscovered that he loved his wife even more than during the first days\r\nof their honeymoon.\r\n\r\nHe found fault with only two of her tastes: Her love for the theatre,\r\nand her taste for imitation jewelry. Her friends (the wives of some\r\npetty officials) frequently procured for her a box at the theatre, often\r\nfor the first representations of the new plays; and her husband was\r\nobliged to accompany her, whether he wished it or not, to these\r\nentertainments which bored him excessively after his day's work at the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, Monsieur Lantin begged his wife to request some lady of\r\nher acquaintance to accompany her, and to bring her home after the\r\ntheatre. She opposed this arrangement, at first; but, after much\r\npersuasion, finally consented, to the infinite delight of her husband.\r\n\r\nNow, with her love for the theatre, came also the desire for ornaments.\r\nHer costumes remained as before, simple, in good taste, and always\r\nmodest; but she soon began to adorn her ears with huge rhinestones,\r\nwhich glittered and sparkled like real diamonds. Around her neck she\r\nwore strings of false pearls, on her arms bracelets of imitation gold,\r\nand combs set with glass jewels.\r\n\r\nHer husband frequently remonstrated with her, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, as you cannot afford to buy real jewelry, you ought to appear\r\nadorned with your beauty and modesty alone, which are the rarest\r\nornaments of your sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she would smile sweetly, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do? I am so fond of jewelry. It is my only weakness. We\r\ncannot change our nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she would wind the pearl necklace round her fingers, make the\r\nfacets of the crystal gems sparkle, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! are they not lovely? One would swear they were real.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin would then answer, smilingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have bohemian tastes, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes, of an evening, when they were enjoying a tete-a-tete by the\r\nfireside, she would place on the tea table the morocco leather box\r\ncontaining the \xe2\x80\x9ctrash,\xe2\x80\x9d as Monsieur Lantin called it. She would examine\r\nthe false gems with a passionate attention, as though they imparted some\r\ndeep and secret joy; and she often persisted in passing a necklace\r\naround her husband's neck, and, laughing heartily, would exclaim: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ndroll you look!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she would throw herself into his arms, and kiss\r\nhim affectionately.\r\n\r\nOne evening, in winter, she had been to the opera, and returned home\r\nchilled through and through. The next morning she coughed, and eight\r\ndays later she died of inflammation of the lungs.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin's despair was so great that his hair became white in one\r\nmonth. He wept unceasingly; his heart was broken as he remembered her\r\nsmile, her voice, every charm of his dead wife.\r\n\r\nTime did not assuage his grief. Often, during office hours, while his\r\ncolleagues were discussing the topics of the day, his eyes would\r\nsuddenly fill with tears, and he would give vent to his grief in\r\nheartrending sobs. Everything in his wife's room remained as it was\r\nduring her lifetime; all her furniture, even her clothing, being left as\r\nit was on the day of her death. Here he was wont to seclude himself\r\ndaily and think of her who had been his treasure-the joy of his\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nBut life soon became a struggle. His income, which, in the hands of his\r\nwife, covered all household expenses, was now no longer sufficient for\r\nhis own immediate wants; and he wondered how she could have managed to\r\nbuy such excellent wine and the rare delicacies which he could no longer\r\nprocure with his modest resources.\r\n\r\nHe incurred some debts, and was soon reduced to absolute poverty. One\r\nmorning, finding himself without a cent in his pocket, he resolved to\r\nsell something, and immediately the thought occurred to him of disposing\r\nof his wife's paste jewels, for he cherished in his heart a sort of\r\nrancor against these \xe2\x80\x9cdeceptions,\xe2\x80\x9d which had always irritated him in the\r\npast. The very sight of them spoiled, somewhat, the memory of his lost\r\ndarling.\r\n\r\nTo the last days of her life she had continued to make purchases,\r\nbringing home new gems almost every evening, and he turned them over\r\nsome time before finally deciding to sell the heavy necklace, which she\r\nseemed to prefer, and which, he thought, ought to be worth about six or\r\nseven francs; for it was of very fine workmanship, though only\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nHe put it in his pocket, and started out in search of what seemed a\r\nreliable jeweler's shop. At length he found one, and went in, feeling a\r\nlittle ashamed to expose his misery, and also to offer such a worthless\r\narticle for sale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the merchant, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to know what this is\r\nworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man took the necklace, examined it, called his clerk, and made some\r\nremarks in an undertone; he then put the ornament back on the counter,\r\nand looked at it from a distance to judge of the effect.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin, annoyed at all these ceremonies, was on the point of\r\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know well enough it is not worth anything,\xe2\x80\x9d when the\r\njeweler said: \xe2\x80\x9cSir, that necklace is worth from twelve to fifteen\r\nthousand francs; but I could not buy it, unless you can tell me exactly\r\nwhere it came from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe widower opened his eyes wide and remained gaping, not comprehending\r\nthe merchant's meaning. Finally he stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cYou say\xe2\x80\x94are you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe other replied, drily: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can try elsewhere and see if any one will\r\noffer you more. I consider it worth fifteen thousand at the most. Come\r\nback; here, if you cannot do better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin, beside himself with astonishment, took up the necklace\r\nand left the store. He wished time for reflection.\r\n\r\nOnce outside, he felt inclined to laugh, and said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fool!\r\nOh, the fool! Had I only taken him at his word! That jeweler cannot\r\ndistinguish real diamonds from the imitation article.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes after, he entered another store, in the Rue de la Paix. As\r\nsoon as the proprietor glanced at the necklace, he cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, parbleu! I know it well; it was bought here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin, greatly disturbed, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much is it worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I sold it for twenty thousand francs. I am willing to take it\r\nback for eighteen thousand, when you inform me, according to our legal\r\nformality, how it came to be in your possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time, Monsieur Lantin was dumfounded. He replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94examine it well. Until this moment I was under the impression\r\nthat it was imitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jeweler asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLantin\xe2\x80\x94I am in the employ of the Minister of the Interior. I live at\r\nnumber sixteen Rue des Martyrs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe merchant looked through his books, found the entry, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nnecklace was sent to Madame Lantin's address, sixteen Rue des Martyrs,\r\nJuly 20, 1876.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men looked into each other's eyes\xe2\x80\x94the widower speechless with\r\nastonishment; the jeweler scenting a thief. The latter broke the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you leave this necklace here for twenty-four hours?\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill give you a receipt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin answered hastily: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, putting the\r\nticket in his pocket, he left the store.\r\n\r\nHe wandered aimlessly through the streets, his mind in a state of\r\ndreadful confusion. He tried to reason, to understand. His wife could\r\nnot afford to purchase such a costly ornament. Certainly not.\r\n\r\nBut, then, it must have been a present!\xe2\x80\x94a present!\xe2\x80\x94a present, from whom?\r\nWhy was it given her?\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and remained standing in the middle of the street. A\r\nhorrible doubt entered his mind\xe2\x80\x94She? Then, all the other jewels must\r\nhave been presents, too! The earth seemed to tremble beneath him\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ntree before him to be falling; he threw up his arms, and fell to the\r\nground, unconscious. He recovered his senses in a pharmacy, into which\r\nthe passers-by had borne him. He asked to be taken home, and, when he\r\nreached the house, he shut himself up in his room, and wept until\r\nnightfall. Finally, overcome with fatigue, he went to bed and fell into\r\na heavy sleep.\r\n\r\nThe sun awoke him next morning, and he began to dress slowly to go to\r\nthe office. It was hard to work after such shocks. He sent a letter to\r\nhis employer, requesting to be excused. Then he remembered that he had\r\nto return to the jeweler's. He did not like the idea; but he could not\r\nleave the necklace with that man. He dressed and went out.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely day; a clear, blue sky smiled on the busy city below.\r\nMen of leisure were strolling about with their hands in their pockets.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin, observing them, said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThe rich, indeed, are\r\nhappy. With money it is possible to forget even the deepest sorrow. One\r\ncan go where one pleases, and in travel find that distraction which is\r\nthe surest cure for grief. Oh if I were only rich!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe perceived that he was hungry, but his pocket was empty. He again\r\nremembered the necklace. Eighteen thousand francs! Eighteen thousand\r\nfrancs! What a sum!\r\n\r\nHe soon arrived in the Rue de la Paix, opposite the jeweler's. Eighteen\r\nthousand francs! Twenty times he resolved to go in, but shame kept him\r\nback. He was hungry, however\xe2\x80\x94very hungry\xe2\x80\x94and not a cent in his pocket.\r\nHe decided quickly, ran across the street, in order not to have time for\r\nreflection, and rushed into the store.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor immediately came forward, and politely offered him a\r\nchair; the clerks glanced at him knowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made inquiries, Monsieur Lantin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the jeweler, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you\r\nare still resolved to dispose of the gems, I am ready to pay you the\r\nprice I offered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Monsieur Lantin.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the proprietor took from a drawer eighteen large bills,\r\ncounted, and handed them to Monsieur Lantin, who signed a receipt; and,\r\nwith trembling hand, put the money into his pocket.\r\n\r\nAs he was about to leave the store, he turned toward the merchant, who\r\nstill wore the same knowing smile, and lowering his eyes, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have\xe2\x80\x94I have other gems, which came from the same source. Will you buy\r\nthem, also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe merchant bowed: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin said gravely: \xe2\x80\x9cI will bring them to you.\xe2\x80\x9d An hour later,\r\nhe returned with the gems.\r\n\r\nThe large diamond earrings were worth twenty thousand francs; the\r\nbracelets, thirty-five thousand; the rings, sixteen thousand; a set of\r\nemeralds and sapphires, fourteen thousand; a gold chain with solitaire\r\npendant, forty thousand\xe2\x80\x94making the sum of one hundred and forty-three\r\nthousand francs.\r\n\r\nThe jeweler remarked, jokingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a person who invested all her savings in precious stones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lantin replied, seriously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only another way of investing one's money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat day he lunched at Voisin's, and drank wine worth twenty francs a\r\nbottle. Then he hired a carriage and made a tour of the Bois. He gazed\r\nat the various turnouts with a kind of disdain, and could hardly refrain\r\nfrom crying out to the occupants:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, too, am rich!\xe2\x80\x94I am worth two hundred thousand francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he thought of his employer. He drove up to the bureau, and\r\nentered gaily, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I have come to resign my position. I have just inherited three\r\nhundred thousand francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with his former colleagues, and confided to them some of\r\nhis projects for the future; he then went off to dine at the Cafe\r\nAnglais.\r\n\r\nHe seated himself beside a gentleman of aristocratic bearing; and,\r\nduring the meal, informed the latter confidentially that he had just\r\ninherited a fortune of four hundred thousand francs.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life, he was not bored at the theatre, and\r\nspent the remainder of the night in a gay frolic.\r\n\r\nSix months afterward, he married again. His second wife was a very\r\nvirtuous woman; but had a violent temper. She caused him much sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFASCINATION\r\n\r\nI can tell you neither the name of the country, nor the name of the man.\r\nIt was a long, long way from here on a fertile and burning shore. We had\r\nbeen walking since the morning along the coast, with the blue sea bathed\r\nin sunlight on one side of us, and the shore covered with crops on the\r\nother. Flowers were growing quite close to the waves, those light,\r\ngentle, lulling waves. It was very warm, a soft warmth permeated with\r\nthe odor of the rich, damp, fertile soil. One fancied one was inhaling\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\nI had been told, that evening, that I should meet with hospitality at\r\nthe house of a Frenchman who lived in an orange grove at the end of a\r\npromontory. Who was he? I did not know. He had come there one morning\r\nten years before, and had bought land which he planted with vines and\r\nsowed with grain. He had worked, this man, with passionate energy, with\r\nfury. Then as he went on from month to month, year to year, enlarging\r\nhis boundaries, cultivating incessantly the strong virgin soil, he\r\naccumulated a fortune by his indefatigable labor.\r\n\r\nBut he kept on working, they said. Rising at daybreak, he would remain\r\nin the fields till evening, superintending everything without ceasing,\r\ntormented by one fixed idea, the insatiable desire for money, which\r\nnothing can quiet, nothing satisfy. He now appeared to be very rich. The\r\nsun was setting as I reached his house. It was situated as described, at\r\nthe end of a promontory in the midst of a grove of orange trees. It was\r\na large square house, quite plain, and overlooked the sea. As I\r\napproached, a man wearing a long beard appeared in the doorway. Having\r\ngreeted him, I asked if he would give me shelter for the night. He held\r\nout his hand and said, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, monsieur, consider yourself at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led me into a room, and put a man servant at my disposal with the\r\nperfect ease and familiar graciousness of a man-of-the-world. Then he\r\nleft me saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will dine as soon as you are ready to come downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe took dinner, sitting opposite each other, on a terrace facing the\r\nsea. I began to talk about this rich, distant, unknown land. He smiled,\r\nas he replied carelessly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this country is beautiful. But no country satisfies one when they\r\nare far from the one they love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou regret France?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI regret Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not go back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will return there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd gradually we began to talk of French society, of the boulevards, and\r\nthings Parisian. He asked me questions that showed he knew all about\r\nthese things, mentioned names, all the familiar names in vaudeville\r\nknown on the sidewalks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom does one see at Tortoni's now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the same crowd, except those who died.\xe2\x80\x9d I looked at him\r\nattentively, haunted by a vague recollection. I certainly had seen that\r\nhead somewhere. But where? And when? He seemed tired, although he was\r\nvigorous; and sad, although he was determined. His long, fair beard fell\r\non his chest. He was somewhat bald and had heavy eyebrows and a thick\r\nmustache.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking into the sea, turning the vapor from the earth into\r\na fiery mist. The orange blossoms exhaled their powerful, delicious\r\nfragrance. He seemed to see nothing besides me, and gazing steadfastly\r\nhe appeared to discover in the depths of my mind the far-away, beloved\r\nand well-known image of the wide, shady pavement leading from the\r\nMadeleine to the Rue Drouot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Boutrelle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he changed much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, his hair is quite white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd La Ridamie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the women? Tell me about the women. Let's see. Do you know Suzanne\r\nVerner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very much. But that is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! And Sophie Astier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl. Did you\xe2\x80\x94did you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he ceased abruptly: And then, in a changed voice, his face suddenly\r\nturning pale, he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is best that I should not speak of that any more, it breaks my\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as if to change the current of his thoughts he rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to go in?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he preceded me into the house. The downstairs rooms were enormous,\r\nbare and mournful, and had a deserted look. Plates and glasses were\r\nscattered on the tables, left there by the dark-skinned servants who\r\nwandered incessantly about this spacious dwelling.\r\n\r\nTwo rifles were banging from two nails, on the wall; and in the corners\r\nof the rooms were spades, fishing poles, dried palm leaves, every\r\nimaginable thing set down at random when people came home in the evening\r\nand ready to hand when they went out at any time, or went to work.\r\n\r\nMy host smiled as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the dwelling, or rather the kennel, of an exile, but my own\r\nroom is cleaner. Let us go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I entered I thought I was in a second-hand store, it was so full of\r\nthings of all descriptions, strange things of various kinds that one\r\nfelt must be souvenirs. On the walls were two pretty paintings by well-\r\nknown artists, draperies, weapons, swords and pistols, and exactly in\r\nthe middle, on the principal panel, a square of white satin in a gold\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nSomewhat surprised, I approached to look at it, and perceived a hairpin\r\nfastened in the centre of the glossy satin. My host placed his hand on\r\nmy shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cis the only thing that I look at here, and the only\r\nthing that I have seen for ten years. M. Prudhomme said: 'This sword is\r\nthe most memorable day of my life.' I can say: 'This hairpin is all my\r\nlife.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sought for some commonplace remark, and ended by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have suffered on account of some woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, rather, that I am suffering like a wretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut come out on my balcony. A name rose to my lips just now which I\r\ndared not utter; for if you had said 'Dead' as you did of Sophie Astier,\r\nI should have fired a bullet into my brain, this very day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had gone out on the wide balcony from whence we could see two gulfs,\r\none to the right and the other to the left, enclosed by high gray\r\nmountains. It was just twilight and the reflection of the sunset still\r\nlingered in the sky.\r\n\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Jeanne de Limours still alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes were fastened on mine and were full of a trembling anxiety. I\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu\xe2\x80\x94she is prettier than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have nothing to tell. She is one of the most charming women, or,\r\nrather, girls, and the most admired in Paris. She leads a delightful\r\nexistence and lives like a princess, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love her,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured in a tone in which he might have said \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to die.\xe2\x80\x9d Then suddenly he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! For three years we lived in a state of terror and delight. I almost\r\nkilled her five or six times. She tried to pierce my eyes with that\r\nhairpin that you saw just now. Look, do you see that little white spot\r\nbeneath my left eye? We loved each other. How can I explain that\r\ninfatuation? You would not understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a simple form of love, the result of the mutual impulse\r\nof two hearts and two souls. But there is also assuredly an atrocious\r\nform, that tortures one cruelly, the result of the occult blending of\r\ntwo unlike personalities who detest each other at the same time that\r\nthey adore one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn three years this woman had ruined me. I had four million francs\r\nwhich she squandered in her calm manner, quietly, eat them up with a\r\ngentle smile that seemed to fall from her eyes on to her lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know her? There is something irresistible about her. What is it? I\r\ndo not know. Is it those gray eyes whose glance penetrates you like a\r\ngimlet and remains there like the point of an arrow? It is more likely\r\nthe gentle, indifferent and fascinating smile that she wears like a\r\nmask. Her slow grace pervades you little by little; exhales from her\r\nlike a perfume, from her slim figure that scarcely sways as she passes\r\nyou, for she seems to glide rather than walk; from her pretty voice with\r\nits slight drawl that would seem to be the music of her smile; from her\r\ngestures, also, which are never exaggerated, but always appropriate, and\r\nintoxicate your vision with their harmony. For three years she was the\r\nonly being that existed for me on the earth! How I suffered; for she\r\ndeceived me as she deceived everyone! Why? For no reason; just for the\r\npleasure of deceiving. And when I found it out, when I treated her as a\r\ncommon girl and a beggar, she said quietly: 'Are we married?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince I have been here I have thought so much about her that at last I\r\nunderstand her. She is Manon Lescaut come back to life. It is Marion,\r\nwho could not love without deceiving; Marion for whom love, amusement,\r\nmoney, are all one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent. After a few minutes he resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had spent my last sou on her she said simply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You understand, my dear boy, that I cannot live on air and weather. I\r\nlove you very much, better than anyone, but I must live. Poverty and I\r\ncould not keep house together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I should tell you what a horrible life I led with her! When I\r\nlooked at her I would just as soon have killed her as kissed her. When I\r\nlooked at her . . . I felt a furious desire to open my arms to embrace\r\nand strangle her. She had, back of her eyes, something false and\r\nintangible that made me execrate her; and that was, perhaps, the reason\r\nI loved her so well. The eternal feminine, the odious and seductive\r\nfeminine, was stronger in her than in any other woman. She was full of\r\nit, overcharged, as with a venomous and intoxicating fluid. She was a\r\nwoman to a greater extent than any one has ever been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I went out with her she would look at all men in such a manner\r\nthat she seemed to offer herself to each in a single glance. This\r\nexasperated me, and still it attached me to her all the more. This\r\ncreature in just walking along the street belonged to everyone, in spite\r\nof me, in spite of herself, by the very fact of her nature, although she\r\nhad a modest, gentle carriage. Do you understand?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what torture! At the theatre, at the restaurant she seemed to\r\nbelong to others under my very eyes. And as soon as I left her she did\r\nbelong to others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now ten years since I saw her and I love her better than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight spread over the earth. A strong perfume of orange blossoms\r\npervaded the air. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you see her again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu! I now have here, in land and money, seven to eight thousand\r\nfrancs. When I reach a million I shall sell out and go away. I shall\r\nhave enough to live on with her for a year\xe2\x80\x94one whole year. And then,\r\ngood-bye, my life will be finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, I do not know. That will be all, I may possibly ask her to\r\ntake me as a valet de chambre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYVETTE SAMORIS \xe2\x80\x9cThe Comtesse Samoris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat lady in black over there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very one. She's wearing mourning for her daughter, whom she\r\nkilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't mean that seriously? How did she die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is a very simple story, without any crime in it, any violence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what really happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost nothing. Many courtesans are born to be virtuous women, they\r\nsay; and many women called virtuous are born to be courtesans\xe2\x80\x94is that\r\nnot so? Now, Madame Samoris, who was born a courtesan, had a daughter\r\nborn a virtuous woman, that's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't quite understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll\xe2\x80\x94explain what I mean. The comtesse is nothing but a common,\r\nordinary parvenue originating no one knows where. A Hungarian or\r\nWallachian countess or I know not what. She appeared one winter in\r\napartments she had taken in the Champs Elysees, that quarter for\r\nadventurers and adventuresses, and opened her drawing-room to the first\r\ncomer or to any one that turned up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went there. Why? you will say. I really can't tell you. I went there,\r\nas every one goes to such places because the women are facile and the\r\nmen are dishonest. You know that set composed of filibusters with varied\r\ndecorations, all noble, all titled, all unknown at the embassies, with\r\nthe exception of those who are spies. All talk of their honor without\r\nthe slightest occasion for doing so, boast of their ancestors, tell you\r\nabout their lives, braggarts, liars, sharpers, as dangerous as the false\r\ncards they have up their sleeves, as delusive as their names\xe2\x80\x94in short,\r\nthe aristocracy of the bagnio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI adore these people. They are interesting to study, interesting to\r\nknow, amusing to understand, often clever, never commonplace like public\r\nfunctionaries. Their wives are always pretty, with a slight flavor of\r\nforeign roguery, with the mystery of their existence, half of it perhaps\r\nspent in a house of correction. They have, as a rule, magnificent eyes\r\nand incredible hair. I adore them also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Samoris is the type of these adventuresses, elegant, mature and\r\nstill beautiful. Charming feline creatures, you feel that they are\r\nvicious to the marrow of their bones. You find them very amusing when\r\nyou visit them; they give card parties; they have dances and suppers; in\r\nshort, they offer you all the pleasures of social life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she had a daughter\xe2\x80\x94a tall, fine-looking girl, always ready for\r\namusement, always full of laughter and reckless gaiety\xe2\x80\x94a true\r\nadventuress' daughter\xe2\x80\x94but, at the same time, an innocent,\r\nunsophisticated, artless girl, who saw nothing, knew nothing, understood\r\nnothing of all the things that happened in her father's house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl was simply a puzzle to me. She was a mystery. She lived amid\r\nthose infamous surroundings with a quiet, tranquil ease that was either\r\nterribly criminal or else the result of innocence. She sprang from the\r\nfilth of that class like a beautiful flower fed on corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know? That's the funniest part of the business! One morning\r\nthere was a ring at my door, and my valet came up to tell me that M.\r\nJoseph Bonenthal wanted to speak to me. I said directly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And who is this gentleman?' My valet replied: 'I don't know, monsieur;\r\nperhaps 'tis some one that wants employment.' And so it was. The man\r\nwanted me to take him as a servant. I asked him where he had been last.\r\nHe answered: 'With the Comtesse Samoris.' 'Ah!' said I, 'but my house is\r\nnot a bit like hers.' 'I know that well, monsieur,' he said, 'and that's\r\nthe very reason I want to take service with monsieur. I've had enough of\r\nthese people: a man may stay a little while with them, but he won't\r\nremain long with them.' I required an additional man servant at the time\r\nand so I took him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA month later Mademoiselle Yvette Samoris died mysteriously, and here\r\nare all the details of her death I could gather from Joseph, who got\r\nthem from his sweetheart, the comtesse's chambermaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a ball night, and two newly arrived guests were chatting behind\r\na door. Mademoiselle Yvette, who had just been dancing, leaned against\r\nthis door to get a little air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey did not see her approaching, but she heard what they were saying.\r\nAnd this was what they said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'But who is the father of the girl?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A Russian, it appears; Count Rouvaloff. He never comes near the mother\r\nnow.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And who is the reigning prince to-day?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That English prince standing near the window; Madame Samoris adores\r\nhim. But her adoration of any one never lasts longer than a month or six\r\nweeks. Nevertheless, as you see, she has a large circle of admirers. All\r\nare called\xe2\x80\x94and nearly all are chosen. That kind of thing costs a good\r\ndeal, but\xe2\x80\x94hang it, what can you expect?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And where did she get this name of Samoris?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'From the only man perhaps that she ever loved\xe2\x80\x94a Jewish banker from\r\nBerlin who goes by the name of Samuel Morris.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Good. Thanks. Now that I know what kind of woman she is and have seen\r\nher, I'm off!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shock this was to the mind of a young girl endowed with all the\r\ninstincts of a virtuous woman! What despair overwhelmed that simple\r\nsoul! What mental tortures quenched her unbounded gaiety, her delightful\r\nlaughter, her exultant satisfaction with life! What a conflict took\r\nplace in that youthful heart up to the moment when the last guest had\r\nleft! Those were things that Joseph could not tell me. But, the same\r\nnight, Yvette abruptly entered her mother's room just as the comtesse\r\nwas getting into bed, sent out the lady's maid, who was close to the\r\ndoor, and, standing erect and pale and with great staring eyes, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Mamma, listen to what I heard a little while ago during the ball.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she repeated word for word the conversation just as I told it to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe comtesse was so stunned that she did not know what to say in reply\r\nat first. When she recovered her self-possession she denied everything\r\nand called God to witness that there was no truth in the story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young girl went away, distracted but not convinced. And she began\r\nto watch her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember distinctly the strange alteration that then took place in\r\nher. She became grave and melancholy. She would fix on us her great\r\nearnest eyes as if she wanted to read what was at the bottom of our\r\nhearts. We did not know what to think of her and used to imagine that\r\nshe was looking out for a husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening she overheard her mother talking to her admirer and later\r\nsaw them together, and her doubts were confirmed. She was heartbroken,\r\nand after telling her mother what she had seen, she said coldly, like a\r\nman of business laying down the terms of an agreement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Here is what I have determined to do, mamma: We will both go away to\r\nsome little town, or rather into the country. We will live there quietly\r\nas well as we can. Your jewelry alone may be called a fortune. If you\r\nwish to marry some honest man, so much the better; still better will it\r\nbe if I can find one. If you don't consent to do this, I will kill\r\nmyself.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time the comtesse ordered her daughter to go to bed and never to\r\nspeak again in this manner, so unbecoming in the mouth of a child toward\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYvette's answer to this was: 'I give you a month to reflect. If, at the\r\nend of that month, we have not changed our way of living, I will kill\r\nmyself, since there is no other honorable issue left to my life.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of a month the Comtesse Samoris had resumed her usual\r\nentertainments, as though nothing had occurred. One day, under the\r\npretext that she had a bad toothache, Yvette purchased a few drops of\r\nchloroform from a neighboring chemist. The next day she purchased more,\r\nand every time she went out she managed to procure small doses of the\r\nnarcotic. She filled a bottle with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne morning she was found in bed, lifeless and already quite cold, with\r\na cotton mask soaked in chloroform over her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer coffin was covered with flowers, the church was hung in white.\r\nThere was a large crowd at the funeral ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! well, if I had known\xe2\x80\x94but you never can know\xe2\x80\x94I would have married\r\nthat girl, for she was infernally pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what became of the mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! she shed a lot of tears over it. She has only begun to receive\r\nvisits again for the past week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what explanation is given of the girl's death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! they pretended that it was an accident caused by a new stove, the\r\nmechanism of which got out of order. As a good many such accidents have\r\noccurred, the thing seemed probable enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VENDETTA\r\n\r\nThe widow of Paolo Saverini lived alone with her son in a poor little\r\nhouse on the outskirts of Bonifacio. The town, built on an outjutting\r\npart of the mountain, in places even overhanging the sea, looks across\r\nthe straits, full of sandbanks, towards the southernmost coast of\r\nSardinia. Beneath it, on the other side and almost surrounding it, is a\r\ncleft in the cliff like an immense corridor which serves as a harbor,\r\nand along it the little Italian and Sardinian fishing boats come by a\r\ncircuitous route between precipitous cliffs as far as the first houses,\r\nand every two weeks the old, wheezy steamer which makes the trip to\r\nAjaccio.\r\n\r\nOn the white mountain the houses, massed together, makes an even whiter\r\nspot. They look like the nests of wild birds, clinging to this peak,\r\noverlooking this terrible passage, where vessels rarely venture. The\r\nwind, which blows uninterruptedly, has swept bare the forbidding coast;\r\nit drives through the narrow straits and lays waste both sides. The pale\r\nstreaks of foam, clinging to the black rocks, whose countless peaks rise\r\nup out of the water, look like bits of rag floating and drifting on the\r\nsurface of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe house of widow Saverini, clinging to the very edge of the precipice,\r\nlooks out, through its three windows, over this wild and desolate\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nShe lived there alone, with her son Antonia and their dog \xe2\x80\x9cSemillante,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\na big, thin beast, with a long rough coat, of the sheep-dog breed. The\r\nyoung man took her with him when out hunting.\r\n\r\nOne night, after some kind of a quarrel, Antoine Saverini was\r\ntreacherously stabbed by Nicolas Ravolati, who escaped the same evening\r\nto Sardinia.\r\n\r\nWhen the old mother received the body of her child, which the neighbors\r\nhad brought back to her, she did not cry, but she stayed there for a\r\nlong time motionless, watching him. Then, stretching her wrinkled hand\r\nover the body, she promised him a vendetta. She did not wish anybody\r\nnear her, and she shut herself up beside the body with the dog, which\r\nhowled continuously, standing at the foot of the bed, her head stretched\r\ntowards her master and her tail between her legs. She did not move any\r\nmore than did the mother, who, now leaning over the body with a blank\r\nstare, was weeping silently and watching it.\r\n\r\nThe young man, lying on his back, dressed in his jacket of coarse cloth,\r\ntorn at the chest, seemed to be asleep. But he had blood all over him;\r\non his shirt, which had been torn off in order to administer the first\r\naid; on his vest, on his trousers, on his face, on his hands. Clots of\r\nblood had hardened in his beard and in his hair.\r\n\r\nHis old mother began to talk to him. At the sound of this voice the dog\r\nquieted down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear, my boy, my little baby, you shall be avenged. Sleep, sleep;\r\nyou shall be avenged. Do you hear? It's your mother's promise! And she\r\nalways keeps her word, your mother does, you know she does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly she leaned over him, pressing her cold lips to his dead ones.\r\n\r\nThen Semillante began to howl again with a long, monotonous,\r\npenetrating, horrible howl.\r\n\r\nThe two of them, the woman and the dog, remained there until morning.\r\n\r\nAntoine Saverini was buried the next day and soon his name ceased to be\r\nmentioned in Bonifacio.\r\n\r\nHe had neither brothers nor cousins. No man was there to carry on the\r\nvendetta. His mother, the old woman, alone pondered over it.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the straits she saw, from morning until night, a\r\nlittle white speck on the coast. It was the little Sardinian village\r\nLongosardo, where Corsican criminals take refuge when they are too\r\nclosely pursued. They compose almost the entire population of this\r\nhamlet, opposite their native island, awaiting the time to return, to go\r\nback to the \xe2\x80\x9cmaquis.\xe2\x80\x9d She knew that Nicolas Ravolati had sought refuge\r\nin this village.\r\n\r\nAll alone, all day long, seated at her window, she was looking over\r\nthere and thinking of revenge. How could she do anything without\r\nhelp\xe2\x80\x94she, an invalid and so near death? But she had promised, she had\r\nsworn on the body. She could not forget, she could not wait. What could\r\nshe do? She no longer slept at night; she had neither rest nor peace of\r\nmind; she thought persistently. The dog, dozing at her feet, would\r\nsometimes lift her head and howl. Since her master's death she often\r\nhowled thus, as though she were calling him, as though her beast's soul,\r\ninconsolable too, had also retained a recollection that nothing could\r\nwipe out.\r\n\r\nOne night, as Semillante began to howl, the mother suddenly got hold of\r\nan idea, a savage, vindictive, fierce idea. She thought it over until\r\nmorning. Then, having arisen at daybreak she went to church. She prayed,\r\nprostrate on the floor, begging the Lord to help her, to support her, to\r\ngive to her poor, broken-down body the strength which she needed in\r\norder to avenge her son.\r\n\r\nShe returned home. In her yard she had an old barrel, which acted as a\r\ncistern. She turned it over, emptied it, made it fast to the ground with\r\nsticks and stones. Then she chained Semillante to this improvised kennel\r\nand went into the house.\r\n\r\nShe walked ceaselessly now, her eyes always fixed on the distant coast\r\nof Sardinia. He was over there, the murderer.\r\n\r\nAll day and all night the dog howled. In the morning the old woman\r\nbrought her some water in a bowl, but nothing more; no soup, no bread.\r\n\r\nAnother day went by. Semillante, exhausted, was sleeping. The following\r\nday her eyes were shining, her hair on end and she was pulling wildly at\r\nher chain.\r\n\r\nAll this day the old woman gave her nothing to eat. The beast, furious,\r\nwas barking hoarsely. Another night went by.\r\n\r\nThen, at daybreak, Mother Saverini asked a neighbor for some straw. She\r\ntook the old rags which had formerly been worn by her husband and\r\nstuffed them so as to make them look like a human body.\r\n\r\nHaving planted a stick in the ground, in front of Semillante's kennel,\r\nshe tied to it this dummy, which seemed to be standing up. Then she made\r\na head out of some old rags.\r\n\r\nThe dog, surprised, was watching this straw man, and was quiet, although\r\nfamished. Then the old woman went to the store and bought a piece of\r\nblack sausage. When she got home she started a fire in the yard, near\r\nthe kennel, and cooked the sausage. Semillante, frantic, was jumping\r\nabout, frothing at the mouth, her eyes fixed on the food, the odor of\r\nwhich went right to her stomach.\r\n\r\nThen the mother made of the smoking sausage a necktie for the dummy. She\r\ntied it very tight around the neck with string, and when she had\r\nfinished she untied the dog.\r\n\r\nWith one leap the beast jumped at the dummy's throat, and with her paws\r\non its shoulders she began to tear at it. She would fall back with a\r\npiece of food in her mouth, then would jump again, sinking her fangs\r\ninto the string, and snatching few pieces of meat she would fall back\r\nagain and once more spring forward. She was tearing up the face with her\r\nteeth and the whole neck was in tatters.\r\n\r\nThe old woman, motionless and silent, was watching eagerly. Then she\r\nchained the beast up again, made her fast for two more days and began\r\nthis strange performance again.\r\n\r\nFor three months she accustomed her to this battle, to this meal\r\nconquered by a fight. She no longer chained her up, but just pointed to\r\nthe dummy.\r\n\r\nShe had taught her to tear him up and to devour him without even leaving\r\nany traces in her throat.\r\n\r\nThen, as a reward, she would give her a piece of sausage.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw the man, Semillante would begin to tremble. Then she\r\nwould look up to her mistress, who, lifting her finger, would cry, \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin a shrill tone.\r\n\r\nWhen she thought that the proper time had come, the widow went to\r\nconfession and, one Sunday morning she partook of communion with an\r\necstatic fervor. Then, putting on men's clothes and looking like an old\r\ntramp, she struck a bargain with a Sardinian fisherman who carried her\r\nand her dog to the other side of the straits.\r\n\r\nIn a bag she had a large piece of sausage. Semillante had had nothing to\r\neat for two days. The old woman kept letting her smell the food and\r\nwhetting her appetite.\r\n\r\nThey got to Longosardo. The Corsican woman walked with a limp. She went\r\nto a baker's shop and asked for Nicolas Ravolati. He had taken up his\r\nold trade, that of carpenter. He was working alone at the back of his\r\nstore.\r\n\r\nThe old woman opened the door and called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Nicolas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned around. Then releasing her dog, she cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, go! Eat him up! eat him up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maddened animal sprang for his throat. The man stretched out his\r\narms, clasped the dog and rolled to the ground. For a few seconds he\r\nsquirmed, beating the ground with his feet. Then he stopped moving,\r\nwhile Semillante dug her fangs into his throat and tore it to ribbons.\r\nTwo neighbors, seated before their door, remembered perfectly having\r\nseen an old beggar come out with a thin, black dog which was eating\r\nsomething that its master was giving him.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall the old woman was at home again. She slept well that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY TWENTY-FIVE DAYS\r\n\r\nI had just taken possession of my room in the hotel, a narrow den\r\nbetween two papered partitions, through which I could hear every sound\r\nmade by my neighbors; and I was beginning to arrange my clothes and\r\nlinen in the wardrobe with a long mirror, when I opened the drawer which\r\nis in this piece of furniture. I immediately noticed a roll of paper.\r\nHaving opened it, I spread it out before me, and read this title:\r\n\r\nMy Twenty-five Days.\r\n\r\nIt was the diary of a guest at the watering place, of the last occupant\r\nof my room, and had been forgotten at the moment of departure.\r\n\r\nThese notes may be of some interest to sensible and healthy persons who\r\nnever leave their own homes. It is for their benefit that I transcribe\r\nthem without altering a letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCHATEL-GUYON, July 15th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the first glance it is not lively, this country. However, I am going\r\nto spend twenty-five days here, to have my liver and stomach treated,\r\nand to get thin. The twenty-five days of any one taking the baths are\r\nvery like the twenty-eight days of the reserves; they are all devoted to\r\nfatigue duty, severe fatigue duty. To-day I have done nothing as yet; I\r\nhave been getting settled. I have made the acquaintance of the locality\r\nand of the doctor. Chatel-Guyon consists of a stream in which flows\r\nyellow water, in the midst of several hillocks on which are a casino,\r\nsome houses, and some stone crosses. On the bank of the stream, at the\r\nend of the valley, may be seen a square building surrounded by a little\r\ngarden; this is the bathing establishment. Sad people wander around this\r\nbuilding\xe2\x80\x94the invalids. A great silence reigns in the walks shaded by\r\ntrees, for this is not a pleasure resort, but a true health resort; one\r\ntakes care of one's health as a business, and one gets well, so it\r\nseems.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who know affirm, even, that the mineral springs perform true\r\nmiracles here. However, no votive offering is hung around the cashier's\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom time to time a gentleman or a lady comes over to a kiosk with a\r\nslate roof, which shelters a woman of smiling and gentle aspect, and a\r\nspring boiling in a basin of cement: Not a word is exchanged between the\r\ninvalid and the female custodian of the healing water. She hands the\r\nnewcomer a little glass in which air bubbles sparkle in the transparent\r\nliquid. The guest drinks and goes off with a grave step to resume his\r\ninterrupted walk beneath the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo noise in the little park, no breath of air in the leaves; no voice\r\npasses through this silence. One ought to write at the entrance to this\r\ndistrict: 'No one laughs here; they take care of their health.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people who chat resemble mutes who merely open their mouths to\r\nsimulate sounds, so afraid are they that their voices might escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the hotel, the same silence. It is a big hotel, where you dine\r\nsolemnly with people of good position, who have nothing to say to each\r\nother. Their manners bespeak good breeding, and their faces reflect the\r\nconviction of a superiority of which it might be difficult for some to\r\ngive actual proofs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt two o'clock I made my way up to the Casino, a little wooden hut\r\nperched on a hillock, which one reaches by a goat path. But the view\r\nfrom that height is admirable. Chatel-Guyon is situated in a very narrow\r\nvalley, exactly between the plain and the mountain. I perceive, at the\r\nleft, the first great billows of the mountains of Auvergne, covered with\r\nwoods, and here and there big gray patches, hard masses of lava, for we\r\nare at the foot of the extinct volcanoes. At the right, through the\r\nnarrow cut of the valley, I discover a plain, infinite as the sea,\r\nsteeped in a bluish fog which lets one only dimly discern the villages,\r\nthe towns, the yellow fields of ripe grain, and the green squares of\r\nmeadowland shaded with apple trees. It is the Limagne, an immense level,\r\nalways enveloped in a light veil of vapor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe night has come. And now, after having dined alone, I write these\r\nlines beside my open window. I hear, over there, in front of me, the\r\nlittle orchestra of the Casino, which plays airs just as a foolish bird\r\nmight sing all alone in the desert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dog barks at intervals. This great calm does one good. Goodnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 16th.\xe2\x80\x94Nothing new. I have taken a bath and then a shower bath. I\r\nhave swallowed three glasses of water, and I have walked along the paths\r\nin the park, a quarter of an hour between each glass, then half an hour\r\nafter the last. I have begun my twenty-five days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 17th.\xe2\x80\x94Remarked two mysterious, pretty women who are taking their\r\nbaths and their meals after every one else has finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 18th.\xe2\x80\x94Nothing new.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 19th.\xe2\x80\x94Saw the two pretty women again. They have style and a little\r\nindescribable air which I like very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 20th.\xe2\x80\x94Long walk in a charming wooded valley, as far as the\r\nHermitage of Sans-Souci. This country is delightful, although sad; but\r\nso calm; so sweet, so green. One meets along the mountain roads long\r\nwagons loaded with hay, drawn by two cows at a slow pace or held back by\r\nthem in going down the slopes with a great effort of their heads, which\r\nare yoked together. A man with a big black hat on his head is driving\r\nthem with a slender stick, tipping them on the side or on the forehead;\r\nand often with a simple gesture, an energetic and serious gesture, he\r\nsuddenly halts them when the excessive load precipitates their journey\r\ndown the too rugged descents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe air is good to inhale in these valleys. And, if it is very warm,\r\nthe dust bears with it a light odor of vanilla and of the stable, for so\r\nmany cows pass over these routes that they leave reminders everywhere.\r\nAnd this odor is a perfume, when it would be a stench if it came from\r\nother animals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 21st.\xe2\x80\x94Excursion to the valley of the Enval. It is a narrow gorge\r\ninclosed by superb rocks at the very foot of the mountain. A stream\r\nflows amid the heaped-up boulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I reached the bottom of this ravine I heard women's voices, and I\r\nsoon perceived the two mysterious ladies of my hotel, who were chatting,\r\nseated on a stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe occasion appeared to me a good one, and I introduced myself without\r\nhesitation. My overtures were received without embarrassment. We walked\r\nback together to the hotel. And we talked about Paris. They knew, it\r\nseemed, many people whom I knew, too. Who can they be?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see them to-morrow. There is nothing more amusing than such\r\nmeetings as this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 22d.\xe2\x80\x94Day passed almost entirely with the two unknown ladies. They\r\nare very pretty, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x94one a brunette and the other a blonde. They\r\nsay they are widows. H'm?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offered to accompany them to Royat tomorrow, and they accepted my\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChatel-Guyon is less sad than I thought on my arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 23d.\xe2\x80\x94Day spent at Royat. Royat is a little patch of hotels at the\r\nbottom of a valley, at the gate of Clermont-Ferrand. A great many people\r\nthere. A large park full of life. Superb view of the Puyde-Dome, seen at\r\nthe end of a perspective of valleys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy fair companions are very popular, which is flattering to me. The man\r\nwho escorts a pretty woman always believes himself crowned with an\r\naureole; with much more reason, the man who is accompanied by one on\r\neach side of him. Nothing is so pleasant as to dine in a fashionable\r\nrestaurant with a female companion at whom everybody stares, and there\r\nis nothing better calculated to exalt a man in the estimation of his\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go to the Bois, in a trap drawn by a sorry nag, or to go out into\r\nthe boulevard escorted by a plain woman, are the two most humiliating\r\nthings that could happen to a sensitive heart that values the opinion of\r\nothers. Of all luxuries, woman is the rarest and the most distinguished;\r\nshe is the one that costs most and which we desire most; she is,\r\ntherefore the one that we should seek by preference to exhibit to the\r\njealous eyes of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo exhibit to the world a pretty woman leaning on your arm is to\r\nexcite, all at once, every kind of jealousy. It is as much as to say:\r\n'Look here! I am rich, since I possess this rare and costly object; I\r\nhave taste, since I have known how to discover this pearl; perhaps,\r\neven, I am loved by her, unless I am deceived by her, which would still\r\nprove that others also consider her charming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, what a disgrace it is to walk about town with an ugly woman!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how many humiliating things this gives people to understand!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, they assume she must be your wife, for how could it\r\nbe supposed that you would have an unattractive sweetheart? A true woman\r\nmay be ungraceful; but then, her ugliness implies a thousand\r\ndisagreeable things for you. One supposes you must be a notary or a\r\nmagistrate, as these two professions have a monopoly of grotesque and\r\nwell-dowered spouses. Now, is this not distressing to a man? And then,\r\nit seems to proclaim to the public that you have the odious courage, and\r\nare even under a legal obligation, to caress that ridiculous face and\r\nthat ill-shaped body, and that you will, without doubt, be shameless\r\nenough to make a mother of this by no means desirable being\xe2\x80\x94which is the\r\nvery height of the ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 24th.\xe2\x80\x94I never leave the side of the two unknown widows, whom I am\r\nbeginning to know quite well. This country is delightful and our hotel\r\nis excellent. Good season. The treatment is doing me an immense amount\r\nof good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 25th.\xe2\x80\x94Drive in a landau to the lake of Tazenat. An exquisite and\r\nunexpected jaunt decided on at luncheon. We started immediately on\r\nrising from table. After a long journey through the mountains we\r\nsuddenly perceived an admirable little lake, quite round, very blue,\r\nclear as glass, and situated at the bottom of an extinct crater. One\r\nside of this immense basin is barren, the other is wooded. In the midst\r\nof the trees is a small house where sleeps a good-natured, intellectual\r\nman, a sage who passes his days in this Virgilian region. He opens his\r\ndwelling for us. An idea comes into my head. I exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Supposing we bathe?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes,' they said, 'but costumes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Bah! we are in the wilderness.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we did bathe!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a poet, how I would describe this unforgettable vision of\r\nthose lissome young forms in the transparency of the water! The high,\r\nsloping sides shut in the lake, motionless, gleaming and round, as a\r\nsilver coin; the sun pours into it a flood of warm light; and along the\r\nrocks the fair forms move in the almost invisible water in which the\r\nswimmers seemed suspended. On the sand at the bottom of the lake one\r\ncould see their shadows as they moved along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 26th.\xe2\x80\x94Some persons seem to look with shocked and disapproving eyes\r\nat my rapid intimacy with the two fair widows. There are some people,\r\nthen, who imagine that life consists in being bored. Everything that\r\nappears to be amusing becomes immediately a breach of good breeding or\r\nmorality. For them duty has inflexible and mortally tedious rules.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would draw their attention, with all respect, to the fact that duty\r\nis not the same for Mormons, Arabs Zulus, Turks, Englishmen, and\r\nFrenchmen, and that there are very virtuous people among all these\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will cite a single example. As regards women, duty begins in England\r\nat nine years of age; in France at fifteen. As for me, I take a little\r\nof each people's notion of duty, and of the whole I make a result\r\ncomparable to the morality of good King Solomon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 27th.\xe2\x80\x94Good news. I have lost 620 grams in weight. Excellent, this\r\nwater of Chatel-Guyon! I am taking the widows to dine at Riom. A sad\r\ntown whose anagram constitutes it an objectionable neighbor to healing\r\nsprings: Riom, Mori.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 28th.\xe2\x80\x94Hello, how's this! My two widows have been visited by two\r\ngentlemen who came to look for them. Two widowers, without doubt. They\r\nare leaving this evening. They have written to me on fancy notepaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 29th.\xe2\x80\x94Alone! Long excursion on foot to the extinct crater of\r\nNachere. Splendid view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 30th.\xe2\x80\x94Nothing. I am taking the treatment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuly 31st.\xe2\x80\x94Ditto. Ditto. This pretty country is full of polluted\r\nstreams. I am drawing the notice of the municipality to the abominable\r\nsewer which poisons the road in front of the hotel. All the kitchen\r\nrefuse of the establishment is thrown into it. This is a good way to\r\nbreed cholera.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 1st.\xe2\x80\x94Nothing. The treatment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 2d.\xe2\x80\x94Admirable walk to Chateauneuf, a place of sojourn for\r\nrheumatic patients, where everybody is lame. Nothing can be queerer than\r\nthis population of cripples!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 3d.\xe2\x80\x94Nothing. The treatment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 4th.\xe2\x80\x94Ditto. Ditto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 5th.\xe2\x80\x94Ditto. Ditto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 6th.\xe2\x80\x94Despair! I have just weighed myself. I have gained 310\r\ngrams. But then?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 7th.\xe2\x80\x94Drove sixty-six kilometres in a carriage on the mountain. I\r\nwill not mention the name of the country through respect for its women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis excursion had been pointed out to me as a beautiful one, and one\r\nthat was rarely made. After four hours on the road, I arrived at a\r\nrather pretty village on the banks of a river in the midst of an\r\nadmirable wood of walnut trees. I had not yet seen a forest of walnut\r\ntrees of such dimensions in Auvergne. It constitutes, moreover, all the\r\nwealth of the district, for it is planted on the village common. This\r\ncommon was formerly only a hillside covered with brushwood. The\r\nauthorities had tried in vain to get it cultivated. There was scarcely\r\nenough pasture on it to feed a few sheep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day it is a superb wood, thanks to the women, and it has a curious\r\nname: it is called the Sins of the Cure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I must say that the women of the mountain districts have the\r\nreputation of being light, lighter than in the plain. A bachelor who\r\nmeets them owes them at least a kiss; and if he does not take more he is\r\nonly a blockhead. If we consider this fairly, this way of looking at the\r\nmatter is the only one that is logical and reasonable. As woman, whether\r\nshe be of the town or the country, has her natural mission to please\r\nman, man should always show her that she pleases him. If he abstains\r\nfrom every sort of demonstration, this means that he considers her ugly;\r\nit is almost an insult to her. If I were a woman, I would not receive, a\r\nsecond time, a man who failed to show me respect at our first meeting,\r\nfor I would consider that he had failed in appreciation of my beauty, my\r\ncharm, and my feminine qualities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the bachelors of the village X often proved to the women of the\r\ndistrict that they found them to their taste, and, as the cure was\r\nunable to prevent these demonstrations, as gallant as they were natural,\r\nhe resolved to utilize them for the benefit of the general prosperity.\r\nSo he imposed as a penance on every woman who had gone wrong that she\r\nshould plant a walnut tree on the common. And every night lanterns were\r\nseen moving about like will-o'-the-wisps on the hillock, for the erring\r\nones scarcely like to perform their penance in broad daylight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn two years there was no longer any room on the lands belonging to the\r\nvillage, and to-day they calculate that there are more than three\r\nthousand trees around the belfry which rings out the services amid their\r\nfoliage. These are the Sins of the Cure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince we have been seeking for so many ways of rewooding France, the\r\nAdministration of Forests might surely enter into some arrangement with\r\nthe clergy to employ a method so simple as that employed by this humble\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 7th.\xe2\x80\x94Treatment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAugust 8th.\xe2\x80\x94I am packing up my trunks and saying good-by to the\r\ncharming little district so calm and silent, to the green mountain, to\r\nthe quiet valleys, to the deserted Casino, from which you can see,\r\nalmost veiled by its light, bluish mist, the immense plain of the\r\nLimagne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall leave to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the manuscript stopped. I will add nothing to it, my impressions of\r\nthe country not having been exactly the same as those of my predecessor.\r\nFor I did not find the two widows!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE TERROR\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou say you cannot possibly understand it, and I believe you. You think\r\nI am losing my mind? Perhaps I am, but for other reasons than those you\r\nimagine, my dear friend.\r\n\r\nYes, I am going to be married, and will tell you what has led me to take\r\nthat step.\r\n\r\nI may add that I know very little of the girl who is going to become my\r\nwife to-morrow; I have only seen her four or five times. I know that\r\nthere is nothing unpleasing about her, and that is enough for my\r\npurpose. She is small, fair, and stout; so, of course, the day after to-\r\nmorrow I shall ardently wish for a tall, dark, thin woman.\r\n\r\nShe is not rich, and belongs to the middle classes. She is a girl such\r\nas you may find by the gross, well adapted for matrimony, without any\r\napparent faults, and with no particularly striking qualities. People say\r\nof her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMlle. Lajolle is a very nice girl,\xe2\x80\x9d and tomorrow they will say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\nvery nice woman Madame Raymon is.\xe2\x80\x9d She belongs, in a word, to that\r\nimmense number of girls whom one is glad to have for one's wife, till\r\nthe moment comes when one discovers that one happens to prefer all other\r\nwomen to that particular woman whom one has married.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d you will say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat on earth did you get married for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hardly like to tell you the strange and seemingly improbable reason\r\nthat urged me on to this senseless act; the fact, however, is that I am\r\nafraid of being alone.\r\n\r\nI don't know how to tell you or to make you understand me, but my state\r\nof mind is so wretched that you will pity me and despise me.\r\n\r\nI do not want to be alone any longer at night. I want to feel that there\r\nis some one close to me, touching me, a being who can speak and say\r\nsomething, no matter what it be.\r\n\r\nI wish to be able to awaken somebody by my side, so that I may be able\r\nto ask some sudden question, a stupid question even, if I feel inclined,\r\nso that I may hear a human voice, and feel that there is some waking\r\nsoul close to me, some one whose reason is at work; so that when I\r\nhastily light the candle I may see some human face by my\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94because\xe2\x80\x94because \xe2\x80\x94I am ashamed to confess it\xe2\x80\x94because I am afraid of\r\nbeing alone.\r\n\r\nOh, you don't understand me yet.\r\n\r\nI am not afraid of any danger; if a man were to come into the room, I\r\nshould kill him without trembling. I am not afraid of ghosts, nor do I\r\nbelieve in the supernatural. I am not afraid of dead people, for I\r\nbelieve in the total annihilation of every being that disappears from\r\nthe face of this earth.\r\n\r\nWell\xe2\x80\x94yes, well, it must be told: I am afraid of myself, afraid of that\r\nhorrible sensation of incomprehensible fear.\r\n\r\nYou may laugh, if you like. It is terrible, and I cannot get over it. I\r\nam afraid of the walls, of the furniture, of the familiar objects; which\r\nare animated, as far as I am concerned, by a kind of animal life. Above\r\nall, I am afraid of my own dreadful thoughts, of my reason, which seems\r\nas if it were about to leave me, driven away by a mysterious and\r\ninvisible agony.\r\n\r\nAt first I feel a vague uneasiness in my mind, which causes a cold\r\nshiver to run all over me. I look round, and of course nothing is to be\r\nseen, and I wish that there were something there, no matter what, as\r\nlong as it were something tangible. I am frightened merely because I\r\ncannot understand my own terror.\r\n\r\nIf I speak, I am afraid of my own voice. If I walk, I am afraid of I\r\nknow not what, behind the door, behind the curtains, in the cupboard, or\r\nunder my bed, and yet all the time I know there is nothing anywhere, and\r\nI turn round suddenly because I am afraid of what is behind me, although\r\nthere is nothing there, and I know it.\r\n\r\nI become agitated. I feel that my fear increases, and so I shut myself\r\nup in my own room, get into bed, and hide under the clothes; and there,\r\ncowering down, rolled into a ball, I close my eyes in despair, and\r\nremain thus for an indefinite time, remembering that my candle is alight\r\non the table by my bedside, and that I ought to put it out, and yet\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndare not do it.\r\n\r\nIt is very terrible, is it not, to be like that?\r\n\r\nFormerly I felt nothing of all that. I came home quite calm, and went up\r\nand down my apartment without anything disturbing my peace of mind. Had\r\nany one told me that I should be attacked by a malady\xe2\x80\x94for I can call it\r\nnothing else\xe2\x80\x94of most improbable fear, such a stupid and terrible malady\r\nas it is, I should have laughed outright. I was certainly never afraid\r\nof opening the door in the dark. I went to bed slowly, without locking\r\nit, and never got up in the middle of the night to make sure that\r\neverything was firmly closed.\r\n\r\nIt began last year in a very strange manner on a damp autumn evening.\r\nWhen my servant had left the room, after I had dined, I asked myself\r\nwhat I was going to do. I walked up and down my room for some time,\r\nfeeling tired without any reason for it, unable to work, and even\r\nwithout energy to read. A fine rain was falling, and I felt unhappy, a\r\nprey to one of those fits of despondency, without any apparent cause,\r\nwhich make us feel inclined to cry, or to talk, no matter to whom, so as\r\nto shake off our depressing thoughts.\r\n\r\nI felt that I was alone, and my rooms seemed to me to be more empty than\r\nthey had ever been before. I was in the midst of infinite and\r\noverwhelming solitude. What was I to do? I sat down, but a kind of\r\nnervous impatience seemed to affect my legs, so I got up and began to\r\nwalk about again. I was, perhaps, rather feverish, for my hands, which I\r\nhad clasped behind me, as one often does when walking slowly, almost\r\nseemed to burn one another. Then suddenly a cold shiver ran down my\r\nback, and I thought the damp air might have penetrated into my rooms, so\r\nI lit the fire for the first time that year, and sat down again and\r\nlooked at the flames. But soon I felt that I could not possibly remain\r\nquiet, and so I got up again and determined to go out, to pull myself\r\ntogether, and to find a friend to bear me company.\r\n\r\nI could not find anyone, so I walked to the boulevard to try and meet\r\nsome acquaintance or other there.\r\n\r\nIt was wretched everywhere, and the wet pavement glistened in the\r\ngaslight, while the oppressive warmth of the almost impalpable rain lay\r\nheavily over the streets and seemed to obscure the light of the lamps.\r\n\r\nI went on slowly, saying to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not find a soul to talk\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI glanced into several cafes, from the Madeleine as far as the Faubourg\r\nPoissoniere, and saw many unhappy-looking individuals sitting at the\r\ntables who did not seem even to have enough energy left to finish the\r\nrefreshments they had ordered.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I wandered aimlessly up and down, and about midnight I\r\nstarted for home. I was very calm and very tired. My janitor opened the\r\ndoor at once, which was quite unusual for him, and I thought that\r\nanother lodger had probably just come in.\r\n\r\nWhen I go out I always double-lock the door of my room, and I found it\r\nmerely closed, which surprised me; but I supposed that some letters had\r\nbeen brought up for me in the course of the evening.\r\n\r\nI went in, and found my fire still burning so that it lighted up the\r\nroom a little, and, while in the act of taking up a candle, I noticed\r\nsomebody sitting in my armchair by the fire, warming his feet, with his\r\nback toward me.\r\n\r\nI was not in the slightest degree frightened. I thought, very naturally,\r\nthat some friend or other had come to see me. No doubt the porter, to\r\nwhom I had said I was going out, had lent him his own key. In a moment I\r\nremembered all the circumstances of my return, how the street door had\r\nbeen opened immediately, and that my own door was only latched and not\r\nlocked.\r\n\r\nI could see nothing of my friend but his head, and he had evidently gone\r\nto sleep while waiting for me, so I went up to him to rouse him. I saw\r\nhim quite distinctly; his right arm was hanging down and his legs were\r\ncrossed; the position of his head, which was somewhat inclined to the\r\nleft of the armchair, seemed to indicate that he was asleep. \xe2\x80\x9cWho can it\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked myself. I could not see clearly, as the room was rather\r\ndark, so I put out my hand to touch him on the shoulder, and it came in\r\ncontact with the back of the chair. There was nobody there; the seat was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nI fairly jumped with fright. For a moment I drew back as if confronted\r\nby some terrible danger; then I turned round again, impelled by an\r\nimperious standing upright, panting with fear, so upset that I could not\r\ncollect my thoughts, and ready to faint.\r\n\r\nBut I am a cool man, and soon recovered myself. I thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a mere\r\nhallucination, that is all,\xe2\x80\x9d and I immediately began to reflect on this\r\nphenomenon. Thoughts fly quickly at such moments.\r\n\r\nI had been suffering from an hallucination, that was an incontestable\r\nfact. My mind had been perfectly lucid and had acted regularly and\r\nlogically, so there was nothing the matter with the brain. It was only\r\nmy eyes that had been deceived; they had had a vision, one of those\r\nvisions which lead simple folk to believe in miracles. It was a nervous\r\nseizure of the optical apparatus, nothing more; the eyes were rather\r\ncongested, perhaps.\r\n\r\nI lit my candle, and when I stooped down to the fire in doing so I\r\nnoticed that I was trembling, and I raised myself up with a jump, as if\r\nsomebody had touched me from behind.\r\n\r\nI was certainly not by any means calm.\r\n\r\nI walked up and down a little, and hummed a tune or two. Then I double-\r\nlocked the door and felt rather reassured; now, at any rate, nobody\r\ncould come in.\r\n\r\nI sat down again and thought over my adventure for a long time; then I\r\nwent to bed and blew out my light.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes all went well; I lay quietly on my back, but presently\r\nan irresistible desire seized me to look round the room, and I turned\r\nover on my side.\r\n\r\nMy fire was nearly out, and the few glowing embers threw a faint light\r\non the floor by the chair, where I fancied I saw the man sitting again.\r\n\r\nI quickly struck a match, but I had been mistaken; there was nothing\r\nthere. I got up, however, and hid the chair behind my bed, and tried to\r\nget to sleep, as the room was now dark; but I had not forgotten myself\r\nfor more than five minutes, when in my dream I saw all the scene which I\r\nhad previously witnessed as clearly as if it were reality. I woke up\r\nwith a start, and having lit the candle, sat up in bed, without\r\nventuring even to try to go to sleep again.\r\n\r\nTwice, however, sleep overcame me for a few moments in spite of myself,\r\nand twice I saw the same thing again, till I fancied I was going mad.\r\nWhen day broke, however, I thought that I was cured, and slept\r\npeacefully till noon.\r\n\r\nIt was all past and over. I had been feverish, had had the nightmare. I\r\nknow not what. I had been ill, in fact, but yet thought I was a great\r\nfool.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed myself thoroughly that evening. I dined at a restaurant and\r\nafterward went to the theatre, and then started for home. But as I got\r\nnear the house I was once more seized by a strange feeling of\r\nuneasiness. I was afraid of seeing him again. I was not afraid of him,\r\nnot afraid of his presence, in which I did not believe; but I was afraid\r\nof being deceived again. I was afraid of some fresh hallucination,\r\nafraid lest fear should take possession of me.\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour I wandered up and down the pavement; then, feeling\r\nthat I was really too foolish, I returned home. I breathed so hard that\r\nI could hardly get upstairs, and remained standing outside my door for\r\nmore than ten minutes; then suddenly I had a courageous impulse and my\r\nwill asserted itself. I inserted my key into the lock, and went into the\r\napartment with a candle in my hand. I kicked open my bedroom door, which\r\nwas partly open, and cast a frightened glance toward the fireplace.\r\nThere was nothing there. A-h! What a relief and what a delight! What a\r\ndeliverance! I walked up and down briskly and boldly, but I was not\r\naltogether reassured, and kept turning round with a jump; the very\r\nshadows in the corners disquieted me.\r\n\r\nI slept badly, and was constantly disturbed by imaginary noises, but did\r\nnot see him; no, that was all over.\r\n\r\nSince that time I have been afraid of being alone at night. I feel that\r\nthe spectre is there, close to me, around me; but it has not appeared to\r\nme again.\r\n\r\nAnd supposing it did, what would it matter, since I do not believe in\r\nit, and know that it is nothing?\r\n\r\nHowever, it still worries me, because I am constantly thinking of it.\r\nHis right arm hanging down and his head inclined to the left like a man\r\nwho was asleep\xe2\x80\x94I don't want to think about it!\r\n\r\nWhy, however, am I so persistently possessed with this idea? His feet\r\nwere close to the fire!\r\n\r\nHe haunts me; it is very stupid, but who and what is he? I know that he\r\ndoes not exist except in my cowardly imagination, in my fears, and in my\r\nagony. There\xe2\x80\x94enough of that!\r\n\r\nYes, it is all very well for me to reason with myself, to stiffen my\r\nbackbone, so to say; but I cannot remain at home because I know he is\r\nthere. I know I shall not see him again; he will not show himself again;\r\nthat is all over. But he is there, all the same, in my thoughts. He\r\nremains invisible, but that does not prevent his being there. He is\r\nbehind the doors, in the closed cupboard, in the wardrobe, under the\r\nbed, in every dark corner. If I open the door or the cupboard, if I take\r\nthe candle to look under the bed and throw a light on the dark places he\r\nis there no longer, but I feel that he is behind me. I turn round,\r\ncertain that I shall not see him, that I shall never see him again; but\r\nfor all that, he is behind me.\r\n\r\nIt is very stupid, it is dreadful; but what am I to do? I cannot help\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut if there were two of us in the place I feel certain that he would\r\nnot be there any longer, for he is there just because I am alone, simply\r\nand solely because I am alone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGEND OF MONT ST. MICHEL\r\n\r\nI had first seen it from Cancale, this fairy castle in the sea. I got an\r\nindistinct impression of it as of a gray shadow outlined against the\r\nmisty sky. I saw it again from Avranches at sunset. The immense stretch\r\nof sand was red, the horizon was red, the whole boundless bay was red.\r\nThe rocky castle rising out there in the distance like a weird,\r\nseignorial residence, like a dream palace, strange and beautiful-this\r\nalone remained black in the crimson light of the dying day.\r\n\r\nThe following morning at dawn I went toward it across the sands, my eyes\r\nfastened on this, gigantic jewel, as big as a mountain, cut like a\r\ncameo, and as dainty as lace. The nearer I approached the greater my\r\nadmiration grew, for nothing in the world could be more wonderful or\r\nmore perfect.\r\n\r\nAs surprised as if I had discovered the habitation of a god, I wandered\r\nthrough those halls supported by frail or massive columns, raising my\r\neyes in wonder to those spires which looked like rockets starting for\r\nthe sky, and to that marvellous assemblage of towers, of gargoyles, of\r\nslender and charming ornaments, a regular fireworks of stone, granite\r\nlace, a masterpiece of colossal and delicate architecture.\r\n\r\nAs I was looking up in ecstasy a Lower Normandy peasant came up to me\r\nand told me the story of the great quarrel between Saint Michael and the\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\nA sceptical genius has said: \xe2\x80\x9cGod made man in his image and man has\r\nreturned the compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis saying is an eternal truth, and it would be very curious to write\r\nthe history of the local divinity of every continent as well as the\r\nhistory of the patron saints in each one of our provinces. The negro has\r\nhis ferocious man-eating idols; the polygamous Mahometan fills his\r\nparadise with women; the Greeks, like a practical people, deified all\r\nthe passions.\r\n\r\nEvery village in France is under the influence of some protecting saint,\r\nmodelled according to the characteristics of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSaint Michael watches over Lower Normandy, Saint Michael, the radiant\r\nand victorious angel, the sword-carrier, the hero of Heaven, the\r\nvictorious, the conqueror of Satan.\r\n\r\nBut this is how the Lower Normandy peasant, cunning, deceitful and\r\ntricky, understands and tells of the struggle between the great saint\r\nand the devil.\r\n\r\nTo escape from the malice of his neighbor, the devil, Saint Michael\r\nbuilt himself, in the open ocean, this habitation worthy of an\r\narchangel; and only such a saint could build a residence of such\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\r\nBut as he still feared the approaches of the wicked one, he surrounded\r\nhis domains by quicksands, more treacherous even than the sea.\r\n\r\nThe devil lived in a humble cottage on the hill, but he owned all the\r\nsalt marshes, the rich lands where grow the finest crops, the wooded\r\nvalleys and all the fertile hills of the country, while the saint ruled\r\nonly over the sands. Therefore Satan was rich, whereas Saint Michael was\r\nas poor as a church mouse.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of fasting the saint grew tired of this state of\r\naffairs and began to think of some compromise with the devil, but the\r\nmatter was by no means easy, as Satan kept a good hold on his crops.\r\n\r\nHe thought the thing over for about six months; then one morning he\r\nwalked across to the shore. The demon was eating his soup in front of\r\nhis door when he saw the saint. He immediately rushed toward him, kissed\r\nthe hem of his sleeve, invited him in and offered him refreshments.\r\n\r\nSaint Michael drank a bowl of milk and then began: \xe2\x80\x9cI have come here to\r\npropose to you a good bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe devil, candid and trustful, answered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat will suit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is. Give me all your lands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSatan, growing alarmed, wished to speak \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe saint continued: \xe2\x80\x9cListen first. Give me all your lands. I will take\r\ncare of all the work, the ploughing, the sowing, the fertilizing,\r\neverything, and we will share the crops equally. How does that suit\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe devil, who was naturally lazy, accepted. He only demanded in\r\naddition a few of those delicious gray mullet which are caught around\r\nthe solitary mount. Saint Michael promised the fish.\r\n\r\nThey grasped hands and spat on the ground to show that it was a bargain,\r\nand the saint continued: \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, so that you will have nothing to\r\ncomplain of, choose that part of the crops which you prefer: the part\r\nthat grows above ground or the part that stays in the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d Satan\r\ncried out: \xe2\x80\x9cI will take all that will be above ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a bargain!\xe2\x80\x9d said the saint. And he went away.\r\n\r\nSix months later, all over the immense domain of the devil, one could\r\nsee nothing but carrots, turnips, onions, salsify, all the plants whose\r\njuicy roots are good and savory and whose useless leaves are good for\r\nnothing but for feeding animals.\r\n\r\nSatan wished to break the contract, calling Saint Michael a swindler.\r\n\r\nBut the saint, who had developed quite a taste for agriculture, went\r\nback to see the devil and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I hadn't thought of that at all; it was just an accident, no\r\nfault of mine. And to make things fair with you, this year I'll let you\r\ntake everything that is under the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Satan.\r\n\r\nThe following spring all the evil spirit's lands were covered with\r\ngolden wheat, oats as big as beans, flax, magnificent colza, red clover,\r\npeas, cabbage, artichokes, everything that develops into grains or fruit\r\nin the sunlight.\r\n\r\nOnce more Satan received nothing, and this time he completely lost his\r\ntemper. He took back his fields and remained deaf to all the fresh\r\npropositions of his neighbor.\r\n\r\nA whole year rolled by. From the top of his lonely manor Saint Michael\r\nlooked at the distant and fertile lands and watched the devil direct the\r\nwork, take in his crops and thresh the wheat. And he grew angry,\r\nexasperated at his powerlessness.\r\n\r\nAs he was no longer able to deceive Satan, he decided to wreak vengeance\r\non him, and he went out to invite him to dinner for the following\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been very unfortunate in your dealings with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow it, but I don't want any ill feeling between us, and I expect you\r\nto dine with me. I'll give you some good things to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSatan, who was as greedy as he was lazy, accepted eagerly. On the day\r\nappointed he donned his finest clothes and set out for the castle.\r\n\r\nSaint Michael sat him down to a magnificent meal. First there was a\r\n'vol-au-vent', full of cocks' crests and kidneys, with meat-balls, then\r\ntwo big gray mullet with cream sauce, a turkey stuffed with chestnuts\r\nsoaked in wine, some salt-marsh lamb as tender as cake, vegetables which\r\nmelted in the mouth and nice hot pancake which was brought on smoking\r\nand spreading a delicious odor of butter.\r\n\r\nThey drank new, sweet, sparkling cider and heady red wine, and after\r\neach course they whetted their appetites with some old apple brandy.\r\n\r\nThe devil drank and ate to his heart's content; in fact he took so much\r\nthat he was very uncomfortable, and began to retch.\r\n\r\nThen Saint Michael arose in anger and cried in a voice like thunder:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! before me, rascal! You dare\xe2\x80\x94before me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSatan, terrified, ran away, and the saint, seizing a stick, pursued him.\r\nThey ran through the halls, turning round the pillars, running up the\r\nstaircases, galloping along the cornices, jumping from gargoyle to\r\ngargoyle. The poor devil, who was woefully ill, was running about madly\r\nand trying hard to escape. At last he found himself at the top of the\r\nlast terrace, right at the top, from which could be seen the immense\r\nbay, with its distant towns, sands and pastures. He could no longer\r\nescape, and the saint came up behind him and gave him a furious kick,\r\nwhich shot him through space like a cannonball.\r\n\r\nHe shot through the air like a javelin and fell heavily before the town\r\nof Mortain. His horns and claws stuck deep into the rock, which keeps\r\nthrough eternity the traces of this fall of Satan.\r\n\r\nHe stood up again, limping, crippled until the end of time, and as he\r\nlooked at this fatal castle in the distance, standing out against the\r\nsetting sun, he understood well that he would always be vanquished in\r\nthis unequal struggle, and he went away limping, heading for distant\r\ncountries, leaving to his enemy his fields, his hills, his valleys and\r\nhis marshes.\r\n\r\nAnd this is how Saint Michael, the patron saint of Normandy, vanquished\r\nthe devil.\r\n\r\nAnother people would have dreamed of this battle in an entirely\r\ndifferent manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW YEAR'S GIFT\r\n\r\nJacques de Randal, having dined at home alone, told his valet he might\r\ngo out, and he sat down at his table to write some letters.\r\n\r\nHe ended every year in this manner, writing and dreaming. He reviewed\r\nthe events of his life since last New Year's Day, things that were now\r\nall over and dead; and, in proportion as the faces of his friends rose\r\nup before his eyes, he wrote them a few lines, a cordial New Year's\r\ngreeting on the first of January.\r\n\r\nSo he sat down, opened a drawer, took out of it a woman's photograph,\r\ngazed at it a few moments, and kissed it. Then, having laid it beside a\r\nsheet of notepaper, he began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR IRENE: You must by this time have received the little souvenir\r\nI sent you addressed to the maid. I have shut myself up this evening in\r\norder to tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pen here ceased to move. Jacques rose up and began walking up and\r\ndown the room.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten months he had had a sweetheart, not like the others, a\r\nwoman with whom one engages in a passing intrigue, of the theatrical\r\nworld or the demi-monde, but a woman whom he loved and won. He was no\r\nlonger a young man, although he was still comparatively young for a man,\r\nand he looked on life seriously in a positive and practical spirit.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he drew up the balance sheet of his passion, as he drew up\r\nevery year the balance sheet of friendships that were ended or freshly\r\ncontracted, of circumstances and persons that had entered into his life.\r\n\r\nHis first ardor of love having grown calmer, he asked himself with the\r\nprecision of a merchant making a calculation what was the state of his\r\nheart with regard to her, and he tried to form an idea of what it would\r\nbe in the future.\r\n\r\nHe found there a great and deep affection; made up of tenderness,\r\ngratitude and the thousand subtleties which give birth to long and\r\npowerful attachments.\r\n\r\nA ring at the bell made him start. He hesitated. Should he open the\r\ndoor? But he said to himself that one must always open the door on New\r\nYear's night, to admit the unknown who is passing by and knocks, no\r\nmatter who it may be.\r\n\r\nSo he took a wax candle, passed through the antechamber, drew back the\r\nbolts, turned the key, pulled the door back, and saw his sweetheart\r\nstanding pale as a corpse, leaning against the wall.\r\n\r\nHe stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe entered with the air of a woman who knew the house. As soon as she\r\nwas in the drawing-room, she sank down on the sofa, and, covering her\r\nface with her hands, began to weep bitterly.\r\n\r\nHe knelt down at her feet, and tried to remove her hands from her eyes,\r\nso that he might look at them, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIrene, Irene, what is the matter with you? I implore you to tell me\r\nwhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, amid her sobs, she murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can no longer live like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive like this? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I can no longer live like this. I have endured so much. He struck\r\nme this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was astonished, having never suspected that her husband could be\r\nbrutal. He was a man of the world, of the better class, a clubman, a\r\nlover of horses, a theatergoer and an expert swordsman; he was known,\r\ntalked about, appreciated everywhere, having very courteous manners, a\r\nvery mediocre intellect, an absence of education and of the real culture\r\nneeded in order to think like all well-bred people, and finally a\r\nrespect for conventionalities.\r\n\r\nHe appeared to devote himself to his wife, as a man ought to do in the\r\ncase of wealthy and well-bred people. He displayed enough of anxiety\r\nabout her wishes, her health, her dresses, and, beyond that, left her\r\nperfectly free.\r\n\r\nRandal, having become Irene's friend, had a right to the affectionate\r\nhand-clasp which every husband endowed with good manners owes to his\r\nwife's intimate acquaintance. Then, when Jacques, after having been for\r\nsome time the friend, became the lover, his relations with the husband\r\nwere more cordial, as is fitting.\r\n\r\nJacques had never dreamed that there were storms in this household, and\r\nhe was bewildered at this unexpected revelation.\r\n\r\nHe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did it happen? Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon she related a long story, the entire history of her life since\r\nthe day of her marriage, the first disagreement arising out of a mere\r\nnothing, then becoming accentuated at every new difference of opinion\r\nbetween two dissimilar dispositions.\r\n\r\nThen came quarrels, a complete separation, not apparent, but real; next,\r\nher husband showed himself aggressive, suspicious, violent. Now, he was\r\njealous, jealous of Jacques, and that very day, after a scene, he had\r\nstruck her.\r\n\r\nShe added with decision: \xe2\x80\x9cI will not go back to him. Do with me what you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJacques sat down opposite to her, their knees touching. He took her\r\nhands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear love, you are going to commit a gross, an irreparable folly. If\r\nyou want to leave your husband, put him in the wrong, so that your\r\nposition as a woman of the world may be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked, as she looked at him uneasily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, what do you advise me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go back home and to put up with your life there till the day when\r\nyou can obtain either a separation or a divorce, with the honors of\r\nwar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not this thing which you advise me to do a little cowardly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it is wise and sensible. You have a high position, a reputation to\r\nprotect, friends to preserve and relations to deal with. You must not\r\nlose all these through a mere caprice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose up, and said with violence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no! I cannot stand it any longer! It is at an end! it is at an\r\nend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, placing her two hands on her lover's shoulders, and looking him\r\nstraight in the face, she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally and truly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take care of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care of you? In my own house? Here? Why, you are mad. It would\r\nmean losing you forever; losing you beyond hope of recall! You are mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied, slowly and seriously, like a woman who feels the weight of\r\nher words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Jacques. He has forbidden me to see you again, and I will not\r\nplay this comedy of coming secretly to your house. You must either lose\r\nme or take me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Irene, in that case, obtain your divorce, and I will marry\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you will marry me in\xe2\x80\x94two years at the soonest. Yours is a patient\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here! Reflect! If you remain here he'll come to-morrow to take you\r\naway, seeing that he is your husband, seeing that he has right and law\r\non his side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not ask you to keep me in your own house, Jacques, but to take me\r\nanywhere you like. I thought you loved me enough to do that. I have made\r\na mistake. Good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round and went toward the door so quickly that he was only\r\nable to catch hold of her when she was outside the room:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Irene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe struggled, and would not listen to him. Her eyes were full of tears,\r\nand she stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone! let me alone! let me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made her sit down by force, and once more falling on his knees at her\r\nfeet, he now brought forward a number of arguments and counsels to make\r\nher understand the folly and terrible risk of her project. He omitted\r\nnothing which he deemed necessary to convince her, finding even in his\r\nvery affection for her incentives to persuasion.\r\n\r\nAs she remained silent and cold as ice, he begged of her, implored of\r\nher to listen to him, to trust him, to follow his advice.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished speaking, she only replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you disposed to let me go away now? Take away your hands, so that I\r\nmay rise to my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Irene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIrene\xe2\x80\x94is your resolution irrevocable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me only whether this resolution, this mad resolution of yours,\r\nwhich you will bitterly regret, is irrevocable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen stay. You know well that you are at home here. We shall go away\r\nto-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose to her feet in spite of him, and said in a hard tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It is too late. I do not want sacrifice; I do not want devotion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay! I have done what I ought to do; I have said what I ought to say.\r\nI have no further responsibility on your behalf. My conscience is at\r\npeace. Tell me what you want me to do, and I will obey.\xe2\x80\x9d'\r\n\r\nShe resumed her seat, looked at him for a long time, and then asked, in\r\na very calm voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, explain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain what? What do you wish me to explain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x94everything that you thought about before changing your mind.\r\nThen I will see what I ought to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought about nothing at all. I had to warn you that you were\r\ngoing to commit an act of folly. You persist; then I ask to share in\r\nthis act of folly, and I even insist on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not natural to change one's mind so quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, my dear love. It is not a question here of sacrifice or\r\ndevotion. On the day when I realized that I loved you, I said to myself\r\nwhat every lover ought to say to himself in the same case: 'The man who\r\nloves a woman, who makes an effort to win her, who gets her, and who\r\ntakes her, enters into a sacred contract with himself and with her. That\r\nis, of course, in dealing with a woman like you, not a woman with a\r\nfickle heart and easily impressed.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage which has a great social value, a great legal value, possesses\r\nin my eyes only a very slight moral value, taking into account the\r\nconditions under which it generally takes place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, when a woman, united by this lawful bond, but having no\r\nattachment to her husband, whom she cannot love, a woman whose heart is\r\nfree, meets a man whom she cares for, and gives herself to him, when a\r\nman who has no other tie, takes a woman in this way, I say that they\r\npledge themselves toward each other by this mutual and free agreement\r\nmuch more than by the 'Yes' uttered in the presence of the mayor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that, if they are both honorable persons, their union must be\r\nmore intimate, more real, more wholesome, than if all the sacraments had\r\nconsecrated it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman risks everything. And it is exactly because she knows it,\r\nbecause she gives everything, her heart, her body, her soul, her honor,\r\nher life, because she has foreseen all miseries, all dangers all\r\ncatastrophes, because she dares to do a bold act, an intrepid act,\r\nbecause she is prepared, determined to brave everything\xe2\x80\x94her husband, who\r\nmight kill her, and society, which may cast her out. This is why she is\r\nworthy of respect in the midst of her conjugal infidelity; this is why\r\nher lover, in taking her, should also foresee everything, and prefer her\r\nto every one else whatever may happen. I have nothing more to say. I\r\nspoke in the beginning like a sensible man whose duty it was to warn\r\nyou; and now I am only a man\xe2\x80\x94a man who loves you\xe2\x80\x94Command, and I obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRadiant, she closed his mouth with a kiss, and said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not true, darling! There is nothing the matter! My husband does\r\nnot suspect anything. But I wanted to see, I wanted to know, what you\r\nwould do. I wished for a New Year's gift\xe2\x80\x94the gift of your heart\xe2\x80\x94another\r\ngift besides the necklace you sent me. You have given it to me. Thanks!\r\nthanks! God be thanked for the happiness you have given me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEND PATIENCE What became of Leremy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is captain in the Sixth Dragoons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Pinson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's a subprefect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Racollet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were searching for other names which would remind us of the youthful\r\nfaces of our younger days. Once in a while we had met some of these old\r\ncomrades, bearded, bald, married, fathers of several children, and the\r\nrealization of these changes had given us an unpleasant shudder,\r\nreminding us how short life is, how everything passes away, how\r\neverything changes. My friend asked me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Patience, fat Patience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI almost, howled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! as for him, just listen to this. Four or five years ago I was in\r\nLimoges, on a tour of inspection, and I was waiting for dinner time. I\r\nwas seated before the big cafe in the Place du Theatre, just bored to\r\ndeath. The tradespeople were coming by twos, threes or fours, to take\r\ntheir absinthe or vermouth, talking all the time of their own or other\r\npeople's business, laughing loudly, or lowering their voices in order to\r\nimpart some important or delicate piece of news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was saying to myself: 'What shall I do after dinner?' And I thought\r\nof the long evening in this provincial town, of the slow, dreary walk\r\nthrough unknown streets, of the impression of deadly gloom which these\r\nprovincial people produce on the lonely traveller, and of the whole\r\noppressive atmosphere of the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of all these things as I watched the little jets of gas\r\nflare up, feeling my loneliness increase with the falling shadows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA big, fat man sat down at the next table and called in a stentorian\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Waiter, my bitters!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe 'my' came out like the report of a cannon. I immediately understood\r\nthat everything was his in life, and not another's; that he had his\r\nnature, by Jove, his appetite, his trousers, his everything, his, more\r\nabsolutely and more completely than anyone else's. Then he looked round\r\nhim with a satisfied air. His bitters were brought, and he ordered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My newspaper!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wondered: 'Which newspaper can his be?' The title would certainly\r\nreveal to me his opinions, his theories, his principles, his hobbies,\r\nhis weaknesses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe waiter brought the Temps. I was surprised. Why the Temps, a\r\nserious, sombre, doctrinaire, impartial sheet? I thought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He must be a serious man with settled and regular habits; in short, a\r\ngood bourgeois.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe put on his gold-rimmed spectacles, leaned back before beginning to\r\nread, and once more glanced about him. He noticed me, and immediately\r\nbegan to stare at me in an annoying manner. I was even going to ask the\r\nreason for this attention, when he exclaimed from his seat:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, by all that's holy, if this isn't Gontran Lardois.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, monsieur, you are not mistaken.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he quickly rose and came toward me with hands outstretched:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, old man, how are you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I did not recognize him at all I was greatly embarrassed. I\r\nstammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why-very well-and-you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began to laugh \xe2\x80\x9c'I bet you don't recognize me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, not exactly. It seems\xe2\x80\x94however\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe slapped me on the back:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come on, no joking! I am Patience, Robert Patience, your friend, your\r\nchum.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recognized him. Yes, Robert Patience, my old college chum. It was he.\r\nI took his outstretched hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And how are you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Fine!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis smile was like a paean of victory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What are you doing here?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI explained that I was government inspector of taxes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe continued, pointing to my red ribbon:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then you have-been a success?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Fairly so. And you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am doing well!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What are you doing?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I'm in business.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Making money?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Heaps. I'm very rich. But come around to lunch, to-morrow noon, 17 Rue\r\ndu Coq-qui-Chante; you will see my place.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed to hesitate a second, then continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Are you still the good sport that you used to be?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I\xe2\x80\x94I hope so.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Not married?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Good. And do you still love a good time and potatoes?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was beginning to find him hopelessly vulgar. Nevertheless, I answered\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And pretty girls?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Most assuredly.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began to laugh good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Good, good! Do you remember our first escapade, in Bordeaux, after\r\nthat dinner at Routie's? What a spree!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, indeed, remember that spree; and the recollection of it cheered\r\nme up. This called to mind other pranks. He would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Say, do you remember the time when we locked the proctor up in old man\r\nLatoque's cellar?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he laughed and banged the table with his fist, and then he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes-yes-yes-and do you remember the face of the geography teacher, M.\r\nMarin, the day we set off a firecracker in the globe, just as he was\r\nharanguing about the principal volcanoes of the earth?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen suddenly I asked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And you, are you married?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ten years, my boy, and I have four children, remarkable youngsters;\r\nbut you'll see them and their mother.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were talking rather loud; the people around us looked at us in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly my friend looked at his watch, a chronometer the size of a\r\npumpkin, and he cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Thunder! I'm sorry, but I'll have to leave you; I am never free at\r\nnight.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rose, took both my hands, shook them as though he were trying to\r\nwrench my arms from their sockets, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'So long, then; till to-morrow noon!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'So long!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spent the morning working in the office of the collector-general of\r\nthe Department. The chief wished me to stay to luncheon, but I told him\r\nthat I had an engagement with a friend. As he had to go out, he\r\naccompanied me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Can you tell me how I can find the Rue du Coq-qui-Chante?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, it's only five minutes' walk from here. As I have nothing special\r\nto do, I will take you there.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe started out and soon found ourselves there. It was a wide, fine-\r\nlooking street, on the outskirts of the town. I looked at the houses and\r\nI noticed No. 17. It was a large house with a garden behind it. The\r\nfacade, decorated with frescoes, in the Italian style, appeared to me as\r\nbeing in bad taste. There were goddesses holding vases, others swathed\r\nin clouds. Two stone cupids supported the number of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to the treasurer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Here is where I am going.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI held my hand out to him. He made a quick, strange gesture, said\r\nnothing and shook my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rang. A maid appeared. I asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Monsieur Patience, if you please?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Right here, sir. Is it to monsieur that you wish to speak?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hall was decorated with paintings from the brush of some local\r\nartist. Pauls and Virginias were kissing each other under palm trees\r\nbathed in a pink light. A hideous Oriental lantern was ranging from the\r\nceiling. Several doors were concealed by bright hangings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what struck me especially was the odor. It was a sickening and\r\nperfumed odor, reminding one of rice powder and the mouldy smell of a\r\ncellar. An indefinable odor in a heavy atmosphere as oppressive as that\r\nof public baths. I followed the maid up a marble stairway, covered with\r\na green, Oriental carpet, and was ushered into a sumptubus parlor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft alone, I looked about me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe room was richly furnished, but in the pretentious taste of a\r\nparvenu. Rather fine engravings of the last century represented women\r\nwith powdered hair dressed high surprised by gentlemen in interesting\r\npositions. Another lady, lying in a large bed, was teasing with her foot\r\na little dog, lost in the sheets. One drawing showed four feet, bodies\r\nconcealed behind a curtain. The large room, surrounded by soft couches,\r\nwas entirely impregnated with that enervating and insipid odor which I\r\nhad already noticed. There seemed to be something suspicious about the\r\nwalls, the hangings, the exaggerated luxury, everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI approached the window to look into the garden. It was very big,\r\nshady, beautiful. A wide path wound round a grass plot in the midst of\r\nwhich was a fountain, entered a shrubbery and came out farther away.\r\nAnd, suddenly, yonder, in the distance, between two clumps of bushes,\r\nthree women appeared. They were walking slowly, arm in arm, clad in\r\nlong, white tea-gowns covered with lace. Two were blondes and the other\r\nwas dark-haired. Almost immediately they disappeared again behind the\r\ntrees. I stood there entranced, delighted with this short and charming\r\napparition, which brought to my mind a whole world of poetry. They had\r\nscarcely allowed themselves to be seen, in just the proper light, in\r\nthat frame of foliage, in the midst of that mysterious, delightful park.\r\nIt seemed to me that I had suddenly seen before me the great ladies of\r\nthe last century, who were depicted in the engravings on the wall. And I\r\nbegan to think of the happy, joyous, witty and amorous times when\r\nmanners were so graceful and lips so approachable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA deep voice made me jump. Patience had come in, beaming, and held out\r\nhis hands to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked into my eyes with the sly look which one takes when divulging\r\nsecrets of love, and, with a Napoleonic gesture, he showed me his\r\nsumptuous parlor, his park, the three women, who had reappeared in the\r\nback of it, then, in a triumphant voice, where the note of pride was\r\nprominent, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And to think that I began with nothing\xe2\x80\x94my wife and my sister-in-law!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABANDONED\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really think you must be mad, my dear, to go for a country walk in\r\nsuch weather as this. You have had some very strange notions for the\r\nlast two months. You drag me to the seaside in spite of myself, when you\r\nhave never once had such a whim during all the forty-four years that we\r\nhave been married. You chose Fecamp, which is a very dull town, without\r\nconsulting me in the matter, and now you are seized with such a rage for\r\nwalking, you who hardly ever stir out on foot, that you want to take a\r\ncountry walk on the hottest day of the year. Ask d'Apreval to go with\r\nyou, as he is ready to gratify all your whims. As for me, I am going\r\nback to have a nap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cadour turned to her old friend and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come with me, Monsieur d'Apreval?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed with a smile, and with all the gallantry of former years:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go wherever you go,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, go and get a sunstroke,\xe2\x80\x9d Monsieur de Cadour said; and\r\nhe went back to the Hotel des Bains to lie down for an hour or two.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone, the old lady and her old companion set off,\r\nand she said to him in a low voice, squeezing his hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last! at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you that you are mad.\r\nThink of the risk you are running. If that man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Henri, do not say that man, when you are speaking of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cif our son guesses anything, if he has\r\nany suspicions, he will have you, he will have us both in his power. You\r\nhave got on without seeing him for the last forty years. What is the\r\nmatter with you to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had been going up the long street that leads from the sea to the\r\ntown, and now they turned to the right, to go to Etretat. The white road\r\nstretched in front of him, then under a blaze of brilliant sunshine, so\r\nthey went on slowly in the burning heat. She had taken her old friend's\r\narm, and was looking straight in front of her, with a fixed and haunted\r\ngaze, and at last she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you have not seen him again, either?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, do not let us begin that discussion again. I have a\r\nwife and children and you have a husband, so we both of us have much to\r\nfear from other people's opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply; she was thinking of her long past youth and of many\r\nsad things that had occurred. How well she recalled all the details of\r\ntheir early friendship, his smiles, the way he used to linger, in order\r\nto watch her until she was indoors. What happy days they were, the only\r\nreally delicious days she had ever enjoyed, and how quickly they were\r\nover!\r\n\r\nAnd then\xe2\x80\x94her discovery\xe2\x80\x94of the penalty she paid! What anguish!\r\n\r\nOf that journey to the South, that long journey, her sufferings, her\r\nconstant terror, that secluded life in the small, solitary house on the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean, at the bottom of a garden, which she did\r\nnot venture to leave. How well she remembered those long days which she\r\nspent lying under an orange tree, looking up at the round, red fruit,\r\namid the green leaves. How she used to long to go out, as far as the\r\nsea, whose fresh breezes came to her over the wall, and whose small\r\nwaves she could hear lapping on the beach. She dreamed of its immense\r\nblue expanse sparkling under the sun, with the white sails of the small\r\nvessels, and a mountain on the horizon. But she did not dare to go\r\noutside the gate. Suppose anybody had recognized her!\r\n\r\nAnd those days of waiting, those last days of misery and expectation!\r\nThe impending suffering, and then that terrible night! What misery she\r\nhad endured, and what a night it was! How she had groaned and screamed!\r\nShe could still see the pale face of her lover, who kissed her hand\r\nevery moment, and the clean-shaven face of the doctor and the nurse's\r\nwhite cap.\r\n\r\nAnd what she felt when she heard the child's feeble cries, that wail,\r\nthat first effort of a human's voice!\r\n\r\nAnd the next day! the next day! the only day of her life on which she\r\nhad seen and kissed her son; for, from that time, she had never even\r\ncaught a glimpse of him.\r\n\r\nAnd what a long, void existence hers had been since then, with the\r\nthought of that child always, always floating before her. She had never\r\nseen her son, that little creature that had been part of herself, even\r\nonce since then; they had taken him from her, carried him away, and had\r\nhidden him. All she knew was that he had been brought up by some\r\npeasants in Normandy, that he had become a peasant himself, had married\r\nwell, and that his father, whose name he did not know, had settled a\r\nhandsome sum of money on him.\r\n\r\nHow often during the last forty years had she wished to go and see him\r\nand to embrace him! She could not imagine to herself that he had grown!\r\nShe always thought of that small human atom which she had held in her\r\narms and pressed to her bosom for a day.\r\n\r\nHow often she had said to M. d'Apreval: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot bear it any longer; I\r\nmust go and see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had always stopped her and kept her from going. She would be\r\nunable to restrain and to master herself; their son would guess it and\r\ntake advantage of her, blackmail her; she would be lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he like?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. I have not seen him again, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible? To have a son and not to know him; to be afraid of him\r\nand to reject him as if he were a disgrace! It is horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went along the dusty road, overcome by the scorching sun, and\r\ncontinually ascending that interminable hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne might take it for a punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI have never had\r\nanother child, and I could no longer resist the longing to see him,\r\nwhich has possessed me for forty years. You men cannot understand that.\r\nYou must remember that I shall not live much longer, and suppose I\r\nshould never see him, never have seen him! . . . Is it possible? How\r\ncould I wait so long? I have thought about him every day since, and what\r\na terrible existence mine has been! I have never awakened, never, do you\r\nunderstand, without my first thoughts being of him, of my child. How is\r\nhe? Oh, how guilty I feel toward him! Ought one to fear what the world\r\nmay say in a case like this? I ought to have left everything to go after\r\nhim, to bring him up and to show my love for him. I should certainly\r\nhave been much happier, but I did not dare, I was a coward. How I have\r\nsuffered! Oh, how those poor, abandoned children must hate their\r\nmothers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly, for she was choked by her sobs. The whole valley\r\nwas deserted and silent in the dazzling light and the overwhelming heat,\r\nand only the grasshoppers uttered their shrill, continuous chirp among\r\nthe sparse yellow grass on both sides of the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down a little,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe allowed herself to be led to the side of the ditch and sank down\r\nwith her face in her hands. Her white hair, which hung in curls on both\r\nsides of her face, had become tangled. She wept, overcome by profound\r\ngrief, while he stood facing her, uneasy and not knowing what to say,\r\nand he merely murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, take courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and wiping her eyes, she began to walk again with\r\nthe uncertain step of an elderly woman.\r\n\r\nA little farther on the road passed beneath a clump of trees, which hid\r\na few houses, and they could distinguish the vibrating and regular blows\r\nof a blacksmith's hammer on the anvil; and presently they saw a wagon\r\nstanding on the right side of the road in front of a low cottage, and\r\ntwo men shoeing a horse under a shed.\r\n\r\nMonsieur d'Apreval went up to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Pierre Benedict's farm?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the road to the left, close to the inn, and then go straight on;\r\nit is the third house past Poret's. There is a small spruce fir close to\r\nthe gate; you cannot make a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned to the left. She was walking very slowly now, her legs\r\nthreatened to give way, and her heart was beating so violently that she\r\nfelt as if she should suffocate, while at every step she murmured, as if\r\nin prayer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Heaven! Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur d'Apreval, who was also nervous and rather pale, said to her\r\nsomewhat gruffly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you cannot manage to control your feelings, you will betray yourself\r\nat once. Do try and restrain yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cMy child! When I think that I am going to see\r\nmy child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were going along one of those narrow country lanes between\r\nfarmyards, that are concealed beneath a double row of beech trees at\r\neither side of the ditches, and suddenly they found themselves in front\r\nof a gate, beside which there was a young spruce fir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly and looked about her. The courtyard, which was\r\nplanted with apple trees, was large and extended as far as the small\r\nthatched dwelling house. On the opposite side were the stable, the barn,\r\nthe cow house and the poultry house, while the gig, the wagon and the\r\nmanure cart were under a slated outhouse. Four calves were grazing under\r\nthe shade of the trees and black hens were wandering all about the\r\nenclosure.\r\n\r\nAll was perfectly still; the house door was open, but nobody was to be\r\nseen, and so they went in, when immediately a large black dog came out\r\nof a barrel that was standing under a pear tree, and began to bark\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\nThere were four bee-hives on boards against the wall of the house.\r\n\r\nMonsieur d'Apreval stood outside and called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs anybody at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen a child appeared, a little girl of about ten, dressed in a chemise\r\nand a linen, petticoat, with dirty, bare legs and a timid and cunning\r\nlook. She remained standing in the doorway, as if to prevent any one\r\ngoing in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your father in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone after the cows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill she be back soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the lady, as if she feared that her companion might force\r\nher to return, said quickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not go without having seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will wait for him, my dear friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they turned away, they saw a peasant woman coming toward the house,\r\ncarrying two tin pails, which appeared to be heavy and which glistened\r\nbrightly in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nShe limped with her right leg, and in her brown knitted jacket, that was\r\nfaded by the sun and washed out by the rain, she looked like a poor,\r\nwretched, dirty servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d the child said.\r\n\r\nWhen she got close to the house, she looked at the strangers angrily and\r\nsuspiciously, and then she went in, as if she had not seen them. She\r\nlooked old and had a hard, yellow, wrinkled face, one of those wooden\r\nfaces that country people so often have.\r\n\r\nMonsieur d'Apreval called her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, madame, but we came in to know whether you could\r\nsell us two glasses of milk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was grumbling when she reappeared in the door, after putting down\r\nher pails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't sell milk,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very thirsty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand madame is very tired. Can we not\r\nget something to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant woman gave them an uneasy and cunning glance and then she\r\nmade up her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you are here, I will give you some,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going into the house,\r\nand almost immediately the child came out and brought two chairs, which\r\nshe placed under an apple tree, and then the mother, in turn, brought\r\nout two bowls of foaming milk, which she gave to the visitors. She did\r\nnot return to the house, however, but remained standing near them, as if\r\nto watch them and to find out for what purpose they had come there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have come from Fecamp?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Monsieur d'Apreval replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are staying at Fecamp for the\r\nsummer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, after a short silence, he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any fowls you could sell us every week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated for a moment and then replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I have. I suppose you want young ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What do you pay for them in the market?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD'Apreval, who had not the least idea, turned to his companion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you paying for poultry in Fecamp, my dear lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour francs and four francs fifty centimes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her eyes full of\r\ntears, while the farmer's wife, who was looking at her askance, asked in\r\nmuch surprise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the lady ill, as she is crying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to say, and replied with some hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94but she lost her watch as we came along, a very handsome watch,\r\nand that troubles her. If anybody should find it, please let us know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMother Benedict did not reply, as she thought it a very equivocal sort\r\nof answer, but suddenly she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, here is my husband!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was the only one who had seen him, as she was facing the gate.\r\nD'Apreval started and Madame de Cadour nearly fell as she turned round\r\nsuddenly on her chair.\r\n\r\nA man bent nearly double, and out of breath, stood there, ten-yards from\r\nthem, dragging a cow at the end of a rope. Without taking any notice of\r\nthe visitors, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it! What a brute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went past them and disappeared in the cow house.\r\n\r\nHer tears had dried quickly as she sat there startled, without a word\r\nand with the one thought in her mind, that this was her son, and\r\nD'Apreval, whom the same thought had struck very unpleasantly, said in\r\nan agitated voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this Monsieur Benedict?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you his name?\xe2\x80\x9d the wife asked, still rather suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blacksmith at the corner of the highroad,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and then\r\nthey were all silent, with their eyes fixed on the door of the cow\r\nhouse, which formed a sort of black hole in the wall of the building.\r\nNothing could be seen inside, but they heard a vague noise, movements\r\nand footsteps and the sound of hoofs, which were deadened by the straw\r\non the floor, and soon the man reappeared in the door, wiping his\r\nforehead, and came toward the house with long, slow strides. He passed\r\nthe strangers without seeming to notice them and said to his wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and draw me a jug of cider; I am very thirsty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went back into the house, while his wife went into the cellar\r\nand left the two Parisians alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, let us go, Henri,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Cadour said, nearly distracted\r\nwith grief, and so d'Apreval took her by the arm, helped her to rise,\r\nand sustaining her with all his strength, for he felt that she was\r\nnearly fainting, he led her out, after throwing five francs on one of\r\nthe chairs.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were outside the gate, she began to sob and said,\r\nshaking with grief:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! is that what you have made of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very pale and replied coldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did what I could. His farm is worth eighty thousand francs, and that\r\nis more than most of the sons of the middle classes have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey returned slowly, without speaking a word. She was still crying; the\r\ntears ran down her cheeks continually for a time, but by degrees they\r\nstopped, and they went back to Fecamp, where they found Monsieur de\r\nCadour waiting dinner for them. As soon as he saw them, he began to\r\nlaugh and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo my wife has had a sunstroke, and I am very glad of it. I really\r\nthink she has lost her head for some time past!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither of them replied, and when the husband asked them, rubbing his\r\nhands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope that, at least, you have had a pleasant walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur d'Apreval replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA delightful walk, I assure you; perfectly delightful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAISON TELLIER\r\n\r\nThey went there every evening about eleven o'clock, just as they would\r\ngo to the club. Six or eight of them; always the same set, not fast men,\r\nbut respectable tradesmen, and young men in government or some other\r\nemploy, and they would drink their Chartreuse, and laugh with the girls,\r\nor else talk seriously with Madame Tellier, whom everybody respected,\r\nand then they would go home at twelve o'clock! The younger men would\r\nsometimes stay later.\r\n\r\nIt was a small, comfortable house painted yellow, at the corner of a\r\nstreet behind Saint Etienne's Church, and from the windows one could see\r\nthe docks full of ships being unloaded, the big salt marsh, and, rising\r\nbeyond it, the Virgin's Hill with its old gray chapel.\r\n\r\nMadame Tellier, who came of a respectable family of peasant proprietors\r\nin the Department of the Eure, had taken up her profession, just as she\r\nwould have become a milliner or dressmaker. The prejudice which is so\r\nviolent and deeply rooted in large towns, does not exist in the country\r\nplaces in Normandy. The peasant says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a paying-business,\xe2\x80\x9d and he sends his daughter to keep an\r\nestablishment of this character just as he would send her to keep a\r\ngirls' school.\r\n\r\nShe had inherited the house from an old uncle, to whom it had belonged.\r\nMonsieur and Madame Tellier, who had formerly been innkeepers near\r\nYvetot, had immediately sold their house, as they thought that the\r\nbusiness at Fecamp was more profitable, and they arrived one fine\r\nmorning to assume the direction of the enterprise, which was declining\r\non account of the absence of the proprietors. They were good people\r\nenough in their way, and soon made themselves liked by their staff and\r\ntheir neighbors.\r\n\r\nMonsieur died of apoplexy two years later, for as the new place kept him\r\nin idleness and without any exercise, he had grown excessively stout,\r\nand his health had suffered. Since she had been a widow, all the\r\nfrequenters of the establishment made much of her; but people said that,\r\npersonally, she was quite virtuous, and even the girls in the house\r\ncould not discover anything against her. She was tall, stout and\r\naffable, and her complexion, which had become pale in the dimness of her\r\nhouse, the shutters of which were scarcely ever opened, shone as if it\r\nhad been varnished. She had a fringe of curly false hair, which gave her\r\na juvenile look, that contrasted strongly with the ripeness of her\r\nfigure. She was always smiling and cheerful, and was fond of a joke, but\r\nthere was a shade of reserve about her, which her occupation had not\r\nquite made her lose. Coarse words always shocked her, and when any young\r\nfellow who had been badly brought up called her establishment a hard\r\nname, she was angry and disgusted.\r\n\r\nIn a word, she had a refined mind, and although she treated her women as\r\nfriends, yet she very frequently used to say that \xe2\x80\x9cshe and they were not\r\nmade of the same stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes during the week she would hire a carriage and take some of her\r\ngirls into the country, where they used to enjoy themselves on the grass\r\nby the side of the little river. They were like a lot of girls let out\r\nfrom school, and would run races and play childish games. They had a\r\ncold dinner on the grass, and drank cider, and went home at night with a\r\ndelicious feeling of fatigue, and in the carriage they kissed Madame'\r\nTellier as their kind mother, who was full of goodness and complaisance.\r\n\r\nThe house had two entrances. At the corner there was a sort of tap-room,\r\nwhich sailors and the lower orders frequented at night, and she had two\r\ngirls whose special duty it was to wait on them with the assistance of\r\nFrederic, a short, light-haired, beardless fellow, as strong as a horse.\r\nThey set the half bottles of wine and the jugs of beer on the shaky\r\nmarble tables before the customers, and then urged the men to drink.\r\n\r\nThe three other girls\xe2\x80\x94there were only five of them\xe2\x80\x94formed a kind of\r\naristocracy, and they remained with the company on the first floor,\r\nunless they were wanted downstairs and there was nobody on the first\r\nfloor. The salon de Jupiter, where the tradesmen used to meet, was\r\npapered in blue, and embellished with a large drawing representing Leda\r\nand the swan. The room was reached by a winding staircase, through a\r\nnarrow door opening on the street, and above this door a lantern\r\ninclosed in wire, such as one still sees in some towns, at the foot of\r\nthe shrine of some saint, burned all night long.\r\n\r\nThe house, which was old and damp, smelled slightly of mildew. At times\r\nthere was an odor of eau de Cologne in the passages, or sometimes from a\r\nhalf-open door downstairs the noisy mirth of the common men sitting and\r\ndrinking rose to the first floor, much to the disgust of the gentlemen\r\nwho were there. Madame Tellier, who was on friendly terms with her\r\ncustomers, did not leave the room, and took much interest in what was\r\ngoing on in the town, and they regularly told her all the news. Her\r\nserious conversation was a change from the ceaseless chatter of the\r\nthree women; it was a rest from the obscene jokes of those stout\r\nindividuals who every evening indulged in the commonplace debauchery of\r\ndrinking a glass of liqueur in company with common women.\r\n\r\nThe names of the girls on the first floor were Fernande, Raphaele, and\r\nRosa, the Jade. As the staff was limited, madame had endeavored that\r\neach member of it should be a pattern, an epitome of the feminine type,\r\nso that every customer might find as nearly as possible the realization\r\nof his ideal. Fernande represented the handsome blonde; she was very\r\ntall, rather fat, and lazy; a country girl, who could not get rid of her\r\nfreckles, and whose short, light, almost colorless, tow-like hair, like\r\ncombed-out hemp, barely covered her head.\r\n\r\nRaphaele, who came from Marseilles, played the indispensable part of the\r\nhandsome Jewess, and was thin, with high cheekbones, which were covered\r\nwith rouge, and black hair covered with pomatum, which curled on her\r\nforehead. Her eyes would have been handsome, if the right one had not\r\nhad a speck in it. Her Roman nose came down over a square jaw, where two\r\nfalse upper teeth contrasted strangely with the bad color of the rest.\r\n\r\nRosa was a little roll of fat, nearly all body, with very short legs,\r\nand from morning till night she sang songs, which were alternately\r\nrisque or sentimental, in a harsh voice; told silly, interminable tales,\r\nand only stopped talking in order to eat, and left off eating in order\r\nto talk; she was never still, and was active as a squirrel, in spite of\r\nher embonpoint and her short legs; her laugh, which was a torrent of\r\nshrill cries, resounded here and there, ceaselessly, in a bedroom, in\r\nthe loft, in the cafe, everywhere, and all about nothing.\r\n\r\nThe two women on the ground floor, Lodise, who was nicknamed La Cocotte,\r\nand Flora, whom they called Balancoise, because she limped a little, the\r\nformer always dressed as the Goddess of Liberty, with a tri-colored\r\nsash, and the other as a Spanish woman, with a string of copper coins in\r\nher carroty hair, which jingled at every uneven step, looked like cooks\r\ndressed up for the carnival. They were like all other women of the lower\r\norders, neither uglier nor better looking than they usually are.\r\n\r\nThey looked just like servants at an inn, and were generally called \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ntwo pumps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA jealous peace, which was, however, very rarely disturbed, reigned\r\namong these five women, thanks to Madame Tellier's conciliatory wisdom,\r\nand to her constant good humor, and the establishment, which was the\r\nonly one of the kind in the little town, was very much frequented.\r\nMadame Tellier had succeeded in giving it such a respectable appearance,\r\nshe was so amiable and obliging to everybody, her good heart was so well\r\nknown, that she was treated with a certain amount of consideration. The\r\nregular customers spent money on her, and were delighted when she was\r\nespecially friendly toward them, and when they met during the day, they\r\nwould say: \xe2\x80\x9cUntil this evening, you know where,\xe2\x80\x9d just as men say: \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nthe club, after dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d In a word, Madame Tellier's house was somewhere\r\nto go to, and they very rarely missed their daily meetings there.\r\n\r\nOne evening toward the end of May, the first arrival, Monsieur Poulin,\r\nwho was a timber merchant, and had been mayor, found the door shut. The\r\nlantern behind the grating was not alight; there was not a sound in the\r\nhouse; everything seemed dead. He knocked, gently at first, but then\r\nmore loudly, but nobody answered the door. Then he went slowly up the\r\nstreet, and when he got to the market place he met Monsieur Duvert, the\r\ngunmaker, who was going to the same place, so they went back together,\r\nbut did not meet with any better success. But suddenly they heard a loud\r\nnoise, close to them, and on going round the house, they saw a number of\r\nEnglish and French sailors, who were hammering at the closed shutters of\r\nthe taproom with their fists.\r\n\r\nThe two tradesmen immediately made their escape, but a low \xe2\x80\x9cPst!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nstopped them; it was Monsieur Tournevau, the fish curer, who had\r\nrecognized them, and was trying to attract their attention. They told\r\nhim what had happened, and he was all the more annoyed, as he was a\r\nmarried man and father of a family, and only went on Saturdays. That was\r\nhis regular evening, and now he should be deprived of this dissipation\r\nfor the whole week.\r\n\r\nThe three men went as far as the quay together, and on the way they met\r\nyoung Monsieur Philippe, the banker's son, who frequented the place\r\nregularly, and Monsieur Pinipesse, the collector, and they all returned\r\nto the Rue aux Juifs together, to make a last attempt. But the\r\nexasperated sailors were besieging the house, throwing stones at the\r\nshutters, and shouting, and the five first-floor customers went away as\r\nquickly as possible, and walked aimlessly about the streets.\r\n\r\nPresently they met Monsieur Dupuis, the insurance agent, and then\r\nMonsieur Vasse, the Judge of the Tribunal of Commerce, and they took a\r\nlong walk, going to the pier first of all, where they sat down in a row\r\non the granite parapet and watched the rising tide, and when the\r\npromenaders had sat there for some time, Monsieur Tournevau said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not very amusing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly not,\xe2\x80\x9d Monsieur Pinipesse replied, and they started off to\r\nwalk again.\r\n\r\nAfter going through the street alongside the hill, they returned over\r\nthe wooden bridge which crosses the Retenue, passed close to the\r\nrailway, and came out again on the market place, when, suddenly, a\r\nquarrel arose between Monsieur Pinipesse, the collector, and Monsieur\r\nTournevau about an edible mushroom which one of them declared he had\r\nfound in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAs they were out of temper already from having nothing to do, they would\r\nvery probably have come to blows, if the others had not interfered.\r\nMonsieur Pinipesse went off furious, and soon another altercation arose\r\nbetween the ex-mayor, Monsieur Poulin, and Monsieur Dupuis, the\r\ninsurance agent, on the subject of the tax collector's salary and the\r\nprofits which he might make. Insulting remarks were freely passing\r\nbetween them, when a torrent of formidable cries was heard, and the body\r\nof sailors, who were tired of waiting so long outside a closed house,\r\ncame into the square. They were walking arm in arm, two and two, and\r\nformed a long procession, and were shouting furiously. The townsmen hid\r\nthemselves in a doorway, and the yelling crew disappeared in the\r\ndirection of the abbey. For a long time they still heard the noise,\r\nwhich diminished like a storm in the distance, and then silence was\r\nrestored. Monsieur Poulin and Monsieur Dupuis, who were angry with each\r\nother, went in different directions, without wishing each other good-by.\r\n\r\nThe other four set off again, and instinctively went in the direction of\r\nMadame Tellier's establishment, which was still closed, silent,\r\nimpenetrable. A quiet, but obstinate drunken man was knocking at the\r\ndoor of the lower room, antd then stopped and called Frederic, in a low\r\nvoice, but finding that he got no answer, he sat down on the doorstep,\r\nand waited the course of events.\r\n\r\nThe others were just going to retire, when the noisy band of sailors\r\nreappeared at the end of the street. The French sailors were shouting\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cMarseillaise,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Englishmen \xe2\x80\x9cRule Britannia.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a\r\ngeneral lurching against the wall, and then the drunken fellows went on\r\ntheir way toward the quay, where a fight broke out between the two\r\nnations, in the course of which an Englishman had his arm broken and a\r\nFrenchman his nose split.\r\n\r\nThe drunken man who had waited outside the door, was crying by that\r\ntime, as drunken men and children cry when they are vexed, and the\r\nothers went away. By degrees, calm was restored in the noisy town; here\r\nand there, at moments, the distant sound of voices could be heard, and\r\nthen died away in the distance.\r\n\r\nOne man only was still wandering about, Monsieur Tournevau, the fish\r\ncurer, who was annoyed at having to wait until the following Saturday,\r\nand he hoped something would turn up, he did not know what; but he was\r\nexasperated at the police for thus allowing an establishment of such\r\npublic utility, which they had under their control, to be closed.\r\n\r\nHe went back to it and examined the walls, trying to find out some\r\nreason, and on the shutter he saw a notice stuck up. He struck a wax\r\nmatch and read the following, in a large, uneven hand: \xe2\x80\x9cClosed on\r\naccount of the Confirmation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went away, as he saw it was useless to remain, and left the\r\ndrunken man lying on the pavement fast asleep, outside that inhospitable\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe next day, all the regular customers, one after the other, found some\r\nreason for going through the street, with a bundle of papers under their\r\narm to keep them in countenance, and with a furtive glance they all read\r\nthat mysterious notice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClosed on account of the Confirmation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nMadame Tellier had a brother, who was a carpenter in their native place,\r\nVirville, in the Department of Eure. When she still kept the inn at\r\nYvetot, she had stood godmother to that brother's daughter, who had\r\nreceived the name of Constance\xe2\x80\x94Constance Rivet; she herself being a\r\nRivet on her father's side. The carpenter, who knew that his sister was\r\nin a good position, did not lose sight of her, although they did not\r\nmeet often, for they were both kept at home by their occupations, and\r\nlived a long way from each other. But as the girl was twelve years old,\r\nand going to be confirmed, he seized that opportunity to write to his\r\nsister, asking her to come and be present at the ceremony. Their old\r\nparents were dead, and as she could not well refuse her goddaughter, she\r\naccepted the invitation. Her brother, whose name was Joseph, hoped that\r\nby dint of showing his sister attention, she might be induced to make\r\nher will in the girl's favor, as she had no children of her own.\r\n\r\nHis sister's occupation did not trouble his scruples in the least, and,\r\nbesides, nobody knew anything about it at Virville. When they spoke of\r\nher, they only said: \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Tellier is living at Fecamp,\xe2\x80\x9d which might\r\nmean that she was living on her own private income. It was quite twenty\r\nleagues from Fecamp to Virville, and for a peasant, twenty leagues on\r\nland is as long a journey as crossing the ocean would be to city people.\r\nThe people at Virville had never been further than Rouen, and nothing\r\nattracted the people from Fecamp to a village of five hundred houses in\r\nthe middle of a plain, and situated in another department; at any rate,\r\nnothing was known about her business.\r\n\r\nBut the Confirmation was coming on, and Madame Tellier was in great\r\nembarrassment. She had no substitute, and did not at all care to leave\r\nher house, even for a day; for all the rivalries between the girls\r\nupstairs and those downstairs would infallibly break out. No doubt\r\nFrederic would get drunk, and when he was in that state, he would knock\r\nanybody down for a mere word. At last, however, she made up her mind to\r\ntake them all with her, with the exception of the man, to whom she gave\r\na holiday until the next day but one.\r\n\r\nWhen she asked her brother, he made no objection, but undertook to put\r\nthem all up for a night, and so on Saturday morning the eight-o'clock\r\nexpress carried off Madame Tellier and her companions in a second-class\r\ncarriage. As far as Beuzeville they were alone, and chattered like\r\nmagpies, but at that station a couple got in. The man, an old peasant,\r\ndressed in a blue blouse with a turned-down collar, wide sleeves tight\r\nat the wrist, ornamented with white embroidery, wearing an old high hat\r\nwith long nap, held an enormous green umbrella in one hand, and a large\r\nbasket in the other, from which the heads of three frightened ducks\r\nprotruded. The woman, who sat up stiffly in her rustic finery, had a\r\nface like a fowl, with a nose that was as pointed as a bill. She sat\r\ndown opposite her husband and did not stir, as she was startled at\r\nfinding herself in such smart company.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly an array of striking colors in the carriage. Madame\r\nTellier was dressed in blue silk from head to foot, and had on a\r\ndazzling red imitation French cashmere shawl. Fernande was puffing in a\r\nScotch plaid dress, of which her companions had laced the bodice as\r\ntight as they could, forcing up her full bust, that was continually\r\nheaving up and down. Raphaele, with a bonnet covered with feathers, so\r\nthat it looked like a bird's nest, had on a lilac dress with gold spots\r\non it, and there was something Oriental about it that suited her Jewish\r\nface. Rosa had on a pink skirt with largo flounces, and looked like a\r\nvery fat child, an obese dwarf; while the two Pumps looked as if they\r\nhad cut their dresses out of old flowered curtains dating from the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were no longer alone in the compartment, the ladies put\r\non staid looks, and began to talk of subjects which might give others a\r\nhigh opinion of them. But at Bolbeck a gentleman with light whiskers, a\r\ngold chain, and wearing two or three rings, got in, and put several\r\nparcels wrapped in oilcloth on the rack over his head. He looked\r\ninclined for a joke, and seemed a good-hearted fellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ladies changing your quarters?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and that question\r\nembarrassed them all considerably. Madame Tellier, however, quickly\r\nregained her composure, and said sharply, to avenge the honor of her\r\ncorps:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you might try and be polite!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe excused himself, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, I ought to have said\r\nyour nunnery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not think of a retort, so, perhaps thinking she had said\r\nenough, madame gave him a dignified bow and compressed her lips.\r\n\r\nThen the gentleman, who was sitting between Rosa and the old peasant,\r\nbegan to wink knowingly at the ducks whose heads were sticking out of\r\nthe basket, and when he felt that he had fixed the attention of his\r\npublic, he began to tickle them under the bills and spoke funnily to\r\nthem to make the company smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have left our little pond, quack! quack! to make the acquaintance of\r\nthe little spit, qu-ack! qu-ack!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate creatures turned their necks away, to avoid his\r\ncaresses, and made desperate efforts to get out of their wicker prison,\r\nand then, suddenly, all at once, uttered the most lamentable quacks of\r\ndistress. The women exploded with laughter. They leaned forward and\r\npushed each other, so as to see better; they were very much interested\r\nin the ducks, and the gentleman redoubled his airs, his wit and his\r\nteasing.\r\n\r\nRosa joined in, and leaning over her neighbor's legs, she kissed the\r\nthree animals on the head, and immediately all the girls wanted to kiss\r\nthem, in turn, and as they did so the gentleman took them on his knee,\r\njumped them up and down and pinched their arms. The two peasants, who\r\nwere even in greater consternation than their poultry, rolled their eyes\r\nas if they were possessed, without venturing to move, and their old\r\nwrinkled faces had not a smile, not a twitch.\r\n\r\nThen the gentleman, who was a commercial traveller, offered the ladies\r\nsuspenders by way of a joke, and taking up one of his packages, he\r\nopened it. It was a joke, for the parcel contained garters. There were\r\nblue silk, pink silk, red silk, violet silk, mauve silk garters, and the\r\nbuckles were made of two gilt metal cupids embracing each other. The\r\ngirls uttered exclamations of delight and looked at them with that\r\ngravity natural to all women when they are considering an article of\r\ndress. They consulted one another by their looks or in a whisper, and\r\nreplied in the same manner, and Madame Tellier was longingly handling a\r\npair of orange garters that were broader and more imposing looking than\r\nthe rest; really fit for the mistress of such an establishment.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman waited, for he had an idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my kittens,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must try them on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a torrent of exclamations, and they squeezed their petticoats\r\nbetween their legs, but he quietly waited his time and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if\r\nyou will not try them on I shall pack them up again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he added cunningly: \xe2\x80\x9cI offer any pair they like to those who will\r\ntry them on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they would not, and sat up very straight and looked dignified.\r\n\r\nBut the two Pumps looked so distressed that he renewed his offer to\r\nthem, and Flora, especially, visibly hesitated, and he insisted: \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nmy dear, a little courage! Just look at that lilac pair; it will suit\r\nyour dress admirably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat decided her, and pulling up her dress she showed a thick leg fit\r\nfor a milkmaid, in a badly fitting, coarse stocking. The commercial\r\ntraveller stooped down and fastened the garter. When he had done this,\r\nhe gave her the lilac pair and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWho next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! I!\xe2\x80\x9d they all shouted at once, and he began on Rosa, who uncovered a\r\nshapeless, round thing without any ankle, a regular \xe2\x80\x9csausage of a leg,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas Raphaele used to say.\r\n\r\nLastly, Madame Tellier herself put out her leg, a handsome, muscular\r\nNorman leg, and in his surprise and pleasure, the commercial traveller\r\ngallantly took off his hat to salute that master calf, like a true\r\nFrench cavalier.\r\n\r\nThe two peasants, who were speechless from surprise, glanced sideways\r\nout of the corner of one eye, and they looked so exactly like fowls that\r\nthe man with the light whiskers, when he sat up, said: \xe2\x80\x9cCo\xe2\x80\x94co\xe2\x80\x94ri\xe2\x80\x94co\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nunder their very noses, and that gave rise to another storm of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nThe old people got out at Motteville with their basket, their ducks and\r\ntheir umbrella, and they heard the woman say to her husband as they went\r\naway:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are no good and are off to that cursed place, Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe funny commercial traveller himself got out at Rouen, after behaving\r\nso coarsely that Madame Tellier was obliged sharply to put him in his\r\nright place, and she added, as a moral: \xe2\x80\x9cThis will teach us not to talk\r\nto the first comer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt Oissel they changed trains, and at a little station further on\r\nMonsieur Joseph Rivet was waiting for them with a large cart with a\r\nnumber of chairs in it, drawn by a white horse.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter politely kissed all the ladies and then helped them into\r\nhis conveyance.\r\n\r\nThree of them sat on three chairs at the back, Raphaele, Madame Tellier\r\nand her brother on the three chairs in front, while Rosa, who had no\r\nseat, settled herself as comfortably as she could on tall Fernande's\r\nknees, and then they set off.\r\n\r\nBut the horse's jerky trot shook the cart so terribly that the chairs\r\nbegan to dance and threw the travellers about, to the right and to the\r\nleft, as if they were dancing puppets, which made them scream and make\r\nhorrible grimaces.\r\n\r\nThey clung on to the sides of the vehicle, their bonnets fell on their\r\nbacks, over their faces and on their shoulders, and the white horse went\r\non stretching out his head and holding out his little hairless tail like\r\na rat's, with which he whisked his buttocks from time to time.\r\n\r\nJoseph Rivet, with one leg on the shafts and the other doubled under\r\nhim, held the reins with his elbows very high, and kept uttering a kind\r\nof clucking sound, which made the horse prick up its ears and go faster.\r\n\r\nThe green country extended on either side of the road, and here and\r\nthere the colza in flower presented a waving expanse of yellow, from\r\nwhich arose a strong, wholesome, sweet and penetrating odor, which the\r\nwind carried to some distance.\r\n\r\nThe cornflowers showed their little blue heads amid the rye, and the\r\nwomen wanted to pick them, but Monsieur Rivet refused to stop.\r\n\r\nThen, sometimes, a whole field appeared to be covered with blood, so\r\nthick were the poppies, and the cart, which looked as if it were filled\r\nwith flowers of more brilliant hue, jogged on through fields bright with\r\nwild flowers, and disappeared behind the trees of a farm, only to\r\nreappear and to go on again through the yellow or green standing crops,\r\nwhich were studded with red or blue.\r\n\r\nOne o'clock struck as they drove up to the carpenter's door. They were\r\ntired out and pale with hunger, as they had eaten nothing since they\r\nleft home. Madame Rivet ran out and made them alight, one after another,\r\nand kissed them as soon as they were on the ground, and she seemed as if\r\nshe would never tire of kissing her sister-in-law, whom she apparently\r\nwanted to monopolize. They had lunch in the workshop, which had been\r\ncleared out for the next day's dinner.\r\n\r\nThe capital omelet, followed by boiled chitterlings and washed down with\r\ngood hard cider, made them all feel comfortable.\r\n\r\nRivet had taken a glass so that he might drink with them, and his wife\r\ncooked, waited on them, brought in the dishes, took them out and asked\r\neach of them in a whisper whether they had everything they wanted. A\r\nnumber of boards standing against the walls and heaps of shavings that\r\nhad been swept into the corners gave out a smell of planed wood, a smell\r\nof a carpenter's shop, that resinous odor which penetrates to the lungs.\r\n\r\nThey wanted to see the little girl, but she had gone to church and would\r\nnot be back again until evening, so they all went out for a stroll in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nIt was a small village, through which the highroad passed. Ten or a\r\ndozen houses on either side of the single street were inhabited by the\r\nbutcher, the grocer, the carpenter, the innkeeper, the shoemaker and the\r\nbaker.\r\n\r\nThe church was at the end of the street and was surrounded by a small\r\nchurchyard, and four immense lime-trees, which stood just outside the\r\nporch, shaded it completely. It was built of flint, in no particular\r\nstyle, and had a slate-roofed steeple. When you got past it, you were\r\nagain in the open country, which was varied here and there by clumps of\r\ntrees which hid the homesteads.\r\n\r\nRivet had given his arm to his sister, out of politeness, although he\r\nwas in his working clothes, and was walking with her in a dignified\r\nmanner. His wife, who was overwhelmed by Raphaele's gold-striped dress,\r\nwalked between her and Fernande, and roly-poly Rosa was trotting behind\r\nwith Louise and Flora, the Seesaw, who was limping along, quite tired\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants came to their doors, the children left off playing, and\r\na window curtain would be raised, so as to show a muslin cap, while an\r\nold woman with a crutch, who was almost blind, crossed herself as if it\r\nwere a religious procession, and they all gazed for a long time at those\r\nhandsome ladies from town, who had come so far to be present at the\r\nconfirmation of Joseph Rivet's little girl, and the carpenter rose very\r\nmuch in the public estimation.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the church they heard some children singing. Little\r\nshrill voices were singing a hymn, but Madame Tellier would not let them\r\ngo in, for fear of disturbing the little cherubs.\r\n\r\nAfter the walk, during which Joseph Rivet enumerated the principal\r\nlanded proprietors, spoke about the yield of the land and the\r\nproductiveness of the cows and sheep, he took his tribe of women home\r\nand installed them in his house, and as it was very small, they had to\r\nput them into the rooms, two and two.\r\n\r\nJust for once Rivet would sleep in the workshop on the shavings; his\r\nwife was to share her bed with her sister-in-law, and Fernande and\r\nRaphaele were to sleep together in the next room. Louise and Flora were\r\nput into the kitchen, where they had a mattress on the floor, and Rosa\r\nhad a little dark cupboard to herself at the top of the stairs, close to\r\nthe loft, where the candidate for confirmation was to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen the little girl came in she was overwhelmed with kisses; all the\r\nwomen wished to caress her with that need of tender expansion, that\r\nhabit of professional affection which had made them kiss the ducks in\r\nthe railway carriage.\r\n\r\nThey each of them took her on their knees, stroked her soft, light hair\r\nand pressed her in their arms with vehement and spontaneous outbursts of\r\naffection, and the child, who was very good and religious, bore it all\r\npatiently.\r\n\r\nAs the day had been a fatiguing one for everybody, they all went to bed\r\nsoon after dinner. The whole village was wrapped in that perfect\r\nstillness of the country, which is almost like a religious silence, and\r\nthe girls, who were accustomed to the noisy evenings of their\r\nestablishment, felt rather impressed by the perfect repose of the\r\nsleeping village, and they shivered, not with cold, but with those\r\nlittle shivers of loneliness which come over uneasy and troubled hearts.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were in bed, two and two together, they clasped each\r\nother in their arms, as if to protect themselves against this feeling of\r\nthe calm and profound slumber of the earth. But Rosa, who was alone in\r\nher little dark cupboard, felt a vague and painful emotion come over\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe was tossing about in bed, unable to get to sleep, when she heard the\r\nfaint sobs of a crying child close to her head, through the partition.\r\nShe was frightened, and called out, and was answered by a weak voice,\r\nbroken by sobs. It was the little girl, who was always used to sleeping\r\nin her mother's room, and who was afraid in her small attic.\r\n\r\nRosa was delighted, got up softly so as not to awaken any one, and went\r\nand fetched the child. She took her into her warm bed, kissed her and\r\npressed her to her bosom, lavished exaggerated manifestations of\r\ntenderness on her, and at last grew calmer herself and went to sleep.\r\nAnd till morning the candidate for confirmation slept with her head on\r\nRosa's bosom.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock the little church bell, ringing the Angelus, woke the\r\nwomen, who usually slept the whole morning long.\r\n\r\nThe villagers were up already, and the women went busily from house to\r\nhouse, carefully bringing short, starched muslin dresses or very long\r\nwax tapers tied in the middle with a bow of silk fringed with gold, and\r\nwith dents in the wax for the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe sun was already high in the blue sky, which still had a rosy tint\r\ntoward the horizon, like a faint remaining trace of dawn. Families of\r\nfowls were walking about outside the houses, and here and there a black\r\ncock, with a glistening breast, raised his head, which was crowned by\r\nhis red comb, flapped his wings and uttered his shrill crow, which the\r\nother cocks repeated.\r\n\r\nVehicles of all sorts came from neighboring parishes, stopping at the\r\ndifferent houses, and tall Norman women dismounted, wearing dark\r\ndresses, with kerchiefs crossed over the bosom, fastened with silver\r\nbrooches a hundred years old.\r\n\r\nThe men had put on their blue smocks over their new frock-coats or over\r\ntheir old dress-coats of green-cloth, the two tails of which hung down\r\nbelow their blouses. When the horses were in the stable there was a\r\ndouble line of rustic conveyances along the road: carts, cabriolets,\r\ntilburies, wagonettes, traps of every shape and age, tipping forward on\r\ntheir shafts or else tipping backward with the shafts up in the air.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter's house was as busy as a bee-hive. The women, in dressing-\r\njackets and petticoats, with their thin, short hair, which looked faded\r\nand worn, hanging down their backs, were busy dressing the child, who\r\nwas standing quietly on a table, while Madame Tellier was directing the\r\nmovements of her battalion. They washed her, did her hair, dressed her,\r\nand with the help of a number of pins, they arranged the folds of her\r\ndress and took in the waist, which was too large.\r\n\r\nThen, when she was ready, she was told to sit down and not to move, and\r\nthe women hurried off to get ready themselves.\r\n\r\nThe church bell began to ring again, and its tinkle was lost in the air,\r\nlike a feeble voice which is soon drowned in space. The candidates came\r\nout of the houses and went toward the parochial building, which\r\ncontained the two schools and the mansion house, and which stood quite\r\nat one end of the village, while the church was situated at the other.\r\n\r\nThe parents, in their very best clothes, followed their children, with\r\nembarrassed looks, and those clumsy movements of a body bent by toil.\r\n\r\nThe little girls disappeared in a cloud of muslin, which looked like\r\nwhipped cream, while the lads, who looked like embryo waiters in a cafe\r\nand whose heads shone with pomatum, walked with their legs apart, so as\r\nnot to get any dust or dirt on their black trousers.\r\n\r\nIt was something for a family, to be proud of, when a large number of\r\nrelatives, who had come from a distance, surrounded the child, and the\r\ncarpenter's triumph was complete.\r\n\r\nMadame Tellier's regiment, with its leader at its head, followed\r\nConstance; her father gave his arm to his sister, her mother walked by\r\nthe side of Raphaele, Fernande with Rosa and Louise and Flora together,\r\nand thus they proceeded majestically through the village, like a\r\ngeneral's staff in full uniform, while the effect on the village was\r\nstartling.\r\n\r\nAt the school the girls ranged themselves under the Sister of Mercy and\r\nthe boys under the schoolmaster, and they started off, singing a hymn as\r\nthey went. The boys led the way, in two files, between the two rows of\r\nvehicles, from which the horses had been taken out, and the girls\r\nfollowed in the same order; and as all the people in the village had\r\ngiven the town ladies the precedence out of politeness, they came\r\nimmediately behind the girls, and lengthened the double line of the\r\nprocession still more, three on the right and three on the left, while\r\ntheir dresses were as striking as a display of fireworks.\r\n\r\nWhen they went into the church the congregation grew quite excited. They\r\npressed against each other, turned round and jostled one another in\r\norder to see, and some of the devout ones spoke almost aloud, for they\r\nwere so astonished at the sight of those ladies whose dresses were more\r\nelaborate than the priest's vestments.\r\n\r\nThe mayor offered them his pew, the first one on the right, close to the\r\nchoir, and Madame Tellier sat there with her sister-in-law, Fernande and\r\nRaphaele. Rosa, Louise and Flora occupied the second seat, in company\r\nwith the carpenter.\r\n\r\nThe choir was full of kneeling children, the girls on one side and the\r\nboys on the other, and the long wax tapers which they held looked like\r\nlances pointing in all directions, and three men were standing in front\r\nof the lectern, singing as loud as they could.\r\n\r\nThey prolonged the syllables of the sonorous Latin indefinitely, holding\r\non to \xe2\x80\x9cAmens\xe2\x80\x9d with interminable \xe2\x80\x9ca-a's,\xe2\x80\x9d which the reed stop of the\r\norgan sustained in a monotonous, long-drawn-out tone.\r\n\r\nA child's shrill voice took up the reply, and from time to time a priest\r\nsitting in a stall and wearing a biretta got up, muttered something and\r\nsat down again, while the three singers continued, their eyes fixed on\r\nthe big book of plain chant lying open before them on the outstretched\r\nwings of a wooden eagle.\r\n\r\nThen silence ensued and the service went on. Toward the close Rosa, with\r\nher head in both hands, suddenly thought of her mother, her village\r\nchurch and her first communion. She almost fancied that that day had\r\nreturned, when she was so small and was almost hidden in her white\r\ndress, and she began to cry.\r\n\r\nFirst of all she wept silently, and the tears dropped slowly from her\r\neyes, but her emotion in creased with her recollections, and she began\r\nto sob. She took out her pocket handkerchief, wiped her eyes and held it\r\nto her mouth, so as not to scream, but it was in vain. A sort of rattle\r\nescaped her throat, and she was answered by two other profound,\r\nheartbreaking sobs, for her two neighbors, Louise and Flora, who were\r\nkneeling near her, overcome by similar recollections, were sobbing by\r\nher side, amid a flood of tears; and as tears are contagious, Madame\r\nTellier soon in turn found that her eyes were wet, and on turning to her\r\nsister-in-law, she saw that all the occupants of her seat were also\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\nSoon, throughout the church, here and there, a wife, a mother, a sister,\r\nseized by the strange sympathy of poignant emotion, and affected at the\r\nsight of those handsome ladies on their knees, shaken with sobs was\r\nmoistening her cambric pocket handkerchief and pressing her beating\r\nheart with her left hand.\r\n\r\nJust as the sparks from an engine will set fire to dry grass, so the\r\ntears of Rosa and of her companions infected the whole congregation in a\r\nmoment. Men, women, old men and lads in new smocks were soon all\r\nsobbing, and something superhuman seemed to be hovering over their\r\nheads\xe2\x80\x94a spirit, the powerful breath of an invisible and all powerful\r\nBeing.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a species of madness seemed to pervade the church, the noise of\r\na crowd in a state of frenzy, a tempest of sobs and stifled cries. It\r\ncame like gusts of wind which blow the trees in a forest, and the\r\npriest, paralyzed by emotion, stammered out incoherent prayers, without\r\nfinding words, ardent prayers of the soul soaring to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe people behind him gradually grew calmer. The cantors, in all the\r\ndignity of their white surplices, went on in somewhat uncertain voices,\r\nand the reed stop itself seemed hoarse, as if the instrument had been\r\nweeping; the priest, however, raised his hand to command silence and\r\nwent and stood on the chancel steps, when everybody was silent at once.\r\n\r\nAfter a few remarks on what had just taken place, and which he\r\nattributed to a miracle, he continued, turning to the seats where the\r\ncarpenter's guests were sitting; \xe2\x80\x9cI especially thank you, my dear\r\nsisters, who have come from such a distance, and whose presence among\r\nus, whose evident faith and ardent piety have set such a salutary\r\nexample to all. You have edified my parish; your emotion has warmed all\r\nhearts; without you, this great day would not, perhaps, have had this\r\nreally divine character. It is sufficient, at times, that there should\r\nbe one chosen lamb, for the Lord to descend on His flock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice failed him again, from emotion, and he said no more, but\r\nconcluded the service.\r\n\r\nThey now left the church as quickly as possible; the children themselves\r\nwere restless and tired with such a prolonged tension of the mind. The\r\nparents left the church by degrees to see about dinner.\r\n\r\nThere was a crowd outside, a noisy crowd, a babel of loud voices, where\r\nthe shrill Norman accent was discernible. The villagers formed two\r\nranks, and when the children appeared, each family took possession of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nThe whole houseful of women caught hold of Constance, surrounded her and\r\nkissed her, and Rosa was especially demonstrative. At last she took hold\r\nof one hand, while Madame Tellier took the other, and Raphaele and\r\nFernande held up her long muslin skirt, so that it might not drag in the\r\ndust; Louise and Flora brought up the rear with Madame Rivet; and the\r\nchild, who was very silent and thoughtful, set off for home in the midst\r\nof this guard of honor.\r\n\r\nDinner was served in the workshop on long boards supported by trestles,\r\nand through the open door they could see all the enjoyment that was\r\ngoing on in the village. Everywhere they were feasting, and through\r\nevery window were to be seen tables surrounded by people in their Sunday\r\nbest, and a cheerful noise was heard in every house, while the men sat\r\nin their shirt-sleeves, drinking glass after glass of cider.\r\n\r\nIn the carpenter's house the gaiety maintained somewhat of an air of\r\nreserve, the consequence of the emotion of the girls in the morning, and\r\nRivet was the only one who was in a jolly mood, and he was drinking to\r\nexcess. Madame Tellier looked at the clock every moment, for, in order\r\nnot to lose two days running, they must take the 3:55 train, which would\r\nbring them to Fecamp by dark.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter tried very hard to distract her attention, so as to keep\r\nhis guests until the next day, but he did not succeed, for she never\r\njoked when there was business on hand, and as soon as they had had their\r\ncoffee she ordered her girls to make haste and get ready, and then,\r\nturning to her brother, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must put in the horse immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d and she herself went to finish\r\nher last preparations.\r\n\r\nWhen she came down again, her sister-in-law was waiting to speak to her\r\nabout the child, and a long conversation took place, in which, however,\r\nnothing was settled. The carpenter's wife was artful and pretended to be\r\nvery much affected, and Madame Tellier, who was holding the girl on her\r\nknee, would not pledge herself to anything definite, but merely gave\r\nvague promises\xe2\x80\x94she would not forget her, there was plenty of time, and\r\nbesides, they would meet again.\r\n\r\nBut the conveyance did not come to the door and the women did not come\r\ndownstairs. Upstairs they even heard loud laughter, romping, little\r\nscreams, and much clapping of hands, and so, while the carpenter's wife\r\nwent to the stable to see whether the cart was ready, madame went\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nRivet, who was very drunk, was plaguing Rosa, who was half choking with\r\nlaughter. Louise and Flora were holding him by the arms and trying to\r\ncalm him, as they were shocked at his levity after that morning's\r\nceremony; but Raphaele and Fernande were urging him on, writhing and\r\nholding their sides with laughter, and they uttered shrill cries at\r\nevery rebuff the drunken fellow received.\r\n\r\nThe man was furious, his face was red, and he was trying to shake off\r\nthe two women who were clinging to him, while he was pulling Rosa's\r\nskirt with all his might and stammering incoherently.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Tellier, who was very indignant, went up to her brother,\r\nseized him by the shoulders, and threw him out of the room with such\r\nviolence that he fell against the wall in the passage, and a minute\r\nafterward they heard him pumping water on his head in the yard, and when\r\nhe reappeared with the cart he was quite calm.\r\n\r\nThey started off in the same way as they had come the day before, and\r\nthe little white horse started off with his quick, dancing trot. Under\r\nthe hot sun, their fun, which had been checked during dinner, broke out\r\nagain. The girls now were amused at the jolting of the cart, pushed\r\ntheir neighbors' chairs, and burst out laughing every moment.\r\n\r\nThere was a glare of light over the country, which dazzled their eyes,\r\nand the wheels raised two trails of dust along the highroad. Presently,\r\nFernande, who was fond of music, asked Rosa to sing something, and she\r\nboldly struck up the \xe2\x80\x9cGros Cure de Meudon,\xe2\x80\x9d but Madame Tellier made her\r\nstop immediately, as she thought it a very unsuitable song for such a\r\nday, and she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSing us something of Beranger's.\xe2\x80\x9d And so, after a moment's hesitation,\r\nRosa began Beranger's song \xe2\x80\x9cThe Grandmother\xe2\x80\x9d in her worn-out voice, and\r\nall the girls, and even Madame Tellier herself, joined in the chorus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I regret My dimpled arms, My nimble legs, And vanished charms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is first rate,\xe2\x80\x9d Rivet declared, carried away by the rhythm, and\r\nthey shouted the refrain to every verse, while Rivet beat time on the\r\nshaft with his foot, and with the reins on the back of the horse, who,\r\nas if he himself were carried away by the rhythm, broke into a wild\r\ngallop, and threw all the women in a heap, one on top of the other, on\r\nthe bottom of the conveyance.\r\n\r\nThey got up, laughing as if they were mad, and the Gong went on, shouted\r\nat the top of their voices, beneath the burning sky, among the ripening\r\ngrain, to the rapid gallop of the little horse, who set off every time\r\nthe refrain was sung, and galloped a hundred yards, to their great\r\ndelight, while occasionally a stone-breaker by the roadside sat up and\r\nlooked at the load of shouting females through his wire spectacles.\r\n\r\nWhen they got out at the station, the carpenter said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you are going; we might have had some good times together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut Madame Tellier replied very sensibly: \xe2\x80\x9cEverything has its right\r\ntime, and we cannot always be enjoying ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he had a\r\nsudden inspiration:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, I will come and see you at Fecamp next month.\xe2\x80\x9d And he gave\r\nRosa a roguish and knowing look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d his sister replied, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be sensible; you may come if you\r\nlike, but you are not to be up to any of your tricks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not reply, and as they heard the whistle of the train, he\r\nimmediately began to kiss them all. When it came to Rosa's turn, he\r\ntried to get to her mouth, which she, however, smiling with her lips\r\nclosed, turned away from him each time by a rapid movement of her head\r\nto one side. He held her in his arms, but he could not attain his\r\nobject, as his large whip, which he was holding in his hand and waving\r\nbehind the girl's back in desperation, interfered with his movements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPassengers for Rouen, take your seats!\xe2\x80\x9d a guard cried, and they got in.\r\nThere was a slight whistle, followed by a loud whistle from the engine,\r\nwhich noisily puffed out its first jet of steam, while the wheels began\r\nto turn a little with a visible effort, and Rivet left the station and\r\nran along by the track to get another look at Rosa, and as the carriage\r\npassed him, he began to crack his whip and to jump, while he sang at the\r\ntop of his voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I regret My dimpled arms, My nimble legs, And vanished charms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then he watched a white pocket-handkerchief, which somebody was\r\nwaving, as it disappeared in the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThey slept the peaceful sleep of a quiet conscience, until they got to\r\nRouen, and when they returned to the house, refreshed and rested, Madame\r\nTellier could not help saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all very well, but I was longing to get home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey hurried over their supper, and then, when they had put on their\r\nusual evening costume, waited for their regular customers, and the\r\nlittle colored lamp outside the door told the passers-by that Madame\r\nTellier had returned, and in a moment the news spread, nobody knew how\r\nor through whom.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Philippe, the banker's son, even carried his friendliness so\r\nfar as to send a special messenger to Monsieur Tournevau, who was in the\r\nbosom of his family.\r\n\r\nThe fish curer had several cousins to dinner every Sunday, and they were\r\nhaving coffee, when a man came in with a letter in his hand. Monsieur\r\nTournevau was much excited; he opened the envelope and grew pale; it\r\ncontained only these words in pencil:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cargo of cod has been found; the ship has come into port; good\r\nbusiness for you. Come immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt in his pockets, gave the messenger two sons, and suddenly\r\nblushing to his ears, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI must go out.\xe2\x80\x9d He handed his wife the\r\nlaconic and mysterious note, rang the bell, and when the servant came\r\nin, he asked her to bring him has hat and overcoat immediately. As soon\r\nas he was in the street, he began to hurry, and the way seemed to him to\r\nbe twice as long as usual, in consequence of his impatience.\r\n\r\nMadame Tellier's establishment had put on quite a holiday look. On the\r\nground floor, a number of sailors were making a deafening noise, and\r\nLouise and Flora drank with one and the other, and were being called for\r\nin every direction at once.\r\n\r\nThe upstairs room was full by nine o'clock. Monsieur Vasse, the Judge of\r\nthe Tribunal of Commerce, Madame Tellier's regular but Platonic wooer,\r\nwas talking to her in a corner in a low voice, and they were both\r\nsmiling, as if they were about to come to an understanding.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Poulin, the ex-mayor, was talking to Rosa, and she was running\r\nher hands through the old gentleman's white whiskers.\r\n\r\nTall Fernande was on the sofa, her feet on the coat of Monsieur\r\nPinipesse, the tax collector, and leaning back against young Monsieur\r\nPhilippe, her right arm around his neck, while she held a cigarette in\r\nher left hand.\r\n\r\nRaphaele appeared to be talking seriously with Monsieur Dupuis, the\r\ninsurance agent, and she finished by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then, the door opened suddenly, and Monsieur Tournevau came in, and\r\nwas greeted with enthusiastic cries of \xe2\x80\x9cLong live Tournevau!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nRaphaele, who was dancing alone up and down the room, went and threw\r\nherself into his arms. He seized her in a vigorous embrace and, without\r\nsaying a word, lifted her up as if she had been a feather.\r\n\r\nRosa was chatting to the ex-mayor, kissing him and puffing; both his\r\nwhiskers at the same time, in order to keep his head straight.\r\n\r\nFernanad and Madame Tellier remained with the four men, and Monsieur\r\nPhilippe exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay for some champagne; get three bottles,\r\nMadame Tellier.\xe2\x80\x9d And Fernande gave him a hug, and whispered to him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlay us a waltz, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d So he rose and sat down at the old piano in\r\nthe corner, and managed to get a hoarse waltz out of the depths of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThe tall girl put her arms round the tax collector, Madame Tellier let\r\nMonsieur Vasse take her round the waist, and the two couples turned\r\nround, kissing as they danced. Monsieur Vasse, who had formerly danced\r\nin good society, waltzed with such elegance that Madame Tellier was\r\nquite captivated.\r\n\r\nFrederic brought the champagne; the first cork popped, and Monsieur\r\nPhilippe played the introduction to a quadrille, through which the four\r\ndancers walked in society fashion, decorously, with propriety,\r\ndeportment, bows and curtsies, and then they began to drink.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Philippe next struck up a lively polka, and Monsieur Tournevau\r\nstarted off with the handsome Jewess, whom he held without letting her\r\nfeet touch the ground. Monsieur Pinipesse and Monsieur Vasse had started\r\noff with renewed vigor, and from time to time one or other couple would\r\nstop to toss off a long draught of sparkling wine, and that dance was\r\nthreatening to become never-ending, when Rosa opened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to dance,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. And she caught hold of Monsieur\r\nDupuis, who was sitting idle on the couch, and the dance began again.\r\n\r\nBut the bottles were empty. \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay for one,\xe2\x80\x9d Monsieur Tournevau\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cSo will I,\xe2\x80\x9d Monsieur Vasse declared. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd. I will do the same,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMonsieur Dupuis remarked.\r\n\r\nThey all began to clap their hands, and it soon became a regular ball,\r\nand from time to time Louise and Flora ran upstairs quickly and had a\r\nfew turns, while their customers downstairs grew impatient, and then\r\nthey returned regretfully to the tap-room. At midnight they were still\r\ndancing.\r\n\r\nMadame Tellier let them amuse themselves while she had long private\r\ntalks in corners with Monsieur Vasse, as if to settle the last details\r\nof something that had already been settled.\r\n\r\nAt last, at one o'clock, the two married men, Monsieur Tournevau and\r\nMonsieur Pinipesse, declared that they were going home, and wanted to\r\npay. Nothing was charged for except the champagne, and that cost only\r\nsix francs a bottle, instead of ten, which was the usual price, and when\r\nthey expressed their surprise at such generosity, Madame Tellier, who\r\nwas beaming, said to them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don't have a holiday every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENIS\r\n\r\nTo Leon Chapron.\r\n\r\nMarambot opened the letter which his servant Denis gave him and smiled.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Denis has been a servant in this house. He was a short,\r\nstout, jovial man, who was known throughout the countryside as a model\r\nservant. He asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs monsieur pleased? Has monsieur received good news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marambot was not rich. He was an old village druggist, a bachelor,\r\nwho lived on an income acquired with difficulty by selling drugs to the\r\nfarmers. He answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy. Old man Malois is afraid of the law-suit with which I am\r\nthreatening him. I shall get my money to-morrow. Five thousand francs\r\nare not liable to harm the account of an old bachelor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marambot rubbed his hands with satisfaction. He was a man of quiet\r\ntemperament, more sad than gay, incapable of any prolonged effort,\r\ncareless in business.\r\n\r\nHe could undoubtedly have amassed a greater income had he taken\r\nadvantage of the deaths of colleagues established in more important\r\ncenters, by taking their places and carrying on their business. But the\r\ntrouble of moving and the thought of all the preparations had always\r\nstopped him. After thinking the matter over for a few days, he would be\r\nsatisfied to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! I'll wait until the next time. I'll not lose anything by the\r\ndelay. I may even find something better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis, on the contrary, was always urging his master to new enterprises.\r\nOf an energetic temperament, he would continually repeat:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! If I had only had the capital to start out with, I could have made\r\na fortune! One thousand francs would do me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marambot would smile without answering and would go out in his little\r\ngarden, where, his hands behind his back, he would walk about dreaming.\r\n\r\nAll day long, Denis sang the joyful refrains of the folk-songs of the\r\ndistrict. He even showed an unusual activity, for he cleaned all the\r\nwindows of the house, energetically rubbing the glass, and singing at\r\nthe top of his voice.\r\n\r\nM. Marambot, surprised at his zeal, said to him several times, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, if you work like that there will be nothing left for you to do\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe following day, at about nine o'clock in the morning, the postman\r\ngave Denis four letters for his master, one of them very heavy. M.\r\nMarambot immediately shut himself up in his room until late in the\r\nafternoon. He then handed his servant four letters for the mail. One of\r\nthem was addressed to M. Malois; it was undoubtedly a receipt for the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nDenis asked his master no questions; he appeared to be as sad and gloomy\r\nthat day as he had seemed joyful the day before.\r\n\r\nNight came. M. Marambot went to bed as usual and slept.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by a strange noise. He sat up in his bed and listened.\r\nSuddenly the door opened, and Denis appeared, holding in one hand a\r\ncandle and in the other a carving knife, his eyes staring, his face\r\ncontracted as though moved by some deep emotion; he was as pale as a\r\nghost.\r\n\r\nM. Marambot, astonished, thought that he was sleep-walking, and he was\r\ngoing to get out of bed and assist him when the servant blew out the\r\nlight and rushed for the bed. His master stretched out his hands to\r\nreceive the shock which knocked him over on his back; he was trying to\r\nseize the hands of his servant, whom he now thought to be crazy, in\r\norder to avoid the blows which the latter was aiming at him.\r\n\r\nHe was struck by the knife; once in the shoulder, once in the forehead\r\nand the third time in the chest. He fought wildly, waving his arms\r\naround in the darkness, kicking and crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDenis! Denis! Are you mad? Listen, Denis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the latter, gasping for breath, kept up his furious attack always\r\nstriking, always repulsed, sometimes with a kick, sometimes with a\r\npunch, and rushing forward again furiously.\r\n\r\nM. Marambot was wounded twice more, once in the leg and once in the\r\nstomach. But, suddenly, a thought flashed across his mind, and he began\r\nto shriek:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop, Denis, I have not yet received my money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man immediately ceased, and his master could hear his labored\r\nbreathing in the darkness.\r\n\r\nM. Marambot then went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have received nothing. M. Malois takes back what he said, the law-\r\nsuit will take place; that is why you carried the letters to the mail.\r\nJust read those on my desk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a final effort, he reached for his matches and lit the candle.\r\n\r\nHe was covered with blood. His sheets, his curtains, and even the walls,\r\nwere spattered with red. Denis, standing in the middle of the room, was\r\nalso bloody from head to foot.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw the blood, M. Marambot thought himself dead, and fell\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nAt break of day he revived. It was some time, however, before he\r\nregained his senses, and was able to understand or remember. But,\r\nsuddenly, the memory of the attack and of his wounds returned to him,\r\nand he was filled with such terror that he closed his eyes in order not\r\nto see anything. After a few minutes he grew calmer and began to think.\r\nHe had not died immediately, therefore he might still recover. He felt\r\nweak, very weak; but he had no real pain, although he noticed an\r\nuncomfortable smarting sensation in several parts of his body. He also\r\nfelt icy cold, and all wet, and as though wrapped up in bandages. He\r\nthought that this dampness came from the blood which he had lost; and he\r\nshivered at the dreadful thought of this red liquid which had come from\r\nhis veins and covered his bed. The idea of seeing this terrible\r\nspectacle again so upset him that he kept his eyes closed with all his\r\nstrength, as though they might open in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of Denis? He had probably escaped.\r\n\r\nBut what could he, Marambot, do now? Get up? Call for help? But if he\r\nshould make the slightest motions, his wounds would undoubtedly open up\r\nagain and he would die from loss of blood.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard the door of his room open. His heart almost stopped.\r\nIt was certainly Denis who was coming to finish him up. He held his\r\nbreath in order to make the murderer think that he had been successful.\r\n\r\nHe felt his sheet being lifted up, and then someone feeling his stomach.\r\nA sharp pain near his hip made him start. He was being very gently\r\nwashed with cold water. Therefore, someone must have discovered the\r\nmisdeed and he was being cared for. A wild joy seized him; but\r\nprudently, he did not wish to show that he was conscious. He opened one\r\neye, just one, with the greatest precaution.\r\n\r\nHe recognized Denis standing beside him, Denis himself! Mercy! He\r\nhastily closed his eye again.\r\n\r\nDenis! What could he be doing? What did he want? What awful scheme could\r\nhe now be carrying out?\r\n\r\nWhat was he doing? Well, he was washing him in order to hide the traces\r\nof his crime! And he would now bury him in the garden, under ten feet of\r\nearth, so that no one could discover him! Or perhaps under the wine\r\ncellar! And M. Marambot began to tremble like a leaf. He kept saying to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cI am lost, lost!\xe2\x80\x9d He closed his eyes so as not to see the\r\nknife as it descended for the final stroke. It did not come. Denis was\r\nnow lifting him up and bandaging him. Then he began carefully to dress\r\nthe wound on his leg, as his master had taught him to do.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any doubt. His servant, after wishing to kill him,\r\nwas trying to save him.\r\n\r\nThen M. Marambot, in a dying voice, gave him the practical piece of\r\nadvice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWash the wounds in a dilute solution of carbolic acid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I am doing, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marambot opened both his eyes. There was no sign of blood either on\r\nthe bed, on the walls, or on the murderer. The wounded man was stretched\r\nout on clean white sheets.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other.\r\n\r\nFinally M. Marambot said calmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been guilty of a great crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to make up for it, monsieur. If you will not tell on me, I\r\nwill serve you as faithfully as in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was no time to anger his servant. M. Marambot murmured as he closed\r\nhis eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear not to tell on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis saved his master. He spent days and nights without sleep, never\r\nleaving the sick room, preparing drugs, broths, potions, feeling his\r\npulse, anxiously counting the beats, attending him with the skill of a\r\ntrained nurse and the devotion of a son.\r\n\r\nHe continually asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, how do you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marambot would answer in a weak voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little better, my boy, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when the sick man would wake up at night, he would often see his\r\nservant seated in an armchair, weeping silently.\r\n\r\nNever had the old druggist been so cared for, so fondled, so spoiled. At\r\nfirst he had said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I am well I shall get rid of this rascal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was now convalescing, and from day to day he would put off dismissing\r\nhis murderer. He thought that no one would ever show him such care and\r\nattention, for he held this man through fear; and he warned him that he\r\nhad left a document with a lawyer denouncing him to the law if any new\r\naccident should occur.\r\n\r\nThis precaution seemed to guarantee him against any future attack; and\r\nhe then asked himself if it would not be wiser to keep this man near\r\nhim, in order to watch him closely.\r\n\r\nJust as formerly, when he would hesitate about taking some larger place\r\nof business, he could not make up his mind to any decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is always time,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to himself.\r\n\r\nDenis continued to show himself an admirable servant. M. Marambot was\r\nwell. He kept him.\r\n\r\nOne morning, just as he was finishing breakfast, he suddenly heard a\r\ngreat noise in the kitchen. He hastened in there. Denis was struggling\r\nwith two gendarmes. An officer was taking notes on his pad.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw his master, the servant began to sob, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told on me, monsieur, that's not right, after what you had promised\r\nme. You have broken your word of honor, Monsieur Marambot; that is not\r\nright, that's not right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Marambot, bewildered and distressed at being suspected, lifted his\r\nhand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you before the Lord, my boy that I did not tell on you. I\r\nhaven't the slightest idea how the police could have found out about\r\nyour attack on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer started:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that he attacked you, M. Marambot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bewildered druggist answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94but I did not tell on him\xe2\x80\x94I haven't said a word\xe2\x80\x94I swear it\xe2\x80\x94he has\r\nserved me excellently from that time on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer pronounced severely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take down your testimony. The law will take notice of this new\r\naction, of which it was ignorant, Monsieur Marambot. I was commissioned\r\nto arrest your servant for the theft of two ducks surreptitiously taken\r\nby him from M. Duhamel of which act there are witnesses. I shall make a\r\nnote of your information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, turning toward his men, he ordered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, bring him along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gendarmes dragged Denis out.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer used a plea of insanity, contrasting the two misdeeds in\r\norder to strengthen his argument. He had clearly proved that the theft\r\nof the two ducks came from the same mental condition as the eight knife-\r\nwounds in the body of Maramlot. He had cunningly analyzed all the phases\r\nof this transitory condition of mental aberration, which could,\r\ndoubtless, be cured by a few months' treatment in a reputable\r\nsanatorium. He had spoken in enthusiastic terms of the continued\r\ndevotion of this faithful servant, of the care with which he had\r\nsurrounded his master, wounded by him in a moment of alienation.\r\n\r\nTouched by this memory, M. Marambot felt the tears rising to his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer noticed it, opened his arms with a broad gesture, spreading\r\nout the long black sleeves of his robe like the wings of a bat, and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, look, gentleman of the jury, look at those tears. What more can I\r\nsay for my client? What speech, what argument, what reasoning would be\r\nworth these tears of his master? They, speak louder than I do, louder\r\nthan the law; they cry: 'Mercy, for the poor wandering mind of a while\r\nago! They implore, they pardon, they bless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent and sat down.\r\n\r\nThen the judge, turning to Marambot, whose testimony had been excellent\r\nfor his servant, asked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, monsieur, even admitting that you consider this man insane, that\r\ndoes not explain why you should have kept him. He was none the less\r\ndangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarambot, wiping his eyes, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your honor, what can you expect? Nowadays it's so hard to find\r\ngood servants\xe2\x80\x94I could never have found a better one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDenis was acquitted and put in a sanatorium at his master's expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY WIFE\r\n\r\nIt had been a stag dinner. These men still came together once in a while\r\nwithout their wives as they had done when they were bachelors. They\r\nwould eat for a long time, drink for a long time; they would talk of\r\neverything, stir up those old and joyful memories which bring a smile to\r\nthe lip and a tremor to the heart. One of them was saying: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorges, do\r\nyou remember our excursion to Saint-Germain with those two little girls\r\nfrom Montmartre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a little detail here or there would be remembered, and all these\r\nthings brought joy to the hearts.\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned on marriage, and each one said with a sincere\r\nair: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if it were to do over again!\xe2\x80\x9d Georges Duportin added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's\r\nstrange how easily one falls into it. You have fully decided never to\r\nmarry; and then, in the springtime, you go to the country; the weather\r\nis warm; the summer is beautiful; the fields are full of flowers; you\r\nmeet a young girl at some friend's house\xe2\x80\x94crash! all is over. You return\r\nmarried!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPierre Letoile exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cCorrect! that is exactly my case, only there\r\nwere some peculiar incidents\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friend interrupted him: \xe2\x80\x9cAs for you, you have no cause to complain.\r\nYou have the most charming wife in the world, pretty, amiable, perfect!\r\nYou are undoubtedly the happiest one of us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other one continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's not my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that I have a perfect wife, but I certainly married her much\r\nagainst my will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94this is the adventure. I was thirty-five, and I had no more idea of\r\nmarrying than I had of hanging myself. Young girls seemed to me to be\r\ninane, and I loved pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the month of May I was invited to the wedding of my cousin,\r\nSimon d'Erabel, in Normandy. It was a regular Normandy wedding. We sat\r\ndown at the table at five o'clock in the evening and at eleven o'clock\r\nwe were still eating. I had been paired off, for the occasion, with a\r\nMademoiselle Dumoulin, daughter of a retired colonel, a young, blond,\r\nsoldierly person, well formed, frank and talkative. She took complete\r\npossession of me for the whole day, dragged me into the park, made me\r\ndance willy-nilly, bored me to death. I said to myself: 'That's all very\r\nwell for to-day, but tomorrow I'll get out. That's all there is to it!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward eleven o'clock at night the women retired to their rooms; the\r\nmen stayed, smoking while they drank or drinking while they smoked,\r\nwhichever you will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the open window we could see the country folks dancing. Farmers\r\nand peasant girls were jumping about in a circle yelling at the top of\r\ntheir lungs a dance air which was feebly accompanied by two violins and\r\na clarinet. The wild song of the peasants often completely drowned the\r\nsound of the instruments, and the weak music, interrupted by the\r\nunrestrained voices, seemed to come to us in little fragments of\r\nscattered notes. Two enormous casks, surrounded by flaming torches,\r\ncontained drinks for the crowd. Two men were kept busy rinsing the\r\nglasses or bowls in a bucket and immediately holding them under the\r\nspigots, from which flowed the red stream of wine or the golden stream\r\nof pure cider; and the parched dancers, the old ones quietly, the girls\r\npanting, came up, stretched out their arms and grasped some receptacle,\r\nthrew back their heads and poured down their throats the drink which\r\nthey preferred. On a table were bread, butter, cheese and sausages. Each\r\none would step up from time to time and swallow a mouthful, and under\r\nthe starlit sky this healthy and violent exercise was a pleasing sight,\r\nand made one also feel like drinking from these enormous casks and\r\neating the crisp bread and butter with a raw onion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mad desire seized me to take part in this merrymaking, and I left my\r\ncompanions. I must admit that I was probably a little tipsy, but I was\r\nsoon entirely so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grabbed the hand of a big, panting peasant woman and I jumped her\r\nabout until I was out of breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I drank some wine and reached for another girl. In order to\r\nrefresh myself afterward, I swallowed a bowlful of cider, and I began to\r\nbounce around as if possessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was very light on my feet. The boys, delighted, were watching me and\r\ntrying to imitate me; the girls all wished to dance with me, and jumped\r\nabout heavily with the grace of cows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter each dance I drank a glass of wine or a glass of cider, and\r\ntoward two o'clock in the morning I was so drunk that I could hardly\r\nstand up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI realized my condition and tried to reach my room. Everybody was\r\nasleep and the house was silent and dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no matches and everybody was in bed. As soon as I reached the\r\nvestibule I began to, feel dizzy. I had a lot of trouble to find the\r\nbanister. At last, by accident, my hand came in contact with it, and I\r\nsat down on the first step of the stairs in order to try to gather my\r\nscattered wits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy room was on the second floor; it was the third door to the left.\r\nFortunately I had not forgotten that. Armed with this knowledge, I\r\narose, not without difficulty, and I began to ascend, step by step. In\r\nmy hands I firmly gripped the iron railing in order not to fall, and\r\ntook great pains to make no noise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly three or four times did my foot miss the steps, and I went down on\r\nmy knees; but thanks to the energy of my arms and the strength of my\r\nwill, I avoided falling completely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last I reached the second floor and I set out in my journey along\r\nthe hall, feeling my way by the walls. I felt one door; I counted:\r\n'One'; but a sudden dizziness made me lose my hold on the wall, make a\r\nstrange turn and fall up against the other wall. I wished to turn in a\r\nstraight line: The crossing was long and full of hardships. At last I\r\nreached the shore, and, prudently, I began to travel along again until I\r\nmet another door. In order to be sure to make no mistake, I again\r\ncounted out loud: 'Two.' I started out on my walk again. At last I found\r\nthe third door. I said: 'Three, that's my room,' and I turned the knob.\r\nThe door opened. Notwithstanding my befuddled state, I thought: 'Since\r\nthe door opens, this must be home.' After softly closing the door, I\r\nstepped out in the darkness. I bumped against something soft: my easy-\r\nchair. I immediately stretched myself out on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my condition it would not have been wise to look for my bureau, my\r\ncandles, my matches. It would have taken me at least two hours. It would\r\nprobably have taken me that long also to undress; and even then I might\r\nnot have succeeded. I gave it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only took my shoes off; I unbuttoned my waistcoat, which was choking\r\nme, I loosened my trousers and went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis undoubtedly lasted for a long time. I was suddenly awakened by a\r\ndeep voice which was saying: 'What, you lazy girl, still in bed? It's\r\nten o'clock!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman's voice answered: 'Already! I was so tired yesterday.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn bewilderment I wondered what this dialogue meant. Where was I? What\r\nhad I done? My mind was wandering, still surrounded by a heavy fog. The\r\nfirst voice continued: 'I'm going to raise your curtains.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard steps approaching me. Completely at a loss what to do, I sat\r\nup. Then a hand was placed on my head. I started. The voice asked: 'Who\r\nis there?' I took good care not to answer. A furious grasp seized me. I\r\nin turn seized him, and a terrific struggle ensued. We were rolling\r\naround, knocking over the furniture and crashing against the walls. A\r\nwoman's voice was shrieking: 'Help! help!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServants, neighbors, frightened women crowded around us. The blinds\r\nwere open and the shades drawn. I was struggling with Colonel Dumoulin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had slept beside his daughter's bed!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we were separated, I escaped to my room, dumbfounded. I locked\r\nmyself in and sat down with my feet on a chair, for my shoes had been\r\nleft in the young girl's room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a great noise through the whole house, doors being opened and\r\nclosed, whisperings and rapid steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter half an hour some one knocked on my door. I cried: 'Who is\r\nthere?' It was my uncle, the bridegroom's father. I opened the door:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was pale and furious, and he treated me harshly: 'You have behaved\r\nlike a scoundrel in my house, do you hear?' Then he added more gently\r\n'But, you young fool, why the devil did you let yourself get caught at\r\nten o'clock in the morning? You go to sleep like a log in that room,\r\ninstead of leaving immediately\xe2\x80\x94immediately after.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI exclaimed: 'But, uncle, I assure you that nothing occurred. I was\r\ndrunk and got into the wrong room.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shrugged his shoulders! 'Don't talk nonsense.' I raised my hand,\r\nexclaiming: 'I swear to you on my honor.' My uncle continued: 'Yes,\r\nthat's all right. It's your duty to say that.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI in turn grew angry and told him the whole unfortunate occurrence. He\r\nlooked at me with a bewildered expression, not knowing what to believe.\r\nThen he went out to confer with the colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard that a kind of jury of the mothers had been formed, to which\r\nwere submitted the different phases of the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came back an hour later, sat down with the dignity of a judge and\r\nbegan: 'No matter what may be the situation, I can see only one way out\r\nof it for you; it is to marry Mademoiselle Dumoulin.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bounded out of the chair, crying: 'Never! never!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGravely he asked: 'Well, what do you expect to do?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered simply: 'Why\xe2\x80\x94leave as soon as my shoes are returned to me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle continued: 'Please do not jest. The colonel has decided to\r\nblow your brains out as soon as he sees you. And you may be sure that he\r\ndoes not threaten idly. I spoke of a duel and he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I tell\r\nyou that I will blow his brains out.\xe2\x80\x9d'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Let us now examine the question from another point of view. Either you\r\nhave misbehaved yourself\xe2\x80\x94and then so much the worse for you, my boy; one\r\nshould not go near a young girl\xe2\x80\x94or else, being drunk, as you say, you\r\nmade a mistake in the room. In this case, it's even worse for you. You\r\nshouldn't get yourself into such foolish situations. Whatever you may\r\nsay, the poor girl's reputation is lost, for a drunkard's excuses are\r\nnever believed. The only real victim in the matter is the girl. Think it\r\nover.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went away, while I cried after him: 'Say what you will, I'll not\r\nmarry her!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stayed alone for another hour. Then my aunt came. She was crying. She\r\nused every argument. No one believed my story. They could not imagine\r\nthat this young girl could have forgotten to lock her door in a house\r\nfull of company. The colonel had struck her. She had been crying the\r\nwhole morning. It was a terrible and unforgettable scandal. And my good\r\naunt added: 'Ask for her hand, anyhow. We may, perhaps, find some way\r\nout of it when we are drawing up the papers.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis prospect relieved me. And I agreed to write my proposal. An hour\r\nlater I left for Paris. The following day I was informed that I had been\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, in three weeks, before I had been able to find any excuse, the\r\nbanns were published, the announcement sent out, the contract signed,\r\nand one Monday morning I found myself in a church, beside a weeping\r\nyoung girl, after telling the magistrate that I consented to take her as\r\nmy companion\xe2\x80\x94for better, for worse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not seen her since my adventure, and I glanced at her out of the\r\ncorner of my eye with a certain malevolent surprise. However, she was\r\nnot ugly\xe2\x80\x94far from it. I said to myself: 'There is some one who won't\r\nlaugh every day.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not look at me once until, the evening, and she did not say a\r\nsingle word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward the middle of the night I entered the bridal chamber with the\r\nfull intention of letting her know my resolutions, for I was now master.\r\nI found her sitting in an armchair, fully dressed, pale and with red\r\neyes. As soon as I entered she rose and came slowly toward me saying:\r\n'Monsieur, I am ready to do whatever you may command. I will kill myself\r\nif you so desire'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe colonel's daughter was as pretty as she could be in this heroic\r\nrole. I kissed her; it was my privilege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI soon saw that I had not got a bad bargain. I have now been married\r\nfive years. I do not regret it in the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPierre Letoile was silent. His companions were laughing. One of them\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cMarriage is indeed a lottery; you must never choose your numbers.\r\nThe haphazard ones are the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother added by way of conclusion: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but do not forget that the god\r\nof drunkards chose for Pierre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNKNOWN\r\n\r\nWe were speaking of adventures, and each one of us was relating his\r\nstory of delightful experiences, surprising meetings, on the train, in a\r\nhotel, at the seashore. According to Roger des Annettes, the seashore\r\nwas particularly favorable to the little blind god.\r\n\r\nGontran, who was keeping mum, was asked what he thought of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess Paris is about the best place for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWoman is\r\nlike a precious trinket, we appreciate her all the more when we meet her\r\nin the most unexpected places; but the rarest ones are only to be found\r\nin Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment, and then continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, it's great! Walk along the streets on some spring morning. The\r\nlittle women, daintily tripping along, seem to blossom out like flowers.\r\nWhat a delightful, charming sight! The dainty perfume of violet is\r\neverywhere. The city is gay, and everybody notices the women. By Jove,\r\nhow tempting they are in their light, thin dresses, which occasionally\r\ngive one a glimpse of the delicate pink flesh beneath!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne saunters along, head up, mind alert, and eyes open. I tell you it's\r\ngreat! You see her in the distance, while still a block away; you\r\nalready know that she is going to please you at closer quarters. You can\r\nrecognize her by the flower on her hat, the toss of her head, or her\r\ngait. She approaches, and you say to yourself: 'Look out, here she is!'\r\nYou come closer to her and you devour her with your eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a young girl running errands for some store, a young woman\r\nreturning from church, or hastening to see her lover? What do you care?\r\nHer well-rounded bosom shows through the thin waist. Oh, if you could\r\nonly take her in your arms and fondle and kiss her! Her glance may be\r\ntimid or bold, her hair light or dark. What difference does it make? She\r\nbrushes against you, and a cold shiver runs down your spine. Ah, how you\r\nwish for her all day! How many of these dear creatures have I met this\r\nway, and how wildly in love I would have been had I known them more\r\nintimately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most distractedly\r\nare those whom we never meet to know? Curious, isn't it? From time to\r\ntime we barely catch a glimpse of some woman, the mere sight of whom\r\nthrills our senses. But it goes no further. When I think of all the\r\nadorable creatures that I have elbowed in the streets of Paris, I fairly\r\nrave. Who are they! Where are they? Where can I find them again? There\r\nis a proverb which says that happiness often passes our way; I am sure\r\nthat I have often passed alongside the one who could have caught me like\r\na linnet in the snare of her fresh beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoger des Annettes had listened smilingly. He answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI know that as\r\nwell as you do. This is what happened to me: About five years ago, for\r\nthe first time I met, on the Pont de la Concorde, a young woman who made\r\na wonderful impression on me. She was dark, rather stout, with glossy\r\nhair, and eyebrows which nearly met above two dark eyes. On her lip was\r\na scarcely perceptible down, which made one dream-dream as one dreams of\r\nbeloved woods, on seeing a bunch of wild violets. She had a small waist\r\nand a well-developed bust, which seemed to present a challenge, offer a\r\ntemptation. Her eyes were like two black spots on white enamel. Her\r\nglance was strange, vacant, unthinking, and yet wonderfully beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI imagined that she might be a Jewess. I followed her, and then turned\r\nround to look at her, as did many others. She walked with a swinging\r\ngait that was not graceful, but somehow attracted one. At the Place de\r\nla Concorde she took a carriage, and I stood there like a fool, moved by\r\nthe strongest desire that had ever assailed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor about three weeks I thought only of her; and then her memory passed\r\nout of my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix months later I descried her in the Rue de la Paix again. On seeing\r\nher I felt the same shock that one experiences on seeing a once dearly\r\nloved woman. I stopped that I might better observe her. When she passed\r\nclose enough to touch me I felt as though I were standing before a red\r\nhot furnace. Then, when she had passed by, I noticed a delicious\r\nsensation, as of a cooling breeze blowing over my face. I did not follow\r\nher. I was afraid of doing something foolish. I was afraid of myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe haunted all my dreams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a year before I saw her again. But just as the sun was going\r\ndown on one beautiful evening in May I recognized her walking along the\r\nAvenue des Champs-Elysees. The Arc de Triomphe stood out in bold relief\r\nagainst the fiery glow of the sky. A golden haze filled the air; it was\r\none of those delightful spring evenings which are the glory of Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI followed her, tormented by a desire to address her, to kneel before\r\nher, to pour forth the emotion which was choking me. Twice I passed by\r\nher only to fall back, and each time as I passed by I felt this\r\nsensation, as of scorching heat, which I had noticed in the Rue de la\r\nPaix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe glanced at me, and then I saw her enter a house on the Rue de\r\nPresbourg. I waited for her two hours and she did not come out. Then I\r\ndecided to question the janitor. He seemed not to understand me. 'She\r\nmust be visiting some one,' he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next time I was eight months without seeing her. But one freezing\r\nmorning in January, I was walking along the Boulevard Malesherbes at a\r\ndog trot, so as to keep warm, when at the corner I bumped into a woman\r\nand knocked a small package out of her hand. I tried to apologize. It\r\nwas she!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first I stood stock still from the shock; then having returned to\r\nher the package which she had dropped, I said abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am both grieved and delighted, madame, to have jostled you. For more\r\nthan two years I have known you, admired you, and had the most ardent\r\nwish to be presented to you; nevertheless I have been unable to find out\r\nwho you are, or where you live. Please excuse these foolish words.\r\nAttribute them to a passionate desire to be numbered among your\r\nacquaintances. Such sentiments can surely offend you in no way! You do\r\nnot know me. My name is Baron Roger des Annettes. Make inquiries about\r\nme, and you will find that I am a gentleman. Now, if you refuse my\r\nrequest, you will throw me into abject misery. Please be good to me and\r\ntell me how I can see you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looked at me with her strange vacant stare, and answered smilingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Give me your address. I will come and see you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so dumfounded that I must have shown my surprise. But I quickly\r\ngathered my wits together and gave her a visiting card, which she\r\nslipped into her pocket with a quick, deft movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecoming bolder, I stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'When shall I see you again?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hesitated, as though mentally running over her list of engagements,\r\nand then murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Will Sunday morning suit you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I should say it would!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went on, after having stared at me, judged, weighed and analyzed me\r\nwith this heavy and vacant gaze which seemed to leave a quieting and\r\ndeadening impression on the person towards whom it was directed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil Sunday my mind was occupied day and night trying to guess who she\r\nmight be and planning my course of conduct towards her. I finally\r\ndecided to buy her a jewel, a beautiful little jewel, which I placed in\r\nits box on the mantelpiece, and left it there awaiting her arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spent a restless night waiting for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt ten o'clock she came, calm and quiet, and with her hand\r\noutstretched, as though she had known me for years. Drawing up a chair,\r\nI took her hat and coat and furs, and laid them aside. And then,\r\ntimidly, I took her hand in mine; after that all went on without a\r\nhitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my friends! what a bliss it is, to stand at a discreet distance and\r\nwatch the hidden pink and blue ribbons, partly concealed, to observe the\r\nhazy lines of the beloved one's form, as they become visible through the\r\nlast of the filmy garments! What a delight it is to watch the ostrich-\r\nlike modesty of those who are in reality none too modest. And what is so\r\npretty as their motions!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer back was turned towards me, and suddenly, my eyes were irresistibly\r\ndrawn to a large black spot right between her shoulders. What could it\r\nbe? Were my eyes deceiving me? But no, there it was, staring me in the\r\nface! Then my mind reverted to the faint down on her lip, the heavy\r\neyebrows almost meeting over her coal-black eyes, her glossy black hair\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I should have been prepared for some surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless I was dumfounded, and my mind was haunted by dim visions\r\nof strange adventures. I seemed to see before me one of the evil genii\r\nof the Thousand and One Nights, one of these dangerous and crafty\r\ncreatures whose mission it is to drag men down to unknown depths. I\r\nthought of Solomon, who made the Queen of Sheba walk on a mirror that he\r\nmight be sure that her feet were not cloven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when the time came for me to sing of love to her, my voice forsook\r\nme. At first she showed surprise, which soon turned to anger; and she\r\nsaid, quickly putting on her wraps:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It was hardly worth while for me to go out of my way to come here.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted her to accept the ring which I had bought for her, but she\r\nreplied haughtily: 'For whom do you take me, sir?' I blushed to the\r\nroots of my hair. She left without saying another word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is my whole adventure. But the worst part of it is that I am now\r\nmadly in love with her. I can't see a woman without thinking of her. All\r\nthe others disgust me, unless they remind me of her. I cannot kiss a\r\nwoman without seeing her face before me, and without suffering the\r\ntorture of unsatisfied desire. She is always with me, always there,\r\ndressed or nude, my true love. She is there, beside the other one,\r\nvisible but intangible. I am almost willing to believe that she was\r\nbewitched, and carried a talisman between her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she? I don't know yet. I have met her once or twice since. I\r\nbowed, but she pretended not to recognize me. Who is she? An Oriental?\r\nYes, doubtless an oriental Jewess! I believe that she must be a Jewess!\r\nBut why? Why? I don't know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPARITION\r\n\r\nThe subject of sequestration of the person came up in speaking of a\r\nrecent lawsuit, and each of us had a story to tell\xe2\x80\x94a true story, he\r\nsaid. We had been spending the evening together at an old family mansion\r\nin the Rue de Grenelle, just a party of intimate friends. The old\r\nMarquis de la Tour-Samuel, who was eighty-two, rose, and, leaning his\r\nelbow on the mantelpiece, said in his somewhat shaky voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also know of something strange, so strange that it has haunted me all\r\nmy life. It is now fifty-six years since the incident occurred, and yet\r\nnot a month passes that I do not see it again in a dream, so great is\r\nthe impression of fear it has left on my mind. For ten minutes I\r\nexperienced such horrible fright that ever since then a sort of constant\r\nterror has remained with me. Sudden noises startle me violently, and\r\nobjects imperfectly distinguished at night inspire me with a mad desire\r\nto flee from them. In short, I am afraid of the dark!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I would not have acknowledged that before I reached my present age.\r\nNow I can say anything. I have never receded before real danger, ladies.\r\nIt is, therefore, permissible, at eighty-two years of age, not to be\r\nbrave in presence of imaginary danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat affair so completely upset me, caused me such deep and mysterious\r\nand terrible distress, that I never spoke of it to any one. I will now\r\ntell it to you exactly as it happened, without any attempt at\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn July, 1827, I was stationed at Rouen. One day as I was walking along\r\nthe quay I met a man whom I thought I recognized without being able to\r\nrecall exactly who he was. Instinctively I made a movement to stop. The\r\nstranger perceived it and at once extended his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a friend to whom I had been deeply attached as a youth. For five\r\nyears I had not seen him; he seemed to have aged half a century. His\r\nhair was quite white and he walked bent over as though completely\r\nexhausted. He apparently understood my surprise, and he told me of the\r\nmisfortune which had shattered his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving fallen madly in love with a young girl, he had married her, but\r\nafter a year of more than earthly happiness she died suddenly of an\r\naffection of the heart. He left his country home on the very day of her\r\nburial and came to his town house in Rouen, where he lived, alone and\r\nunhappy, so sad and wretched that he thought constantly of suicide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Since I have found you again in this manner,' he said, 'I will ask you\r\nto render me an important service. It is to go and get me out of the\r\ndesk in my bedroom\xe2\x80\x94our bedroom\xe2\x80\x94some papers of which I have urgent need.\r\nI cannot send a servant or a business clerk, as discretion and absolute\r\nsilence are necessary. As for myself, nothing on earth would induce me\r\nto reenter that house. I will give you the key of the room, which I\r\nmyself locked on leaving, and the key of my desk, also a few words for\r\nmy gardener, telling him to open the chateau for you. But come and\r\nbreakfast with me tomorrow and we will arrange all that.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised to do him the slight favor he asked. It was, for that\r\nmatter, only a ride which I could make in an hour on horseback, his\r\nproperty being but a few miles distant from Rouen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt ten o'clock the following day I breakfasted, tete-a-tete, with my\r\nfriend, but he scarcely spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe begged me to pardon him; the thought of the visit I was about to\r\nmake to that room, the scene of his dead happiness, overcame him, he\r\nsaid. He, indeed, seemed singularly agitated and preoccupied, as though\r\nundergoing some mysterious mental struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length he explained to me exactly what I had to do. It was very\r\nsimple. I must take two packages of letters and a roll of papers from\r\nthe first right-hand drawer of the desk, of which I had the key. He\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I need not beg you to refrain from glancing at them.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wounded at that remark and told him so somewhat sharply. He\r\nstammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Forgive me, I suffer so,' and tears came to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt about one o'clock I took leave of him to accomplish my mission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The weather was glorious, and I trotted across the fields, listening\r\nto the song of the larks and the rhythmical clang of my sword against my\r\nboot. Then I entered the forest and walked my horse. Branches of trees\r\ncaressed my face as I passed, and now and then I caught a leaf with my\r\nteeth and chewed it, from sheer gladness of heart at being alive and\r\nvigorous on such a radiant day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I approached the chateau I took from my pocket the letter I had for\r\nthe gardener, and was astonished at finding it sealed. I was so\r\nirritated that I was about to turn back without having fulfilled my\r\npromise, but reflected that I should thereby display undue\r\nsusceptibility. My friend in his troubled condition might easily have\r\nfastened the envelope without noticing that he did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manor looked as if it had been abandoned for twenty years. The open\r\ngate was falling from its hinges, the walks were overgrown with grass\r\nand the flower beds were no longer distinguishable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe noise I made by kicking at a shutter brought out an old man from a\r\nside door. He seemed stunned with astonishment at seeing me. On\r\nreceiving my letter, he read it, reread it, turned it over and over,\r\nlooked me up and down, put the paper in his pocket and finally said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, what is it you wish?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI replied shortly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You ought to know, since you have just read your master's orders. I\r\nwish to enter the chateau.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed overcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then you are going in\xe2\x80\x94into her room?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to lose patience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Damn it! Are you presuming to question me?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stammered in confusion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No\xe2\x80\x94sir\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94but it has not been opened since\xe2\x80\x94since the-death. If you\r\nwill be kind enough to wait five minutes I will go and\xe2\x80\x94and see if\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI interrupted him angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'See here, what do you mean by your tricks?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You know very well you cannot enter the room, since here is the key!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe no longer objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then, sir, I will show you the way.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Show me the staircase and leave me. I'll find my way without you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'But\xe2\x80\x94sir\xe2\x80\x94indeed\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time I lost patience, and pushing him aside, went into the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI first went through the kitchen, then two rooms occupied by this man\r\nand his wife. I then crossed a large hall, mounted a staircase and\r\nrecognized the door described by my friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI easily opened it, and entered the apartment. It was so dark that at\r\nfirst I could distinguish nothing. I stopped short, disagreeably\r\naffected by that disagreeable, musty odor of closed, unoccupied rooms.\r\nAs my eyes slowly became accustomed to the darkness I saw plainly enough\r\na large and disordered bedroom, the bed without sheets but still\r\nretaining its mattresses and pillows, on one of which was a deep\r\nimpression, as though an elbow or a head had recently rested there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chairs all seemed out of place. I noticed that a door, doubtless\r\nthat of a closet, had remained half open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI first went to the window, which I opened to let in the light, but the\r\nfastenings of the shutters had grown so rusty that I could not move\r\nthem. I even tried to break them with my sword, but without success. As\r\nI was growing irritated over my useless efforts and could now see fairly\r\nwell in the semi-darkness, I gave up the hope of getting more light, and\r\nwent over to the writing desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seated myself in an armchair and, letting down the lid of the desk, I\r\nopened the drawer designated. It was full to the top. I needed but three\r\npackages, which I knew how to recognize, and began searching for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was straining my eyes in the effort to read the superscriptions when\r\nI seemed to hear, or, rather, feel, something rustle back of me. I paid\r\nno attention, believing that a draught from the window was moving some\r\ndrapery. But in a minute or so another movement, almost imperceptible,\r\nsent a strangely disagreeable little shiver over my skin. It was so\r\nstupid to be affected, even slightly, that self-respect prevented my\r\nturning around. I had just found the second package I needed and was\r\nabout to lay my hand on the third when a long and painful sigh, uttered\r\njust at my shoulder, made me bound like a madman from my seat and land\r\nseveral feet off. As I jumped I had turned round my hand on the hilt of\r\nmy sword, and, truly, if I had not felt it at my side I should have\r\ntaken to my heels like a coward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tall woman dressed in white, stood gazing at me from the back of the\r\nchair where I had been sitting an instant before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a shudder ran through all my limbs that I nearly fell backward. No\r\none who has not experienced it can understand that frightful,\r\nunreasoning terror! The mind becomes vague, the heart ceases to beat,\r\nthe entire body grows as limp as a sponge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe in ghosts, nevertheless I collapsed from a hideous\r\ndread of the dead, and I suffered, oh! I suffered in a few moments more\r\nthan in all the rest of my life from the irresistible terror of the\r\nsupernatural. If she had not spoken I should have died perhaps. But she\r\nspoke, she spoke in a sweet, sad voice that set my nerves vibrating. I\r\ndare not say that I became master of myself and recovered my reason. No!\r\nI was terrified and scarcely knew what I was doing. But a certain innate\r\npride, a remnant of soldierly instinct, made me, almost in spite of\r\nmyself, maintain a bold front. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, sir, you can render me a great service.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to reply, but it was impossible for me to pronounce a word.\r\nOnly a vague sound came from my throat. She continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Will you? You can save me, cure me. I suffer frightfully. I suffer,\r\noh! how I suffer!' and she slowly seated herself in my armchair, still\r\nlooking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Will you?' she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI nodded in assent, my voice still being paralyzed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she held out to me a tortoise-shell comb and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Comb my hair, oh! comb my hair; that will cure me; it must be combed.\r\nLook at my head\xe2\x80\x94how I suffer; and my hair pulls so!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer hair, unbound, very long and very black, it seemed to me, hung over\r\nthe back of the armchair and touched the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did I promise? Why did I take that comb with a shudder, and why did\r\nI hold in my hands her long black hair that gave my skin a frightful\r\ncold sensation, as though I were handling snakes? I cannot tell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sensation has remained in my fingers, and I still tremble in\r\nrecalling it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI combed her hair. I handled, I know not how, those icy locks. I\r\ntwisted, knotted, and unknotted, and braided them. She sighed, bowed her\r\nhead, seemed happy. Suddenly she said, 'Thank you!' snatched the comb\r\nfrom my hands and fled by the door that I had noticed ajar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft alone, I experienced for several seconds the horrible agitation of\r\none who awakens from a nightmare. At length I regained my senses. I ran\r\nto the window and with a mighty effort burst open the shutters, letting\r\na flood of light into the room. Immediately I sprang to the door by\r\nwhich that being had departed. I found it closed and immovable!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the mad desire to flee overcame me like a panic the panic which\r\nsoldiers know in battle. I seized the three packets of letters on the\r\nopen desk, ran from the room, dashed down the stairs four steps at a\r\ntime, found myself outside, I know not how, and, perceiving my horse a\r\nfew steps off, leaped into the saddle and galloped away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stopped only when I reached Rouen and alighted at my lodgings.\r\nThrowing the reins to my orderly, I fled to my room and shut myself in\r\nto reflect. For an hour I anxiously asked myself if I were not the\r\nvictim of a hallucination. Undoubtedly I had had one of those\r\nincomprehensible nervous attacks those exaltations of mind that give\r\nrise to visions and are the stronghold of the supernatural. And I was\r\nabout to believe I had seen a vision, had a hallucination, when, as I\r\napproached the window, my eyes fell, by chance, upon my breast. My\r\nmilitary cape was covered with long black hairs! One by one, with\r\ntrembling fingers, I plucked them off and threw them away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI then called my orderly. I was too disturbed, too upset to go and see\r\nmy friend that day, and I also wished to reflect more fully upon what I\r\nought to tell him. I sent him his letters, for which he gave the soldier\r\na receipt. He asked after me most particularly, and, on being told I was\r\nill\xe2\x80\x94had had a sunstroke\xe2\x80\x94appeared exceedingly anxious. Next morning I\r\nwent to him, determined to tell him the truth. He had gone out the\r\nevening before and had not yet returned. I called again during the day;\r\nmy friend was still absent. After waiting a week longer without news of\r\nhim, I notified the authorities and a judicial search was instituted.\r\nNot the slightest trace of his whereabouts or manner of disappearance\r\nwas discovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA minute inspection of the abandoned chateau revealed nothing of a\r\nsuspicious character. There was no indication that a woman had been\r\nconcealed there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter fruitless researches all further efforts were abandoned, and for\r\nfifty-six years I have heard nothing; I know no more than before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 8.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOCHETTE\r\n\r\nHow strange those old recollections are which haunt us, without our\r\nbeing able to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nThis one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so\r\nvividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many\r\nsinister things, which were either affecting or terrible, that I am\r\nastonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of\r\nMother Bellflower recurring to my mind's eye, just as I knew her\r\nformerly, now so long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.\r\n\r\nShe was an old seamstress who came to my parents' house once a week,\r\nevery Thursday, to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those\r\ncountry houses called chateaux, which are merely old houses with gable\r\nroofs, to which are attached three or four farms lying around them.\r\n\r\nThe village, a large village, almost a market town, was a few hundred\r\nyards away, closely circling the church, a red brick church, black with\r\nage.\r\n\r\nWell, every Thursday Mother Clochette came between half-past six and\r\nseven in the morning, and went immediately into the linen-room and began\r\nto work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she\r\nhad a beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard,\r\ngrowing in improbable tufts, in curly bunches which looked as if they\r\nhad been sown by a madman over that great face of a gendarme in\r\npetticoats. She had them on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on\r\nher chin, on her cheeks; and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily\r\nthick and long, and quite gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like\r\na pair of mustaches stuck on there by mistake.\r\n\r\nShe limped, not as lame people generally do, but like a ship at anchor.\r\nWhen she planted her great, bony, swerving body on her sound leg, she\r\nseemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then suddenly\r\nshe dipped as if to disappear in an abyss, and buried herself in the\r\nground. Her walk reminded one of a storm, as she swayed about, and her\r\nhead, which was always covered with an enormous white cap, whose ribbons\r\nfluttered down her back, seemed to traverse the horizon from north to\r\nsouth and from south to north, at each step.\r\n\r\nI adored Mother Clochette. As soon as I was up I went into the linen-\r\nroom where I found her installed at work, with a foot-warmer under her\r\nfeet. As soon as I arrived, she made me take the foot-warmer and sit\r\nupon it, so that I might not catch cold in that large, chilly room under\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat draws the blood from your throat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to me.\r\n\r\nShe told me stories, whilst mending the linen with her long crooked\r\nnimble fingers; her eyes behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had\r\nimpaired her sight, appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.\r\n\r\nShe had, as far as I can remember the things which she told me and by\r\nwhich my childish heart was moved, the large heart of a poor woman. She\r\ntold me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the\r\ncow-house and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper\r\nMalet's windmill, looking at the sails turning, or about a hen's egg\r\nwhich had been found in the church belfry without any one being able to\r\nunderstand what creature had been there to lay it, or the story of Jean-\r\nJean Pila's dog, who had been ten leagues to bring back his master's\r\nbreeches which a tramp had stolen whilst they were hanging up to dry out\r\nof doors, after he had been in the rain. She told me these simple\r\nadventures in such a manner, that in my mind they assumed the\r\nproportions of never-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious\r\npoems; and the ingenious stories invented by the poets which my mother\r\ntold me in the evening, had none of the flavor, none of the breadth or\r\nvigor of the peasant woman's narratives.\r\n\r\nWell, one Tuesday, when I had spent all the morning in listening to\r\nMother Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during the day\r\nafter picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm.\r\nI remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.\r\n\r\nOn opening the door of the linen-room, I saw the old seamstress lying on\r\nthe ground by the side of her chair, with her face to the ground and her\r\narms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of\r\nmy shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer\r\none, no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles\r\nglistened against the wall, as they had rolled away from her.\r\n\r\nI ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few\r\nminutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred\r\nmy childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing-room and hid\r\nmyself in a dark corner, in the depths of an immense old armchair, where\r\nI knelt down and wept. I remained there a long time, no doubt, for night\r\ncame on. Suddenly somebody came in with a lamp, without seeing me,\r\nhowever, and I heard my father and mother talking with the medical man,\r\nwhose voice I recognized.\r\n\r\nHe had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the causes of\r\nthe accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down\r\nand had a glass of liqueur and a biscuit.\r\n\r\nHe went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my\r\nmind until I die! I think that I can give the exact words which he used.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe poor woman! She broke her leg the day of my arrival\r\nhere, and I had not even had time to wash my hands after getting off the\r\ndiligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a bad case,\r\nvery bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was seventeen, and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would any one\r\nbelieve it? I have never told her story before, and nobody except myself\r\nand one other person who is no longer living in this part of the country\r\never knew it. Now that she is dead, I may be less discreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust then a young assistant-teacher came to live in the village; he was\r\na handsome, well-made fellow, and looked like a non-commissioned\r\nofficer. All the girls ran after him, but he paid no attention to them,\r\npartly because he was very much afraid of his superior, the\r\nschoolmaster, old Grabu, who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Grabu already employed pretty Hortense who has just died here, and\r\nwho was afterwards nicknamed Clochette. The assistant master singled out\r\nthe pretty young girl, who was, no doubt, flattered at being chosen by\r\nthis impregnable conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and\r\nhe succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the hay-\r\nloft behind the school, at night, after she had done her day's sewing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left\r\nthe Grabus' she went upstairs and hid among the hay, to wait for her\r\nlover. He soon joined her, and was beginning to say pretty things to\r\nher, when the door of the hay-loft opened and the schoolmaster appeared,\r\nand asked: 'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?' Feeling sure that\r\nhe would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and\r\nreplied stupidly: 'I came up here to rest a little amongst the bundles\r\nof hay, Monsieur Grabu.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe loft was very large and absolutely dark, and Sigisbert pushed the\r\nfrightened girl to the further end and said: 'Go over there and hide\r\nyourself. I shall lose my position, so get away and hide yourself.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the schoolmaster heard the whispering, he continued: 'Why, you are\r\nnot by yourself?' 'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!' 'But you are not, for you\r\nare talking.' 'I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.' 'I will soon find out,'\r\nthe old man replied, and double locking the door, he went down to get a\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the young man, who was a coward such as one frequently meets, lost\r\nhis head, and becoming furious all of a sudden, he repeated: 'Hide\r\nyourself, so that he may not find you. You will keep me from making a\r\nliving for the rest of my life; you will ruin my whole career. Do hide\r\nyourself!' They could hear the key turning in the lock again, and\r\nHortense ran to the window which looked out on the street, opened it\r\nquickly, and then said in a low and determined voice: 'You will come and\r\npick me up when he is gone,' and she jumped out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Grabu found nobody, and went down again in great surprise, and a\r\nquarter of an hour later, Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his\r\nadventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall unable to get\r\nup, as she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to\r\nfetch her. It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate\r\ngirl home with me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the\r\nbones had come trough the flesh. She did not complain, and merely said,\r\nwith admirable resignation: 'I am punished, well punished!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent for assistance and for the work-girl's relatives and told them\r\na, made-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and\r\nlamed her outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a\r\nwhole month tried in vain to find the author of this accident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all! And I say that this woman was a heroine and belonged to\r\nthe race of those who accomplish the grandest deeds of history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr,\r\na noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not absolutely\r\nadmire her, I should not have told you this story, which I would never\r\ntell any one during her life; you understand why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor ceased. Mamma cried and papa said some words which I did not\r\ncatch; then they left the room and I remained on my knees in the\r\narmchair and sobbed, whilst I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps\r\nand something knocking against the side of the staircase.\r\n\r\nThey were carrying away Clochette's body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KISS\r\n\r\nMy Little Darling: So you are crying from morning until night and from\r\nnight until morning, because your husband leaves you; you do not know\r\nwhat to do and so you ask your old aunt for advice; you must consider\r\nher quite an expert. I don't know as much as you think I do, and yet I\r\nam not entirely ignorant of the art of loving, or, rather, of making\r\none's self loved, in which you are a little lacking. I can admit that at\r\nmy age.\r\n\r\nYou say that you are all attention, love, kisses and caresses for him.\r\nPerhaps that is the very trouble; I think you kiss him too much.\r\n\r\nMy dear, we have in our hands the most terrible power in the world:\r\nLOVE.\r\n\r\nMan is gifted with physical strength, and he exercises force. Woman is\r\ngifted with charm, and she rules with caresses. It is our weapon,\r\nformidable and invincible, but we should know how to use it.\r\n\r\nKnow well that we are the mistresses of the world! To tell the history\r\nof Love from the beginning of the world would be to tell the history of\r\nman himself: Everything springs from it, the arts, great events,\r\ncustoms, wars, the overthrow of empires.\r\n\r\nIn the Bible you find Delila, Judith; in fables we find Omphale, Helen;\r\nin history the Sabines, Cleopatra and many others.\r\n\r\nTherefore we reign supreme, all-powerful. But, like kings, we must make\r\nuse of delicate diplomacy.\r\n\r\nLove, my dear, is made up of imperceptible sensations. We know that it\r\nis as strong as death, but also as frail as glass. The slightest shock\r\nbreaks it, and our power crumbles, and we are never able to raise it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWe have the power of making ourselves adored, but we lack one tiny\r\nthing, the understanding of the various kinds of caresses. In embraces\r\nwe lose the sentiment of delicacy, while the man over whom we rule\r\nremains master of himself, capable of judging the foolishness of certain\r\nwords. Take care, my dear; that is the defect in our armor. It is our\r\nAchilles' heel.\r\n\r\nDo you know whence comes our real power? From the kiss, the kiss alone!\r\nWhen we know how to hold out and give up our lips we can become queens.\r\n\r\nThe kiss is only a preface, however, but a charming preface. More\r\ncharming than the realization itself. A preface which can always be read\r\nover again, whereas one cannot always read over the book.\r\n\r\nYes, the meeting of lips is the most perfect, the most divine sensation\r\ngiven to human beings, the supreme limit of happiness: It is in the kiss\r\nalone that one sometimes seems to feel this union of souls after which\r\nwe strive, the intermingling of hearts, as it were.\r\n\r\nDo you remember the verses of Sully-Prudhomme:\r\n\r\nCaresses are nothing but anxious bliss, Vain attempts of love to unite\r\nsouls through a kiss.\r\n\r\nOne caress alone gives this deep sensation of two beings welded into one\r\n\xe2\x80\x94it is the kiss. No violent delirium of complete possession is worth\r\nthis trembling approach of the lips, this first moist and fresh contact,\r\nand then the long, lingering, motionless rapture.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my dear, the kiss is our strongest weapon, but we must take\r\ncare not to dull it. Do not forget that its value is only relative,\r\npurely conventional. It continually changes according to circumstances,\r\nthe state of expectancy and the ecstasy of the mind. I will call\r\nattention to one example.\r\n\r\nAnother poet, Francois Coppee, has written a line which we all remember,\r\na line which we find delightful, which moves our very hearts.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the expectancy of a lover, waiting in a room one\r\nwinter's evening, his anxiety, his nervous impatience, the terrible fear\r\nof not seeing her, he describes the arrival of the beloved woman, who at\r\nlast enters hurriedly, out of breath, bringing with her part of the\r\nwinter breeze, and he exclaims:\r\n\r\nOh! the taste of the kisses first snatched through the veil.\r\n\r\nIs that not a line of exquisite sentiment, a delicate and charming\r\nobservation, a perfect truth? All those who have hastened to a\r\nclandestine meeting, whom passion has thrown into the arms of a man,\r\nwell do they know these first delicious kisses through the veil; and\r\nthey tremble at the memory of them. And yet their sole charm lies in the\r\ncircumstances, from being late, from the anxious expectancy, but from\r\nthe purely\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, impurely, if you prefer\xe2\x80\x94sensual point of view,\r\nthey are detestable.\r\n\r\nThink! Outside it is cold. The young woman has walked quickly; the veil\r\nis moist from her cold breath. Little drops of water shine in the lace.\r\nThe lover seizes her and presses his burning lips to her liquid breath.\r\nThe moist veil, which discolors and carries the dreadful odor of\r\nchemical dye, penetrates into the young man's mouth, moistens his\r\nmustache. He does not taste the lips of his beloved, he tastes the dye\r\nof this lace moistened with cold breath. And yet, like the poet, we\r\nwould all exclaim:\r\n\r\nOh! the taste of the kisses first snatched through the veil.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the value of this caress being entirely a matter of\r\nconvention, we must be careful not to abuse it.\r\n\r\nWell, my dear, I have several times noticed that you are very clumsy.\r\nHowever, you were not alone in that fault; the majority of women lose\r\ntheir authority by abusing the kiss with untimely kisses. When they feel\r\nthat their husband or their lover is a little tired, at those times when\r\nthe heart as well as the body needs rest, instead of understanding what\r\nis going on within him, they persist in giving inopportune caresses,\r\ntire him by the obstinacy of begging lips and give caresses lavished\r\nwith neither rhyme nor reason.\r\n\r\nTrust in the advice of my experience. First, never kiss your husband in\r\npublic, in the train, at the restaurant. It is bad taste; do not give in\r\nto your desires. He would feel ridiculous and would never forgive you.\r\n\r\nBeware of useless kisses lavished in intimacy. I am sure that you abuse\r\nthem. For instance, I remember one day that you did something quite\r\nshocking. Probably you do not remember it.\r\n\r\nAll three of us were together in the drawing-room, and, as you did not\r\nstand on ceremony before me, your husband was holding you on his knees\r\nand kissing you at great length on the neck, the lips and throat.\r\nSuddenly you exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! the fire!\xe2\x80\x9d You had been paying no attention\r\nto it, and it was almost out. A few lingering embers were glowing on the\r\nhearth. Then he rose, ran to the woodbox, from which he dragged two\r\nenormous logs with great difficulty, when you came to him with begging\r\nlips, murmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss me!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned his head with difficulty and tried to hold up the\r\nlogs at the same time. Then you gently and slowly placed your mouth on\r\nthat of the poor fellow, who remained with his neck out of joint, his\r\nsides twisted, his arms almost dropping off, trembling with fatigue and\r\ntired from his desperate effort. And you kept drawing out this torturing\r\nkiss, without seeing or understanding. Then when you freed him, you\r\nbegan to grumble: \xe2\x80\x9cHow badly you kiss!\xe2\x80\x9d No wonder!\r\n\r\nOh, take care of that! We all have this foolish habit, this unconscious\r\nneed of choosing the most inconvenient moments. When he is carrying a\r\nglass of water, when he is putting on his shoes, when he is tying his\r\nscarf\xe2\x80\x94in short, when he finds himself in any uncomfortable position\r\n\xe2\x80\x94then is the time which we choose for a caress which makes him stop for\r\na whole minute in the middle of a gesture with the sole desire of\r\ngetting rid of us!\r\n\r\nDo not think that this criticism is insignificant. Love, my dear, is a\r\ndelicate thing. The least little thing offends it; know that everything\r\ndepends on the tact of our caresses. An ill-placed kiss may do any\r\namount of harm.\r\n\r\nTry following my advice.\r\n\r\nYour old aunt, COLLETTE.\r\n\r\nThis story appeared in the Gaulois in November, 1882, under the\r\npseudonym of \xe2\x80\x9cMaufrigneuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGION OF HONOR\r\n\r\nHOW HE GOT THE LEGION OF HONOR\r\n\r\nFrom the time some people begin to talk they seem to have an\r\novermastering desire or vocation.\r\n\r\nEver since he was a child, M. Caillard had only had one idea in his head\r\n\xe2\x80\x94to wear the ribbon of an order. When he was still quite a small boy he\r\nused to wear a zinc cross of the Legion of Honor pinned on his tunic,\r\njust as other children wear a soldier's cap, and he took his mother's\r\nhand in the street with a proud air, sticking out his little chest with\r\nits red ribbon and metal star so that it might show to advantage.\r\n\r\nHis studies were not a success, and he failed in his examination for\r\nBachelor of Arts; so, not knowing what to do, he married a pretty girl,\r\nas he had plenty of money of his own.\r\n\r\nThey lived in Paris, as many rich middle-class people do, mixing with\r\ntheir own particular set, and proud of knowing a deputy, who might\r\nperhaps be a minister some day, and counting two heads of departments\r\namong their friends.\r\n\r\nBut M. Caillard could not get rid of his one absorbing idea, and he felt\r\nconstantly unhappy because he had not the right to wear a little bit of\r\ncolored ribbon in his buttonhole.\r\n\r\nWhen he met any men who were decorated on the boulevards, he looked at\r\nthem askance, with intense jealousy. Sometimes, when he had nothing to\r\ndo in the afternoon, he would count them, and say to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cJust let\r\nme see how many I shall meet between the Madeleine and the Rue Drouot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he would walk slowly, looking at every coat with a practiced eye\r\nfor the little bit of red ribbon, and when he had got to the end of his\r\nwalk he always repeated the numbers aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight officers and seventeen knights. As many as that! It is stupid to\r\nsow the cross broadcast in that fashion. I wonder how many I shall meet\r\ngoing back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he returned slowly, unhappy when the crowd of passers-by interfered\r\nwith his vision.\r\n\r\nHe knew the places where most were to be found. They swarmed in the\r\nPalais Royal. Fewer were seen in the Avenue de l'Opera than in the Rue\r\nde la Paix, while the right side of the boulevard was more frequented by\r\nthem than the left.\r\n\r\nThey also seemed to prefer certain cafes and theatres. Whenever he saw a\r\ngroup of white-haired old gentlemen standing together in the middle of\r\nthe pavement, interfering with the traffic, he used to say to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are officers of the Legion of Honor,\xe2\x80\x9d and he felt inclined to take\r\noff his hat to them.\r\n\r\nHe had often remarked that the officers had a different bearing to the\r\nmere knights. They carried their head differently, and one felt that\r\nthey enjoyed a higher official consideration and a more widely extended\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the worthy man would be seized with a furious hatred\r\nfor every one who was decorated; he felt like a Socialist toward them.\r\n\r\nThen, when he got home, excited at meeting so many crosses\xe2\x80\x94just as a\r\npoor, hungry wretch might be on passing some dainty provision shop\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nused to ask in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall we get rid of this wretched government?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd his wife would be surprised, and ask:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am indignant,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cat the injustice I see going on around\r\nus. Oh, the Communards were certainly right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he would go out again and look at the shops where the\r\ndecorations were sold, and he examined all the emblems of various shapes\r\nand colors. He would have liked to possess them all, and to have walked\r\ngravely at the head of a procession, with his crush hat under his arm\r\nand his breast covered with decorations, radiant as a star, amid a buzz\r\nof admiring whispers and a hum of respect.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! he had no right to wear any decoration whatever.\r\n\r\nHe used to say to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is really too difficult for any man to\r\nobtain the Legion of Honor unless he is some public functionary. Suppose\r\nI try to be appointed an officer of the Academy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he did not know how to set about it, and spoke on the subject to his\r\nwife, who was stupefied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOfficer of the Academy! What have you done to deserve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got angry. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I am talking about. I only want to know how\r\nto set about it. You are quite stupid at times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right. I don't understand anything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn idea struck him: \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you were to speak to M. Rosselin, the\r\ndeputy; he might be able to advise me. You understand I cannot broach\r\nthe subject to him directly. It is rather difficult and delicate, but\r\ncoming from you it might seem quite natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Caillard did what he asked her, and M. Rosselin promised to speak\r\nto the minister about it; and then Caillard began to worry him, till the\r\ndeputy told him he must make a formal application and put forward his\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were his charms?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was not even a Bachelor of Arts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHowever, he set to work and produced a pamphlet, with the title, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nPeople's Right to Instruction,\xe2\x80\x9d but he could not finish it for want of\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nHe sought for easier subjects, and began several in succession. The\r\nfirst was, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Instruction of Children by Means of the Eye.\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted\r\ngratuitous theatres to be established in every poor quarter of Paris for\r\nlittle children. Their parents were to take them there when they were\r\nquite young, and, by means of a magic lantern, all the notions of human\r\nknowledge were to be imparted to them. There were to be regular courses.\r\nThe sight would educate the mind, while the pictures would remain\r\nimpressed on the brain, and thus science would, so to say, be made\r\nvisible. What could be more simple than to teach universal history,\r\nnatural history, geography, botany, zoology, anatomy, etc., etc., in\r\nthis manner?\r\n\r\nHe had his ideas printed in pamphlets, and sent a copy to each deputy,\r\nten to each minister, fifty to the President of the Republic, ten to\r\neach Parisian, and five to each provincial newspaper.\r\n\r\nThen he wrote on \xe2\x80\x9cStreet Lending-Libraries.\xe2\x80\x9d His idea was to have little\r\npushcarts full of books drawn about the streets. Everyone would have a\r\nright to ten volumes a month in his home on payment of one sou.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people,\xe2\x80\x9d M. Caillard said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill only disturb itself for the sake\r\nof its pleasures, and since it will not go to instruction, instruction\r\nmust come to it,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc.\r\n\r\nHis essays attracted no attention, but he sent in his application, and\r\nhe got the usual formal official reply. He thought himself sure of\r\nsuccess, but nothing came of it.\r\n\r\nThen he made up his mind to apply personally. He begged for an interview\r\nwith the Minister of Public Instruction, and he was received by a young\r\nsubordinate, who was very grave and important, and kept touching the\r\nknobs of electric bells to summon ushers, and footmen, and officials\r\ninferior to himself. He declared to M. Caillard that his matter was\r\ngoing on quite favorably, and advised him to continue his remarkable\r\nlabors, and M. Caillard set at it again.\r\n\r\nM. Rosselin, the deputy, seemed now to take a great interest in his\r\nsuccess, and gave him a lot of excellent, practical advice. He, himself,\r\nwas decorated, although nobody knew exactly what he had done to deserve\r\nsuch a distinction.\r\n\r\nHe told Caillard what new studies he ought to undertake; he introduced\r\nhim to learned societies which took up particularly obscure points of\r\nscience, in the hope of gaining credit and honors thereby; and he even\r\ntook him under his wing at the ministry.\r\n\r\nOne day, when he came to lunch with his friend\xe2\x80\x94for several months past\r\nhe had constantly taken his meals there\xe2\x80\x94he said to him in a whisper as\r\nhe shook hands: \xe2\x80\x9cI have just obtained a great favor for you. The\r\nCommittee of Historical Works is going to intrust you with a commission.\r\nThere are some researches to be made in various libraries in France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaillard was so delighted that he could scarcely eat or drink, and a\r\nweek later he set out. He went from town to town, studying catalogues,\r\nrummaging in lofts full of dusty volumes, and was hated by all the\r\nlibrarians.\r\n\r\nOne day, happening to be at Rouen, he thought he should like to go and\r\nvisit his wife, whom he had not seen for more than a week, so he took\r\nthe nine o'clock train, which would land him at home by twelve at night.\r\n\r\nHe had his latchkey, so he went in without making any noise, delighted\r\nat the idea of the surprise he was going to give her. She had locked\r\nherself in. How tiresome! However, he cried out through the door:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanne, it is I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe must have been very frightened, for he heard her jump out of her bed\r\nand speak to herself, as if she were in a dream. Then she went to her\r\ndressing room, opened and closed the door, and went quickly up and down\r\nher room barefoot two or three times, shaking the furniture till the\r\nvases and glasses sounded. Then at last she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Alexander?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cmake haste and open the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had done so, she threw herself into his arms, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a fright! What a surprise! What a pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to undress himself methodically, as he did everything, and took\r\nfrom a chair his overcoat, which he was in the habit of hanging up in\r\nthe hall. But suddenly he remained motionless, struck dumb with\r\nastonishment\xe2\x80\x94there was a red ribbon in the buttonhole:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\xe2\x80\x94this\xe2\x80\x94this overcoat has got the ribbon in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a second, his wife threw herself on him, and, taking it from his\r\nhands, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! you have made a mistake\xe2\x80\x94give it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he still held it by one of the sleeves, without letting it go,\r\nrepeating in a half-dazed manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Why? Just explain\xe2\x80\x94Whose overcoat is it? It is not mine, as it has\r\nthe Legion of Honor on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to take it from him, terrified and hardly able to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen\xe2\x80\x94listen! Give it to me! I must not tell you! It is a secret.\r\nListen to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he grew angry and turned pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know how this overcoat comes to be here? It does not belong\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she almost screamed at him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it does; listen! Swear to me\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94you are decorated!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not intend to joke at his expense.\r\n\r\nHe was so overcome that he let the overcoat fall and dropped into an\r\narmchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x94you say I am\xe2\x80\x94decorated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it is a secret, a great secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had put the glorious garment into a cupboard, and came to her\r\nhusband pale and trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a new overcoat that I have had made for\r\nyou. But I swore that I would not tell you anything about it, as it will\r\nnot be officially announced for a month or six weeks, and you were not\r\nto have known till your return from your business journey. M. Rosselin\r\nmanaged it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosselin!\xe2\x80\x9d he contrived to utter in his joy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has obtained the\r\ndecoration for me? He\xe2\x80\x94Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he was obliged to drink a glass of water.\r\n\r\nA little piece of white paper fell to the floor out of the pocket of the\r\novercoat. Caillard picked it up; it was a visiting card, and he read\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosselin-Deputy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see how it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife.\r\n\r\nHe almost cried with joy, and, a week later, it was announced in the\r\nJournal Officiel that M. Caillard had been awarded the Legion of Honor\r\non account of his exceptional services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEST\r\n\r\nThe Bondels were a happy family, and although they frequently quarrelled\r\nabout trifles, they soon became friends again.\r\n\r\nBondel was a merchant who had retired from active business after saving\r\nenough to allow him to live quietly; he had rented a little house at\r\nSaint-Germain and lived there with his wife. He was a quiet man with\r\nvery decided opinions; he had a certain degree of education and read\r\nserious newspapers; nevertheless, he appreciated the gaulois wit.\r\nEndowed with a logical mind, and that practical common sense which is\r\nthe master quality of the industrial French bourgeois, he thought\r\nlittle, but clearly, and reached a decision only after careful\r\nconsideration of the matter in hand. He was of medium size, with a\r\ndistinguished look, and was beginning to turn gray.\r\n\r\nHis wife, who was full of serious qualities, had also several faults.\r\nShe had a quick temper and a frankness that bordered upon violence. She\r\nbore a grudge a long time. She had once been pretty, but had now become\r\ntoo stout and too red; but in her neighborhood at Saint-Germain she\r\nstill passed for a very beautiful woman, who exemplified health and an\r\nuncertain temper.\r\n\r\nTheir dissensions almost always began at breakfast, over some trivial\r\nmatter, and they often continued all day and even until the following\r\nday. Their simple, common, limited life imparted seriousness to the most\r\nunimportant matters, and every topic of conversation became a subject of\r\ndispute. This had not been so in the days when business occupied their\r\nminds, drew their hearts together, and gave them common interests and\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nBut at Saint-Germain they saw fewer people. It had been necessary to\r\nmake new acquaintances, to create for themselves a new world among\r\nstrangers, a new existence devoid of occupations. Then the monotony of\r\nloneliness had soured each of them a little; and the quiet happiness\r\nwhich they had hoped and waited for with the coming of riches did not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nOne June morning, just as they were sitting down to breakfast, Bondel\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the people who live in the little red cottage at the end of\r\nthe Rue du Berceau?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Bondel was out of sorts. She answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes and no; I am acquainted with them, but I do not care to know them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? They seem to be very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning I met the husband on the terrace and we took a little walk\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that there was danger in the air, Bendel added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was he who\r\nspoke to me first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife looked at him in a displeased manner. She continued: \xe2\x80\x9cYou would\r\nhave done just as well to avoid him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there are rumors about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! rumors such as one often hears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Bondel was, unfortunately, a little hasty. He exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you know that I abhor gossip. As for those people, I find them\r\nvery pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked testily: \xe2\x80\x9cThe wife also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes; although I have barely seen her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe discussion gradually grew more heated, always on the same subject\r\nfor lack of others. Madame Bondel obstinately refused to say what she\r\nhad heard about these neighbors, allowing things to be understood\r\nwithout saying exactly what they were. Bendel would shrug his shoulders,\r\ngrin, and exasperate his wife. She finally cried out: \xe2\x80\x9cWell! that\r\ngentleman is deceived by his wife, there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe husband answered quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cI can't see how that affects the honor of\r\na man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed dumfounded: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you don't see?\xe2\x80\x94you don't see?\xe2\x80\x94well, that's\r\ntoo much! You don't see!\xe2\x80\x94why, it's a public scandal! he is disgraced!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! by no means! Should a man be considered disgraced\r\nbecause he is deceived, because he is betrayed, robbed? No, indeed! I'll\r\ngrant you that that may be the case for the wife, but as for him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe became furious, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cFor him as well as for her. They are\r\nboth in disgrace; it's a public shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBondel, very calm, asked: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, is it true? Who can assert such\r\na thing as long as no one has been caught in the act?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Bondel was growing uneasy; she snapped: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Who can assert it?\r\nWhy, everybody! everybody! it's as clear as the nose on your face.\r\nEverybody knows it and is talking about it. There is not the slightest\r\ndoubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was grinning: \xe2\x80\x9cFor a long time people thought that the sun revolved\r\naround the earth. This man loves his wife and speaks of her tenderly and\r\nreverently. This whole business is nothing but lies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStamping her foot, she stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that that fool, that\r\nidiot, knows anything about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBondel did not grow angry; he was reasoning clearly: \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me. This\r\ngentleman is no fool. He seemed to me, on the contrary, to be very\r\nintelligent and shrewd; and you can't make me believe that a man with\r\nbrains doesn't notice such a thing in his own house, when the neighbors,\r\nwho are not there, are ignorant of no detail of this liaison\xe2\x80\x94for I'll\r\nwarrant that they know everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Bondel had a fit of angry mirth, which irritated her husband's\r\nnerves. She laughed: \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha! they're all the same! There's not a\r\nman alive who could discover a thing like that unless his nose was stuck\r\ninto it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe discussion was wandering to other topics now. She was exclaiming\r\nover the blindness of deceived husbands, a thing which he doubted and\r\nwhich she affirmed with such airs of personal contempt that he finally\r\ngrew angry. Then the discussion became an angry quarrel, where she took\r\nthe side of the women and he defended the men. He had the conceit to\r\ndeclare: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I swear that if I had ever been deceived, I should have\r\nnoticed it, and immediately, too. And I should have taken away your\r\ndesire for such things in such a manner that it would have taken more\r\nthan one doctor to set you on foot again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoiling with anger, she cried out to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou! you! why, you're as big\r\na fool as the others, do you hear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe still maintained: \xe2\x80\x9cI can swear to you that I am not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed so impertinently that he felt his heart beat and a chill run\r\ndown his back. For the third time he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have seen it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, still laughing in the same manner. She slammed the door and\r\nleft the room, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWell! if that isn't too much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBondel remained alone, ill at ease. That insolent, provoking laugh had\r\ntouched him to the quick. He went outside, walked, dreamed. The\r\nrealization of the loneliness of his new life made him sad and morbid.\r\nThe neighbor, whom he had met that morning, came to him with\r\noutstretched hands. They continued their walk together. After touching\r\non various subjects they came to talk of their wives. Both seemed to\r\nhave something to confide, something inexpressible, vague, about these\r\nbeings associated with their lives; their wives. The neighbor was\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, at times, one might think that they bear some particular ill-\r\nwill toward their husband, just because he is a husband. I love my\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94I love her very much; I appreciate and respect her; well! there are\r\ntimes when she seems to have more confidence and faith in our friends\r\nthan in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBondel immediately thought: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt; my wife was right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he left this man he began to think things over again. He felt in\r\nhis soul a strange confusion of contradictory ideas, a sort of interior\r\nburning; that mocking, impertinent laugh kept ringing in his ears and\r\nseemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy; you are just the same as the others, you fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThat was indeed bravado, one of those pieces of impudence of which a\r\nwoman makes use when she dares everything, risks everything, to wound\r\nand humiliate the man who has aroused her ire. This poor man must also\r\nbe one of those deceived husbands, like so many others. He had said\r\nsadly: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are times when she seems to have more confidence and faith\r\nin our friends than in me.\xe2\x80\x9d That is how a husband formulated his\r\nobservations on the particular attentions of his wife for another man.\r\nThat was all. He had seen nothing more. He was like the rest\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\nrest!\r\n\r\nAnd how strangely Bondel's own wife had laughed as she said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou, too\r\n\xe2\x80\x94you, too.\xe2\x80\x9d How wild and imprudent these creatures are who can arouse\r\nsuch suspicions in the heart for the sole purpose of revenge!\r\n\r\nHe ran over their whole life since their marriage, reviewed his mental\r\nlist of their acquaintances, to see whether she had ever appeared to\r\nshow more confidence in any one else than in himself. He never had\r\nsuspected any one, he was so calm, so sure of her, so confident.\r\n\r\nBut, now he thought of it, she had had a friend, an intimate friend, who\r\nfor almost a year had dined with them three times a week. Tancret, good\r\nold Tancret, whom he, Bendel, loved as a brother and whom he continued\r\nto see on the sly, since his wife, he did not know why, had grown angry\r\nat the charming fellow.\r\n\r\nHe stopped to think, looking over the past with anxious eyes. Then he\r\ngrew angry at himself for harboring this shameful insinuation of the\r\ndefiant, jealous, bad ego which lives in all of us. He blamed and\r\naccused himself when he remembered the visits and the demeanor of this\r\nfriend whom his wife had dismissed for no apparent reason. But,\r\nsuddenly, other memories returned to him, similar ruptures due to the\r\nvindictive character of Madame Bondel, who never pardoned a slight. Then\r\nhe laughed frankly at himself for the doubts which he had nursed; and he\r\nremembered the angry looks of his wife as he would tell her, when he\r\nreturned at night: \xe2\x80\x9cI saw good old Tancret, and he wished to be\r\nremembered to you,\xe2\x80\x9d and he reassured himself.\r\n\r\nShe would invariably answer: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see that gentleman you can tell\r\nhim that I can very well dispense with his remembrances.\xe2\x80\x9d With what an\r\nirritated, angry look she would say these words! How well one could feel\r\nthat she did not and would not forgive\xe2\x80\x94and he had suspected her even for\r\na second? Such foolishness!\r\n\r\nBut why did she grow so angry? She never had given the exact reason for\r\nthis quarrel. She still bore him that grudge! Was it?\xe2\x80\x94But no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nBondel declared that he was lowering himself by even thinking of such\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nYes, he was undoubtedly lowering himself, but he could not help thinking\r\nof it, and he asked himself with terror if this thought which had\r\nentered into his mind had not come to stop, if he did not carry in his\r\nheart the seed of fearful torment. He knew himself; he was a man to\r\nthink over his doubts, as formerly he would ruminate over his commercial\r\noperations, for days and nights, endlessly weighing the pros and the\r\ncons.\r\n\r\nHe was already becoming excited; he was walking fast and losing his\r\ncalmness. A thought cannot be downed. It is intangible, cannot be\r\ncaught, cannot be killed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a plan occurred to him; it was bold, so bold that at first he\r\ndoubted whether he would carry it out.\r\n\r\nEach time that he met Tancret, his friend would ask for news of Madame\r\nBondel, and Bondel would answer: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is still a little angry.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing\r\nmore. Good Lord! What a fool he had been! Perhaps!\r\n\r\nWell, he would take the train to Paris, go to Tancret, and bring him\r\nback with him that very evening, assuring him that his wife's mysterious\r\nanger had disappeared. But how would Madame Bondel act? What a scene\r\nthere would be! What anger! what scandal! What of it?\xe2\x80\x94that would be\r\nrevenge! When she should come face to face with him, unexpectedly, he\r\ncertainly ought to be able to read the truth in their expressions.\r\n\r\nHe immediately went to the station, bought his ticket, got into the car,\r\nand as soon as he felt him self being carried away by the train, he felt\r\na fear, a kind of dizziness, at what he was going to do. In order not to\r\nweaken, back down, and return alone, he tried not to think of the matter\r\nany longer, to bring his mind to bear on other affairs, to do what he\r\nhad decided to do with a blind resolution; and he began to hum tunes\r\nfrom operettas and music halls until he reached Paris.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he found himself walking along the streets that led to\r\nTancret's, he felt like stopping, He paused in front of several shops,\r\nnoticed the prices of certain objects, was interested in new things,\r\nfelt like taking a glass of beer, which was not his usual custom; and as\r\nhe approached his friend's dwelling he ardently hoped not meet him. But\r\nTancret was at home, alone, reading. He jumped up in surprise, crying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Bondel! what luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBondel, embarrassed, answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear fellow, I happened to be in\r\nParis, and I thought I'd drop in and shake hands with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's very nice, very nice! The more so that for some time you have\r\nnot favored me with your presence very often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see\xe2\x80\x94even against one's will, one is often influenced by\r\nsurrounding conditions, and as my wife seemed to bear you some ill-will\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJove! 'seemed'\xe2\x80\x94she did better than that, since she showed me the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the reason? I never heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! nothing at all\xe2\x80\x94a bit of foolishness\xe2\x80\x94a discussion in which we did\r\nnot both agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what was the subject of this discussion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady of my acquaintance, whom you may perhaps know by name, Madame\r\nBoutin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! really. Well, I think that my wife has forgotten her grudge, for\r\nthis very morning she spoke to me of you in very pleasant terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTancret started and seemed so dumfounded that for a few minutes he could\r\nfind nothing to say. Then he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cShe spoke of me\xe2\x80\x94in pleasant terms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am. I am not dreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then\xe2\x80\x94as I was coming to Paris I thought that I would please you by\r\ncoming to tell you the good news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes\xe2\x80\x94why, yes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBondel appeared to hesitate; then, after a short pause, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\neven had an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take you back home with me to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTancret, who was naturally prudent, seemed a little worried by this\r\nproposition, and he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! really\xe2\x80\x94is it possible? Are we not\r\nexposing ourselves to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94a scene?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, you know, Madame Bendel bears malice for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I can assure you that she no longer bears you any ill\xe2\x80\x94will. I\r\nam even convinced that it will be a great pleasure for her to see you\r\nthus, unexpectedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, really!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then! let us go along. I am delighted. You see, this\r\nmisunderstanding was very unpleasant for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey set out together toward the Saint-Lazare station, arm in arm. They\r\nmade the trip in silence. Both seemed absorbed in deep meditation.\r\nSeated in the car, one opposite the other, they looked at each other\r\nwithout speaking, each observing that the other was pale.\r\n\r\nThen they left the train and once more linked arms as if to unite\r\nagainst some common danger. After a walk of a few minutes they stopped,\r\na little out of breath, before Bondel's house. Bondel ushered his friend\r\ninto the parlor, called the servant, and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cIs madame at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease ask her to come down at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey dropped into two armchairs and waited. Both were filled with the\r\nsame longing to escape before the appearance of the much-feared person.\r\n\r\nA well-known, heavy tread could be heard descending the stairs. A hand\r\nmoved the knob, and both men watched the brass handle turn. Then the\r\ndoor opened wide, and Madame Bondel stopped and looked to see who was\r\nthere before she entered. She looked, blushed, trembled, retreated a\r\nstep, then stood motionless, her cheeks aflame and her hands resting\r\nagainst the sides of the door frame.\r\n\r\nTancret, as pale as if about to faint, had arisen, letting fall his hat,\r\nwhich rolled along the floor. He stammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu\xe2\x80\x94madame\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94I thought\xe2\x80\x94I ventured\xe2\x80\x94I was so sorry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she did not answer, he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWill you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, quickly, carried away by some impulse, she walked toward him with\r\nher hands outstretched; and when he had taken, pressed, and held these\r\ntwo hands, she said, in a trembling, weak little voice, which was new to\r\nher husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear friend\xe2\x80\x94how happy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bondel, who was watching them, felt an icy chill run over him, as if\r\nhe had been dipped in a cold bath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUND ON A DROWNED MAN\r\n\r\nMadame, you ask me whether I am laughing at you? You cannot believe that\r\na man has never been in love. Well, then, no, no, I have never loved,\r\nnever!\r\n\r\nWhy is this? I really cannot tell. I have never experienced that\r\nintoxication of the heart which we call love! Never have I lived in that\r\ndream, in that exaltation, in that state of madness into which the image\r\nof a woman casts us. I have never been pursued, haunted, roused to fever\r\nheat, lifted up to Paradise by the thought of meeting, or by the\r\npossession of, a being who had suddenly become for me more desirable\r\nthan any good fortune, more beautiful than any other creature, of more\r\nconsequence than the whole world! I have never wept, I have never\r\nsuffered on account of any of you. I have not passed my nights\r\nsleepless, while thinking of her. I have no experience of waking\r\nthoughts bright with thought and memories of her. I have never known the\r\nwild rapture of hope before her arrival, or the divine sadness of regret\r\nwhen she went from me, leaving behind her a delicate odor of violet\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nI have never been in love.\r\n\r\nI have also often asked myself why this is. And truly I can scarcely\r\ntell. Nevertheless I have found some reasons for it; but they are of a\r\nmetaphysical character, and perhaps you will not be able to appreciate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI suppose I am too critical of women to submit to their fascination. I\r\nask you to forgive me for this remark. I will explain what I mean. In\r\nevery creature there is a moral being and a physical being. In order to\r\nlove, it would be necessary for me to find a harmony between these two\r\nbeings which I have never found. One always predominates; sometimes the\r\nmoral, sometimes the physical.\r\n\r\nThe intellect which we have a right to require in a woman, in order to\r\nlove her, is not the same as the virile intellect. It is more, and it is\r\nless. A woman must be frank, delicate, sensitive, refined,\r\nimpressionable. She has no need of either power or initiative in\r\nthought, but she must have kindness, elegance, tenderness, coquetry and\r\nthat faculty of assimilation which, in a little while, raises her to an\r\nequality with him who shares her life. Her greatest quality must be\r\ntact, that subtle sense which is to the mind what touch is to the body.\r\nIt reveals to her a thousand little things, contours, angles and forms\r\non the plane of the intellectual.\r\n\r\nVery frequently pretty women have not intellect to correspond with their\r\npersonal charms. Now, the slightest lack of harmony strikes me and pains\r\nme at the first glance. In friendship this is not of importance.\r\nFriendship is a compact in which one fairly shares defects and merits.\r\nWe may judge of friends, whether man or woman, giving them credit for\r\nwhat is good, and overlooking what is bad in them, appreciating them at\r\ntheir just value, while giving ourselves up to an intimate, intense and\r\ncharming sympathy.\r\n\r\nIn order to love, one must be blind, surrender one's self absolutely,\r\nsee nothing, question nothing, understand nothing. One must adore the\r\nweakness as well as the beauty of the beloved object, renounce all\r\njudgment, all reflection, all perspicacity.\r\n\r\nI am incapable of such blindness and rebel at unreasoning subjugation.\r\nThis is not all. I have such a high and subtle idea of harmony that\r\nnothing can ever fulfill my ideal. But you will call me a madman. Listen\r\nto me. A woman, in my opinion, may have an exquisite soul and charming\r\nbody without that body and that soul being in perfect harmony with one\r\nanother. I mean that persons who have noses made in a certain shape\r\nshould not be expected to think in a certain fashion. The fat have no\r\nright to make use of the same words and phrases as the thin. You, who\r\nhave blue eyes, madame, cannot look at life and judge of things and\r\nevents as if you had black eyes. The shade of your eyes should\r\ncorrespond, by a sort of fatality, with the shade of your thought. In\r\nperceiving these things, I have the scent of a bloodhound. Laugh if you\r\nlike, but it is so.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, once I imagined that I was in love for an hour, for a day. I\r\nhad foolishly yielded to the influence of surrounding circumstances. I\r\nallowed myself to be beguiled by a mirage of Dawn. Would you like me to\r\ntell you this short story?\r\n\r\nI met, one evening, a pretty, enthusiastic little woman who took a\r\npoetic fancy to spend a night with me in a boat on a river. I would have\r\npreferred a room and a bed; however, I consented to the river and the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of June. My fair companion chose a moonlight night\r\nin order the better to stimulate her imagination.\r\n\r\nWe had dined at a riverside inn and set out in the boat about ten\r\no'clock. I thought it a rather foolish kind of adventure, but as my\r\ncompanion pleased me I did not worry about it. I sat down on the seat\r\nfacing her; I seized the oars, and off we starred.\r\n\r\nI could not deny that the scene was picturesque. We glided past a wooded\r\nisle full of nightingales, and the current carried us rapidly over the\r\nriver covered with silvery ripples. The tree toads uttered their shrill,\r\nmonotonous cry; the frogs croaked in the grass by the river's bank, and\r\nthe lapping of the water as it flowed on made around us a kind of\r\nconfused murmur almost imperceptible, disquieting, and gave us a vague\r\nsensation of mysterious fear.\r\n\r\nThe sweet charm of warm nights and of streams glittering in the\r\nmoonlight penetrated us. It was delightful to be alive and to float\r\nalong thus, and to dream and to feel at one's side a sympathetic and\r\nbeautiful young woman.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat affected, somewhat agitated, somewhat intoxicated by the\r\npale brightness of the night and the consciousness of my proximity to a\r\nlovely woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit beside me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nI obeyed.\r\n\r\nShe went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecite some poetry for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeared to be rather too much. I declined; she persisted. She\r\ncertainly wanted to play the game, to have a whole orchestra of\r\nsentiment, from the moon to the rhymes of poets. In the end I had to\r\nyield, and, as if in mockery, I repeated to her a charming little poem\r\nby Louis Bouilhet, of which the following are the last verses:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate the poet who with tearful eye Murmurs some name while gazing\r\ntow'rds a star, Who sees no magic in the earth or sky, Unless Lizette or\r\nNinon be not far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bard who in all Nature nothing sees Divine, unless a petticoat he\r\nties Amorously to the branches of the trees Or nightcap to the grass, is\r\nscarcely wise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not heard the Eternal's thunder tone, The voice of Nature in her\r\nvarious moods, Who cannot tread the dim ravines alone, And of no woman\r\ndream mid whispering woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI expected some reproaches. Nothing of the sort. She murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow true it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was astonished. Had she understood?\r\n\r\nOur boat had gradually approached the bank and become entangled in the\r\nbranches of a willow which impeded its progress. I placed my arm round\r\nmy companion's waist, and very gently approached my lips towards her\r\nneck. But she repulsed me with an abrupt, angry movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done, pray! How rude you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried to draw her toward me. She resisted, caught hold of the tree,\r\nand was near flinging us both into the water. I deemed it prudent to\r\ncease my importunities.\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather capsize you. I feel so happy. I want to dream. This is\r\nso delightful.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, in a slightly malicious tone, she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you already forgotten the verses you repeated to me just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was right. I became silent.\r\n\r\nShe went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I plied the oars once more.\r\n\r\nI began to think the night long and my position ridiculous.\r\n\r\nMy companion said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you make me a promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo remain quiet, well-behaved and discreet, if I permit you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Say what you mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is what I mean: I want to lie down on my back at the bottom of the\r\nboat with you by my side. But I forbid you to touch me, to embrace me\r\n\xe2\x80\x94in short\xe2\x80\x94to caress me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI promised. She said warningly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you move, 'I'll capsize the boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then we lay down side by side, our eyes turned toward the sky, while\r\nthe boat glided slowly through the water. We were rocked by its gentle\r\nmotion. The slight sounds of the night came to us more distinctly in the\r\nbottom of the boat, sometimes causing us to start. And I felt springing\r\nup within me a strange, poignant emotion, an infinite tenderness,\r\nsomething like an irresistible impulse to open my arms in order to\r\nembrace, to open my heart in order to love, to give myself, to give my\r\nthoughts, my body, my life, my entire being to some one.\r\n\r\nMy companion murmured, like one in a dream:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we; Where are we going? It seems to me that I am leaving the\r\nearth. How sweet it is! Ah, if you loved me\xe2\x80\x94a little!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart began to throb. I had no answer to give. It seemed to me that I\r\nloved her. I had no longer any violent desire. I felt happy there by her\r\nside, and that was enough for me.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we remained for a long, long time without stirring. We had\r\nclasped each other's hands; some delightful force rendered us\r\nmotionless, an unknown force stronger than ourselves, an alliance,\r\nchaste, intimate, absolute, of our beings lying there side by side,\r\nbelonging to each other without contact. What was this? How do I know?\r\nLove, perhaps?\r\n\r\nLittle by little the dawn appeared. It was three o'clock in the morning.\r\nSlowly a great brightness spread over the sky. The boat knocked up\r\nagainst something. I rose up. We had come close to a tiny islet.\r\n\r\nBut I remained enchanted, in an ecstasy. Before us stretched the\r\nfirmament, red, pink, violet, spotted with fiery clouds resembling\r\ngolden vapor. The river was glowing with purple and three houses on one\r\nside of it seemed to be burning.\r\n\r\nI bent toward my companion. I was going to say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! look!\xe2\x80\x9d But I held\r\nmy tongue, quite dazed, and I could no longer see anything except her.\r\nShe, too, was rosy, with rosy flesh tints with a deeper tinge that was\r\npartly a reflection of the hue of the sky. Her tresses were rosy; her\r\neyes were rosy; her teeth were rosy; her dress, her laces, her smile,\r\nall were rosy. And in truth I believed, so overpowering was the\r\nillusion, that the dawn was there in the flesh before me.\r\n\r\nShe rose softly to her feet, holding out her lips to me; and I moved\r\ntoward her, trembling, delirious feeling indeed that I was going to kiss\r\nHeaven, to kiss happiness, to kiss a dream that had become a woman, to\r\nkiss the ideal which had descended into human flesh.\r\n\r\nShe said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a caterpillar in your hair.\xe2\x80\x9d And, suddenly, I\r\nfelt as sad as if I had lost all hope in life.\r\n\r\nThat is all, madame. It is puerile, silly, stupid. But I am sure that\r\nsince that day it would be impossible for me to love. And yet\xe2\x80\x94who can\r\ntell?\r\n\r\n[The young man upon whom this letter was found was yesterday taken out\r\nof the Seine between Bougival and Marly. An obliging bargeman, who had\r\nsearched the pockets in order to ascertain the name of the deceased,\r\nbrought this paper to the author.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORPHAN\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Source had adopted this boy under very sad circumstances.\r\nShe was at the time thirty-six years old. Being disfigured through\r\nhaving as a child slipped off her nurse's lap into the fireplace and\r\nburned her face shockingly, she had determined not to marry, for she did\r\nnot want any man to marry her for her money.\r\n\r\nA neighbor of hers, left a widow just before her child was born, died in\r\ngiving birth, without leaving a sou. Mademoiselle Source took the new-\r\nborn child, put him out to nurse, reared him, sent him to a boarding-\r\nschool, then brought him home in his fourteenth year, in order to have\r\nin her empty house somebody who would love her, who would look after\r\nher, and make her old age pleasant.\r\n\r\nShe had a little country place four leagues from Rennes, and she now\r\ndispensed with a servant; her expenses having increased to more than\r\ndouble since this orphan's arrival, her income of three thousand francs\r\nwas no longer sufficient to support three persons.\r\n\r\nShe attended to the housekeeping and cooking herself, and sent out the\r\nboy on errands, letting him also occupy himself in cultivating the\r\ngarden. He was gentle, timid, silent, and affectionate. And she\r\nexperienced a deep happiness, a fresh happiness when he kissed her\r\nwithout surprise or horror at her disfigurement. He called her \xe2\x80\x9cAunt,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand treated her as a mother.\r\n\r\nIn the evening they both sat down at the fireside, and she made nice\r\nlittle dainties for him. She heated some wine and toasted a slice of\r\nbread, and it made a charming little meal before going to bed. She often\r\ntook him on her knees and covered him with kisses, murmuring tender\r\nwords in his ear. She called him: \xe2\x80\x9cMy little flower, my cherub, my\r\nadored angel, my divine jewel.\xe2\x80\x9d He softly accepted her caresses, hiding\r\nhis head on the old maid's shoulder. Although he was now nearly fifteen,\r\nhe had remained small and weak, and had a rather sickly appearance.\r\n\r\nSometimes Mademoiselle Source took him to the city, to see two married\r\nfemale relatives of hers, distant cousins, who were living in the\r\nsuburbs, and who were the only members of her family in existence. The\r\ntwo women had always found fault with her, for having adopted this boy,\r\non account of the inheritance; but for all that, they gave her a cordial\r\nwelcome, having still hopes of getting a share for themselves, a third,\r\nno doubt, if what she possessed were only equally divided.\r\n\r\nShe was happy, very happy, always occupied with her adopted child. She\r\nbought books for him to improve his mind, and he became passionately\r\nfond of reading.\r\n\r\nHe no longer climbed on her knee to pet her as he had formerly done;\r\nbut, instead, would go and sit down in his little chair in the chimney-\r\ncorner and open a volume. The lamp placed at the edge of the Tittle\r\ntable above his head shone on his curly hair, and on a portion of his\r\nforehead; he did not move, he did not raise his eyes or make any\r\ngesture. He read on, interested, entirely absorbed in the story he was\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nSeated opposite to him, she would gaze at him earnestly, astonished at\r\nhis studiousness, often on the point of bursting into tears.\r\n\r\nShe said to him occasionally: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will fatigue yourself, my treasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhoping that he would raise his head, and come across to embrace her; but\r\nhe did not even answer her; he had not heard or understood what she was\r\nsaying; he paid no attention to anything save what he read in those\r\npages.\r\n\r\nFor two years he devoured an incalculable number of volumes. His\r\ncharacter changed.\r\n\r\nAfter this, he asked Mademoiselle Source several times for money, which\r\nshe gave him. As he always wanted more, she ended by refusing, for she\r\nwas both methodical and decided, and knew how to act rationally when it\r\nwas necessary to do so. By dint of entreaties he obtained a large sum\r\nfrom her one night; but when he begged her for more a few days later,\r\nshe showed herself inflexible, and did not give way to him further, in\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be satisfied with her decision.\r\n\r\nHe again became quiet, as he had formerly been, remaining seated for\r\nentire hours, without moving, plunged in deep reverie. He now did not\r\neven talk to Madame Source, merely answering her remarks with short,\r\nformal words. Nevertheless, he was agreeable and attentive in his manner\r\ntoward her; but he never embraced her now.\r\n\r\nShe had by this time grown slightly afraid of him when they sat facing\r\none another at night on opposite sides of the fireplace. She wanted to\r\nwake him up, to make him say something, no matter what, that would break\r\nthis dreadful silence, which was like the darkness of a wood. But he did\r\nnot appear to listen to her, and she shuddered with the terror of a poor\r\nfeeble woman when she had spoken to him five or six times successively\r\nwithout being able to get a word out of him.\r\n\r\nWhat was the matter with him? What was going on in that closed-up head?\r\nWhen she had remained thus two or three hours opposite him, she felt as\r\nif she were going insane, and longed to rush away and to escape into the\r\nopen country in order to avoid that mute, eternal companionship and also\r\nsome vague danger, which she could not define, but of which she had a\r\npresentiment.\r\n\r\nShe frequently wept when she was alone. What was the matter with him?\r\nWhen she expressed a wish, he unmurmuringly carried it into execution.\r\nWhen she wanted anything brought from the city, he immediately went\r\nthere to procure it. She had no complaint to make of him; no, indeed!\r\nAnd yet\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnother year flitted by, and it seemed to her that a fresh change had\r\ntaken place in the mind of the young man. She perceived it; she felt it;\r\nshe divined it. How? No matter! She was sure she was not mistaken; but\r\nshe could not have explained in what manner the unknown thoughts of this\r\nstrange youth had changed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that, until now, he had been like a person in a\r\nhesitating frame of mind, who had suddenly arrived at a determination.\r\nThis idea came to her one evening as she met his glance, a fixed,\r\nsingular glance which she had not seen in his face before.\r\n\r\nThen he commenced to watch her incessantly, and she wished she could\r\nhide herself in order to avoid that cold eye riveted on her.\r\n\r\nHe kept staring at her, evening after evening, for hours together, only\r\naverting his eyes when she said, utterly unnerved:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not look at me like that, my child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he would lower his head.\r\n\r\nBut the moment her back was turned she once more felt that his eyes were\r\nupon her. Wherever she went, he pursued her with his persistent gaze.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when she was walking in her little garden, she suddenly\r\nnoticed him hidden behind a bush, as if he were lying in wait for her;\r\nand, again, when she sat in front of the house mending stockings while\r\nhe was digging some vegetable bed, he kept continually watching her in a\r\nsurreptitious manner, as he worked.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that she asked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter with you, my boy? For the last three years, you have\r\nbecome very different. I don't recognize you. Do tell me what ails you,\r\nand what you are thinking of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe invariably replied, in a quiet, weary tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nothing ails me, aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when she persisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my child, answer me, answer me when I speak to you. If you knew\r\nwhat grief you caused me, you would always answer, and you would not\r\nlook at me that way. Have you any trouble? Tell me! I'll comfort you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went away, with a tired air, murmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is nothing the matter with me, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not grown much, having always a childish look, although his\r\nfeatures were those of a man. They were, however, hard and badly cut. He\r\nseemed incomplete, abortive, only half finished, and disquieting as a\r\nmystery. He was a self-contained, unapproachable being, in whom there\r\nseemed always to be some active, dangerous mental labor going on.\r\nMademoiselle Source was quite conscious of all this, and she could not\r\nsleep at night, so great was her anxiety. Frightful terrors, dreadful\r\nnightmares assailed her. She shut herself up in her own room, and\r\nbarricaded the door, tortured by fear.\r\n\r\nWhat was she afraid of? She could not tell.\r\n\r\nShe feared everything, the night, the walls, the shadows thrown by the\r\nmoon on the white curtains of the windows, and, above all, she feared\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nWhat had she to fear? Did she know what it was?\r\n\r\nShe could live this way no longer! She felt certain that a misfortune\r\nthreatened her, a frightful misfortune.\r\n\r\nShe set forth secretly one morning, and went into the city to see her\r\nrelatives. She told them about the matter in a gasping voice. The two\r\nwomen thought she was going mad and tried to reassure her.\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew the way he looks at me from morning till night. He never\r\ntakes his eyes off me! At times, I feel a longing to cry for help, to\r\ncall in the neighbors, so much am I afraid. But what could I say to\r\nthem? He does nothing but look at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two female cousins asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he ever brutal to you? Does he give you sharp answers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never; he does everything I wish; he works hard: he is steady; but\r\nI am so frightened that I care nothing for that. He is planning\r\nsomething, I am certain of that\xe2\x80\x94quite certain. I don't care to remain\r\nall alone like that with him in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe relatives, astonished at her words, declared that people would be\r\namazed, would not understand; and they advised her to keep silent about\r\nher fears and her plans, without, however, dissuading her from coming to\r\nreside in the city, hoping in that way that the entire inheritance would\r\neventually fall into their hands.\r\n\r\nThey even promised to assist her in selling her house, and in finding\r\nanother, near them.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Source returned home. But her mind was so much upset that\r\nshe trembled at the slightest noise, and her hands shook whenever any\r\ntrifling disturbance agitated her.\r\n\r\nTwice she went again to consult her relatives, quite determined now not\r\nto remain any longer in this way in her lonely dwelling. At last, she\r\nfound a little cottage in the suburbs, which suited her, and she\r\nprivately bought it.\r\n\r\nThe signature of the contract took place on a Tuesday morning, and\r\nMademoiselle Source devoted the rest of the day to the preparations for\r\nher change of residence.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock in the evening she got into the diligence which passed\r\nwithin a few hundred yards of her house, and she told the conductor to\r\nput her down in the place where she usually alighted. The man called out\r\nto her as he whipped his horses:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Mademoiselle Source\xe2\x80\x94good night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied as she walked on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Pere Joseph.\xe2\x80\x9d Next morning, at half-past seven, the\r\npostman who conveyed letters to the village noticed at the cross-road,\r\nnot far from the high road, a large splash of blood not yet dry. He said\r\nto himself: \xe2\x80\x9cHallo! some boozer must have had a nose bleed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he perceived ten paces farther on a pocket handkerchief also stained\r\nwith blood. He picked it up. The linen was fine, and the postman, in\r\nalarm, made his way over to the ditch, where he fancied he saw a strange\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Source was lying at the bottom on the grass, her throat cut\r\nwith a knife.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the gendarmes, the examining magistrate, and other\r\nauthorities made an inquiry as to the cause of death.\r\n\r\nThe two female relatives, called as witnesses, told all about the old\r\nmaid's fears and her last plans.\r\n\r\nThe orphan was arrested. After the death of the woman who had adopted\r\nhim, he wept from morning till night, plunged, at least to all\r\nappearance, in the most violent grief.\r\n\r\nHe proved that he had spent the evening up to eleven o'clock in a cafe.\r\nTen persons had seen him, having remained there till his departure.\r\n\r\nThe driver of the diligence stated that he had set down the murdered\r\nwoman on the road between half-past nine and ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe accused was acquitted. A will, drawn up a long time before, which\r\nhad been left in the hands of a notary in Rennes, made him sole heir. So\r\nhe inherited everything.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, the people of the country boycotted him, as they still\r\nsuspected him. His house, that of the dead woman, was looked upon as\r\naccursed. People avoided him in the street.\r\n\r\nBut he showed himself so good-natured, so open, so familiar, that\r\ngradually these horrible doubts were forgotten. He was generous,\r\nobliging, ready to talk to the humblest about anything, as long as they\r\ncared to talk to him.\r\n\r\nThe notary, Maitre Rameau, was one of the first to take his part,\r\nattracted by his smiling loquacity. He said at a dinner, at the tax\r\ncollector's house:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man who speaks with such facility and who is always in good humor\r\ncould not have such a crime on his conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTouched by his argument, the others who were present reflected, and they\r\nrecalled to mind the long conversations with this man who would almost\r\ncompel them to stop at the road corners to listen to his ideas, who\r\ninsisted on their going into his house when they were passing by his\r\ngarden, who could crack a joke better than the lieutenant of the\r\ngendarmes himself, and who possessed such contagious gaiety that, in\r\nspite of the repugnance with which he inspired them, they could not keep\r\nfrom always laughing in his company.\r\n\r\nAll doors were opened to him after a time.\r\n\r\nHe is to-day the mayor of his township.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGGAR He had seen better days, despite his present misery and\r\ninfirmities.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifteen both his legs had been crushed by a carriage on\r\nthe Varville highway. From that time forth he begged, dragging himself\r\nalong the roads and through the farmyards, supported by crutches which\r\nforced his shoulders up to his ears. His head looked as if it were\r\nsqueezed in between two mountains.\r\n\r\nA foundling, picked up out of a ditch by the priest of Les Billettes on\r\nthe eve of All Saints' Day and baptized, for that reason, Nicholas\r\nToussaint, reared by charity, utterly without education, crippled in\r\nconsequence of having drunk several glasses of brandy given him by the\r\nbaker (such a funny story!) and a vagabond all his life afterward\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nonly thing he knew how to do was to hold out his hand for alms.\r\n\r\nAt one time the Baroness d'Avary allowed him to sleep in a kind of\r\nrecess spread with straw, close to the poultry yard in the farm\r\nadjoining the chateau, and if he was in great need he was sure of\r\ngetting a glass of cider and a crust of bread in the kitchen. Moreover,\r\nthe old lady often threw him a few pennies from her window. But she was\r\ndead now.\r\n\r\nIn the villages people gave him scarcely anything\xe2\x80\x94he was too well known.\r\nEverybody had grown tired of seeing him, day after day for forty years,\r\ndragging his deformed and tattered person from door to door on his\r\nwooden crutches. But he could not make up his mind to go elsewhere,\r\nbecause he knew no place on earth but this particular corner of the\r\ncountry, these three or four villages where he had spent the whole of\r\nhis miserable existence. He had limited his begging operations and would\r\nnot for worlds have passed his accustomed bounds.\r\n\r\nHe did not even know whether the world extended for any distance beyond\r\nthe trees which had always bounded his vision. He did not ask himself\r\nthe question. And when the peasants, tired of constantly meeting him in\r\ntheir fields or along their lanes, exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't you go to other\r\nvillages instead of always limping about here?\xe2\x80\x9d he did not answer, but\r\nslunk away, possessed with a vague dread of the unknown\xe2\x80\x94the dread of a\r\npoor wretch who fears confusedly a thousand things\xe2\x80\x94new faces, taunts,\r\ninsults, the suspicious glances of people who do not know him and the\r\npolicemen walking in couples on the roads. These last he always\r\ninstinctively avoided, taking refuge in the bushes or behind heaps of\r\nstones when he saw them coming.\r\n\r\nWhen he perceived them in the distance, 'With uniforms gleaming in the\r\nsun, he was suddenly possessed with unwonted agility\xe2\x80\x94the agility of a\r\nwild animal seeking its lair. He threw aside his crutches, fell to the\r\nground like a limp rag, made himself as small as possible and crouched\r\nlike a hare under cover, his tattered vestments blending in hue with the\r\nearth on which he cowered.\r\n\r\nHe had never had any trouble with the police, but the instinct to avoid\r\nthem was in his blood. He seemed to have inherited it from the parents\r\nhe had never known.\r\n\r\nHe had no refuge, no roof for his head, no shelter of any kind. In\r\nsummer he slept out of doors and in winter he showed remarkable skill in\r\nslipping unperceived into barns and stables. He always decamped before\r\nhis presence could be discovered. He knew all the holes through which\r\none could creep into farm buildings, and the handling of his crutches\r\nhaving made his arms surprisingly muscular he often hauled himself up\r\nthrough sheer strength of wrist into hay-lofts, where he sometimes\r\nremained for four or five days at a time, provided he had collected a\r\nsufficient store of food beforehand.\r\n\r\nHe lived like the beasts of the field. He was in the midst of men, yet\r\nknew no one, loved no one, exciting in the breasts of the peasants only\r\na sort of careless contempt and smoldering hostility. They nicknamed him\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBell,\xe2\x80\x9d because he hung between his two crutches like a church bell\r\nbetween its supports.\r\n\r\nFor two days he had eaten nothing. No one gave him anything now. Every\r\none's patience was exhausted. Women shouted to him from their doorsteps\r\nwhen they saw him coming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe off with you, you good-for-nothing vagabond! Why, I gave you a piece\r\nof bread only three days ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he turned on his crutches to the next house, where he was received\r\nin the same fashion.\r\n\r\nThe women declared to one another as they stood at their doors:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can't feed that lazy brute all the year round!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd yet the \xe2\x80\x9clazy brute\xe2\x80\x9d needed food every day.\r\n\r\nHe had exhausted Saint-Hilaire, Varville and Les Billettes without\r\ngetting a single copper or so much as a dry crust. His only hope was in\r\nTournolles, but to reach this place he would have to walk five miles\r\nalong the highroad, and he felt so weary that he could hardly drag\r\nhimself another yard. His stomach and his pocket were equally empty, but\r\nhe started on his way.\r\n\r\nIt was December and a cold wind blew over the fields and whistled\r\nthrough the bare branches of the trees; the clouds careered madly across\r\nthe black, threatening sky. The cripple dragged himself slowly along,\r\nraising one crutch after the other with a painful effort, propping\r\nhimself on the one distorted leg which remained to him.\r\n\r\nNow and then he sat down beside a ditch for a few moments' rest. Hunger\r\nwas gnawing his vitals, and in his confused, slow-working mind he had\r\nonly one idea-to eat-but how this was to be accomplished he did not\r\nknow. For three hours he continued his painful journey. Then at last the\r\nsight of the trees of the village inspired him with new energy.\r\n\r\nThe first peasant he met, and of whom he asked alms, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it's you again, is it, you old scamp? Shall I never be rid of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd \xe2\x80\x9cBell\xe2\x80\x9d went on his way. At every door he got nothing but hard words.\r\nHe made the round of the whole village, but received not a halfpenny for\r\nhis pains.\r\n\r\nThen he visited the neighboring farms, toiling through the muddy land,\r\nso exhausted that he could hardly raise his crutches from the ground. He\r\nmet with the same reception everywhere. It was one of those cold, bleak\r\ndays, when the heart is frozen and the temper irritable, and hands do\r\nnot open either to give money or food.\r\n\r\nWhen he had visited all the houses he knew, \xe2\x80\x9cBell\xe2\x80\x9d sank down in the\r\ncorner of a ditch running across Chiquet's farmyard. Letting his\r\ncrutches slip to the ground, he remained motionless, tortured by hunger,\r\nbut hardly intelligent enough to realize to the full his unutterable\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nHe awaited he knew not what, possessed with that vague hope which\r\npersists in the human heart in spite of everything. He awaited in the\r\ncorner of the farmyard in the biting December wind, some mysterious aid\r\nfrom Heaven or from men, without the least idea whence it was to arrive.\r\nA number of black hens ran hither and thither, seeking their food in the\r\nearth which supports all living things. Ever now and then they snapped\r\nup in their beaks a grain of corn or a tiny insect; then they continued\r\ntheir slow, sure search for nutriment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBell\xe2\x80\x9d watched them at first without thinking of anything. Then a\r\nthought occurred rather to his stomach than to his mind\xe2\x80\x94the thought that\r\none of those fowls would be good to eat if it were cooked over a fire of\r\ndead wood.\r\n\r\nHe did not reflect that he was going to commit a theft. He took up a\r\nstone which lay within reach, and, being of skillful aim, killed at the\r\nfirst shot the fowl nearest to him. The bird fell on its side, flapping\r\nits wings. The others fled wildly hither and thither, and \xe2\x80\x9cBell,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npicking up his crutches, limped across to where his victim lay.\r\n\r\nJust as he reached the little black body with its crimsoned head he\r\nreceived a violent blow in his back which made him let go his hold of\r\nhis crutches and sent him flying ten paces distant. And Farmer Chiquet,\r\nbeside himself with rage, cuffed and kicked the marauder with all the\r\nfury of a plundered peasant as \xe2\x80\x9cBell\xe2\x80\x9d lay defenceless before him.\r\n\r\nThe farm hands came up also and joined their master in cuffing the lame\r\nbeggar. Then when they were tired of beating him they carried him off\r\nand shut him up in the woodshed, while they went to fetch the police.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBell,\xe2\x80\x9d half dead, bleeding and perishing with hunger, lay on the floor.\r\nEvening came\xe2\x80\x94then night\xe2\x80\x94then dawn. And still he had not eaten.\r\n\r\nAbout midday the police arrived. They opened the door of the woodshed\r\nwith the utmost precaution, fearing resistance on the beggar's part, for\r\nFarmer Chiquet asserted that he had been attacked by him and had had\r\ngreat, difficulty in defending himself.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, get up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut \xe2\x80\x9cBell\xe2\x80\x9d could not move. He did his best to raise himself on his\r\ncrutches, but without success. The police, thinking his weakness\r\nfeigned, pulled him up by main force and set him between the crutches.\r\n\r\nFear seized him\xe2\x80\x94his native fear of a uniform, the fear of the game in\r\npresence of the sportsman, the fear of a mouse for a cat-and by the\r\nexercise of almost superhuman effort he succeeded in remaining upright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant. He walked. All the inmates of the farm\r\nwatched his departure. The women shook their fists at him the men\r\nscoffed at and insulted him. He was taken at last! Good riddance! He\r\nwent off between his two guards. He mustered sufficient energy\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nenergy of despair\xe2\x80\x94to drag himself along until the evening, too dazed to\r\nknow what was happening to him, too frightened to understand.\r\n\r\nPeople whom he met on the road stopped to watch him go by and peasants\r\nmuttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's some thief or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToward evening he reached the country town. He had never been so far\r\nbefore. He did not realize in the least what he was there for or what\r\nwas to become of him. All the terrible and unexpected events of the last\r\ntwo days, all these unfamiliar faces and houses struck dismay into his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHe said not a word, having nothing to say because he understood nothing.\r\nBesides, he had spoken to no one for so many years past that he had\r\nalmost lost the use of his tongue, and his thoughts were too\r\nindeterminate to be put into words.\r\n\r\nHe was shut up in the town jail. It did not occur to the police that he\r\nmight need food, and he was left alone until the following day. But when\r\nin the early morning they came to examine him he was found dead on the\r\nfloor. Such an astonishing thing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RABBIT\r\n\r\nOld Lecacheur appeared at the door of his house between five and a\r\nquarter past five in the morning, his usual hour, to watch his men going\r\nto work.\r\n\r\nHe was only half awake, his face was red, and with his right eye open\r\nand the left nearly closed, he was buttoning his braces over his fat\r\nstomach with some difficulty, at the same time looking into every corner\r\nof the farmyard with a searching glance. The sun darted its oblique rays\r\nthrough the beech trees by the side of the ditch and athwart the apple\r\ntrees outside, and was making the cocks crow on the dunghill, and the\r\npigeons coo on the roof. The smell of the cow stable came through the\r\nopen door, and blended in the fresh morning air with the pungent odor of\r\nthe stable, where the horses were neighing, with their heads turned\r\ntoward the light.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his trousers were properly fastened, Lecacheur came out, and\r\nwent, first of all, toward the hen house to count the morning's eggs,\r\nfor he had been afraid of thefts for some time; but the servant girl ran\r\nup to him with lifted arms and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster! master! they have stolen a rabbit during the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rabbit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, master, the big gray rabbit, from the hutch on the left\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nwhereupon the farmer completely opened his left eye, and said, simply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd off he went to inspect it. The hutch had been broken open and the\r\nrabbit was gone. Then he became thoughtful, closed his right eye again,\r\nand scratched his nose, and after a little consideration, he said to the\r\nfrightened girl, who was standing stupidly before her master:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and fetch the gendarmes; say I expect them as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLecacheur was mayor of the village, Pavigny-le-Gras, and ruled it like a\r\nmaster, on account of his money and position, and as soon as the servant\r\nhad disappeared in the direction of the village, which was only about\r\nfive hundred yards off, he went into the house to have his morning\r\ncoffee and to discuss the matter with his wife, whom he found on her\r\nknees in front of the fire, trying to make it burn quickly, and as soon\r\nas he got to the door, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody has stolen the gray rabbit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round so suddenly that she found herself sitting on the\r\nfloor, and looking at her husband with distressed eyes, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Cacheux? Somebody has stolen a rabbit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe big gray one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame! Who can have done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a little, thin, active, neat woman, who knew all about farming.\r\nLecacheur had his own ideas about the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be that fellow, Polyte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife got up suddenly and said in a furious voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did it! he did it! You need not look for any one else. He did it!\r\nYou have said it, Cacheux!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll her peasant's fury, all her avarice, all her rage of a saving woman\r\nagainst the man of whom she had always been suspicious, and against the\r\ngirl whom she had always suspected, showed themselves in the contraction\r\nof her mouth, and the wrinkles in the cheeks and forehead of her thin,\r\nexasperated face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have sent for the gendarmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Polyte was a laborer, who had been employed on the farm for a few\r\ndays, and who had been dismissed by Lecacheur for an insolent answer. He\r\nwas an old soldier, and was supposed to have retained his habits of *\r\nmarauding and debauchery from his campaigns in Africa. He did anything\r\nfor a livelihood, but whether he were a mason, a navvy, a reaper,\r\nwhether he broke stones or lopped trees, he was always lazy, and so he\r\nremained nowhere for long, and had, at times, to change his neighborhood\r\nto obtain work.\r\n\r\nFrom the first day that he came to the farm, Lecacheur's wife had\r\ndetested him, and now she was sure that he had committed the theft.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour the two gendarmes arrived. Brigadier Senateur was\r\nvery tall and thin, and Gendarme Lenient short and fat. Lecacheur made\r\nthem sit down, and told them the affair, and then they went and saw the\r\nscene of the theft, in order to verify the fact that the hutch had been\r\nbroken open, and to collect all the proofs they could. When they got\r\nback to the kitchen, the mistress brought in some wine, filled their\r\nglasses, and asked with a distrustful look:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you catch him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brigadier, who had his sword between his legs, appeared thoughtful.\r\nCertainly, he was sure of taking him, if he was pointed out to him, but\r\nif not, he could not answer for being able to discover him, himself, and\r\nafter reflecting for a long time, he put this simple question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Lecacheur replied, with a look of Normandy slyness in his eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for knowing him, I do not, as I did not see him commit the theft. If\r\nI had seen him, I should have made him eat it raw, skin and flesh,\r\nwithout a drop of cider to wash it down. But as for saying who it is, I\r\ncannot, although I believe it is that good-for-nothing Polyte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he related at length his troubles with Polyte, his leaving his\r\nservice, his bad reputation, things which had been told him,\r\naccumulating insignificant and minute proofs, and then, the brigadier,\r\nwho had been listening very attentively while he emptied his glass and\r\nfilled it again with an indifferent air, turned to his gendarme and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go and look in the cottage of Severin's wife.\xe2\x80\x9d At which the\r\ngendarme smiled and nodded three times.\r\n\r\nThen Madame Lecacheur came to them, and very quietly, with all a\r\npeasant's cunning, questioned the brigadier in her turn. That shepherd\r\nSeverin, a simpleton, a sort of brute who had been brought up and had\r\ngrown up among his bleating flocks, and who knew scarcely anything\r\nbesides them in the world, had nevertheless preserved the peasant's\r\ninstinct for saving, at the bottom of his heart. For years and years he\r\nmust have hidden in hollow trees and crevices in the rocks all that he\r\nearned, either as a shepherd or by curing animals' sprains\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\nbonesetter's secret had been handed down to him by the old shepherd\r\nwhose place he took-by touch or word, and one day he bought a small\r\nproperty, consisting of a cottage and a field, for three thousand\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nA few months later it became known that he was going to marry a servant,\r\nnotorious for her bad morals, the innkeeper's servant. The young fellows\r\nsaid that the girl, knowing that he was pretty well off, had been to his\r\ncottage every night, and had taken him, captured him, led him on to\r\nmatrimony, little by little night by night.\r\n\r\nAnd then, having been to the mayor's office and to church, she now lived\r\nin the house which her man had bought, while he continued to tend his\r\nflocks, day and night, on the plains.\r\n\r\nAnd the brigadier added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolyte has been sleeping there for three weeks, for the thief has no\r\nplace of his own to go to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gendarme made a little joke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe takes the shepherd's blankets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lecacheur, who was seized by a fresh access of rage, of rage\r\nincreased by a married woman's anger against debauchery, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is she, I am sure. Go there. Ah, the blackguard thieves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the brigadier was quite unmoved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne minute,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us wait until twelve o'clock, as he goes and\r\ndines there every day. I shall catch them with it under their noses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gendarme smiled, pleased at his chief's idea, and Lecacheur also\r\nsmiled now, for the affair of the shepherd struck him as very funny;\r\ndeceived husbands are always a joke.\r\n\r\nTwelve o'clock had just struck when the brigadier, followed by his man,\r\nknocked gently three times at the door of a little lonely house,\r\nsituated at the corner of a wood, five hundred yards from the village.\r\n\r\nThey had been standing close against the wall, so as not to be seen from\r\nwithin, and they waited. As nobody answered, the brigadier knocked again\r\nin a minute or two. It was so quiet that the house seemed uninhabited;\r\nbut Lenient, the gendarme, who had very quick ears, said that he heard\r\nsomebody moving about inside, and then Senateur got angry. He would not\r\nallow any one to resist the authority of the law for a moment, and,\r\nknocking at the door with the hilt of his sword, he cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door, in the name of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs this order had no effect, he roared out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not obey, I shall smash the lock. I am the brigadier of the\r\ngendarmerie, by G\xe2\x80\x94! Here, Lenient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not finished speaking when the door opened and Senateur saw\r\nbefore him a fat girl, with a very red, blowzy face, with drooping\r\nbreasts, a big stomach and broad hips, a sort of animal, the wife of the\r\nshepherd Severin, and he went into the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to pay you a visit, as I want to make a little search,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, and he looked about him. On the table there was a plate, a jug of\r\ncider and a glass half full, which proved that a meal was in progress.\r\nTwo knives were lying side by side, and the shrewd gendarme winked at\r\nhis superior officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt smells good,\xe2\x80\x9d the latter said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne might swear that it was stewed rabbit,\xe2\x80\x9d Lenient added, much amused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have a glass of brandy?\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant woman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you; I only want the skin of the rabbit that you are eating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pretended not to understand, but she was trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat rabbit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brigadier had taken a seat, and was calmly wiping his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, you are not going to try and make us believe that you live\r\non couch grass. What were you eating there all by yourself for your\r\ndinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Nothing whatever, I swear to you. A mite of butter on my bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a novice, my good woman. A mite of butter on your bread. You\r\nare mistaken; you ought to have said: a mite of butter on the rabbit. By\r\nG\xe2\x80\x94, your butter smells good! It is special butter, extra good butter,\r\nbutter fit for a wedding; certainly, not household butter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gendarme was shaking with laughter, and repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot household butter certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Brigadier Senateur was a joker, all the gendarmes had grown\r\nfacetious, and the officer continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your butter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy butter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your butter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the jar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where is the butter jar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe brought out an old cup, at the bottom of which there was a layer of\r\nrancid salt butter, and the brigadier smelled of it, and said, with a\r\nshake of his head:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the same. I want the butter that smells of the rabbit. Come,\r\nLenient, open your eyes; look under the sideboard, my good fellow, and I\r\nwill look under the bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving shut the door, he went up to the bed and tried to move it; but it\r\nwas fixed to the wall, and had not been moved for more than half a\r\ncentury, apparently. Then the brigadier stooped, and made his uniform\r\ncrack. A button had flown off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLenient,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, brigadier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, my lad, and look under the bed; I am too tall. I will look\r\nafter the sideboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up and waited while his man executed his orders.\r\n\r\nLenient, who was short and stout, took off his kepi, laid himself on his\r\nstomach, and, putting his face on the floor, looked at the black cavity\r\nunder the bed, and then, suddenly, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, here we are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got? The rabbit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the thief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thief! Pull him out, pull him out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gendarme had put his arms under the bed and laid hold of something,\r\nand he was pulling with all his might, and at last a foot, shod in a\r\nthick boot, appeared, which he was holding in his right hand. The\r\nbrigadier took it, crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull! Pull!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Lenient, who was on his knees by that time, was pulling at the other\r\nleg. But it was a hard job, for the prisoner kicked out hard, and arched\r\nup his back under the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage! courage! pull! pull!\xe2\x80\x9d Senateur cried, and they pulled him with\r\nall their strength, so that the wooden slat gave way, and he came out as\r\nfar as his head; but at last they got that out also, and they saw the\r\nterrified and furious face of Polyte, whose arms remained stretched out\r\nunder the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull away!\xe2\x80\x9d the brigadier kept on exclaiming. Then they heard a strange\r\nnoise, and as the arms followed the shoulders, and the hands the arms,\r\nthey saw in the hands the handle of a saucepan, and at the end of the\r\nhandle the saucepan itself, which contained stewed rabbit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! good Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d the brigadier shouted in his delight, while\r\nLenient took charge of the man; the rabbit's skin, an overwhelming\r\nproof, was discovered under the mattress, and then the gendarmes\r\nreturned in triumph to the village with their prisoner and their booty.\r\n\r\nA week later, as the affair had made much stir, Lecacheur, on going into\r\nthe mairie to consult the schoolmaster, was told that the shepherd\r\nSeverin had been waiting for him for more than an hour, and he found him\r\nsitting on a chair in a corner, with his stick between his legs. When he\r\nsaw the mayor, he got up, took off his cap, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Maitre Cacheux\xe2\x80\x9d; and then he remained standing, timid and\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d the former said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is it, monsieur. Is it true that somebody stole one of your\r\nrabbits last week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is quite true, Severin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho stole the rabbit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolyte Ancas, the laborer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight! right! And is it also true that it was found under my bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, the rabbit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rabbit and then Polyte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my poor Severin, quite true, but who told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well everybody. I understand! And I suppose you know all about\r\nmarriages, as you marry people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith regard to one's rights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat rights?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe husband's rights and then the wife's rights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Then just tell me, M'sieu Cacheux, has my wife the right to go to\r\nbed with Polyte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, to go to bed with Polyte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, has she any right before the law, and, seeing that she is my wife,\r\nto go to bed with Polyte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course not, of course not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I catch him there again, shall I have the right to thrash him and\r\nher also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94why, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then; I will tell you why I want to know. One night last\r\nweek, as I had my suspicions, I came in suddenly, and they were not\r\nbehaving properly. I chucked Polyte out, to go and sleep somewhere else;\r\nbut that was all, as I did not know what my rights were. This time I did\r\nnot see them; I only heard of it from others. That is over, and we will\r\nnot say any more about it; but if I catch them again\xe2\x80\x94by G\xe2\x80\x94, if I catch\r\nthem again, I will make them lose all taste for such nonsense, Maitre\r\nCacheux, as sure as my name is Severin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS AVENGER\r\n\r\nWhen M. Antoine Leuillet married the widow, Madame Mathilde Souris, he\r\nhad already been in love with her for ten years.\r\n\r\nM. Souris has been his friend, his old college chum. Leuillet was very\r\nmuch attached to him, but thought he was somewhat of a simpleton. He\r\nwould often remark: \xe2\x80\x9cThat poor Souris who will never set the world on\r\nfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Souris married Miss Mathilde Duval, Leuillet was astonished and\r\nsomewhat annoyed, as he was slightly devoted to her, himself. She was\r\nthe daughter of a neighbor, a former proprietor of a draper's\r\nestablishment who had retired with quite a small fortune. She married\r\nSouris for his money.\r\n\r\nThen Leuillet thought he would start a flirtation with his friend's\r\nwife. He was a good-looking man, intelligent and also rich. He thought\r\nit would be all plain sailing, but he was mistaken. Then he really began\r\nto admire her with an admiration that his friendship for the husband\r\nobliged him to keep within the bounds of discretion, making him timid\r\nand embarrassed. Madame Souris believing that his presumptions had\r\nreceived a wholesome check now treated him as a good friend. This went\r\non for nine years.\r\n\r\nOne morning a messenger brought Leuillet a distracted note from the poor\r\nwoman. Souris had just died suddenly from the rupture of an aneurism. He\r\nwas dreadfully shocked, for they were just the same age. But almost\r\nimmediately a feeling of profound joy, of intense relief, of\r\nemancipation filled his being. Madame Souris was free.\r\n\r\nHe managed, however, to assume the sad, sympathetic expression that was\r\nappropriate, waited the required time, observed all social appearances.\r\nAt the end of fifteen months he married the widow.\r\n\r\nThis was considered to be a very natural, and even a generous action. It\r\nwas the act of a good friend of an upright man.\r\n\r\nHe was happy at last, perfectly happy.\r\n\r\nThey lived in the most cordial intimacy, having understood and\r\nappreciated each other from the first. They had no secrets from one\r\nanother and even confided to each other their most secret thoughts.\r\nLeuillet loved his wife now with a quiet and trustful affection; he\r\nloved her as a tender, devoted companion who is an equal and a\r\nconfidante. But there lingered in his mind a strange and inexplicable\r\nbitterness towards the defunct Souris, who had first been the husband of\r\nthis woman, who had had the flower of her youth and of her soul, and had\r\neven robbed her of some of her poetry. The memory of the dead husband\r\nmarred the happiness of the living husband, and this posthumous jealousy\r\ntormented his heart by day and by night.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was he talked incessantly of Souris, asked about a\r\nthousand personal and secret minutia, wanted to know all about his\r\nhabits and his person. And he sneered at him even in his grave,\r\nrecalling with self-satisfaction his whims, ridiculing his absurdities,\r\ndwelling on his faults.\r\n\r\nHe would call to his wife all over the house:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Mathilde!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would come, always smiling, knowing well that he would say something\r\nabout Souris and ready to flatter her new husband's inoffensive mania.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, do you remember one day how Souris insisted on explaining to\r\nme that little men always commanded more affection than big men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he made some remarks that were disparaging to the deceased, who was\r\na small man, and decidedly flattering to himself, Leuillet, who was a\r\ntall man.\r\n\r\nMme. Leuillet allowed him to think he was right, quite right, and she\r\nlaughed heartily, gently ridiculing her former husband for the sake of\r\npleasing the present one, who always ended by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, what a ninny that Souris was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were happy, quite happy, and Leuillet never ceased to show his\r\ndevotion to his wife.\r\n\r\nOne night, however, as they lay awake, Leuillet said as he kissed his\r\nwife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, dearie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Souris\xe2\x80\x94I don't exactly know how to say it\xe2\x80\x94was Souris very loving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a kiss for reply and murmured \xe2\x80\x9cNot as loving as you are,\r\nmon chat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was flattered in his self-love and continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been\xe2\x80\x94a ninny\xe2\x80\x94was he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply. She only smiled slyly and hid her face in her\r\nhusband's neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been a ninny and not\xe2\x80\x94not\xe2\x80\x94not smart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head slightly to imply, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not at all smart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been an awful nuisance, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time she was frank and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her again for this avowal and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a brute he was! You were not happy with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not always pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeuillet was delighted, forming in his mind a comparison, much in his\r\nown favor, between his wife's former and present position. He was silent\r\nfor a time, and then with a burst of laughter he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be frank, very frank with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, tell me truly did you never feel tempted to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94to deceive\r\nthat imbecile Souris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Leuillet said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d pretending to be shocked and hid her face\r\nagain on her husband's shoulder. But he saw that she was laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, own up,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looked like a ninny, that\r\ncreature! It would be funny, so funny! Good old Souris! Come, come,\r\ndearie, you do not mind telling me, me, of all people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe insisted on the \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d thinking that if she had wished to deceive\r\nSouris she would have chosen him, and he was trembling in anticipation\r\nof her avowal, sure that if she had not been a virtuous woman she would\r\nhave encouraged his own attentions.\r\n\r\nBut she did not answer, laughing still, as at the recollection of\r\nsomething exceedingly comical.\r\n\r\nLeuillet, in his turn began to laugh, thinking he might have been the\r\nlucky man, and he muttered amid his mirth: \xe2\x80\x9cThat poor Souris, that poor\r\nSouris, oh, yes, he looked like a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Leuillet was almost in spasms of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, confess, be frank. You know I will not mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she stammered out, almost choking with laughter: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, what?\xe2\x80\x9d insisted her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, tell all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was quieter now and putting her mouth to her husband's ear, she\r\nwhispered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did deceive him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt a chill run down his back and to his very bones, and he\r\nstammered out, dumfounded: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94deceived him\xe2\x80\x94criminally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe still thought he was amused and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes, absolutely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was obliged to sit up to recover his breath, he was so shocked and\r\nupset at what he had heard.\r\n\r\nShe had become serious, understanding too late what she had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith whom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Leuillet at length.\r\n\r\nShe was silent seeking some excuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young man,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied at length.\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly toward her and said drily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not suppose it was the cook. I want to know what young man, do\r\nyou hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer.\r\n\r\nHe snatched the covers from her face, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what young man, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she said sorrowfully: \xe2\x80\x9cI was only in fun.\xe2\x80\x9d But he was trembling\r\nwith rage. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? How? You were only in fun? You were making fun of me,\r\nthen? But I am not satisfied, do you hear? I want the name of the young\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, but lay there motionless.\r\n\r\nHe took her by the arm and squeezed it, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand me,\r\nfinally? I wish you to reply when I speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are going crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said nervously, \xe2\x80\x9clet me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was wild with rage, not knowing what to say, exasperated, and he\r\nshook her with all his might, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me, do you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made an abrupt effort to disengage herself and the tips of her\r\nfingers touched her husband's nose. He was furious, thinking she had\r\ntried to hit him, and he sprang upon her holding her down; and boxing\r\nher ears with all his might, he cried: \xe2\x80\x9cTake that, and that, there,\r\nthere, wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was out of breath and exhausted, he rose and went toward the\r\ndressing table to prepare a glass of eau sucree with orange flower, for\r\nhe felt as if he should faint.\r\n\r\nShe was weeping in bed, sobbing bitterly, for she felt as if her\r\nhappiness was over, through her own fault.\r\n\r\nThen, amidst her tears, she stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Antoine, come here, I told you a lie, you will understand,\r\nlisten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd prepared to defend herself now, armed with excuses and artifice, she\r\nraised her disheveled head with its nightcap all awry.\r\n\r\nTurning toward her, he approached, ashamed of having struck her, but\r\nfeeling in the bottom of his heart as a husband, a relentless hatred\r\ntoward this woman who had deceived the former husband, Souris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY UNCLE JULES\r\n\r\nA white-haired old man begged us for alms. My companion, Joseph\r\nDavranche, gave him five francs. Noticing my surprised look, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat poor unfortunate reminds me of a story which I shall tell you, the\r\nmemory of which continually pursues me. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy family, which came originally from Havre, was not rich. We just\r\nmanaged to make both ends meet. My father worked hard, came home late\r\nfrom the office, and earned very little. I had two sisters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother suffered a good deal from our reduced circumstances, and she\r\noften had harsh words for her husband, veiled and sly reproaches. The\r\npoor man then made a gesture which used to distress me. He would pass\r\nhis open hand over his forehead, as if to wipe away perspiration which\r\ndid not exist, and he would answer nothing. I felt his helpless\r\nsuffering. We economized on everything, and never would accept an\r\ninvitation to dinner, so as not to have to return the courtesy. All our\r\nprovisions were bought at bargain sales. My sisters made their own\r\ngowns, and long discussions would arise on the price of a piece of braid\r\nworth fifteen centimes a yard. Our meals usually consisted of soup and\r\nbeef, prepared with every kind of sauce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say it is wholesome and nourishing, but I should have preferred a\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to go through terrible scenes on account of lost buttons and\r\ntorn trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery Sunday, dressed in our best, we would take our walk along the\r\nbreakwater. My father, in a frock coat, high hat and kid gloves, would\r\noffer his arm to my mother, decked out and beribboned like a ship on a\r\nholiday. My sisters, who were always ready first, would await the signal\r\nfor leaving; but at the last minute some one always found a spot on my\r\nfather's frock coat, and it had to be wiped away quickly with a rag\r\nmoistened with benzine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, in his shirt sleeves, his silk hat on his head, would await\r\nthe completion of the operation, while my mother, putting on her\r\nspectacles, and taking off her gloves in order not to spoil them, would\r\nmake haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we set out ceremoniously. My sisters marched on ahead, arm in arm.\r\nThey were of marriageable age and had to be displayed. I walked on the\r\nleft of my mother and my father on her right. I remember the pompous air\r\nof my poor parents in these Sunday walks, their stern expression, their\r\nstiff walk. They moved slowly, with a serious expression, their bodies\r\nstraight, their legs stiff, as if something of extreme importance\r\ndepended upon their appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery Sunday, when the big steamers were returning from unknown and\r\ndistant countries, my father would invariably utter the same words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What a surprise it would be if Jules were on that one! Eh?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Uncle Jules, my father's brother, was the only hope of the family,\r\nafter being its only fear. I had heard about him since childhood, and it\r\nseemed to me that I should recognize him immediately, knowing as much\r\nabout him as I did. I knew every detail of his life up to the day of his\r\ndeparture for America, although this period of his life was spoken of\r\nonly in hushed tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that he had led a bad life, that is to say, he had squandered\r\na little money, which action, in a poor family, is one of the greatest\r\ncrimes. With rich people a man who amuses himself only sows his wild\r\noats. He is what is generally called a sport. But among needy families a\r\nboy who forces his parents to break into the capital becomes a good-for-\r\nnothing, a rascal, a scamp. And this distinction is just, although the\r\naction be the same, for consequences alone determine the seriousness of\r\nthe act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Uncle Jules had visibly diminished the inheritance on which my\r\nfather had counted, after he had swallowed his own to the last penny.\r\nThen, according to the custom of the times, he had been shipped off to\r\nAmerica on a freighter going from Havre to New York.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce there, my uncle began to sell something or other, and he soon\r\nwrote that he was making a little money and that he soon hoped to be\r\nable to indemnify my father for the harm he had done him. This letter\r\ncaused a profound emotion in the family. Jules, who up to that time had\r\nnot been worth his salt, suddenly became a good man, a kind-hearted\r\nfellow, true and honest like all the Davranches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the captains told us that he had rented a large shop and was\r\ndoing an important business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years later a second letter came, saying: 'My dear Philippe, I am\r\nwriting to tell you not to worry about my health, which is excellent.\r\nBusiness is good. I leave to-morrow for a long trip to South America. I\r\nmay be away for several years without sending you any news. If I\r\nshouldn't write, don't worry. When my fortune is made I shall return to\r\nHavre. I hope that it will not be too long and that we shall all live\r\nhappily together . . . .'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis letter became the gospel of the family. It was read on the\r\nslightest provocation, and it was shown to everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor ten years nothing was heard from Uncle Jules; but as time went on\r\nmy father's hope grew, and my mother, also, often said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'When that good Jules is here, our position will be different. There is\r\none who knew how to get along!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd every Sunday, while watching the big steamers approaching from the\r\nhorizon, pouring out a stream of smoke, my father would repeat his\r\neternal question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What a surprise it would be if Jules were on that one! Eh?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe almost expected to see him waving his handkerchief and crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Hey! Philippe!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThousands of schemes had been planned on the strength of this expected\r\nreturn; we were even to buy a little house with my uncle's money\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle place in the country near Ingouville. In fact, I wouldn't swear\r\nthat my father had not already begun negotiations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe elder of my sisters was then twenty-eight, the other twenty-six.\r\nThey were not yet married, and that was a great grief to every one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last a suitor presented himself for the younger one. He was a clerk,\r\nnot rich, but honorable. I have always been morally certain that Uncle\r\nJules' letter, which was shown him one evening, had swept away the young\r\nman's hesitation and definitely decided him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was accepted eagerly, and it was decided that after the wedding the\r\nwhole family should take a trip to Jersey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJersey is the ideal trip for poor people. It is not far; one crosses a\r\nstrip of sea in a steamer and lands on foreign soil, as this little\r\nisland belongs to England. Thus, a Frenchman, with a two hours' sail,\r\ncan observe a neighboring people at home and study their customs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis trip to Jersey completely absorbed our ideas, was our sole\r\nanticipation, the constant thought of our minds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last we left. I see it as plainly as if it had happened yesterday.\r\nThe boat was getting up steam against the quay at Granville; my father,\r\nbewildered, was superintending the loading of our three pieces of\r\nbaggage; my mother, nervous, had taken the arm of my unmarried sister,\r\nwho seemed lost since the departure of the other one, like the last\r\nchicken of a brood; behind us came the bride and groom, who always\r\nstayed behind, a thing that often made me turn round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whistle sounded. We got on board, and the vessel, leaving the\r\nbreakwater, forged ahead through a sea as flat as a marble table. We\r\nwatched the coast disappear in the distance, happy and proud, like all\r\nwho do not travel much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was swelling out his chest in the breeze, beneath his frock\r\ncoat, which had that morning been very carefully cleaned; and he spread\r\naround him that odor of benzine which always made me recognize Sunday.\r\nSuddenly he noticed two elegantly dressed ladies to whom two gentlemen\r\nwere offering oysters. An old, ragged sailor was opening them with his\r\nknife and passing them to the gentlemen, who would then offer them to\r\nthe ladies. They ate them in a dainty manner, holding the shell on a\r\nfine handkerchief and advancing their mouths a little in order not to\r\nspot their dresses. Then they would drink the liquid with a rapid little\r\nmotion and throw the shell overboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was probably pleased with this delicate manner of eating\r\noysters on a moving ship. He considered it good form, refined, and,\r\ngoing up to my mother and sisters, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Would you like me to offer you some oysters?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother hesitated on account of the expense, but my two sisters\r\nimmediately accepted. My mother said in a provoked manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am afraid that they will hurt my stomach. Offer the children some,\r\nbut not too much, it would make them sick.' Then, turning toward me, she\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'As for Joseph, he doesn't need any. Boys shouldn't be spoiled.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I remained beside my mother, finding this discrimination\r\nunjust. I watched my father as he pompously conducted my two sisters and\r\nhis son-in-law toward the ragged old sailor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two ladies had just left, and my father showed my sisters how to\r\neat them without spilling the liquor. He even tried to give them an\r\nexample, and seized an oyster. He attempted to imitate the ladies, and\r\nimmediately spilled all the liquid over his coat. I heard my mother\r\nmutter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He would do far better to keep quiet.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, suddenly, my father appeared to be worried; he retreated a few\r\nsteps, stared at his family gathered around the old shell opener, and\r\nquickly came toward us. He seemed very pale, with a peculiar look. In a\r\nlow voice he said to my mother:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's extraordinary how that man opening the oysters looks like Jules.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonished, my mother asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What Jules?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why, my brother. If I did not know that he was well off in America, I\r\nshould think it was he.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBewildered, my mother stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are crazy! As long as you know that it is not he, why do you say\r\nsuch foolish things?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my father insisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Go on over and see, Clarisse! I would rather have you see with your\r\nown eyes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe arose and walked to her daughters. I, too, was watching the man. He\r\nwas old, dirty, wrinkled, and did not lift his eyes from his work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother returned. I noticed that she was trembling. She exclaimed\r\nquickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I believe that it is he. Why don't you ask the captain? But be very\r\ncareful that we don't have this rogue on our hands again!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father walked away, but I followed him. I felt strangely moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain, a tall, thin man, with blond whiskers, was walking along\r\nthe bridge with an important air as if he were commanding the Indian\r\nmail steamer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father addressed him ceremoniously, and questioned him about his\r\nprofession, adding many compliments:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What might be the importance of Jersey? What did it produce? What was\r\nthe population? The customs? The nature of the soil?' etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You have there an old shell opener who seems quite interesting. Do you\r\nknow anything about him?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain, whom this conversation began to weary, answered dryly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He is some old French tramp whom I found last year in America, and I\r\nbrought him back. It seems that he has some relatives in Havre, but that\r\nhe doesn't wish to return to them because he owes them money. His name\r\nis Jules\xe2\x80\x94Jules Darmanche or Darvanche or something like that. It seems\r\nthat he was once rich over there, but you can see what's left of him\r\nnow.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father turned ashy pale and muttered, his throat contracted, his\r\neyes haggard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ah! ah! very well, very well. I'm not in the least surprised. Thank\r\nyou very much, captain.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went away, and the astonished sailor watched him disappear. He\r\nreturned to my mother so upset that she said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Sit down; some one will notice that something is the matter.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sank down on a bench and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's he! It's he!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What are we going to do?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe answered quickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'We must get the children out of the way. Since Joseph knows\r\neverything, he can go and get them. We must take good care that our son-\r\nin-law doesn't find out.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father seemed absolutely bewildered. He murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What a catastrophe!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly growing furious, my mother exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I always thought that that thief never would do anything, and that he\r\nwould drop down on us again! As if one could expect anything from a\r\nDavranche!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father passed his hand over his forehead, as he always did when his\r\nwife reproached him. She added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Give Joseph some money so that he can pay for the oysters. All that it\r\nneeded to cap the climax would be to be recognized by that beggar. That\r\nwould be very pleasant! Let's get down to the other end of the boat, and\r\ntake care that that man doesn't come near us!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey gave me five francs and walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonished, my sisters were awaiting their father. I said that mamma\r\nhad felt a sudden attack of sea-sickness, and I asked the shell opener:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'How much do we owe you, monsieur?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like laughing: he was my uncle! He answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Two francs fifty.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI held out my five francs and he returned the change. I looked at his\r\nhand; it was a poor, wrinkled, sailor's hand, and I looked at his face,\r\nan unhappy old face. I said to myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That is my uncle, the brother of my father, my uncle!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave him a ten-cent tip. He thanked me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'God bless you, my young sir!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe spoke like a poor man receiving alms. I couldn't help thinking that\r\nhe must have begged over there! My sisters looked at me, surprised at my\r\ngenerosity. When I returned the two francs to my father, my mother asked\r\nme in surprise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Was there three francs' worth? That is impossible.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered in a firm voice\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I gave ten cents as a tip.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother started, and, staring at me, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You must be crazy! Give ten cents to that man, to that vagabond\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe stopped at a look from my father, who was pointing at his son-in-\r\nlaw. Then everybody was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore us, on the distant horizon, a purple shadow seemed to rise out\r\nof the sea. It was Jersey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we approached the breakwater a violent desire seized me once more to\r\nsee my Uncle Jules, to be near him, to say to him something consoling,\r\nsomething tender. But as no one was eating any more oysters, he had\r\ndisappeared, having probably gone below to the dirty hold which was the\r\nhome of the poor wretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODEL\r\n\r\nCurving like a crescent moon, the little town of Etretat, with its white\r\ncliffs, its white, shingly beach and its blue sea, lay in the sunlight\r\nat high noon one July day. At either extremity of this crescent its two\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgates,\xe2\x80\x9d the smaller to the right, the larger one at the left, stretched\r\nforth\xe2\x80\x94one a dwarf and the other a colossal limb\xe2\x80\x94into the water, and the\r\nbell tower, almost as tall as the cliff, wide below, narrowing at the\r\ntop, raised its pointed summit to the sky.\r\n\r\nOn the sands beside the water a crowd was seated watching the bathers.\r\nOn the terrace of, the Casino another crowd, seated or walking,\r\ndisplayed beneath the brilliant sky a perfect flower patch of bright\r\ncostumes, with red and blue parasols embroidered with large flowers in\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\nOn the walk at the end of the terrace, other persons, the restful, quiet\r\nones, were walking slowly, far from the dressy throng.\r\n\r\nA young man, well known and celebrated as a painter, Jean Sumner, was\r\nwalking with a dejected air beside a wheeled chair in which sat a young\r\nwoman, his wife. A manservant was gently pushing the chair, and the\r\ncrippled woman was gazing sadly at the brightness of the sky, the\r\ngladness of the day, and the happiness of others.\r\n\r\nThey did not speak. They did not look at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us stop a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman.\r\n\r\nThey stopped, and the painter sat down on a camp stool that the servant\r\nhanded him.\r\n\r\nThose who were passing behind the silent and motionless couple looked at\r\nthem compassionately. A whole legend of devotion was attached to them.\r\nHe had married her in spite of her infirmity, touched by her affection\r\nfor him, it was said.\r\n\r\nNot far from there, two young men were chatting, seated on a bench and\r\nlooking out into the horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not true; I tell you that I am well acquainted with Jean\r\nSumner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, why did he marry her? For she was a cripple when she married,\r\nwas she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so. He married her\xe2\x80\x94he married her\xe2\x80\x94just as every one marries,\r\nparbleu! because he was an idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why\xe2\x80\x94but why, my friend? There is no why. People do stupid things\r\njust because they do stupid things. And, besides, you know very well\r\nthat painters make a specialty of foolish marriages. They almost always\r\nmarry models, former sweethearts, in fact, women of doubtful reputation,\r\nfrequently. Why do they do this? Who can say? One would suppose that\r\nconstant association with the general run of models would disgust them\r\nforever with that class of women. Not at all. After having posed them\r\nthey marry them. Read that little book, so true, so cruel and so\r\nbeautiful, by Alphonse Daudet: 'Artists' Wives.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of the couple you see over there the accident occurred in a\r\nspecial and terrible manner. The little woman played a frightful comedy,\r\nor, rather, tragedy. She risked all to win all. Was she sincere? Did she\r\nlove Jean? Shall we ever know? Who is able to determine precisely how\r\nmuch is put on and how much is real in the actions of a woman? They are\r\nalways sincere in an eternal mobility of impressions. They are furious,\r\ncriminal, devoted, admirable and base in obedience to intangible\r\nemotions. They tell lies incessantly without intention, without knowing\r\nor understanding why, and in spite of it all are absolutely frank in\r\ntheir feelings and sentiments, which they display by violent,\r\nunexpected, incomprehensible, foolish resolutions which overthrow our\r\narguments, our customary poise and all our selfish plans. The\r\nunforeseenness and suddenness of their determinations will always render\r\nthem undecipherable enigmas as far as we are concerned. We continually\r\nask ourselves:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Are they sincere? Are they pretending?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my friend, they are sincere and insincere at one and the same\r\ntime, because it is their nature to be extremists in both and to be\r\nneither one nor the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee the methods that even the best of them employ to get what they\r\ndesire. They are complex and simple, these methods. So complex that we\r\ncan never guess at them beforehand, and so simple that after having been\r\nvictimized we cannot help being astonished and exclaiming: 'What! Did\r\nshe make a fool of me so easily as that?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they always succeed, old man, especially when it is a question of\r\ngetting married.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is Sumner's story:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little woman was a model, of course. She posed for him. She was\r\npretty, very stylish-looking, and had a divine figure, it seems. He\r\nfancied that he loved her with his whole soul. That is another strange\r\nthing. As soon as one likes a woman one sincerely believes that they\r\ncould not get along without her for the rest of their life. One knows\r\nthat one has felt the same way before and that disgust invariably\r\nsucceeded gratification; that in order to pass one's existence side by\r\nside with another there must be not a brutal, physical passion which\r\nsoon dies out, but a sympathy of soul, temperament and temper. One\r\nshould know how to determine in the enchantment to which one is\r\nsubjected whether it proceeds from the physical, from a certain sensuous\r\nintoxication, or from a deep spiritual charm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he believed himself in love; he made her no end of promises of\r\nfidelity, and was devoted to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was really attractive, gifted with that fashionable flippancy that\r\nlittle Parisians so readily affect. She chattered, babbled, made foolish\r\nremarks that sounded witty from the manner in which they were uttered.\r\nShe used graceful gesture's which were calculated to attract a painter's\r\neye. When she raised her arms, when she bent over, when she got into a\r\ncarriage, when she held out her hand to you, her gestures were perfect\r\nand appropriate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor three months Jean never noticed that, in reality, she was like all\r\nother models.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rented a little house for her for the summer at Andresy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was there one evening when for the first time doubts came into my\r\nfriend's mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it was a beautiful evening we thought we would take a stroll along\r\nthe bank of the river. The moon poured a flood of light on the trembling\r\nwater, scattering yellow gleams along its ripples in the currents and\r\nall along the course of the wide, slow river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe strolled along the bank, a little enthused by that vague exaltation\r\nthat these dreamy evenings produce in us. We would have liked to\r\nundertake some wonderful task, to love some unknown, deliciously poetic\r\nbeing. We felt ourselves vibrating with raptures, longings, strange\r\naspirations. And we were silent, our beings pervaded by the serene and\r\nliving coolness of the beautiful night, the coolness of the moonlight,\r\nwhich seemed to penetrate one's body, permeate it, soothe one's spirit,\r\nfill it with fragrance and steep it in happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly Josephine (that is her name) uttered an exclamation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, did you see the big fish that jumped, over there?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe replied without looking, without thinking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, dear.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, you did not see it, for your back was turned.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, that's true. It is so delightful that I am not thinking of\r\nanything.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was silent, but at the end of a minute she felt as if she must say\r\nsomething and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Are you going to Paris to-morrow?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I do not know,' he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was annoyed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Do you think it is very amusing to walk along without speaking? People\r\ntalk when they are not stupid.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not reply. Then, feeling with her woman's instinct that she was\r\ngoing to make him angry, she began to sing a popular air that had\r\nharassed our ears and our minds for two years:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Je regardais en fair.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Please keep quiet.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe replied angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why do you wish me to keep quiet?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You spoil the landscape for us!' he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen followed a scene, a hateful, idiotic scene, with unexpected\r\nreproaches, unsuitable recriminations, then tears. Nothing was left\r\nunsaid. They went back to the house. He had allowed her to talk without\r\nreplying, enervated by the beauty of the scene and dumfounded by this\r\nstorm of abuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree months later he strove wildly to free himself from those\r\ninvincible and invisible bonds with which such a friendship chains our\r\nlives. She kept him under her influence, tyrannizing over him, making\r\nhis life a burden to him. They quarreled continually, vituperating and\r\nfinally fighting each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to break with her at any cost. He sold all his canvases,\r\nborrowed money from his friends, realizing twenty thousand francs (he\r\nwas not well known then), and left them for her one morning with a note\r\nof farewell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came and took refuge with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout three o'clock that afternoon there was a ring at the bell. I went\r\nto the door. A woman sprang toward me, pushed me aside, came in and went\r\ninto my atelier. It was she!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had risen when he saw her coming.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe threw the envelope containing the banknotes at his feet with a\r\ntruly noble gesture and said in a quick tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'There's your money. I don't want it!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was very pale, trembling and ready undoubtedly to commit any folly.\r\nAs for him, I saw him grow pale also, pale with rage and exasperation,\r\nready also perhaps to commit any violence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What do you want?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I do not choose to be treated like a common woman. You implored me to\r\naccept you. I asked you for nothing. Keep me with you!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stamped his foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, that's a little too much! If you think you are going\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had seized his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Keep still, Jean. . . Let me settle it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went toward her and quietly, little by little, I began to reason with\r\nher, exhausting all the arguments that are used under similar\r\ncircumstances. She listened to me, motionless, with a fixed gaze,\r\nobstinate and silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally, not knowing what more to say, and seeing that there would be a\r\nscene, I thought of a last resort and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He loves you still, my dear, but his family want him to marry some\r\none, and you understand\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gave a start and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ah! Ah! Now I understand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd turning toward him, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are\xe2\x80\x94you are going to get married?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe replied decidedly\xe2\x80\x9d 'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe took a step forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'If you marry, I will kill myself! Do you hear?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shrugged his shoulders and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, then kill yourself!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe stammered out, almost choking with her violent emotion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What do you say? What do you say? What do you say? Say it again!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, then kill yourself if you like!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith her face almost livid, she replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Do not dare me! I will throw myself from the window!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began to laugh, walked toward the window, opened it, and bowing with\r\nthe gesture of one who desires to let some one else precede him, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This is the way. After you!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looked at him for a second with terrible, wild, staring eyes. Then,\r\ntaking a run as if she were going to jump a hedge in the country, she\r\nrushed past me and past him, jumped over the sill and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never forget the impression made on me by that open window\r\nafter I had seen that body pass through it to fall to the ground. It\r\nappeared to me in a second to be as large as the heavens and as hollow\r\nas space. And I drew back instinctively, not daring to look at it, as\r\nthough I feared I might fall out myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJean, dumfounded, stood motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey brought the poor girl in with both legs broken. She will never\r\nwalk again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJean, wild with remorse and also possibly touched with gratitude, made\r\nup his mind to marry her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you have it, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was growing dusk. The young woman felt chilly and wanted to go home,\r\nand the servant wheeled the invalid chair in the direction of the\r\nvillage. The painter walked beside his wife, neither of them having\r\nexchanged a word for an hour.\r\n\r\nThis story appeared in Le Gaulois, December 17, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VAGABOND\r\n\r\nHe was a journeyman carpenter, a good workman and a steady fellow,\r\ntwenty-seven years old, but, although the eldest son, Jacques Randel had\r\nbeen forced to live on his family for two months, owing to the general\r\nlack of work. He had walked about seeking work for over a month and had\r\nleft his native town, Ville-Avary, in La Manche, because he could find\r\nnothing to do and would no longer deprive his family of the bread they\r\nneeded themselves, when he was the strongest of them all. His two\r\nsisters earned but little as charwomen. He went and inquired at the town\r\nhall, and the mayor's secretary told him that he would find work at the\r\nLabor Agency, and so he started, well provided with papers and\r\ncertificates, and carrying another pair of shoes, a pair of trousers and\r\na shirt in a blue handkerchief at the end of his stick.\r\n\r\nAnd he had walked almost without stopping, day and night, along\r\ninterminable roads, in sun and rain, without ever reaching that\r\nmysterious country where workmen find work. At first he had the fixed\r\nidea that he must only work as a carpenter, but at every carpenter's\r\nshop where he applied he was told that they had just dismissed men on\r\naccount of work being so slack, and, finding himself at the end of his\r\nresources, he made up his mind to undertake any job that he might come\r\nacross on the road. And so by turns he was a navvy, stableman,\r\nstonecutter; he split wood, lopped the branches of trees, dug wells,\r\nmixed mortar, tied up fagots, tended goats on a mountain, and all for a\r\nfew pence, for he only obtained two or three days' work occasionally by\r\noffering himself at a shamefully low price, in order to tempt the\r\navarice of employers and peasants.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a week he had found nothing, and had no money left, and\r\nnothing to eat but a piece of bread, thanks to the charity of some women\r\nfrom whom he had begged at house doors on the road. It was getting dark,\r\nand Jacques Randel, jaded, his legs failing him, his stomach empty, and\r\nwith despair in his heart, was walking barefoot on the grass by the side\r\nof the road, for he was taking care of his last pair of shoes, as the\r\nother pair had already ceased to exist for a long time. It was a\r\nSaturday, toward the end of autumn. The heavy gray clouds were being\r\ndriven rapidly through the sky by the gusts of wind which whistled among\r\nthe trees, and one felt that it would rain soon. The country was\r\ndeserted at that hour on the eve of Sunday. Here and there in the fields\r\nthere rose up stacks of wheat straw, like huge yellow mushrooms, and the\r\nfields looked bare, as they had already been sown for the next year.\r\n\r\nRandel was hungry, with the hunger of some wild animal, such a hunger as\r\ndrives wolves to attack men. Worn out and weakened with fatigue, he took\r\nlonger strides, so as not to take so many steps, and with heavy head,\r\nthe blood throbbing in his temples, with red eyes and dry mouth, he\r\ngrasped his stick tightly in his hand, with a longing to strike the\r\nfirst passerby who might be going home to supper.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the sides of the road, imagining he saw potatoes dug up and\r\nlying on the ground before his eyes; if he had found any he would have\r\ngathered some dead wood, made a fire in the ditch and have had a capital\r\nsupper off the warm, round vegetables with which he would first of all\r\nhave warmed his cold hands. But it was too late in the year, and he\r\nwould have to gnaw a raw beetroot which he might pick up in a field as\r\nhe had done the day before.\r\n\r\nFor the last two days he had talked to himself as he quickened his steps\r\nunder the influence of his thoughts. He had never thought much hitherto,\r\nas he had given all his mind, all his simple faculties to his mechanical\r\nwork. But now fatigue and this desperate search for work which he could\r\nnot get, refusals and rebuffs, nights spent in the open air lying on the\r\ngrass, long fasting, the contempt which he knew people with a settled\r\nabode felt for a vagabond, and that question which he was continually\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not remain at home?\xe2\x80\x9d distress at not being able to\r\nuse his strong arms which he felt so full of vigor, the recollection of\r\nthe relations he had left at home and who also had not a penny, filled\r\nhim by degrees with rage, which had been accumulating every day, every\r\nhour, every minute, and which now escaped his lips in spite of himself\r\nin short, growling sentences.\r\n\r\nAs he stumbled over the stones which tripped his bare feet, he grumbled:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow wretched! how miserable! A set of hogs\xe2\x80\x94to let a man die of hunger\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncarpenter\xe2\x80\x94a set of hogs\xe2\x80\x94not two sous\xe2\x80\x94not two sous\xe2\x80\x94and now it is\r\nraining\xe2\x80\x94a set of hogs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was indignant at the injustice of fate, and cast the blame on men, on\r\nall men, because nature, that great, blind mother, is unjust, cruel and\r\nperfidious, and he repeated through his clenched teeth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA set of hogs\xe2\x80\x9d as he looked at the thin gray smoke which rose from the\r\nroofs, for it was the dinner hour. And, without considering that there\r\nis another injustice which is human, and which is called robbery and\r\nviolence, he felt inclined to go into one of those houses to murder the\r\ninhabitants and to sit down to table in their stead.\r\n\r\nHe said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI have no right to live now, as they are letting me\r\ndie of hunger, and yet I only ask for work\xe2\x80\x94a set of hogs!\xe2\x80\x9d And the pain\r\nin his limbs, the gnawing in his heart rose to his head like terrible\r\nintoxication, and gave rise to this simple thought in his brain: \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nthe right to live because I breathe and because the air is the common\r\nproperty of everybody. So nobody has the right to leave me without\r\nbread!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fine, thick, icy cold rain was coming down, and he stopped and\r\nmurmured: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, misery! Another month of walking before I get home.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwas indeed returning home then, for he saw that he should more easily\r\nfind work in his native town, where he was known\xe2\x80\x94and he did not mind\r\nwhat he did\xe2\x80\x94than on the highroads, where everybody suspected him. As the\r\ncarpentering business was not prosperous, he would turn day laborer, be\r\na mason's hodman, a ditcher, break stones on the road. If he only earned\r\na franc a day, that would at any rate buy him something to eat.\r\n\r\nHe tied the remains of his last pocket handkerchief round his neck to\r\nprevent the cold rain from running down his back and chest, but he soon\r\nfound that it was penetrating the thin material of which his clothes\r\nwere made, and he glanced about him with the agonized look of a man who\r\ndoes not know where to hide his body and to rest his head, and has no\r\nplace of shelter in the whole world.\r\n\r\nNight came on and wrapped the country in obscurity, and in the distance,\r\nin a meadow, he saw a dark spot on the grass; it was a cow, and so he\r\ngot over the ditch by the roadside and went up to her without exactly\r\nknowing what he was doing. When he got close to her she raised her great\r\nhead to him, and he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I only had a jug I could get a little\r\nmilk.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the cow and the cow looked at him and then, suddenly\r\ngiving her a kick in the side, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe animal got up slowly, letting her heavy udders bang down. Then the\r\nman lay down on his back between the animal's legs and drank for a long\r\ntime, squeezing her warm, swollen teats, which tasted of the cowstall,\r\nwith both hands, and he drank as long as she gave any milk. But the icy\r\nrain began to fall more heavily, and he saw no place of shelter on the\r\nwhole of that bare plain. He was cold, and he looked at a light which\r\nwas shining among the trees in the window of a house.\r\n\r\nThe cow had lain down again heavily, and he sat down by her side and\r\nstroked her head, grateful for the nourishment she had given him. The\r\nanimal's strong, thick breath, which came out of her nostrils like two\r\njets of steam in the evening air, blew on the workman's face, and he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not cold inside there!\xe2\x80\x9d He put his hands on her chest and\r\nunder her stomach to find some warmth there, and then the idea struck\r\nhim that he might pass the night beside that large, warm animal. So he\r\nfound a comfortable place and laid his head on her side, and then, as he\r\nwas worn out with fatigue, fell asleep immediately.\r\n\r\nHe woke up, however, several times, with his back or his stomach half\r\nfrozen, according as he put one or the other against the animal's flank.\r\nThen he turned over to warm and dry that part of his body which had\r\nremained exposed to the night air, and soon went soundly to sleep again.\r\nThe crowing of a cock woke him; the day was breaking, it was no longer\r\nraining, and the sky was bright. The cow was resting with her muzzle on\r\nthe ground, and he stooped down, resting on his hands, to kiss those\r\nwide, moist nostrils, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my beauty, until next time.\r\nYou are a nice animal. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he put on his shoes and went off,\r\nand for two hours walked straight before him, always following the same\r\nroad, and then he felt so tired that he sat down on the grass. It was\r\nbroad daylight by that time, and the church bells were ringing; men in\r\nblue blouses, women in white caps, some on foot, some in carts, began to\r\npass along the road, going to the neighboring villages to spend Sunday\r\nwith friends or relations.\r\n\r\nA stout peasant came in sight, driving before him a score of frightened,\r\nbleating sheep, with the help of an active dog. Randel got up, and\r\nraising his cap, said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not happen to have any work for a man who\r\nis dying of hunger?\xe2\x80\x9d But the other, giving an angry look at the\r\nvagabond, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI have no work for fellows whom I meet on the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the carpenter went back and sat down by the side of the ditch again.\r\nHe waited there for a long time, watching the country people pass and\r\nlooking for a kind, compassionate face before he renewed his request,\r\nand finally selected a man in an overcoat, whose stomach was adorned\r\nwith a gold chain. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been looking for work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\nlast two months and cannot find any, and I have not a sou in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut the would-be gentleman replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have read the notice\r\nwhich is stuck up at the entrance to the village: 'Begging is prohibited\r\nwithin the boundaries of this parish.' Let me tell you that I am the\r\nmayor, and if you do not get out of here pretty quickly I shall have you\r\narrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRandel, who was getting angry, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHave me arrested if you like; I\r\nshould prefer it, for, at any rate, I should not die of hunger.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nwent back and sat down by the side of his ditch again, and in about a\r\nquarter of an hour two gendarmes appeared on the road. They were walking\r\nslowly side by side, glittering in the sun with their shining hats,\r\ntheir yellow accoutrements and their metal buttons, as if to frighten\r\nevildoers, and to put them to flight at a distance. He knew that they\r\nwere coming after him, but he did not move, for he was seized with a\r\nsudden desire to defy them, to be arrested by them, and to have his\r\nrevenge later.\r\n\r\nThey came on without appearing to have seen him, walking heavily, with\r\nmilitary step, and balancing themselves as if they were doing the goose\r\nstep; and then, suddenly, as they passed him, appearing to have noticed\r\nhim, they stopped and looked at him angrily and threateningly, and the\r\nbrigadier came up to him and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nresting,\xe2\x80\x9d the man replied calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had to\r\ntell you all the places I have been to it would take me more than an\r\nhour.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo Ville-Avary.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nLa Manche.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs that where you belong?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you leave it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo look for work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brigadier turned to his gendarme and said in the angry voice of a\r\nman who is exasperated at last by an oft-repeated trick: \xe2\x80\x9cThey all say\r\nthat, these scamps. I know all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou any papers?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have some.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGive them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRandel took his papers out of his pocket, his certificates, those poor,\r\nworn-out, dirty papers which were falling to pieces, and gave them to\r\nthe soldier, who spelled them through, hemming and hawing, and then,\r\nhaving seen that they were all in order, he gave them back to Randel\r\nwith the dissatisfied look of a man whom some one cleverer than himself\r\nhas tricked.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments' further reflection, he asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any\r\nmoney on you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot even a sou?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\neven a son!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you live then?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOn what people give me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\r\nbeg?\xe2\x80\x9d And Randel answered resolutely: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, when I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the gendarme said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have caught you on the highroad in the act of\r\nvagabondage and begging, without any resources or trade, and so I\r\ncommand you to come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d The carpenter got up and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWherever\r\nyou please.\xe2\x80\x9d And, placing himself between the two soldiers, even before\r\nhe had received the order to do so, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, lock me up; that\r\nwill at any rate put a roof over my head when it rains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they set off toward the village, the red tiles of which could be\r\nseen through the leafless trees, a quarter of a league off. Service was\r\nabout to begin when they went through the village. The square was full\r\nof people, who immediately formed two lines to see the criminal pass. He\r\nwas being followed by a crowd of excited children. Male and female\r\npeasants looked at the prisoner between the two gendarmes, with hatred\r\nin their eyes and a longing to throw stones at him, to tear his skin\r\nwith their nails, to trample him under their feet. They asked each other\r\nwhether he had committed murder or robbery. The butcher, who was an ex-\r\n'spahi', declared that he was a deserter. The tobacconist thought that\r\nhe recognized him as the man who had that very morning passed a bad\r\nhalf-franc piece off on him, and the ironmonger declared that he was the\r\nmurderer of Widow Malet, whom the police had been looking for for six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIn the municipal court, into which his custodians took him, Randel saw\r\nthe mayor again, sitting on the magisterial bench, with the schoolmaster\r\nby his side. \xe2\x80\x9cAha! aha!\xe2\x80\x9d the magistrate exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cso here you are\r\nagain, my fine fellow. I told you I should have you locked up. Well,\r\nbrigadier, what is he charged with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a vagabond without house or home, Monsieur le Maire, without any\r\nresources or money, so he says, who was arrested in the act of begging,\r\nbut he is provided with good testimonials, and his papers are all in\r\norder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me his papers,\xe2\x80\x9d the mayor said. He took them, read them, reread,\r\nreturned them and then said: \xe2\x80\x9cSearch him.\xe2\x80\x9d So they searched him, but\r\nfound nothing, and the mayor seemed perplexed, and asked the workman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you doing on the road this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI was looking for\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWork? On the highroad?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you expect me to find any if I\r\nhide in the woods?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other with the hatred of two wild beasts which\r\nbelong to different hostile species, and the magistrate continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to have you set at liberty, but do not be brought up before me\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d To which the carpenter replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather you locked me\r\nup; I have had enough running about the country.\xe2\x80\x9d But the magistrate\r\nreplied severely: \xe2\x80\x9cbe silent.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he said to the two gendarmes:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will conduct this man two hundred yards from the village and let\r\nhim continue his journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, give me something to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d the workman said, but the other\r\ngrew indignant: \xe2\x80\x9cHave we nothing to do but to feed you? Ah! ah! ah! that\r\nis rather too much!\xe2\x80\x9d But Randel went on firmly: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you let me nearly\r\ndie of hunger again, you will force me to commit a crime, and then, so\r\nmuch the worse for you other fat fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor had risen and he repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cTake him away immediately or I\r\nshall end by getting angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gendarmes thereupon seized the carpenter by the arms and dragged\r\nhim out. He allowed them to do it without resistance, passed through the\r\nvillage again and found himself on the highroad once more; and when the\r\nmen had accompanied him two hundred yards beyond the village, the\r\nbrigadier said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow off with you and do not let me catch you about here\r\nagain, for if I do, you will know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRandel went off without replying or knowing where he was going. He\r\nwalked on for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, so stupefied that\r\nhe no longer thought of anything. But suddenly, as he was passing a\r\nsmall house, where the window was half open, the smell of the soup and\r\nboiled meat stopped him suddenly, and hunger, fierce, devouring,\r\nmaddening hunger, seized him and almost drove him against the walls of\r\nthe house like a wild beast.\r\n\r\nHe said aloud in a grumbling voice: \xe2\x80\x9cIn Heaven's name! they must give me\r\nsome this time!\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to knock at the door vigorously with his\r\nstick, and as no one came he knocked louder and called out: \xe2\x80\x9cHey! hey!\r\nyou people in there, open the door!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, as nothing stirred, he\r\nwent up to the window and pushed it wider open with his hand, and the\r\nclose warm air of the kitchen, full of the smell of hot soup, meat and\r\ncabbage, escaped into the cold outer air, and with a bound the carpenter\r\nwas in the house. Two places were set at the table, and no doubt the\r\nproprietors of the house, on going to church, had left their dinner on\r\nthe fire, their nice Sunday boiled beef and vegetable soup, while there\r\nwas a loaf of new bread on the chimney-piece, between two bottles which\r\nseemed full.\r\n\r\nRandel seized the bread first of all and broke it with as much violence\r\nas if he were strangling a man, and then he began to eat voraciously,\r\nswallowing great mouthfuls quickly. But almost immediately the smell of\r\nthe meat attracted him to the fireplace, and, having taken off the lid\r\nof the saucepan, he plunged a fork into it and brought out a large piece\r\nof beef tied with a string. Then he took more cabbage, carrots and\r\nonions until his plate was full, and, having put it on the table, he sat\r\ndown before it, cut the meat into four pieces, and dined as if he had\r\nbeen at home. When he had eaten nearly all the meat, besides a quantity\r\nof vegetables, he felt thirsty and took one of the bottles off the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he poured the liquor into his glass when he saw it was\r\nbrandy. So much the better; it was warming and would instill some fire\r\ninto his veins, and that would be all right, after being so cold; and he\r\ndrank some. He certainly enjoyed it, for he had grown unaccustomed to\r\nit, and he poured himself out another glassful, which he drank at two\r\ngulps. And then almost immediately he felt quite merry and light-hearted\r\nfrom the effects of the alcohol, just as if some great happiness filled\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nHe continued to eat, but more slowly, and dipping his bread into the\r\nsoup. His skin had become burning, and especially his forehead, where\r\nthe veins were throbbing. But suddenly the church bells began to ring.\r\nMass was over, and instinct rather than fear, the instinct of prudence,\r\nwhich guides all beings and makes them clear-sighted in danger, made the\r\ncarpenter get up. He put the remains of the loaf into one pocket and the\r\nbrandy bottle into the other, and he furtively went to the window and\r\nlooked out into the road. It was still deserted, so he jumped out and\r\nset off walking again, but instead of following the highroad he ran\r\nacross the fields toward a wood he saw a little way off.\r\n\r\nHe felt alert, strong, light-hearted, glad of what he had done, and so\r\nnimble that he sprang over the enclosure of the fields at a single\r\nbound, and as soon as he was under the trees he took the bottle out of\r\nhis pocket again and began to drink once more, swallowing it down as he\r\nwalked, and then his ideas began to get confused, his eyes grew dim, and\r\nhis legs as elastic as springs, and he started singing the old popular\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what joy, what joy it is, To pick the sweet, wild strawberries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was now walking on thick, damp, cool moss, and that soft carpet under\r\nhis feet made him feel absurdly inclined to turn head over heels as he\r\nused to do when a child, so he took a run, turned a somersault, got up\r\nand began over again. And between each time he began to sing again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what joy, what joy it is, To pick the sweet, wild strawberries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly he found himself above a deep road, and in the road he saw a\r\ntall girl, a servant, who was returning to the village with two pails of\r\nmilk. He watched, stooping down, and with his eyes as bright as those of\r\na dog who scents a quail, but she saw him raised her head and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWas\r\nthat you singing like that?\xe2\x80\x9d He did not reply, however, but jumped down\r\ninto the road, although it was a fall of at least six feet and when she\r\nsaw him suddenly standing in front of her, she exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear, how\r\nyou frightened me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he did not hear her, for he was drunk, he was mad, excited by\r\nanother requirement which was more imperative than hunger, more feverish\r\nthan alcohol; by the irresistible fury of the man who has been deprived\r\nof everything for two months, and who is drunk; who is young, ardent and\r\ninflamed by all the appetites which nature has implanted in the vigorous\r\nflesh of men.\r\n\r\nThe girl started back from him, frightened at his face, his eyes, his\r\nhalf-open mouth, his outstretched hands, but he seized her by the\r\nshoulders, and without a word, threw her down in the road.\r\n\r\nShe let her two pails fall, and they rolled over noisily, and all the\r\nmilk was spilt, and then she screamed lustily, but it was of no avail in\r\nthat lonely spot.\r\n\r\nWhen she got up the thought of her overturned pails suddenly filled her\r\nwith fury, and, taking off one of her wooden sabots, she threw it at the\r\nman to break his head if he did not pay her for her milk.\r\n\r\nBut he, mistaking the reason of this sudden violent attack, somewhat\r\nsobered, and frightened at what he had done, ran off as fast as he\r\ncould, while she threw stones at him, some of which hit him in the back.\r\n\r\nHe ran for a long time, very long, until he felt more tired than he had\r\never been before. His legs were so weak that they could scarcely carry\r\nhim; all his ideas were confused, he lost recollection of everything and\r\ncould no longer think about anything, and so he sat down at the foot of\r\na tree, and in five minutes was fast asleep. He was soon awakened,\r\nhowever, by a rough shake, and, on opening his eyes, he saw two cocked\r\nhats of shiny leather bending over him, and the two gendarmes of the\r\nmorning, who were holding him and binding his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew I should catch you again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brigadier jeeringly. But\r\nRandel got up without replying. The two men shook him, quite ready to\r\nill treat him if he made a movement, for he was their prey now. He had\r\nbecome a jailbird, caught by those hunters of criminals who would not\r\nlet him go again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, start!\xe2\x80\x9d the brigadier said, and they set off. It was late\r\nafternoon, and the autumn twilight was setting in over the land, and in\r\nhalf an hour they reached the village, where every door was open, for\r\nthe people had heard what had happened. Peasants and peasant women and\r\ngirls, excited with anger, as if every man had been robbed and every\r\nwoman attacked, wished to see the wretch brought back, so that they\r\nmight overwhelm him with abuse. They hooted him from the first house in\r\nthe village until they reached the Hotel de Ville, where the mayor was\r\nwaiting for him to be himself avenged on this vagabond, and as soon as\r\nhe saw him approaching he cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my fine fellow! here we are!\xe2\x80\x9d And he rubbed his hands, more pleased\r\nthan he usually was, and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI said so. I said so, the moment I\r\nsaw him in the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then with increased satisfaction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you blackguard! Oh, you dirty blackguard! You will get your twenty\r\nyears, my fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHING HOLE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCuts and wounds which caused death.\xe2\x80\x9d Such was the charge upon which\r\nLeopold Renard, upholsterer, was summoned before the Court of Assizes.\r\n\r\nRound him were the principal witnesses, Madame Flameche, widow of the\r\nvictim, and Louis Ladureau, cabinetmaker, and Jean Durdent, plumber.\r\n\r\nNear the criminal was his wife, dressed in black, an ugly little woman,\r\nwho looked like a monkey dressed as a lady.\r\n\r\nThis is how Renard (Leopold) recounted the drama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, it is a misfortune of which I was the prime victim all\r\nthe time, and with which my will has nothing to do. The facts are their\r\nown commentary, Monsieur le President. I am an honest man, a hard-\r\nworking man, an upholsterer, living in the same street for the last\r\nsixteen years, known, liked, respected and esteemed by all, as my\r\nneighbors can testify, even the porter's wife, who is not amiable every\r\nday. I am fond of work, I am fond of saving, I like honest men and\r\nrespectable amusements. That is what has ruined me, so much the worse\r\nfor me; but as my will had nothing to do with it, I continue to respect\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery Sunday for the last five years my wife and I have spent the day\r\nat Passy. We get fresh air, and, besides, we are fond of fishing. Oh! we\r\nare as fond of it as we are of little onions. Melie inspired me with\r\nthat enthusiasm, the jade, and she is more enthusiastic than I am, the\r\nscold, seeing that all the mischief in this business is her fault, as\r\nyou will see immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am strong and mild tempered, without a pennyworth of malice in me.\r\nBut she! oh! la! la! she looks like nothing; she is short and thin. Very\r\nwell, she does more mischief than a weasel. I do not deny that she has\r\nsome good qualities; she has some, and very important ones for a man in\r\nbusiness. But her character! Just ask about it in the neighborhood, and\r\neven the porter's wife, who has just sent me about my business\xe2\x80\x94she will\r\ntell you something about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery day she used to find fault with my mild temper: 'I would not put\r\nup with this! I would not put up with that.' If I had listened to her,\r\nMonsieur le President, I should have had at least three hand-to-hand\r\nfights a month . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Renard interrupted him: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for good reasons, too; they laugh\r\nbest who laugh last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned toward her frankly: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can't blame you, since you were\r\nnot the cause of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, facing the President again, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will continue. We used to go to Passy every Saturday evening, so as\r\nto begin fishing at daybreak the next morning. It is a habit which has\r\nbecome second nature with us, as the saying is. Three years ago this\r\nsummer I discovered a place, oh! such a spot. Oh, dear, dear! In the\r\nshade, eight feet of water at least and perhaps ten, a hole with\r\ncavities under the bank, a regular nest for fish and a paradise for the\r\nfisherman. I might look upon that fishing hole as my property, Monsieur\r\nle President, as I was its Christopher Columbus. Everybody in the\r\nneighborhood knew it, without making any opposition. They would say:\r\n'That is Renard's place'; and nobody would have gone there, not even\r\nMonsieur Plumeau, who is well known, be it said without any offense, for\r\npoaching on other people's preserves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I returned to this place of which I felt certain, just as if I\r\nhad owned it. I had scarcely got there on Saturday, when I got into\r\nDelila, with my wife. Delila is my Norwegian boat, which I had built by\r\nFournaire, and which is light and safe. Well, as I said, we got into the\r\nboat and we were going to set bait, and for setting bait there is none\r\nto be compared with me, and they all know it. You want to know with what\r\nI bait? I cannot answer that question; it has nothing to do with the\r\naccident. I cannot answer; that is my secret. There are more than three\r\nhundred people who have asked me; I have been offered glasses of brandy\r\nand liqueur, fried fish, matelotes, to make me tell. But just go and try\r\nwhether the chub will come. Ah! they have tempted my stomach to get at\r\nmy secret, my recipe. Only my wife knows, and she will not tell it any\r\nmore than I will. Is not that so, Melie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president of the court interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust get to the facts as soon as you can,\xe2\x80\x9d and the accused continued:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am getting to them, I am getting to them. Well, on Saturday, July 8,\r\nwe left by the twenty-five past five train and before dinner we went to\r\nset bait as usual. The weather promised to keep fine and I said to\r\nMelie: 'All right for tomorrow.' And she replied: 'If looks like it,' We\r\nnever talk more than that together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then we returned to dinner. I was happy and thirsty, and that was\r\nthe cause of everything. I said to Melie: 'Look here, Melie, it is fine\r\nweather, suppose I drink a bottle of 'Casque a meche'.' That is a weak\r\nwhite wine which we have christened so, because if you drink too much of\r\nit it prevents you from sleeping and takes the place of a nightcap. Do\r\nyou understand me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe replied: 'You can do as you please, but you will be ill again and\r\nwill not be able to get up tomorrow.' That was true, sensible and\r\nprudent, clear-sighted, I must confess. Nevertheless I could not resist,\r\nand I drank my bottle. It all came from that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I could not sleep. By Jove! it kept me awake till two o'clock in\r\nthe morning, and then I went to sleep so soundly that I should not have\r\nheard the angel sounding his trump at the last judgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, my wife woke me at six o'clock and I jumped out of bed,\r\nhastily put on my trousers and jersey, washed my face and jumped on\r\nboard Delila. But it was too late, for when I arrived at my hole it was\r\nalready occupied! Such a thing had never happened to me in three years,\r\nand it made me feel as if I were being robbed under my own eyes. I said\r\nto myself: 'Confound it all! confound it!' And then my wife began to nag\r\nat me. 'Eh! what about your 'Casque a meche'? Get along, you drunkard!\r\nAre you satisfied, you great fool?' I could say nothing, because it was\r\nall true, but I landed all the same near the spot and tried to profit by\r\nwhat was left. Perhaps after all the fellow might catch nothing and go\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a little thin man in white linen coat and waistcoat and a large\r\nstraw hat, and his wife, a fat woman, doing embroidery, sat behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she saw us take up our position close to them she murmured: 'Are\r\nthere no other places on the river?' My wife, who was furious, replied:\r\n'People who have any manners make inquiries about the habits of the\r\nneighborhood before occupying reserved spots.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I did not want a fuss, I said to her: 'Hold your tongue, Melie. Let\r\nthem alone, let them alone; we shall see.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we fastened Delila under the willows and had landed and were\r\nfishing side by side, Melie and I, close to the two others. But here,\r\nmonsieur, I must enter into details.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had only been there about five minutes when our neighbor's line\r\nbegan to jerk twice, thrice; and then he pulled out a chub as thick as\r\nmy thigh; rather less, perhaps, but nearly as big! My heart beat, the\r\nperspiration stood on my forehead and Melie said to me: 'Well, you sot,\r\ndid you see that?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust then Monsieur Bru, the grocer of Poissy, who is fond of gudgeon\r\nfishing, passed in a boat and called out to me: 'So somebody has taken\r\nyour usual place, Monsieur Renard?' And I replied: 'Yes, Monsieur Bru,\r\nthere are some people in this world who do not know the rules of common\r\npoliteness.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little man in linen pretended not to hear, nor his fat lump of a\r\nwife, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the president interrupted him a second time: \xe2\x80\x9cTake care, you are\r\ninsulting the widow, Madame Flameche, who is present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenard made his excuses: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, I beg your pardon; my anger\r\ncarried me away. Well, not a quarter of an hour had passed when the\r\nlittle man caught another chub, and another almost immediately, and\r\nanother five minutes later.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTears were in my eyes, and I knew that Madame Renard was boiling with\r\nrage, for she kept on nagging at me: 'Oh, how horrid! Don't you see that\r\nhe is robbing you of your fish? Do you think that you will catch\r\nanything? Not even a frog, nothing whatever. Why, my hands are tingling,\r\njust to think of it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I said to myself: 'Let us wait until twelve o'clock. Then this\r\npoacher will go to lunch and I shall get my place again. As for me,\r\nMonsieur le President, I lunch on that spot every Sunday. We bring our\r\nprovisions in Delila. But there! At noon the wretch produced a chicken\r\nin a newspaper, and while he was eating, he actually caught another\r\nchub!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelie and I had a morsel also, just a bite, a mere nothing, for our\r\nheart was not in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I took up my newspaper to aid my digestion. Every Sunday I read\r\nthe Gil Blas in the shade by the side of the water. It is Columbine's\r\nday, you know; Columbine, who writes the articles in the Gil Blas. I\r\ngenerally put Madame Renard into a rage by pretending to know this\r\nColumbine. It is not true, for I do not know her and have never seen\r\nher, but that does not matter. She writes very well, and then she says\r\nthings that are pretty plain for a woman. She suits me and there are not\r\nmany of her sort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I began to tease my wife, but she got angry immediately, and very\r\nangry, so I held my tongue. At that moment our two witnesses who are\r\npresent here, Monsieur Ladureau and Monsieur Durdent, appeared on the\r\nother side of the river. We knew each other by sight. The little man\r\nbegan to fish again and he caught so many that I trembled with vexation\r\nand his wife said: 'It is an uncommonly good spot, and we will come here\r\nalways, Desire.' As for me, a cold shiver ran down my back, and Madame\r\nRenard kept repeating: 'You are not a man; you have the blood of a\r\nchicken in your veins'; and suddenly I said to her: 'Look here, I would\r\nrather go away or I shall be doing something foolish.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she whispered to me, as if she had put a red-hot iron under my\r\nnose: 'You are not a man. Now you are going to run away and surrender\r\nyour place! Go, then, Bazaine!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt hurt, but yet I did not move, while the other fellow pulled out\r\na bream: Oh, I never saw such a large one before, never! And then my\r\nwife began to talk aloud, as if she were thinking, and you can see her\r\ntricks. She said: 'That is what one might call stolen fish, seeing that\r\nwe set the bait ourselves. At any rate, they ought to give us back the\r\nmoney we have spent on bait.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the fat woman in the cotton dress said in her turn: 'Do you mean\r\nto call us thieves, madame?' Explanations followed and compliments began\r\nto fly. Oh, Lord! those creatures know some good ones. They shouted so\r\nloud that our two witnesses, who were on the other bank, began to call\r\nout by way of a joke: 'Less noise over there; you will interfere with\r\nyour husbands' fishing.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that neither the little man nor I moved any more than if we\r\nhad been two tree stumps. We remained there, with our eyes fixed on the\r\nwater, as if we had heard nothing; but, by Jove! we heard all the same.\r\n'You are a thief! You are nothing better than a tramp! You are a regular\r\njade!' and so on and so on. A sailor could not have said more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly I heard a noise behind me and turned round. It was the other\r\none, the fat woman, who had attacked my wife with her parasol. Whack,\r\nwhack! Melie got two of them. But she was furious, and she hits hard\r\nwhen she is in a rage. She caught the fat woman by the hair and then\r\nthump! thump! slaps in the face rained down like ripe plums. I should\r\nhave let them fight it out: women together, men together. It does not do\r\nto mix the blows. But the little man in the linen jacket jumped up like\r\na devil and was going to rush at my wife. Ah! no, no, not that, my\r\nfriend! I caught the gentleman with the end of my fist, and crash!\r\ncrash! One on the nose, the other in the stomach. He threw up his arms\r\nand legs and fell on his back into the river, just into the hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have fished him out most certainly, Monsieur le President, if\r\nI had had time. But, to make matters worse, the fat woman had the upper\r\nhand and was pounding Melie for all she was worth. I know I ought not to\r\nhave interfered while the man was in the water, but I never thought that\r\nhe would drown and said to myself: 'Bah, it will cool him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI therefore ran up to the women to separate them and all I received was\r\nscratches and bites. Good Lord, what creatures! Well, it took me five\r\nminutes, and perhaps ten, to separate those two viragos. When I turned\r\nround there was nothing to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe water was as smooth as a lake and the others yonder kept shouting:\r\n'Fish him out! fish him out!' It was all very well to say that, but I\r\ncannot swim and still less dive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last the man from the dam came and two gentlemen with boathooks, but\r\nover a quarter of an hour had passed. He was found at the bottom of the\r\nhole, in eight feet of water, as I have said. There he was, the poor\r\nlittle man, in his linen suit! Those are the facts such as I have sworn\r\nto. I am innocent, on my honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe witnesses having given testimony to the same effect, the accused was\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPASM\r\n\r\nThe hotel guests slowly entered the dining-room and took their places.\r\nThe waiters did not hurry themselves, in order to give the late comers a\r\nchance and thus avoid the trouble of bringing in the dishes a second\r\ntime. The old bathers, the habitues, whose season was almost over,\r\nglanced, gazed toward the door whenever it opened, to see what new faces\r\nmight appear.\r\n\r\nThis is the principal distraction of watering places. People look\r\nforward to the dinner hour in order to inspect each day's new arrivals,\r\nto find out who they are, what they do, and what they think. We always\r\nhave a vague desire to meet pleasant people, to make agreeable\r\nacquaintances, perhaps to meet with a love adventure. In this life of\r\nelbowings, unknown strangers assume an extreme importance. Curiosity is\r\naroused, sympathy is ready to exhibit itself, and sociability is the\r\norder of the day.\r\n\r\nWe cherish antipathies for a week and friendships for a month; we see\r\npeople with different eyes, when we view them through the medium of\r\nacquaintanceship at watering places. We discover in men suddenly, after\r\nan hour's chat, in the evening after dinner, under the trees in the park\r\nwhere the healing spring bubbles up, a high intelligence and astonishing\r\nmerits, and a month afterward we have completely forgotten these new\r\nfriends, who were so fascinating when we first met them.\r\n\r\nPermanent and serious ties are also formed here sooner than anywhere\r\nelse. People see each other every day; they become acquainted very\r\nquickly, and their affection is tinged with the sweetness and\r\nunrestraint of long-standing intimacies. We cherish in after years the\r\ndear and tender memories of those first hours of friendship, the memory\r\nof those first conversations in which a soul was unveiled, of those\r\nfirst glances which interrogate and respond to questions and secret\r\nthoughts which the mouth has not as yet uttered, the memory of that\r\nfirst cordial confidence, the memory of that delightful sensation of\r\nopening our hearts to those who seem to open theirs to us in return.\r\n\r\nAnd the melancholy of watering places, the monotony of days that are all\r\nalike, proves hourly an incentive to this heart expansion.\r\n\r\nWell, this evening, as on every other evening, we awaited the appearance\r\nof strange faces.\r\n\r\nOnly two appeared, but they were very remarkable, a man and a woman\r\n\xe2\x80\x94father and daughter. They immediately reminded me of some of Edgar\r\nPoe's characters; and yet there was about them a charm, the charm\r\nassociated with misfortune. I looked upon them as the victims of fate.\r\nThe man was very tall and thin, rather stooped, with perfectly white\r\nhair, too white for his comparatively youthful physiognomy; and there\r\nwas in his bearing and in his person that austerity peculiar to\r\nProtestants. The daughter, who was probably twenty-four or twenty-five,\r\nwas small in stature, and was also very thin, very pale, and she had the\r\nair of one who was worn out with utter lassitude. We meet people like\r\nthis from time to time, who seem too weak for the tasks and the needs of\r\ndaily life, too weak to move about, to walk, to do all that we do every\r\nday. She was rather pretty; with a transparent, spiritual beauty. And\r\nshe ate with extreme slowness, as if she were almost incapable of moving\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\nIt must have been she, assuredly, who had come to take the waters.\r\n\r\nThey sat facing me, on the opposite side of the table; and I at once\r\nnoticed that the father had a very singular, nervous twitching.\r\n\r\nEvery time he wanted to reach an object, his hand described a sort of\r\nzigzag before it succeeded in reaching what it was in search of, and\r\nafter a little while this movement annoyed me so that I turned aside my\r\nhead in order not to see it.\r\n\r\nI noticed, too, that the young girl, during meals, wore a glove on her\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I went for a stroll in the park of the bathing\r\nestablishment. This led toward the little Auvergnese station of Chatel-\r\nGuyon, hidden in a gorge at the foot of the high mountain, from which\r\nflowed so many boiling springs, arising from the deep bed of extinct\r\nvolcanoes. Over yonder, above our heads, the domes of extinct craters\r\nlifted their ragged peaks above the rest in the long mountain chain. For\r\nChatel-Guyon is situated at the entrance to the land of mountain domes.\r\n\r\nBeyond it stretches out the region of peaks, and, farther on again the\r\nregion of precipitous summits.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cPuy de Dome\xe2\x80\x9d is the highest of the domes, the Peak of Sancy is the\r\nloftiest of the peaks, and Cantal is the most precipitous of these\r\nmountain heights.\r\n\r\nIt was a very warm evening, and I was walking up and down a shady path,\r\nlistening to the opening, strains of the Casino band, which was playing\r\non an elevation overlooking the park.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw the father and the daughter advancing slowly in my direction.\r\nI bowed as one bows to one's hotel companions at a watering place; and\r\nthe man, coming to a sudden halt, said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you not, monsieur, tell us of a nice walk to take, short, pretty,\r\nand not steep; and pardon my troubling you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI offered to show them the way toward the valley through which the\r\nlittle river flowed, a deep valley forming a gorge between two tall,\r\ncraggy, wooded slopes.\r\n\r\nThey gladly accepted my offer.\r\n\r\nAnd we talked, naturally, about the virtue of the waters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy daughter has a strange malady, the seat of which is\r\nunknown. She suffers from incomprehensible nervous attacks. At one time\r\nthe doctors think she has an attack of heart disease, at another time\r\nthey imagine it is some affection of the liver, and at another they\r\ndeclare it to be a disease of the spine. To-day this protean malady,\r\nthat assumes a thousand forms and a thousand modes of attack, is\r\nattributed to the stomach, which is the great caldron and regulator of\r\nthe body. This is why we have come here. For my part, I am rather\r\ninclined to think it is the nerves. In any case it is very sad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately the remembrance of the violent spasmodic movement of his\r\nhand came back to my mind, and I asked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is this not the result of heredity? Are not your own nerves\r\nsomewhat affected?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied calmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine? Oh, no-my nerves have always been very steady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, after a pause, he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time I\r\ntry to reach for anything? This arises from a terrible experience which\r\nI had. Just imagine, this daughter of mine was actually buried alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could only utter, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d so great were my astonishment and emotion.\r\n\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the story. It is simple. Juliette had been subject for some\r\ntime to serious attacks of the heart. We believed that she had disease\r\nof that organ, and were prepared for the worst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day she was carried into the house cold, lifeless, dead. She had\r\nfallen down unconscious in the garden. The doctor certified that life\r\nwas extinct. I watched by her side for a day and two nights. I laid her\r\nwith my own hands in the coffin, which I accompanied to the cemetery,\r\nwhere she was deposited in the family vault. It is situated in the very\r\nheart of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to have her interred with her jewels, bracelets, necklaces,\r\nrings, all presents which she had received from me, and wearing her\r\nfirst ball dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may easily imagine my state of mind when I re-entered our home. She\r\nwas the only one I had, for my wife had been dead for many years. I\r\nfound my way to my own apartment in a half-distracted condition, utterly\r\nexhausted, and sank into my easy-chair, without the capacity to think or\r\nthe strength to move. I was nothing better now than a suffering,\r\nvibrating machine, a human being who had, as it were, been flayed alive;\r\nmy soul was like an open wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy old valet, Prosper, who had assisted me in placing Juliette in her\r\ncoffin, and aided me in preparing her for her last sleep, entered the\r\nroom noiselessly, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Does monsieur want anything?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI merely shook my head in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Monsieur is wrong,' he urged. 'He will injure his health. Would\r\nmonsieur like me to put him to bed?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered: 'No, let me alone!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not how many hours slipped away. Oh, what a night, what a night!\r\nIt was cold. My fire had died out in the huge grate; and the wind, the\r\nwinter wind, an icy wind, a winter hurricane, blew with a regular,\r\nsinister noise against the windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many hours slipped away? There I was without sleeping, powerless,\r\ncrushed, my eyes wide open, my legs stretched out, my body limp,\r\ninanimate, and my mind torpid with despair. Suddenly the great doorbell,\r\nthe great bell of the vestibule, rang out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI started so that my chair cracked under me. The solemn, ponderous\r\nsound vibrated through the empty country house as through a vault. I\r\nturned round to see what the hour was by the clock. It was just two in\r\nthe morning. Who could be coming at such an hour?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, abruptly, the bell again rang twice. The servants, without doubt,\r\nwere afraid to get up. I took a wax candle and descended the stairs. I\r\nwas on the point of asking: 'Who is there?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I felt ashamed of my weakness, and I slowly drew back the heavy\r\nbolts. My heart was throbbing wildly. I was frightened. I opened the\r\ndoor brusquely, and in the darkness I distinguished a white figure,\r\nstanding erect, something that resembled an apparition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recoiled petrified with horror, faltering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Who-who-who are you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA voice replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is I, father.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really thought I must be mad, and I retreated backward before this\r\nadvancing spectre. I kept moving away, making a sign with my hand,' as\r\nif to drive the phantom away, that gesture which you have noticed\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ngesture which has remained with me ever since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Do not be afraid, papa,' said the apparition. 'I was not dead.\r\nSomebody tried to steal my rings and cut one of my fingers; the blood\r\nbegan to flow, and that restored me to life.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, in fact, I could see that her hand was covered with blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fell on my knees, choking with sobs and with a rattling in my throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, when I had somewhat collected my thoughts, though I was still so\r\nbewildered that I scarcely realized the awesome happiness that had\r\nbefallen me, I made her go up to my room and sit dawn in my easy-chair;\r\nthen I rang excitedly for Prosper to get him to rekindle the fire and to\r\nbring some wine, and to summon assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man entered, stared at my daughter, opened his mouth with a gasp of\r\nalarm and stupefaction, and then fell back dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was he who had opened the vault, who had mutilated and then\r\nabandoned my daughter; for he could not efface the traces of the theft.\r\nHe had not even taken the trouble to put back the coffin into its place,\r\nfeeling sure, besides, that he would not be suspected by me, as I\r\ntrusted him absolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, monsieur, that we are very unfortunate people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent.\r\n\r\nThe night had fallen, casting its shadows over the desolate, mournful\r\nvale, and a sort of mysterious fear possessed me at finding myself by\r\nthe side of those strange beings, of this young girl who had come back\r\nfrom the tomb, and this father with his uncanny spasm.\r\n\r\nI found it impossible to make any comment on this dreadful story. I only\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a horrible thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, after a minute's silence, I added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go indoors. I think it is growing cool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd we made our way back to the hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE WOOD\r\n\r\nAs the mayor was about to sit down to breakfast, word was brought to him\r\nthat the rural policeman, with two prisoners, was awaiting him at the\r\nHotel de Ville. He went there at once and found old Hochedur standing\r\nguard before a middle-class couple whom he was regarding with a severe\r\nexpression on his face.\r\n\r\nThe man, a fat old fellow with a red nose and white hair, seemed utterly\r\ndejected; while the woman, a little roundabout individual with shining\r\ncheeks, looked at the official who had arrested them, with defiant eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What is it, Hochedur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rural policeman made his deposition: He had gone out that morning at\r\nhis usual time, in order to patrol his beat from the forest of Champioux\r\nas far as the boundaries of Argenteuil. He had not noticed anything\r\nunusual in the country except that it was a fine day, and that the wheat\r\nwas doing well, when the son of old Bredel, who was going over his\r\nvines, called out to him: \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Daddy Hochedur, go and have a look at\r\nthe outskirts of the wood. In the first thicket you will find a pair of\r\npigeons who must be a hundred and thirty years old between them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went in the direction indicated, entered the thicket, and there he\r\nheard words which made him suspect a flagrant breach of morality.\r\nAdvancing, therefore, on his hands and knees as if to surprise a\r\npoacher, he had arrested the couple whom he found there.\r\n\r\nThe mayor looked at the culprits in astonishment, for the man was\r\ncertainly sixty, and the woman fifty-five at least, and he began to\r\nquestion them, beginning with the man, who replied in such a weak voice\r\nthat he could scarcely be heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas Beaurain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour occupation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaberdasher, in the Rue des Martyrs, in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you doing in the wood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe haberdasher remained silent, with his eyes on his fat paunch, and\r\nhis hands hanging at his sides, and the mayor continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you deny what the officer of the municipal authorities states?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you confess it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to say in your defence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you meet the partner in your misdemeanor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is my wife, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94you do not live together-in Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, monsieur, but we are living together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in that case\xe2\x80\x94you must be mad, altogether mad, my dear sir, to get\r\ncaught playing lovers in the country at ten o'clock in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe haberdasher seemed ready to cry with shame, and he muttered: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nshe who enticed me! I told her it was very stupid, but when a woman once\r\ngets a thing into her head\xe2\x80\x94you know\xe2\x80\x94you cannot get it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor, who liked a joke, smiled and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cIn your case, the\r\ncontrary ought to have happened. You would not be here, if she had had\r\nthe idea only in her head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Monsieur Beauain was seized with rage and turning to his wife, he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see to what you have brought us with your poetry? And now\r\nwe shall have to go before the courts at our age, for a breach of\r\nmorals! And we shall have to shut up the shop, sell our good will, and\r\ngo to some other neighborhood! That's what it has come to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Beaurain got up, and without looking at her husband, she\r\nexplained herself without embarrassment, without useless modesty, and\r\nalmost without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, monsieur, I know that we have made ourselves ridiculous.\r\nWill you allow me to plead my cause like an advocate, or rather like a\r\npoor woman? And I hope that you will be kind enough to send us home, and\r\nto spare us the disgrace of a prosecution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYears ago, when I was young, I made Monsieur Beaurain's acquaintance\r\none Sunday in this neighborhood. He was employed in a draper's shop, and\r\nI was a saleswoman in a ready-made clothing establishment. I remember it\r\nas if it were yesterday. I used to come and spend Sundays here\r\noccasionally with a friend of mine, Rose Leveque, with whom I lived in\r\nthe Rue Pigalle, and Rose had a sweetheart, while I had none. He used to\r\nbring us here, and one Saturday he told me laughing that he should bring\r\na friend with him the next day. I quite understood what he meant, but I\r\nreplied that it would be no good; for I was virtuous, monsieur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day we met Monsieur Beaurain at the railway station, and in\r\nthose days he was good-looking, but I had made up my mind not to\r\nencourage him, and I did not. Well, we arrived at Bezons. It was a\r\nlovely day, the sort of day that touches your heart. When it is fine\r\neven now, just as it used to be formerly, I grow quite foolish, and when\r\nI am in the country I utterly lose my head. The green grass, the\r\nswallows flying so swiftly, the smell of the grass, the scarlet poppies,\r\nthe daisies, all that makes me crazy. It is like champagne when one is\r\nnot accustomed to it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was lovely weather, warm and bright, and it seemed to\r\npenetrate your body through your eyes when you looked and through your\r\nmouth when you breathed. Rose and Simon hugged and kissed each other\r\nevery minute, and that gave me a queer feeling! Monsieur Beaurain and I\r\nwalked behind them, without speaking much, for when people do not know\r\neach other, they do not find anything to talk about. He looked timid,\r\nand I liked to see his embarrassment. At last we got to the little wood;\r\nit was as cool as in a bath there, and we four sat down. Rose and her\r\nlover teased me because I looked rather stern, but you will understand\r\nthat I could not be otherwise. And then they began to kiss and hug\r\nagain, without putting any more restraint upon themselves than if we had\r\nnot been there; and then they whispered together, and got up and went\r\noff among the trees, without saying a word. You may fancy what I looked\r\nlike, alone with this young fellow whom I saw for the first time. I felt\r\nso confused at seeing them go that it gave me courage, and I began to\r\ntalk. I asked him what his business was, and he said he was a linen\r\ndraper's assistant, as I told you just now. We talked for a few minutes,\r\nand that made him bold, and he wanted to take liberties with me, but I\r\ntold him sharply to keep his place. Is not that true, Monsieur\r\nBeaurain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Beaurain, who was looking at his feet in confusion, did not\r\nreply, and she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThen he saw that I was virtuous, and he began\r\nto make love to me nicely, like an honorable man, and from that time he\r\ncame every Sunday, for he was very much in love with me. I was very fond\r\nof him also, very fond of him! He was a good-looking fellow, formerly,\r\nand in short he married me the next September, and we started in\r\nbusiness in the Rue des Martyrs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a hard struggle for some years, monsieur. Business did not\r\nprosper, and we could not afford many country excursions, and, besides,\r\nwe had got out of the way of them. One has other things in one's head,\r\nand thinks more of the cash box than of pretty speeches, when one is in\r\nbusiness. We were growing old by degrees without perceiving it, like\r\nquiet people who do not think much about love. One does not regret\r\nanything as long as one does not notice what one has lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, monsieur, business became better, and we were tranquil as to\r\nthe future! Then, you see, I do not exactly know what went on in my\r\nmind, no, I really do not know, but I began to dream like a little\r\nboarding-school girl. The sight of the little carts full of flowers\r\nwhich are drawn about the streets made me cry; the smell of violets\r\nsought me out in my easy-chair, behind my cash box, and made my heart\r\nbeat! Then I would get up and go out on the doorstep to look at the blue\r\nsky between the roofs. When one looks up at the sky from the street, it\r\nlooks like a river which is descending on Paris, winding as it flows,\r\nand the swallows pass to and fro in it like fish. These ideas are very\r\nstupid at my age! But how can one help it, monsieur, when one has worked\r\nall one's life? A moment comes in which one perceives that one could\r\nhave done something else, and that one regrets, oh! yes, one feels\r\nintense regret! Just think, for twenty years I might have gone and had\r\nkisses in the woods, like other women. I used to think how delightful it\r\nwould be to lie under the trees and be in love with some one! And I\r\nthought of it every day and every night! I dreamed of the moonlight on\r\nthe water, until I felt inclined to drown myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not venture to speak to Monsieur Beaurain about this at first. I\r\nknew that he would make fun of me, and send me back to sell my needles\r\nand cotton! And then, to speak the truth, Monsieur Beaurain never said\r\nmuch to me, but when I looked in the glass, I also understood quite well\r\nthat I no longer appealed to any one!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I made up my mind, and I proposed to him an excursion into the\r\ncountry, to the place where we had first become acquainted. He agreed\r\nwithout mistrusting anything, and we arrived here this morning, about\r\nnine o'clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt quite young again when I got among the wheat, for a woman's\r\nheart never grows old! And really, I no longer saw my husband as he is\r\nat present, but just as he was formerly! That I will swear to you,\r\nmonsieur. As true as I am standing here I was crazy. I began to kiss\r\nhim, and he was more surprised than if I had tried to murder him. He\r\nkept saying to me: 'Why, you must be mad! You are mad this morning! What\r\nis the matter with you?' I did not listen to him, I only listened to my\r\nown heart, and I made him come into the wood with me. That is all. I\r\nhave spoken the truth, Monsieur le Maire, the whole truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor was a sensible man. He rose from his chair, smiled, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in peace, madame, and when you again visit our forests, be more\r\ndiscreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTINE\r\n\r\nIt came to him one Sunday after mass. He was walking home from church\r\nalong the by-road that led to his house when he saw ahead of him\r\nMartine, who was also going home.\r\n\r\nHer father walked beside his daughter with the important gait of a rich\r\nfarmer. Discarding the smock, he wore a short coat of gray cloth and on\r\nhis head a round-topped hat with wide brim.\r\n\r\nShe, laced up in a corset which she wore only once a week, walked along\r\nerect, with her squeezed-in waist, her broad shoulders and prominent\r\nhips, swinging herself a little. She wore a hat trimmed with flowers,\r\nmade by a milliner at Yvetot, and displayed the back of her full, round,\r\nsupple neck, reddened by the sun and air, on which fluttered little\r\nstray locks of hair.\r\n\r\nBenoist saw only her back; but he knew well the face he loved, without,\r\nhowever, having ever noticed it more closely than he did now.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he said: \xe2\x80\x9cNom d'un nom, she is a fine girl, all the same, that\r\nMartine.\xe2\x80\x9d He watched her as she walked, admiring her hastily, feeling a\r\ndesire taking possession of him. He did not long to see her face again,\r\nno. He kept gazing at her figure, repeating to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cNom d'un nom,\r\nshe is a fine girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartine turned to the right to enter \xe2\x80\x9cLa Martiniere,\xe2\x80\x9d the farm of her\r\nfather, Jean Martin, and she cast a glance behind her as she turned\r\nround. She saw Benoist, who looked to her very comical. She called out:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Benoist.\xe2\x80\x9d He replied: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Martine; good-\r\nmorning, mait Martin,\xe2\x80\x9d and went on his way.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home the soup was on the table. He sat down opposite his\r\nmother beside the farm hand and the hired man, while the maid servant\r\nwent to draw some cider.\r\n\r\nHe ate a few spoonfuls, then pushed away his plate. His mother said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you feel well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I feel as if I had some pap in my stomach and that takes away my\r\nappetite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe watched the others eating, as he cut himself a piece of bread from\r\ntime to time and carried it lazily to his mouth, masticating it slowly.\r\nHe thought of Martine. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a fine girl, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d And to think\r\nthat he had not noticed it before, and that it came to him, just like\r\nthat, all at once, and with such force that he could not eat.\r\n\r\nHe did not touch the stew. His mother said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Benoist, try and eat a little; it is loin of mutton, it will do\r\nyou good. When one has no appetite, they should force themselves to\r\neat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe swallowed a few morsels, then, pushing away his plate, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I can't go that, positively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they rose from table he walked round the farm, telling the farm\r\nhand he might go home and that he would drive up the animals as he\r\npassed by them.\r\n\r\nThe country was deserted, as it was the day of rest. Here and there in a\r\nfield of clover cows were moving along heavily, with full bellies,\r\nchewing their cud under a blazing sun. Unharnessed plows were standing\r\nat the end of a furrow; and the upturned earth ready for the seed showed\r\nbroad brown patches of stubble of wheat and oats that had lately been\r\nharvested.\r\n\r\nA rather dry autumn wind blew across the plain, promising a cool evening\r\nafter the sun had set. Benoist sat down on a ditch, placed his hat on\r\nhis knees as if he needed to cool off his head, and said aloud in the\r\nstillness of the country: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want a fine girl, she is a fine girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought of it again at night, in his bed, and in the morning when he\r\nawoke.\r\n\r\nHe was not sad, he was not discontented, he could not have told what\r\nailed him. It was something that had hold of him, something fastened in\r\nhis mind, an idea that would not leave him and that produced a sort of\r\ntickling sensation in his heart.\r\n\r\nSometimes a big fly is shut up in a room. You hear it flying about,\r\nbuzzing, and the noise haunts you, irritates you. Suddenly it stops; you\r\nforget it; but all at once it begins again, obliging you to look up. You\r\ncannot catch it, nor drive it away, nor kill it, nor make it keep still.\r\nAs soon as it settles for a second, it starts off buzzing again.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of Martine disturbed Benoist's mind like an imprisoned\r\nfly.\r\n\r\nThen he longed to see her again and walked past the Martiniere several\r\ntimes. He saw her, at last, hanging out some clothes on a line stretched\r\nbetween two apple trees.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm day. She had on only a short skirt and her chemise,\r\nshowing the curves of her figure as she hung up the towels. He remained\r\nthere, concealed by the hedge, for more than an hour, even after she had\r\nleft. He returned home more obsessed with her image than ever.\r\n\r\nFor a month his mind was full of her, he trembled when her name was\r\nmentioned in his presence. He could not eat, he had night sweats that\r\nkept him from sleeping.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, at mass, he never took his eyes off her. She noticed it and\r\nsmiled at him, flattered at his appreciation.\r\n\r\nOne evening, he suddenly met her in the road. She stopped short when she\r\nsaw him coming. Then he walked right up to her, choking with fear and\r\nemotion, but determined to speak to her. He began falteringly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Martine, this cannot go on like this any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied as if she wanted to tease him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cannot go on any longer, Benoist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy thinking of you as many hours as there are in the day,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nShe put her hands on her hips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not oblige you to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is you,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered; \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot sleep, nor rest, nor eat, nor\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you need to cure you of all that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe stood there in dismay, his arms swinging, his eyes staring, his mouth\r\nagape.\r\n\r\nShe hit him a punch in the stomach and ran off.\r\n\r\nFrom that day they met each other along the roadside, in by-roads or\r\nelse at twilight on the edge of a field, when he was going home with his\r\nhorses and she was driving her cows home to the stable.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself carried, cast toward her by a strong impulse of his\r\nheart and body. He would have liked to squeeze her, strangle her, eat\r\nher, make her part of himself. And he trembled with impotence,\r\nimpatience, rage, to think she did not belong to him entirely, as if\r\nthey were one being.\r\n\r\nPeople gossiped about it in the countryside. They said they were\r\nengaged. He had, besides, asked her if she would be his wife, and she\r\nhad answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey, were waiting for an opportunity to talk to their parents about it.\r\n\r\nBut, all at once, she stopped coming to meet him at the usual hour. He\r\ndid not even see her as he wandered round the farm. He could only catch\r\na glimpse of her at mass on Sunday. And one Sunday, after the sermon,\r\nthe priest actually published the banns of marriage between Victoire-\r\nAdelaide Martin and Josephin-Isidore Vallin.\r\n\r\nBenoist felt a sensation in his hands as if the blood had been drained\r\noff. He had a buzzing in the ears; and could hear nothing; and presently\r\nhe perceived that his tears were falling on his prayer book.\r\n\r\nFor a month he stayed in his room. Then he went back to his work.\r\n\r\nBut he was not cured, and it was always in his mind. He avoided the\r\nroads that led past her home, so that he might not even see the trees in\r\nthe yard, and this obliged him to make a great circuit morning and\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nShe was now married to Vallin, the richest farmer in the district.\r\nBenoist and he did not speak now, though they had been comrades from\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as Benoist was passing the town hall, he heard that she was\r\nenceinte. Instead of experiencing a feeling of sorrow, he experienced,\r\non the contrary, a feeling of relief. It was over, now, all over. They\r\nwere more separated by that than by her marriage. He really preferred\r\nthat it should be so.\r\n\r\nMonths passed, and more months. He caught sight of her, occasionally,\r\ngoing to the village with a heavier step than usual. She blushed as she\r\nsaw him, lowered her head and quickened her pace. And he turned out of\r\nhis way so as not to pass her and meet her glance.\r\n\r\nHe dreaded the thought that he might one morning meet her face to face,\r\nand be obliged to speak to her. What could he say to her now, after all\r\nhe had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair\r\nbeside her cheeks? He often thought of those meetings along the\r\nroadside. She had acted horridly after all her promises.\r\n\r\nBy degrees his grief diminished, leaving only sadness behind. And one\r\nday he took the old road that led past the farm where she now lived. He\r\nlooked at the roof from a distance. It was there, in there, that she\r\nlived with another! The apple trees were in bloom, the cocks crowed on\r\nthe dung hill. The whole dwelling seemed empty, the farm hands had gone\r\nto the fields to their spring toil. He stopped near the gate and looked\r\ninto the yard. The dog was asleep outside his kennel, three calves were\r\nwalking slowly, one behind the other, towards the pond. A big turkey was\r\nstrutting before the door, parading before the turkey hens like a singer\r\nat the opera.\r\n\r\nBenoist leaned against the gate post and was suddenly seized with a\r\ndesire to weep. But suddenly, he heard a cry, a loud cry for help coming\r\nfrom the house. He was struck with dismay, his hands grasping the wooden\r\nbars of the gate, and listened attentively. Another cry, a prolonged,\r\nheartrending cry, reached his ears, his soul, his flesh. It was she who\r\nwas crying like that! He darted inside, crossed the grass patch, pushed\r\nopen the door, and saw her lying on the floor, her body drawn up, her\r\nface livid, her eyes haggard, in the throes of childbirth.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, trembling and paler than she was, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, here I am, Martine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied in gasps:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do not leave me, do not leave me, Benoist!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, not knowing what to say, what to do. She began to cry\r\nout again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, it is killing me. Oh, Benoist!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe writhed frightfully.\r\n\r\nBenoist was suddenly seized with a frantic longing to help her, to quiet\r\nher, to remove her pain. He leaned over, lifted her up and laid her on\r\nher bed; and while she kept on moaning he began to take off her clothes,\r\nher jacket, her skirt and her petticoat. She bit her fists to keep from\r\ncrying out. Then he did as he was accustomed to doing for cows, ewes,\r\nand mares: he assisted in delivering her and found in his hands a large\r\ninfant who was moaning.\r\n\r\nHe wiped it off and wrapped it up in a towel that was drying in front of\r\nthe fire, and laid it on a bundle of clothes ready for ironing that was\r\non the table. Then he went back to the mother.\r\n\r\nHe took her up and placed her on the floor again, then he changed the\r\nbedclothes and put her back into bed. She faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Benoist, you have a noble heart.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she wept a little\r\nas if she felt regretful.\r\n\r\nHe did not love her any longer, not the least bit. It was all over. Why?\r\nHow? He could not have said. What had happened had cured him better than\r\nten years of absence.\r\n\r\nShe asked, exhausted and trembling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied calmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very fine girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they were silent again. At the end of a few moments, the mother, in\r\na weak voice, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow her to me, Benoist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up the little one and was showing it to her as if he were\r\nholding the consecrated wafer, when the door opened, and Isidore Vallin\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand at first, then all at once he guessed.\r\n\r\nBenoist, in consternation, stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was passing, I was just passing by when I heard her crying out, and I\r\ncame\xe2\x80\x94there is your child, Vallin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the husband, his eyes full of tears, stepped forward, took the\r\nlittle mite of humanity that he held out to him, kissed it, unable to\r\nspeak from emotion for a few seconds; then placing the child on the bed,\r\nhe held out both hands to Benoist, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour hand upon it, Benoist. From now on we understand each other. If\r\nyou are willing, we will be a pair of friends, a pair of friends!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nBenoist replied: \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I will, certainly, indeed I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALL OVER\r\n\r\nCompte de Lormerin had just finished dressing. He cast a parting glance\r\nat the large mirror which occupied an entire panel in his dressing-room\r\nand smiled.\r\n\r\nHe was really a fine-looking man still, although quite gray. Tall,\r\nslight, elegant, with no sign of a paunch, with a small mustache of\r\ndoubtful shade, which might be called fair, he had a walk, a nobility, a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchic,\xe2\x80\x9d in short, that indescribable something which establishes a\r\ngreater difference between two men than would millions of money. He\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLormerin is still alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went into the drawing-room where his correspondence awaited him.\r\n\r\nOn his table, where everything had its place, the work table of the\r\ngentleman who never works, there were a dozen letters lying beside three\r\nnewspapers of different opinions. With a single touch he spread out all\r\nthese letters, like a gambler giving the choice of a card; and he\r\nscanned the handwriting, a thing he did each morning before opening the\r\nenvelopes.\r\n\r\nIt was for him a moment of delightful expectancy, of inquiry and vague\r\nanxiety. What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him? What did\r\nthey contain of pleasure, of happiness, or of grief? He surveyed them\r\nwith a rapid sweep of the eye, recognizing the writing, selecting them,\r\nmaking two or three lots, according to what he expected from them. Here,\r\nfriends; there, persons to whom he was indifferent; further on,\r\nstrangers. The last kind always gave him a little uneasiness. What did\r\nthey want from him? What hand had traced those curious characters full\r\nof thoughts, promises, or threats?\r\n\r\nThis day one letter in particular caught his eye. It was simple,\r\nnevertheless, without seeming to reveal anything; but he looked at it\r\nuneasily, with a sort of chill at his heart. He thought: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom can\r\nit be? I certainly know this writing, and yet I can't identify it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised it to a level with his face, holding it delicately between two\r\nfingers, striving to read through the envelope, without making up his\r\nmind to open it.\r\n\r\nThen he smelled it, and snatched up from the table a little magnifying\r\nglass which he used in studying all the niceties of handwriting. He\r\nsuddenly felt unnerved. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom is it from? This hand is familiar to me,\r\nvery familiar. I must have often read its tracings, yes, very often. But\r\nthis must have been a long, long time ago. Whom the deuce can it be\r\nfrom? Pooh! it's only somebody asking for money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he tore open the letter. Then he read:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND: You have, without doubt, forgotten me, for it is now\r\ntwenty-five years since we saw each other. I was young; I am old. When I\r\nbade you farewell, I left Paris in order to follow into the provinces my\r\nhusband, my old husband, whom you used to call \xe2\x80\x9cmy hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d Do you\r\nremember him? He died five years ago, and now I am returning to Paris to\r\nget my daughter married, for I have a daughter, a beautiful girl of\r\neighteen, whom you have never seen. I informed you of her birth, but you\r\ncertainly did not pay much attention to so trifling an event.\r\n\r\nYou are still the handsome Lormerin; so I have been told. Well, if you\r\nstill recollect little Lise, whom you used to call Lison, come and dine\r\nwith her this evening, with the elderly Baronne de Vance your ever\r\nfaithful friend, who, with some emotion, although happy, reaches out to\r\nyou a devoted hand, which you must clasp, but no longer kiss, my poor\r\nJaquelet. LISE DE VANCE.\r\n\r\nLormerin's heart began to throb. He remained sunk in his armchair with\r\nthe letter on his knees, staring straight before him, overcome by a\r\npoignant emotion that made the tears mount up to his eyes!\r\n\r\nIf he had ever loved a woman in his life it was this one, little Lise,\r\nLise de Vance, whom he called \xe2\x80\x9cAshflower,\xe2\x80\x9d on account of the strange\r\ncolor of her hair and the pale gray of her eyes. Oh! what a dainty,\r\npretty, charming creature she was, this frail baronne, the wife of that\r\ngouty, pimply baron, who had abruptly carried her off to the provinces,\r\nshut her up, kept her in seclusion through jealousy, jealousy of the\r\nhandsome Lormerin.\r\n\r\nYes, he had loved her, and he believed that he too, had been truly\r\nloved. She familiarly gave him, the name of Jaquelet, and would\r\npronounce that word in a delicious fashion.\r\n\r\nA thousand forgotten memories came back to him, far, off and sweet and\r\nmelancholy now. One evening she had called on him on her way home from a\r\nball, and they went for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne, she in evening\r\ndress, he in his dressing-jacket. It was springtime; the weather was\r\nbeautiful. The fragrance from her bodice embalmed the warm air-the odor\r\nof her bodice, and perhaps, too, the fragrance of her skin. What a\r\ndivine night! When they reached the lake, as the moon's rays fell across\r\nthe branches into the water, she began to weep. A little surprised, he\r\nasked her why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know. The moon and the water have affected me. Every time I see\r\npoetic things I have a tightening at the heart, and I have to cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled, affected himself, considering her feminine emotion charming\r\n\xe2\x80\x94the unaffected emotion of a poor little woman, whom every sensation\r\noverwhelms. And he embraced her passionately, stammering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little Lise, you are exquisite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a charming love affair, short-lived and dainty, it had been and\r\nover all too quickly, cut short in the midst of its ardor by this old\r\nbrute of a baron, who had carried off his wife, and never let any one\r\nsee her afterward.\r\n\r\nLormerin had forgotten, in fact, at the end of two or three months. One\r\nwoman drives out another so quickly in Paris, when one is a bachelor! No\r\nmatter; he had kept a little altar for her in his heart, for he had\r\nloved her alone! He assured himself now that this was so.\r\n\r\nHe rose, and said aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, I will go and dine with her this\r\nevening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd instinctively he turned toward the mirror to inspect himself from\r\nhead to foot. He reflected: \xe2\x80\x9cShe must look very old, older than I look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he felt gratified at the thought of showing himself to her still\r\nhandsome, still fresh, of astonishing her, perhaps of filling her with\r\nemotion, and making her regret those bygone days so far, far distant!\r\n\r\nHe turned his attention to the other letters. They were of no\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe whole day he kept thinking of this ghost of other days. What was she\r\nlike now? How strange it was to meet in this way after twenty-five\r\nyears! But would he recognize her?\r\n\r\nHe made his toilet with feminine coquetry, put on a white waistcoat,\r\nwhich suited him better with the coat than a black one, sent for the\r\nhairdresser to give him a finishing touch with the curling iron, for he\r\nhad preserved his hair, and started very early in order to show his\r\neagerness to see her.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he saw on entering a pretty drawing-room newly furnished\r\nwas his own portrait, an old faded photograph, dating from the days when\r\nhe was a beau, hanging on the wall in an antique silk frame.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and waited. A door opened behind him. He rose up abruptly,\r\nand, turning round, beheld an old woman with white hair who extended\r\nboth hands toward him.\r\n\r\nHe seized them, kissed them one after the other several times; then,\r\nlifting up his head, he gazed at the woman he had loved.\r\n\r\nYes, it was an old lady, an old lady whom he did not recognize, and who,\r\nwhile she smiled, seemed ready to weep.\r\n\r\nHe could not abstain from murmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Lise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is I; it is I, indeed. You would not have known me, would you?\r\nI have had so much sorrow\xe2\x80\x94so much sorrow. Sorrow has consumed my life.\r\nLook at me now\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, don't look at me! But how handsome you have\r\nkept\xe2\x80\x94and young! If I had by chance met you in the street I would have\r\nexclaimed: 'Jaquelet!'. Now, sit down and let us, first of all, have a\r\nchat. And then I will call my daughter, my grown-up daughter. You'll see\r\nhow she resembles me\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, how I resembled her\xe2\x80\x94no, it is not quite\r\nthat; she is just like the 'me' of former days\xe2\x80\x94you shall see! But I\r\nwanted to be alone with you first. I feared that there would be some\r\nemotion on my side, at the first moment. Now it is all over; it is past.\r\nPray be seated, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down beside her, holding her hand; but he did not know what to\r\nsay; he did not know this woman\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to him that he had never seen\r\nher before. Why had he come to this house? What could he talk about? Of\r\nthe long ago? What was there in common between him and her? He could no\r\nlonger recall anything in presence of this grandmotherly face. He could\r\nno longer recall all the nice, tender things, so sweet, so bitter, that\r\nhad come to his mind that morning when he thought of the other, of\r\nlittle Lise, of the dainty Ashflower. What, then, had become of her, the\r\nformer one, the one he had loved? That woman of far-off dreams, the\r\nblonde with gray eyes, the young girl who used to call him \xe2\x80\x9cJaquelet\xe2\x80\x9d so\r\nprettily?\r\n\r\nThey remained side by side, motionless, both constrained, troubled,\r\nprofoundly ill at ease.\r\n\r\nAs they talked only commonplaces, awkwardly and spasmodically and\r\nslowly, she rose and pressed the button of the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to call Renee,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThere was a tap at the door, then the rustle of a dress; then a young\r\nvoice exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLormerin remained bewildered as at the sight of an apparition.\r\n\r\nHe stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, mademoiselle\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, turning toward the mother:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was she, she whom he had known in bygone days, the Lise who\r\nhad vanished and come back! In her he found the woman he had won twenty-\r\nfive years before. This one was even younger, fresher, more childlike.\r\n\r\nHe felt a wild desire to open his arms, to clasp her to his heart again,\r\nmurmuring in her ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Lison!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man-servant announced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner is ready, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they proceeded toward the dining-room.\r\n\r\nWhat passed at this dinner? What did they say to him, and what could he\r\nsay in reply? He found himself plunged in one of those strange dreams\r\nwhich border on insanity. He gazed at the two women with a fixed idea in\r\nhis mind, a morbid, self-contradictory idea:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the real one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother smiled again repeating over and over:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d And it was in the bright eyes of the young girl that\r\nhe found again his memories of the past. Twenty times he opened his\r\nmouth to say to her: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember, Lison?\xe2\x80\x9d forgetting this white-\r\nhaired lady who was looking at him tenderly.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, there were moments when, he no longer felt sure, when he lost\r\nhis head. He could see that the woman of to-day was not exactly the\r\nwoman of long ago. The other one, the former one, had in her voice, in\r\nher glances, in her entire being, something which he did not find again.\r\nAnd he made prodigious efforts of mind to recall his lady love, to seize\r\nagain what had escaped from her, what this resuscitated one did not\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThe baronne said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have lost your old vivacity, my poor friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many other things that I have lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut in his heart, touched with emotion, he felt his old love springing\r\nto life once more, like an awakened wild beast ready to bite him.\r\n\r\nThe young girl went on chattering, and every now and then some familiar\r\nintonation, some expression of her mother's, a certain style of speaking\r\nand thinking, that resemblance of mind and manner which people acquire\r\nby living together, shook Lormerin from head to foot. All these things\r\npenetrated him, making the reopened wound of his passion bleed anew.\r\n\r\nHe got away early, and took a turn along the boulevard. But the image of\r\nthis young girl pursued him, haunted him, quickened his heart, inflamed\r\nhis blood. Apart from the two women, he now saw only one, a young one,\r\nthe old one come back out of the past, and he loved her as he had loved\r\nher in bygone years. He loved her with greater ardor, after an interval\r\nof twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nHe went home to reflect on this strange and terrible thing, and to think\r\nwhat he should do.\r\n\r\nBut, as he was passing, with a wax candle in his hand, before the glass,\r\nthe large glass in which he had contemplated himself and admired himself\r\nbefore he started, he saw reflected there an elderly, gray-haired man;\r\nand suddenly he recollected what he had been in olden days, in the days\r\nof little Lise. He saw himself charming and handsome, as he had been\r\nwhen he was loved! Then, drawing the light nearer, he looked at himself\r\nmore closely, as one inspects a strange thing with a magnifying glass,\r\ntracing the wrinkles, discovering those frightful ravages, which he had\r\nnot perceived till now.\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down, crushed at the sight of himself, at the sight of his\r\nlamentable image, murmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll over, Lormerin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARROT I\r\n\r\nEverybody in Fecamp knew Mother Patin's story. She had certainly been\r\nunfortunate with her husband, for in his lifetime he used to beat her,\r\njust as wheat is threshed in the barn.\r\n\r\nHe was master of a fishing bark and had married her, formerly, because\r\nshe was pretty, although poor.\r\n\r\nPatin was a good sailor, but brutal. He used to frequent Father Auban's\r\ninn, where he would usually drink four or five glasses of brandy, on\r\nlucky days eight or ten glasses and even more, according to his mood.\r\nThe brandy was served to the customers by Father Auban's daughter, a\r\npleasing brunette, who attracted people to the house only by her pretty\r\nface, for nothing had ever been gossiped about her.\r\n\r\nPatin, when he entered the inn, would be satisfied to look at her and to\r\ncompliment her politely and respectfully. After he had had his first\r\nglass of brandy he would already find her much nicer; at the second he\r\nwould wink; at the third he would say. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were only willing,\r\nMam'zelle Desiree\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d without ever finishing his sentence; at the fourth\r\nhe would try to hold her back by her skirt in order to kiss her; and\r\nwhen he went as high as ten it was Father Auban who brought him the\r\nremaining drinks.\r\n\r\nThe old innkeeper, who knew all the tricks of the trade, made Desiree\r\nwalk about between the tables in order to increase the consumption of\r\ndrinks; and Desiree, who was a worthy daughter of Father Auban, flitted\r\naround among the benches and joked with them, her lips smiling and her\r\neyes sparkling.\r\n\r\nPatin got so well accustomed to Desiree's face that he thought of it\r\neven while at sea, when throwing out his nets, in storms or in calms, on\r\nmoonlit or dark evenings. He thought of her while holding the tiller in\r\nthe stern of his boat, while his four companions were slumbering with\r\ntheir heads on their arms. He always saw her, smiling, pouring out the\r\nyellow brandy with a peculiar shoulder movement and then exclaiming as\r\nshe turned away: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, now; are you satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw her so much in his mind's eye that he was overcome by an\r\nirresistible desire to marry her, and, not being able to hold out any\r\nlonger, he asked for her hand.\r\n\r\nHe was rich, owned his own vessel, his nets and a little house at the\r\nfoot of the hill on the Retenue, whereas Father Auban had nothing. The\r\nmarriage was therefore eagerly agreed upon and the wedding took place as\r\nsoon as possible, as both parties were desirous for the affair to be\r\nconcluded as early as convenient.\r\n\r\nThree days after the wedding Patin could no longer understand how he had\r\never imagined Desiree to be different from other women. What a fool he\r\nhad been to encumber himself with a penniless creature, who had\r\nundoubtedly inveigled him with some drug which she had put in his\r\nbrandy!\r\n\r\nHe would curse all day lung, break his pipe with his teeth and maul his\r\ncrew. After he had sworn by every known term at everything that came his\r\nway he would rid himself of his remaining anger on the fish and\r\nlobsters, which he pulled from the nets and threw into the baskets amid\r\noaths and foul language. When he returned home he would find his wife,\r\nFather Auban's daughter, within reach of his mouth and hand, and it was\r\nnot long before he treated her like the lowest creature in the world. As\r\nshe listened calmly, accustomed to paternal violence, he grew\r\nexasperated at her quiet, and one evening he beat her. Then life at his\r\nhome became unbearable.\r\n\r\nFor ten years the principal topic of conversation on the Retenue was\r\nabout the beatings that Patin gave his wife and his manner of cursing at\r\nher for the least thing. He could, indeed, curse with a richness of\r\nvocabulary in a roundness of tone unequalled by any other man in Fecamp.\r\nAs soon as his ship was sighted at the entrance of the harbor, returning\r\nfrom the fishing expedition, every one awaited the first volley he would\r\nhurl from the bridge as soon as he perceived his wife's white cap.\r\n\r\nStanding at the stern he would steer, his eye fixed on the bows and on\r\nthe sail, and, notwithstanding the difficulty of the narrow passage and\r\nthe height of the turbulent waves, he would search among the watching\r\nwomen and try to recognize his wife, Father Auban's daughter, the\r\nwretch!\r\n\r\nThen, as soon as he saw her, notwithstanding the noise of the wind and\r\nwaves, he would let loose upon her with such power and volubility that\r\nevery one would laugh, although they pitied her greatly. When he arrived\r\nat the dock he would relieve his mind, while unloading the fish, in such\r\nan expressive manner that he attracted around him all the loafers of the\r\nneighborhood. The words left his mouth sometimes like shots from a\r\ncannon, short and terrible, sometimes like peals of thunder, which roll\r\nand rumble for five minutes, such a hurricane of oaths that he seemed to\r\nhave in his lungs one of the storms of the Eternal Father.\r\n\r\nWhen he left his ship and found himself face to face with her,\r\nsurrounded by all the gossips of the neighborhood, he would bring up a\r\nnew cargo of insults and bring her back to their dwelling, she in front,\r\nhe behind, she weeping, he yelling at her.\r\n\r\nAt last, when alone with her behind closed doors, he would thrash her on\r\nthe slightest pretext. The least thing was sufficient to make him raise\r\nhis hand, and when he had once begun he did not stop, but he would throw\r\ninto her face the true motive for his anger. At each blow he would roar:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you beggar! There, you wretch! There, you pauper! What a bright\r\nthing I did when I rinsed my mouth with your rascal of a father's\r\napology for brandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor woman lived in continual fear, in a ceaseless trembling of body\r\nand soul, in everlasting expectation of outrageous thrashings.\r\n\r\nThis lasted ten years. She was so timorous that she would grow pale\r\nwhenever she spoke to any one, and she thought of nothing but the blows\r\nwith which she was threatened; and she became thinner, more yellow and\r\ndrier than a smoked fish.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOne night, when her husband was at sea, she was suddenly awakened by the\r\nwild roaring of the wind!\r\n\r\nShe sat up in her bed, trembling, but, as she hear nothing more, she lay\r\ndown again; almost immediately there was a roar in the chimney which\r\nshook the entire house; it seemed to cross the heavens like a pack of\r\nfurious animals snorting and roaring.\r\n\r\nThen she arose and rushed to the harbor. Other women were arriving from\r\nall sides, carrying lanterns. The men also were gathering, and all were\r\nwatching the foaming crests of the breaking wave.\r\n\r\nThe storm lasted fifteen hours. Eleven sailors never returned; Patin was\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Dieppe the wreck of his bark, the Jeune-Amelie,\r\nwas found. The bodies of his sailors were found near Saint-Valery, but\r\nhis body was never recovered. As his vessel seemed to have been cut in\r\ntwo, his wife expected and feared his return for a long time, for if\r\nthere had been a collision he alone might have been picked up and\r\ncarried afar off.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she grew accustomed to the thought that she was rid of\r\nhim, although she would start every time that a neighbor, a beggar or a\r\npeddler would enter suddenly.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, about four years after the disappearance of her husband,\r\nwhile she was walking along the Rue aux Juifs, she stopped before the\r\nhouse of an old sea captain who had recently died and whose furniture\r\nwas for sale. Just at that moment a parrot was at auction. He had green\r\nfeathers and a blue head and was watching everybody with a displeased\r\nlook. \xe2\x80\x9cThree francs!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the auctioneer. \xe2\x80\x9cA bird that can talk like a\r\nlawyer, three francs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA friend of the Patin woman nudged her and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to buy that, you who are rich. It would be good company for\r\nyou. That bird is worth more than thirty francs. Anyhow, you can always\r\nsell it for twenty or twenty-five!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatin's widow added fifty centimes, and the bird was given her in a\r\nlittle cage, which she carried away. She took it home, and, as she was\r\nopening the wire door in order to give it something to drink, he bit her\r\nfinger and drew blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how naughty he is!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she gave it some hemp-seed and corn and watched it pruning\r\nits feathers as it glanced warily at its new home and its new mistress.\r\nOn the following morning, just as day was breaking, the Patin woman\r\ndistinctly heard a loud, deep, roaring voice calling: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to\r\nget up, carrion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer fear was so great that she hid her head under the sheets, for when\r\nPatin was with her as soon as he would open his eyes he would shout\r\nthose well-known words into her ears.\r\n\r\nTrembling, rolled into a ball, her back prepared for the thrashing which\r\nshe already expected, her face buried in the pillows, she murmured:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! he is here! Good Lord! he is here! Good Lord! he has come\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMinutes passed; no noise disturbed the quiet room. Then, trembling, she\r\nstuck her head out of the bed, sure that he was there, watching, ready\r\nto beat her. Except for a ray of sun shining through the window, she saw\r\nnothing, and she said to her self: \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be hidden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a long time and then, gaining courage, she said to herself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have dreamed it, seeing there is nobody here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little reassured, she closed her eyes, when from quite near a furious\r\nvoice, the thunderous voice of the drowned man, could be heard crying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay! when in the name of all that's holy are you going to get up, you\r\nb\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe jumped out of bed, moved by obedience, by the passive obedience of a\r\nwoman accustomed to blows and who still remembers and always will\r\nremember that voice! She said: \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, Patin; what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPut Patin did not answer. Then, at a complete loss, she looked around\r\nher, then in the chimney and under the bed and finally sank into a\r\nchair, wild with anxiety, convinced that Patin's soul alone was there,\r\nnear her, and that he had returned in order to torture her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she remembered the loft, in order to reach which one had to\r\ntake a ladder. Surely he must have hidden there in order to surprise\r\nher. He must have been held by savages on some distant shore, unable to\r\nescape until now, and he had returned, worse that ever. There was no\r\ndoubting the quality of that voice. She raised her head and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou up there, Patin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatin did not answer. Then, with a terrible fear which made her heart\r\ntremble, she climbed the ladder, opened the skylight, looked, saw\r\nnothing, entered, looked about and found nothing. Sitting on some straw,\r\nshe began to cry, but while she was weeping, overcome by a poignant and\r\nsupernatural terror, she heard Patin talking in the room below.\r\n\r\nHe seemed less angry and he was saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNasty weather! Fierce wind!\r\nNasty weather! I haven't eaten, damn it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe cried through the ceiling: \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, Patin; I am getting your meal\r\nready. Don't get angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran down again. There was no one in the room. She felt herself\r\ngrowing weak, as if death were touching her, and she tried to run and\r\nget help from the neighbors, when a voice near her cried out: \xe2\x80\x9cI haven't\r\nhad my breakfast, by G\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the parrot in his cage watched her with his round, knowing, wicked\r\neye. She, too, looked at him wildly, murmuring: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! so it's you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cJust you wait! I'll teach you how to\r\nloaf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat happened within her? She felt, she understood that it was he, the\r\ndead man, who had come back, who had disguised himself in the feathers\r\nof this bird in order to continue to torment her; that he would curse,\r\nas formerly, all day long, and bite her, and swear at her, in order to\r\nattract the neighbors and make them laugh. Then she rushed for the cage\r\nand seized the bird, which scratched and tore her flesh with its claws\r\nand beak. But she held it with all her strength between her hands. She\r\nthrew it on the ground and rolled over it with the frenzy of one\r\npossessed. She crushed it and finally made of it nothing but a little\r\ngreen, flabby lump which no longer moved or spoke. Then she wrapped it\r\nin a cloth, as in a shroud, and she went out in her nightgown, barefoot;\r\nshe crossed the dock, against which the choppy waves of the sea were\r\nbeating, and she shook the cloth and let drop this little, dead thing,\r\nwhich looked like so much grass. Then she returned, threw herself on her\r\nknees before the empty cage, and, overcome by what she had done, kneeled\r\nand prayed for forgiveness, as if she had committed some heinous crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIECE OF STRING\r\n\r\nIt was market-day, and from all the country round Goderville the\r\npeasants and their wives were coming toward the town. The men walked\r\nslowly, throwing the whole body forward at every step of their long,\r\ncrooked legs. They were deformed from pushing the plough which makes the\r\nleft-shoulder higher, and bends their figures side-ways; from reaping\r\nthe grain, when they have to spread their legs so as to keep on their\r\nfeet. Their starched blue blouses, glossy as though varnished,\r\nornamented at collar and cuffs with a little embroidered design and\r\nblown out around their bony bodies, looked very much like balloons about\r\nto soar, whence issued two arms and two feet.\r\n\r\nSome of these fellows dragged a cow or a calf at the end of a rope. And\r\njust behind the animal followed their wives beating it over the back\r\nwith a leaf-covered branch to hasten its pace, and carrying large\r\nbaskets out of which protruded the heads of chickens or ducks. These\r\nwomen walked more quickly and energetically than the men, with their\r\nerect, dried-up figures, adorned with scanty little shawls pinned over\r\ntheir flat bosoms, and their heads wrapped round with a white cloth,\r\nenclosing the hair and surmounted by a cap.\r\n\r\nNow a char-a-banc passed by, jogging along behind a nag and shaking up\r\nstrangely the two men on the seat, and the woman at the bottom of the\r\ncart who held fast to its sides to lessen the hard jolting.\r\n\r\nIn the market-place at Goderville was a great crowd, a mingled multitude\r\nof men and beasts. The horns of cattle, the high, long-napped hats of\r\nwealthy peasants, the head-dresses of the women came to the surface of\r\nthat sea. And the sharp, shrill, barking voices made a continuous, wild\r\ndin, while above it occasionally rose a huge burst of laughter from the\r\nsturdy lungs of a merry peasant or a prolonged bellow from a cow tied\r\nfast to the wall of a house.\r\n\r\nIt all smelled of the stable, of milk, of hay and of perspiration,\r\ngiving off that half-human, half-animal odor which is peculiar to\r\ncountry folks.\r\n\r\nMaitre Hauchecorne, of Breaute, had just arrived at Goderville and was\r\nmaking his way toward the square when he perceived on the ground a\r\nlittle piece of string. Maitre Hauchecorne, economical as are all true\r\nNormans, reflected that everything was worth picking up which could be\r\nof any use, and he stooped down, but painfully, because he suffered from\r\nrheumatism. He took the bit of thin string from the ground and was\r\ncarefully preparing to roll it up when he saw Maitre Malandain, the\r\nharness maker, on his doorstep staring at him. They had once had a\r\nquarrel about a halter, and they had borne each other malice ever since.\r\nMaitre Hauchecorne was overcome with a sort of shame at being seen by\r\nhis enemy picking up a bit of string in the road. He quickly hid it\r\nbeneath his blouse and then slipped it into his breeches, pocket, then\r\npretended to be still looking for something on the ground which he did\r\nnot discover and finally went off toward the market-place, his head bent\r\nforward and his body almost doubled in two by rheumatic pains.\r\n\r\nHe was at once lost in the crowd, which kept moving about slowly and\r\nnoisily as it chaffered and bargained. The peasants examined the cows,\r\nwent off, came back, always in doubt for fear of being cheated, never\r\nquite daring to decide, looking the seller square in the eye in the\r\neffort to discover the tricks of the man and the defect in the beast.\r\n\r\nThe women, having placed their great baskets at their feet, had taken\r\nout the poultry, which lay upon the ground, their legs tied together,\r\nwith terrified eyes and scarlet combs.\r\n\r\nThey listened to propositions, maintaining their prices in a decided\r\nmanner with an impassive face or perhaps deciding to accept the smaller\r\nprice offered, suddenly calling out to the customer who was starting to\r\ngo away:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I'll let you have them, Mait' Anthime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, little by little, the square became empty, and when the Angelus\r\nstruck midday those who lived at a distance poured into the inns.\r\n\r\nAt Jourdain's the great room was filled with eaters, just as the vast\r\ncourt was filled with vehicles of every sort\xe2\x80\x94wagons, gigs, chars-a-\r\nbancs, tilburies, innumerable vehicles which have no name, yellow with\r\nmud, misshapen, pieced together, raising their shafts to heaven like two\r\narms, or it may be with their nose on the ground and their rear in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nJust opposite to where the diners were at table the huge fireplace, with\r\nits bright flame, gave out a burning heat on the backs of those who sat\r\nat the right. Three spits were turning, loaded with chickens, with\r\npigeons and with joints of mutton, and a delectable odor of roast meat\r\nand of gravy flowing over crisp brown skin arose from the hearth,\r\nkindled merriment, caused mouths to water.\r\n\r\nAll the aristocracy of the plough were eating there at Mait' Jourdain's,\r\nthe innkeeper's, a dealer in horses also and a sharp fellow who had made\r\na great deal of money in his day.\r\n\r\nThe dishes were passed round, were emptied, as were the jugs of yellow\r\ncider. Every one told of his affairs, of his purchases and his sales.\r\nThey exchanged news about the crops. The weather was good for greens,\r\nbut too wet for grain.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the drum began to beat in the courtyard before the house. Every\r\none, except some of the most indifferent, was on their feet at once and\r\nran to the door, to the windows, their mouths full and napkins in their\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWhen the public crier had finished his tattoo he called forth in a jerky\r\nvoice, pausing in the wrong places:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it known to the inhabitants of Goderville and in general to all\r\npersons present at the market that there has been lost this morning on\r\nthe Beuzeville road, between nine and ten o'clock, a black leather\r\npocketbook containing five hundred francs and business papers. You are\r\nrequested to return it to the mayor's office at once or to Maitre\r\nFortune Houlbreque, of Manneville. There will be twenty francs reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the man went away. They heard once more at a distance the dull\r\nbeating of the drum and the faint voice of the crier. Then they all\r\nbegan to talk of this incident, reckoning up the chances which Maitre\r\nHoulbreque had of finding or of not finding his pocketbook again.\r\n\r\nThe meal went on. They were finishing their coffee when the corporal of\r\ngendarmes appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\nHe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Maitre Hauchecorne, of Breaute, here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaitre Hauchecorne, seated at the other end of the table answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he followed the corporal.\r\n\r\nThe mayor was waiting for him, seated in an armchair. He was the notary\r\nof the place, a tall, grave man of pompous speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaitre Hauchecorne,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthis morning on the Beuzeville road, you\r\nwere seen to pick up the pocketbook lost by Maitre Houlbreque, of\r\nManneville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe countryman looked at the mayor in amazement frightened already at\r\nthis suspicion which rested on him, he knew not why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I picked up that pocketbook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear I don't even know anything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was seen\xe2\x80\x94I? Who saw me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. Malandain, the harness-maker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the old man remembered, understood, and, reddening with anger,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! he saw me, did he, the rascal? He saw me picking up this string\r\nhere, M'sieu le Maire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd fumbling at the bottom of his pocket, he pulled out of it the little\r\nend of string.\r\n\r\nBut the mayor incredulously shook his head:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not make me believe, Maitre Hauchecorne, that M. Malandain,\r\nwho is a man whose word can be relied on, has mistaken this string for a\r\npocketbook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant, furious, raised his hand and spat on the ground beside him\r\nas if to attest his good faith, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that, it is God's truth, M'sieu le Maire. There! On my soul's\r\nsalvation, I repeat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter you picked up the object in question, you even looked about for\r\nsome time in the mud to see if a piece of money had not dropped out of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good man was choking with indignation and fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can they tell\xe2\x80\x94how can they tell such lies as that to slander an\r\nhonest man! How can they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis protestations were in vain; he was not believed.\r\n\r\nHe was confronted with M. Malandain, who repeated and sustained his\r\ntestimony. They railed at one another for an hour. At his own request\r\nMaitre Hauchecorne was searched. Nothing was found on him.\r\n\r\nAt last the mayor, much perplexed, sent him away, warning him that he\r\nwould inform the public prosecutor and ask for orders.\r\n\r\nThe news had spread. When he left the mayor's office the old man was\r\nsurrounded, interrogated with a curiosity which was serious or mocking,\r\nas the case might be, but into which no indignation entered. And he\r\nbegan to tell the story of the string. They did not believe him. They\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nHe passed on, buttonholed by every one, himself buttonholing his\r\nacquaintances, beginning over and over again his tale and his\r\nprotestations, showing his pockets turned inside out to prove that he\r\nhad nothing in them.\r\n\r\nThey said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou old rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grew more and more angry, feverish, in despair at not being believed,\r\nand kept on telling his story.\r\n\r\nThe night came. It was time to go home. He left with three of his\r\nneighbors, to whom he pointed out the place where he had picked up the\r\nstring, and all the way he talked of his adventure.\r\n\r\nThat evening he made the round of the village of Breaute for the purpose\r\nof telling every one. He met only unbelievers.\r\n\r\nHe brooded over it all night long.\r\n\r\nThe next day, about one in the afternoon, Marius Paumelle, a farm hand\r\nof Maitre Breton, the market gardener at Ymauville, returned the\r\npocketbook and its contents to Maitre Holbreque, of Manneville.\r\n\r\nThis man said, indeed, that he had found it on the road, but not knowing\r\nhow to read, he had carried it home and given it to his master.\r\n\r\nThe news spread to the environs. Maitre Hauchecorne was informed. He\r\nstarted off at once and began to relate his story with the denoument. He\r\nwas triumphant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat grieved me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not the thing itself, do you\r\nunderstand, but it was being accused of lying. Nothing does you so much\r\nharm as being in disgrace for lying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll day he talked of his adventure. He told it on the roads to the\r\npeople who passed, at the cabaret to the people who drank and next\r\nSunday when they came out of church. He even stopped strangers to tell\r\nthem about it. He was easy now, and yet something worried him without\r\nhis knowing exactly what it was. People had a joking manner while they\r\nlistened. They did not seem convinced. He seemed to feel their remarks\r\nbehind his back.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday of the following week he went to market at Goderville,\r\nprompted solely by the need of telling his story.\r\n\r\nMalandain, standing on his doorstep, began to laugh as he saw him pass.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nHe accosted a farmer of Criquetot, who did not let him finish, and\r\ngiving him a punch in the pit of the stomach cried in his face: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\r\ngreat rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he turned his heel upon him.\r\n\r\nMaitre Hauchecorne remained speechless and grew more and more uneasy.\r\nWhy had they called him \xe2\x80\x9cgreat rogue\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nWhen seated at table in Jourdain's tavern he began again to explain the\r\nwhole affair.\r\n\r\nA horse dealer of Montivilliers shouted at him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out, get out, you old scamp! I know all about your old string.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHauchecorne stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut since they found it again, the pocketbook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the other continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, daddy; there's one who finds it and there's another\r\nwho returns it. And no one the wiser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe farmer was speechless. He understood at last. They accused him of\r\nhaving had the pocketbook brought back by an accomplice, by a\r\nconfederate.\r\n\r\nHe tried to protest. The whole table began to laugh.\r\n\r\nHe could not finish his dinner, and went away amid a chorus of jeers.\r\n\r\nHe went home indignant, choking with rage, with confusion, the more cast\r\ndown since with his Norman craftiness he was, perhaps, capable of having\r\ndone what they accused him of and even of boasting of it as a good\r\ntrick. He was dimly conscious that it was impossible to prove his\r\ninnocence, his craftiness being so well known. He felt himself struck to\r\nthe heart by the injustice of the suspicion.\r\n\r\nHe began anew to tell his tale, lengthening his recital every day, each\r\nday adding new proofs, more energetic declarations and more sacred\r\noaths, which he thought of, which he prepared in his hours of solitude,\r\nfor his mind was entirely occupied with the story of the string. The\r\nmore he denied it, the more artful his arguments, the less he was\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are liars proofs,\xe2\x80\x9d they said behind his back.\r\n\r\nHe felt this. It preyed upon him and he exhausted himself in useless\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nHe was visibly wasting away.\r\n\r\nJokers would make him tell the story of \xe2\x80\x9cthe piece of string\xe2\x80\x9d to amuse\r\nthem, just as you make a soldier who has been on a campaign tell his\r\nstory of the battle. His mind kept growing weaker and about the end of\r\nDecember he took to his bed.\r\n\r\nHe passed away early in January, and, in the ravings of death agony, he\r\nprotested his innocence, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little bit of string\xe2\x80\x94a little bit of string. See, here it is, M'sieu\r\nle Maire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 9.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOINE\r\n\r\nHe was known for thirty miles round was father Toine\xe2\x80\x94fat Toine, Toine-\r\nmy-extra, Antoine Macheble, nicknamed Burnt-Brandy\xe2\x80\x94the innkeeper of\r\nTournevent.\r\n\r\nIt was he who had made famous this hamlet buried in a niche in the\r\nvalley that led down to the sea, a poor little peasants' hamlet\r\nconsisting of ten Norman cottages surrounded by ditches and trees.\r\n\r\nThe houses were hidden behind a curve which had given the place the name\r\nof Tournevent. It seemed to have sought shelter in this ravine overgrown\r\nwith grass and rushes, from the keen, salt sea wind\xe2\x80\x94the ocean wind that\r\ndevours and burns like fire, that drys up and withers like the sharpest\r\nfrost of winter, just as birds seek shelter in the furrows of the fields\r\nin time of storm.\r\n\r\nBut the whole hamlet seemed to be the property of Antoine Macheble,\r\nnicknamed Burnt-Brandy, who was called also Toine, or Toine-My-Extra-\r\nSpecial, the latter in consequence of a phrase current in his mouth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Extra-Special is the best in France:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis \xe2\x80\x9cExtra-Special\xe2\x80\x9d was, of course, his cognac.\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years he had served the whole countryside with his\r\nExtra-Special and his \xe2\x80\x9cBurnt-Brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d for whenever he was asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nshall I drink, Toine?\xe2\x80\x9d he invariably answered: \xe2\x80\x9cA burnt-brandy, my son-\r\nin-law; that warms the inside and clears the head\xe2\x80\x94there's nothing better\r\nfor your body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe called everyone his son-in-law, though he had no daughter, either\r\nmarried or to be married.\r\n\r\nWell known indeed was Toine Burnt-Brandy, the stoutest man in all\r\nNormandy. His little house seemed ridiculously small, far too small and\r\ntoo low to hold him; and when people saw him standing at his door, as he\r\ndid all day long, they asked one another how he could possibly get\r\nthrough the door. But he went in whenever a customer appeared, for it\r\nwas only right that Toine should be invited to take his thimbleful of\r\nwhatever was drunk in his wine shop.\r\n\r\nHis inn bore the sign: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Friends' Meeting-Place\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and old Toine was,\r\nindeed, the friend of all. His customers came from Fecamp and\r\nMontvilliers, just for the fun of seeing him and hearing him talk; for\r\nfat Toine would have made a tombstone laugh. He had a way of chaffing\r\npeople without offending them, or of winking to express what he didn't\r\nsay, of slapping his thighs when he was merry in such a way as to make\r\nyou hold your sides, laughing. And then, merely to see him drink was a\r\ncuriosity. He drank everything that was offered him, his roguish eyes\r\ntwinkling, both with the enjoyment of drinking and at the thought of the\r\nmoney he was taking in. His was a double pleasure: first, that of\r\ndrinking; and second, that of piling up the cash.\r\n\r\nYou should have heard him quarrelling with his wife! It was worth paying\r\nfor to see them together. They had wrangled all the thirty years they\r\nhad been married; but Toine was good-humored, while his better-half grew\r\nangry. She was a tall peasant woman, who walked with long steps like a\r\nstork, and had a head resembling that of an angry screech-owl. She spent\r\nher time rearing chickens in a little poultry-yard behind the inn, and\r\nshe was noted for her success in fattening them for the table.\r\n\r\nWhenever the gentry of Fecamp gave a dinner they always had at least one\r\nof Madame Toine's chickens to be in the fashion.\r\n\r\nBut she was born ill-tempered, and she went through life in a mood of\r\nperpetual discontent. Annoyed at everyone, she seemed to be particularly\r\nannoyed at her husband. She disliked his gaiety, his reputation, his\r\nrude health, his embonpoint. She treated him as a good-for-nothing\r\ncreature because he earned his money without working, and as a glutton\r\nbecause he ate and drank as much as ten ordinary men; and not a day went\r\nby without her declaring spitefully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'd be better in the stye along with the pigs! You're so fat it makes\r\nme sick to look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she would shout in his face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait! Wait a bit! We'll see! You'll burst one of these fine days like a\r\nsack of corn-you old bloat, you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToine would laugh heartily, patting his corpulent person, and replying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, old hen, why don't you fatten up your chickens like that?\r\njust try!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, rolling his sleeves back from his enormous arm, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would make a fine wing now, wouldn't it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the customers, doubled up with laughter, would thump the table with\r\ntheir fists and stamp their feet on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe old woman, mad with rage, would repeat:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit! Wait a bit! You'll see what'll happen. He'll burst like a\r\nsack of grain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd off she would go, amid the jeers and laughter of the drinkers.\r\n\r\nToine was, in fact, an astonishing sight, he was so fat, so heavy, so\r\nred. He was one of those enormous beings with whom Death seems to be\r\namusing himself\xe2\x80\x94playing perfidious tricks and pranks, investing with an\r\nirresistibly comic air his slow work of destruction. Instead of\r\nmanifesting his approach, as with others, in white hairs, in emaciation,\r\nin wrinkles, in the gradual collapse which makes the onlookers say:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad! how he has changed!\xe2\x80\x9d he took a malicious pleasure in fattening\r\nToine, in making him monstrous and absurd, in tingeing his face with a\r\ndeep crimson, in giving him the appearance of superhuman health, and the\r\nchanges he inflicts on all were in the case of Toine laughable, comic,\r\namusing, instead of being painful and distressing to witness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit! Wait a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cYou'll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last Toine had an apoplectic fit, and was paralyzed in consequence.\r\nThe giant was put to bed in the little room behind the partition of the\r\ndrinking-room that he might hear what was said and talk to his friends,\r\nfor his head was quite clear although his enormous body was helplessly\r\ninert. It was hoped at first that his immense legs would regain some\r\ndegree of power; but this hope soon disappeared, and Toine spent his\r\ndays and nights in the bed, which was only made up once a week, with the\r\nhelp of four neighbors who lifted the innkeeper, each holding a limb,\r\nwhile his mattress was turned.\r\n\r\nHe kept his spirits, nevertheless; but his gaiety was of a different\r\nkind\xe2\x80\x94more timid, more humble; and he lived in a constant, childlike fear\r\nof his wife, who grumbled from morning till night:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at him there\xe2\x80\x94the great glutton! the good-for-nothing creature, the\r\nold boozer! Serve him right, serve him right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe no longer answered her. He contented himself with winking behind the\r\nold woman's back, and turning over on his other side\xe2\x80\x94the only movement\r\nof which he was now capable. He called this exercise a \xe2\x80\x9ctack to the\r\nnorth\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9ctack to the south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis great distraction nowadays was to listen to the conversations in the\r\nbar, and to shout through the wall when he recognized a friend's voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, my son-in-law! Is that you, Celestin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Celestin Maloisel answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it's me, Toine. Are you getting about again yet, old fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly getting about,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Toine. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven't grown thin;\r\nmy carcass is still good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon he got into the way of asking his intimates into his room to keep\r\nhim company, although it grieved him to see that they had to drink\r\nwithout him. It pained him to the quick that his customers should be\r\ndrinking without him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's what hurts worst of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say: \xe2\x80\x9cthat I cannot drink my\r\nExtra-Special any more. I can put up with everything else, but going\r\nwithout drink is the very deuce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen his wife's screech-owl face would appear at the window, and she\r\nwould break in with the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at him! Look at him now, the good-for-nothing wretch! I've got to\r\nfeed him and wash him just as if he were a pig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when the old woman had gone, a cock with red feathers would\r\nsometimes fly up to the window sill and looking into the room with his\r\nround inquisitive eye, would begin to crow loudly. Occasionally, too, a\r\nfew hens would flutter as far as the foot of the bed, seeking crumbs on\r\nthe floor. Toine's friends soon deserted the drinking room to come and\r\nchat every afternoon beside the invalid's bed. Helpless though he was,\r\nthe jovial Toine still provided them with amusement. He would have made\r\nthe devil himself laugh. Three men were regular in their attendance at\r\nthe bedside: Celestin Maloisel, a tall, thin fellow, somewhat gnarled,\r\nlike the trunk of an apple-tree; Prosper Horslaville, a withered little\r\nman with a ferret nose, cunning as a fox; and Cesaire Paumelle, who\r\nnever spoke, but who enjoyed Toine's society all the same.\r\n\r\nThey brought a plank from the yard, propped it upon the edge of the bed,\r\nand played dominoes from two till six.\r\n\r\nBut Toine's wife soon became insufferable. She could not endure that her\r\nfat, lazy husband should amuse himself at games while lying in his bed;\r\nand whenever she caught him beginning a game she pounced furiously on\r\nthe dominoes, overturned the plank, and carried all away into the bar,\r\ndeclaring that it was quite enough to have to feed that fat, lazy pig\r\nwithout seeing him amusing himself, as if to annoy poor people who had\r\nto work hard all day long.\r\n\r\nCelestin Maloisel and Cesaire Paumelle bent their heads to the storm,\r\nbut Prosper Horslaville egged on the old woman, and was only amused at\r\nher wrath.\r\n\r\nOne day, when she was more angry than usual, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I'd do if I were you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fixed her owl's eyes on him, and waited for his next words.\r\n\r\nProsper went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour man is as hot as an oven, and he never leaves his bed\xe2\x80\x94well, I'd\r\nmake him hatch some eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was struck dumb at the suggestion, thinking that Prosper could not\r\npossibly be in earnest. But he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd put five under one arm, and five under the other, the same day that\r\nI set a hen. They'd all come out at the same time; then I'd take your\r\nhusband's chickens to the hen to bring up with her own. You'd rear a\r\nfine lot that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould it be done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the astonished old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould it be done?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Since eggs can be hatched\r\nin a warm box why shouldn't they be hatched in a warm bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was struck by this reasoning, and went away soothed and reflective.\r\n\r\nA week later she entered Toine's room with her apron full of eggs, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've just put the yellow hen on ten eggs. Here are ten for you; try not\r\nto break them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the amazed Toine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to hatch them, you lazy creature!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nHe laughed at first; then, finding she was serious, he got angry, and\r\nrefused absolutely to have the eggs put under his great arms, that the\r\nwarmth of his body might hatch them.\r\n\r\nBut the old woman declared wrathfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll get no dinner as long as you won't have them. You'll see what'll\r\nhappen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTome was uneasy, but answered nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen twelve o'clock struck, he called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, mother, is the soup ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no soup for you, lazy-bones,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old woman from her\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nHe thought she must be joking, and waited a while. Then he begged,\r\nimplored, swore, \xe2\x80\x9ctacked to the north\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctacked to the south,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nbeat on the wall with his fists, but had to consent at last to five eggs\r\nbeing placed against his left side; after which he had his soup.\r\n\r\nWhen his friends arrived that afternoon they thought he must be ill, he\r\nseemed so constrained and queer.\r\n\r\nThey started the daily game of dominoes. But Tome appeared to take no\r\npleasure in it, and reached forth his hand very slowly, and with great\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's wrong with your arm?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Horslaville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a sort of stiffness in the shoulder,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Toine.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they heard people come into the inn. The players were silent.\r\n\r\nIt was the mayor with the deputy. They ordered two glasses of Extra-\r\nSpecial, and began to discuss local affairs. As they were talking in\r\nsomewhat low tones Toine wanted to put his ear to the wall, and,\r\nforgetting all about his eggs, he made a sudden \xe2\x80\x9ctack to the north,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich had the effect of plunging him into the midst of an omelette.\r\n\r\nAt the loud oath he swore his wife came hurrying into the room, and,\r\nguessing what had happened, stripped the bedclothes from him with\r\nlightning rapidity. She stood at first without moving or uttering a\r\nsyllable, speechless with indignation at sight of the yellow poultice\r\nsticking to her husband's side.\r\n\r\nThen, trembling with fury, she threw herself on the paralytic, showering\r\non him blows such as those with which she cleaned her linen on the\r\nseashore. Tome's three friends were choking with laughter, coughing,\r\nspluttering and shouting, and the fat innkeeper himself warded his\r\nwife's attacks with all the prudence of which he was capable, that he\r\nmight not also break the five eggs at his other side.\r\n\r\nTome was conquered. He had to hatch eggs, he had to give up his games of\r\ndominoes and renounce movement of any sort, for the old woman angrily\r\ndeprived him of food whenever he broke an egg.\r\n\r\nHe lay on his back, with eyes fixed on the ceiling, motionless, his arms\r\nraised like wings, warming against his body the rudimentary chickens\r\nenclosed in their white shells.\r\n\r\nHe spoke now only in hushed tones; as if he feared a noise as much as\r\nmotion, and he took a feverish interest in the yellow hen who was\r\naccomplishing in the poultry-yard the same task as he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the yellow hen eaten her food all right?\xe2\x80\x9d he would ask his wife.\r\n\r\nAnd the old woman went from her fowls to her husband and from her\r\nhusband to her fowls, devoured by anxiety as to the welfare of the\r\nlittle chickens who were maturing in the bed and in the nest.\r\n\r\nThe country people who knew the story came, agog with curiosity, to ask\r\nnews of Toine. They entered his room on tiptoe, as one enters a sick-\r\nchamber, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! how goes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toine; \xe2\x80\x9conly it keeps me fearfully hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne morning his wife entered in a state of great excitement, and\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe yellow hen has seven chickens! Three of the eggs were addled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToine's heart beat painfully. How many would he have?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it soon be over?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with the anguish of a woman who is\r\nabout to become a mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's to be hoped so!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old woman crossly, haunted by fear\r\nof failure.\r\n\r\nThey waited. Friends of Toine who had got wind that his time was drawing\r\nnear arrived, and filled the little room.\r\n\r\nNothing else was talked about in the neighboring cottages. Inquirers\r\nasked one another for news as they stood at their doors.\r\n\r\nAbout three o'clock Toine fell asleep. He slumbered half his time\r\nnowadays. He was suddenly awakened by an unaccustomed tickling under his\r\nright arm. He put his left hand on the spot, and seized a little\r\ncreature covered with yellow down, which fluttered in his hand.\r\n\r\nHis emotion was so great that he cried out, and let go his hold of the\r\nchicken, which ran over his chest. The bar was full of people at the\r\ntime. The customers rushed to Toine's room, and made a circle round him\r\nas they would round a travelling showman; while Madame Toine picked up\r\nthe chicken, which had taken refuge under her husband's beard.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke, so great was the tension. It was a warm April day. Outside\r\nthe window the yellow hen could be heard calling to her newly-fledged\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nToine, who was perspiring with emotion and anxiety, murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have another now\xe2\x80\x94under the left arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis' wife plunged her great bony hand into the bed, and pulled out a\r\nsecond chicken with all the care of a midwife.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors wanted to see it. It was passed from one to another, and\r\nexamined as if it were a phenomenon.\r\n\r\nFor twenty minutes no more hatched out, then four emerged at the same\r\nmoment from their shells.\r\n\r\nThere was a great commotion among the lookers-on. And Toine smiled with\r\nsatisfaction, beginning to take pride in this unusual sort of paternity.\r\nThere were not many like him! Truly, he was a remarkable specimen of\r\nhumanity!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes six!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat heavens, what a christening we'll\r\nhave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a loud laugh rose from all present. Newcomers filled the bar. They\r\nasked one another:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many are there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToine's wife took this new family to the hen, who clucked loudly,\r\nbristled her feathers, and spread her wings wide to shelter her growing\r\nbrood of little ones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's one more!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toine.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken. There were three! It was an unalloyed triumph! The last\r\nchicken broke through its shell at seven o'clock in the evening. All the\r\neggs were good! And Toine, beside himself with joy, his brood hatched\r\nout, exultant, kissed the tiny creature on the back, almost suffocating\r\nit. He wanted to keep it in his bed until morning, moved by a mother's\r\ntenderness toward the tiny being which he had brought to life, but the\r\nold woman carried it away like the others, turning a deaf ear to her\r\nhusband's entreaties.\r\n\r\nThe delighted spectators went off to spread the news of the event, and\r\nHorslaville, who was the last to go, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll invite me when the first is cooked, won't you, Toine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this idea a smile overspread the fat man's face, and he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I'll invite you, my son-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME HUSSON'S \xe2\x80\x9cROSIER\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had just left Gisors, where I was awakened to hearing the name of the\r\ntown called out by the guards, and I was dozing off again when a\r\nterrific shock threw me forward on top of a large lady who sat opposite\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOne of the wheels of the engine had broken, and the engine itself lay\r\nacross the track. The tender and the baggage car were also derailed, and\r\nlay beside this mutilated engine, which rattled, groaned, hissed,\r\npuffed, sputtered, and resembled those horses that fall in the street\r\nwith their flanks heaving, their breast palpitating, their nostrils\r\nsteaming and their whole body trembling, but incapable of the slightest\r\neffort to rise and start off again.\r\n\r\nThere were no dead or wounded; only a few with bruises, for the train\r\nwas not going at full speed. And we looked with sorrow at the great\r\ncrippled iron creature that could not draw us along any more, and that\r\nblocked the track, perhaps for some time, for no doubt they would have\r\nto send to Paris for a special train to come to our aid.\r\n\r\nIt was then ten o'clock in the morning, and I at once decided to go back\r\nto Gisors for breakfast.\r\n\r\nAs I was walking along I said to myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGisors, Gisors\xe2\x80\x94why, I know someone there!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it? Gisors? Let me see, I have a friend in this town.\xe2\x80\x9d A name\r\nsuddenly came to my mind, \xe2\x80\x9cAlbert Marambot.\xe2\x80\x9d He was an old school friend\r\nwhom I had not seen for at least twelve years, and who was practicing\r\nmedicine in Gisors. He had often written, inviting me to come and see\r\nhim, and I had always promised to do so, without keeping my word. But at\r\nlast I would take advantage of this opportunity.\r\n\r\nI asked the first passer-by:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where Dr. Marambot lives?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied, without hesitation, and with the drawling accent of the\r\nNormans:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRue Dauphine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI presently saw, on the door of the house he pointed out, a large brass\r\nplate on which was engraved the name of my old chum. I rang the bell,\r\nbut the servant, a yellow-haired girl who moved slowly, said with a\r\nStupid air:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe isn't here, he isn't here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard a sound of forks and of glasses and I cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Marambot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA door opened and a large man, with whiskers and a cross look on his\r\nface, appeared, carrying a dinner napkin in his hand.\r\n\r\nI certainly should not have recognized him. One would have said he was\r\nforty-five at least, and, in a second, all the provincial life which\r\nmakes one grow heavy, dull and old came before me. In a single flash of\r\nthought, quicker than the act of extending my hand to him, I could see\r\nhis life, his manner of existence, his line of thought and his theories\r\nof things in general. I guessed at the prolonged meals that had rounded\r\nout his stomach, his after-dinner naps from the torpor of a slow\r\nindigestion aided by cognac, and his vague glances cast on the patient\r\nwhile he thought of the chicken that was roasting before the fire. His\r\nconversations about cooking, about cider, brandy and wine, the way of\r\npreparing certain dishes and of blending certain sauces were revealed to\r\nme at sight of his puffy red cheeks, his heavy lips and his lustreless\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not recognize me. I am Raoul Aubertin,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nHe opened his arms and gave me such a hug that I thought he would choke\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not breakfasted, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate! I was just sitting down to table and I have an excellent\r\ntrout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive minutes later I was sitting opposite him at breakfast. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a bachelor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you like it here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime does not hang heavy; I am busy. I have patients and friends. I eat\r\nwell, have good health, enjoy laughing and shooting. I get along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not life very monotonous in this little town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear boy, not when one knows how to fill in the time. A little\r\ntown, in fact, is like a large one. The incidents and amusements are\r\nless varied, but one makes more of them; one has fewer acquaintances,\r\nbut one meets them more frequently. When you know all the windows in a\r\nstreet, each one of them interests you and puzzles you more than a whole\r\nstreet in Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little town is very amusing, you know, very amusing, very amusing.\r\nWhy, take Gisors. I know it at the tips of my fingers, from its\r\nbeginning up to the present time. You have no idea what queer history it\r\nhas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you belong to Gisors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? No. I come from Gournay, its neighbor and rival. Gournay is to\r\nGisors what Lucullus was to Cicero. Here, everything is for glory; they\r\nsay 'the proud people of Gisors.' At Gournay, everything is for the\r\nstomach; they say 'the chewers of Gournay.' Gisors despises Gournay, but\r\nGournay laughs at Gisors. It is a very comical country, this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI perceived that I was eating something very delicious, hard-boiled eggs\r\nwrapped in a covering of meat jelly flavored with herbs and put on ice\r\nfor a few moments. I said as I smacked my lips to compliment Marambot:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo things are necessary, good jelly, which is hard to get, and good\r\neggs. Oh, how rare good eggs are, with the yolks slightly reddish, and\r\nwith a good flavor! I have two poultry yards, one for eggs and the other\r\nfor chickens. I feed my laying hens in a special manner. I have my own\r\nideas on the subject. In an egg, as in the meat of a chicken, in beef,\r\nor in mutton, in milk, in everything, one perceives, and ought to taste,\r\nthe juice, the quintessence of all the food on which the animal has fed.\r\nHow much better food we could have if more attention were paid to this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed as I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a gourmand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu. It is only imbeciles who are not. One is a gourmand as one is\r\nan artist, as one is learned, as one is a poet. The sense of taste, my\r\nfriend, is very delicate, capable of perfection, and quite as worthy of\r\nrespect as the eye and the ear. A person who lacks this sense is\r\ndeprived of an exquisite faculty, the faculty of discerning the quality\r\nof food, just as one may lack the faculty of discerning the beauties of\r\na book or of a work of art; it means to be deprived of an essential\r\norgan, of something that belongs to higher humanity; it means to belong\r\nto one of those innumerable classes of the infirm, the unfortunate, and\r\nthe fools of which our race is composed; it means to have the mouth of\r\nan animal, in a word, just like the mind of an animal. A man who cannot\r\ndistinguish one kind of lobster from another; a herring\xe2\x80\x94that admirable\r\nfish that has all the flavors, all the odors of the sea\xe2\x80\x94from a mackerel\r\nor a whiting; and a Cresane from a Duchess pear, may be compared to a\r\nman who should mistake Balzac for Eugene Sue; a symphony of Beethoven\r\nfor a military march composed by the bandmaster of a regiment; and the\r\nApollo Belvidere for the statue of General de Blaumont.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is General de Blaumont?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that's true, you do not know. It is easy to tell that you do not\r\nbelong to Gisors. I told you just now, my dear boy, that they called the\r\ninhabitants of this town 'the proud people of Gisors,' and never was an\r\nepithet better deserved. But let us finish breakfast first, and then I\r\nwill tell you about our town and take you to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped talking every now and then while he slowly drank a glass of\r\nwine which he gazed at affectionately as he replaced the glass on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing to see him, with a napkin tied around his neck, his\r\ncheeks flushed, his eyes eager, and his whiskers spreading round his\r\nmouth as it kept working.\r\n\r\nHe made me eat until I was almost choking. Then, as I was about to\r\nreturn to the railway station, he seized me by the arm and took me\r\nthrough the streets. The town, of a pretty, provincial type, commanded\r\nby its citadel, the most curious monument of military architecture of\r\nthe seventh century to be found in France, overlooks, in its turn, a\r\nlong, green valley, where the large Norman cows graze and ruminate in\r\nthe pastures.\r\n\r\nThe doctor quoted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Gisors, a town of 4,000 inhabitants in the department of Eure,\r\nmentioned in Caesar's Commentaries: Caesaris ostium, then Caesartium,\r\nCaesortium, Gisortium, Gisors.' I shall not take you to visit the old\r\nRoman encampment, the remains of which are still in existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, it seems to me that you are affected with a special\r\nmalady that, as a doctor, you ought to study; it is called the spirit of\r\nprovincialism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spirit of provincialism, my friend, is nothing but natural\r\npatriotism,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love my house, my town and my province because\r\nI discover in them the customs of my own village; but if I love my\r\ncountry, if I become angry when a neighbor sets foot in it, it is\r\nbecause I feel that my home is in danger, because the frontier that I do\r\nnot know is the high road to my province. For instance, I am a Norman, a\r\ntrue Norman; well, in spite of my hatred of the German and my desire for\r\nrevenge, I do not detest them, I do not hate them by instinct as I hate\r\nthe English, the real, hereditary natural enemy of the Normans; for the\r\nEnglish traversed this soil inhabited by my ancestors, plundered and\r\nravaged it twenty times, and my aversion to this perfidious people was\r\ntransmitted to me at birth by my father. See, here is the statue of the\r\ngeneral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat general?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Blaumont! We had to have a statue. We are not 'the proud people\r\nof Gisors' for nothing! So we discovered General de Blaumont. Look in\r\nthis bookseller's window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew me towards the bookstore, where about fifteen red, yellow and\r\nblue volumes attracted the eye. As I read the titles, I began to laugh\r\nidiotically. They read:\r\n\r\nGisors, its origin, its future, by M. X. . . ., member of several\r\nlearned societies; History of Gisors, by the Abbe A . . .; Gisors from\r\nthe time of Caesar to the present day, by M. B. . . ., Landowner; Gisors\r\nand its environs, by Doctor C. D. . . .; The Glories of Gisors, by a\r\nDiscoverer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Marambot, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a year, not a single year, you\r\nunderstand, passes without a fresh history of Gisors being published\r\nhere; we now have twenty-three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the glories of Gisors?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will not mention them all, only the principal ones. We had first\r\nGeneral de Blaumont, then Baron Davillier, the celebrated ceramist who\r\nexplored Spain and the Balearic Isles, and brought to the notice of\r\ncollectors the wonderful Hispano-Arabic china. In literature we have a\r\nvery clever journalist, now dead, Charles Brainne, and among those who\r\nare living, the very eminent editor of the Nouvelliste de Rouen, Charles\r\nLapierre . . . and many others, many others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were traversing along street with a gentle incline, with a June sun\r\nbeating down on it and driving the residents into their houses.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there appeared at the farther end of the street a drunken man\r\nwho was staggering along, with his head forward his arms and legs limp.\r\nHe would walk forward rapidly three, six, or ten steps and then stop.\r\nWhen these energetic movements landed him in the middle of the road he\r\nstopped short and swayed on his feet, hesitating between falling and a\r\nfresh start. Then he would dart off in any direction, sometimes falling\r\nagainst the wall of a house, against which he seemed to be fastened, as\r\nthough he were trying to get in through the wall. Then he would suddenly\r\nturn round and look ahead of him, his mouth open and his eyes blinking\r\nin the sunlight, and getting away from the wall by a movement of the\r\nhips, he started off once more.\r\n\r\nA little yellow dog, a half-starved cur, followed him, barking; stopping\r\nwhen he stopped, and starting off when he started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marambot, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is Madame Husson's 'Rosier'.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Husson's 'Rosier',\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is what we call drunkards round here. The name comes from an\r\nold story which has now become a legend, although it is true in all\r\nrespects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it an amusing story?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery amusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, tell it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere lived formerly in this town a very upright old lady who was a\r\ngreat guardian of morals and was called Mme. Husson. You know, I am\r\ntelling you the real names and not imaginary ones. Mme. Husson took a\r\nspecial interest in good works, in helping the poor and encouraging the\r\ndeserving. She was a little woman with a quick walk and wore a black\r\nwig. She was ceremonious, polite, on very good terms with the Almighty\r\nin the person of Abby Malon, and had a profound horror, an inborn horror\r\nof vice, and, in particular, of the vice the Church calls\r\nlasciviousness. Any irregularity before marriage made her furious,\r\nexasperated her till she was beside herself.\r\n\r\nNow, this was the period when they presented a prize as a reward of\r\nvirtue to any girl in the environs of Paris who was found to be chaste.\r\nShe was called a Rosiere, and Mme. Husson got the idea that she would\r\ninstitute a similar ceremony at Gisors. She spoke about it to Abbe\r\nMalon, who at once made out a list of candidates.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mme. Husson had a servant, an old woman called Francoise, as\r\nupright as her mistress. As soon as the priest had left, madame called\r\nthe servant and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Francoise, here are the girls whose names M. le cure has\r\nsubmitted to me for the prize of virtue; try and find out what\r\nreputation they bear in the district.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Francoise set out. She collected all the scandal, all the stories,\r\nall the tattle, all the suspicions. That she might omit nothing, she\r\nwrote it all down together with her memoranda in her housekeeping book,\r\nand handed it each morning to Mme. Husson, who, after adjusting her\r\nspectacles on her thin nose, read as follows:\r\n\r\nBread...........................four sous\r\nMilk............................two sous Butter\r\n.........................eight sous Malvina Levesque got into trouble\r\nlast year with Mathurin Poilu. Leg of mutton...................twenty-\r\nfive sous Salt............................one sou Rosalie Vatinel was\r\nseen in the Riboudet woods with Cesaire Pienoir, by Mme. Onesime, the\r\nironer, on July the 20th about dusk. Radishes........................one\r\nsou Vinegar.........................two sous Oxalic\r\nacid.....................two sous\r\n\r\nJosephine Durdent, who is not believed to have committed a fault,\r\nalthough she corresponds with young Oportun, who is in service in Rouen,\r\nand who sent her a present of a cap by diligence.\r\n\r\nNot one came out unscathed in this rigorous inquisition. Francoise\r\ninquired of everyone, neighbors, drapers, the principal, the teaching\r\nsisters at school, and gathered the slightest details.\r\n\r\nAs there is not a girl in the world about whom gossips have not found\r\nsomething to say, there was not found in all the countryside one young\r\ngirl whose name was free from some scandal.\r\n\r\nBut Mme. Husson desired that the \xe2\x80\x9cRosiere\xe2\x80\x9d of Gisors, like Caesar's\r\nwife, should be above suspicion, and she was horrified, saddened and in\r\ndespair at the record in her servant's housekeeping account-book.\r\n\r\nThey then extended their circle of inquiries to the neighboring\r\nvillages; but with no satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThey consulted the mayor. His candidates failed. Those of Dr. Barbesol\r\nwere equally unlucky, in spite of the exactness of his scientific\r\nvouchers.\r\n\r\nBut one morning Francoise, on returning from one of her expeditions,\r\nsaid to her mistress:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, madame, that if you wish to give a prize to anyone, there is\r\nonly Isidore in all the country round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Husson remained thoughtful. She knew him well, this Isidore, the\r\nson of Virginie the greengrocer. His proverbial virtue had been the\r\ndelight of Gisors for several years, and served as an entertaining theme\r\nof conversation in the town, and of amusement to the young girls who\r\nloved to tease him. He was past twenty-one, was tall, awkward, slow and\r\ntimid; helped his mother in the business, and spent his days picking\r\nover fruit and vegetables, seated on a chair outside the door.\r\n\r\nHe had an abnormal dread of a petticoat and cast down his eyes whenever\r\na female customer looked at him smilingly, and this well-known timidity\r\nmade him the butt of all the wags in the country.\r\n\r\nBold words, coarse expressions, indecent allusions, brought the color to\r\nhis cheeks so quickly that Dr. Barbesol had nicknamed him \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nthermometer of modesty.\xe2\x80\x9d Was he as innocent as he looked? ill-natured\r\npeople asked themselves. Was it the mere presentiment of unknown and\r\nshameful mysteries or else indignation at the relations ordained as the\r\nconcomitant of love that so strongly affected the son of Virginie the\r\ngreengrocer? The urchins of the neighborhood as they ran past the shop\r\nwould fling disgusting remarks at him just to see him cast down his\r\neyes. The girls amused themselves by walking up and down before him,\r\ncracking jokes that made him go into the store. The boldest among them\r\nteased him to his face just to have a laugh, to amuse themselves, made\r\nappointments with him and proposed all sorts of things.\r\n\r\nSo Madame Husson had become thoughtful.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Isidore was an exceptional case of notorious, unassailable\r\nvirtue. No one, among the most sceptical, most incredulous, would have\r\nbeen able, would have dared, to suspect Isidore of the slightest\r\ninfraction of any law of morality. He had never been seen in a cafe,\r\nnever been seen at night on the street. He went to bed at eight o'clock\r\nand rose at four. He was a perfection, a pearl.\r\n\r\nBut Mme. Husson still hesitated. The idea of substituting a boy for a\r\ngirl, a \xe2\x80\x9crosier\xe2\x80\x9d for a \xe2\x80\x9crosiere,\xe2\x80\x9d troubled her, worried her a little,\r\nand she resolved to consult Abbe Malon.\r\n\r\nThe abbe responded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you desire to reward, madame? It is virtue, is it not, and\r\nnothing but virtue? What does it matter to you, therefore, if it is\r\nmasculine or feminine? Virtue is eternal; it has neither sex nor\r\ncountry; it is 'Virtue.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Mme. Husson went to see the mayor.\r\n\r\nHe approved heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will have a fine ceremony,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd another year if we can\r\nfind a girl as worthy as Isidore we will give the reward to her. It will\r\neven be a good example that we shall set to Nanterre. Let us not be\r\nexclusive; let us welcome all merit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsidore, who had been told about this, blushed deeply and seemed happy.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was fixed for the 15th of August, the festival of the\r\nVirgin Mary and of the Emperor Napoleon. The municipality had decided to\r\nmake an imposing ceremony and had built the platform on the couronneaux,\r\na delightful extension of the ramparts of the old citadel where I will\r\ntake you presently.\r\n\r\nWith the natural revulsion of public feeling, the virtue of Isidore,\r\nridiculed hitherto, had suddenly become respected and envied, as it\r\nwould bring him in five hundred francs besides a savings bank book, a\r\nmountain of consideration, and glory enough and to spare. The girls now\r\nregretted their frivolity, their ridicule, their bold manners; and\r\nIsidore, although still modest and timid, had now a little contented air\r\nthat bespoke his internal satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe evening before the 15th of August the entire Rue Dauphine was\r\ndecorated with flags. Oh, I forgot to tell you why this street had been\r\ncalled Rue Dauphine.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the wife or mother of the dauphin, I do not remember which\r\none, while visiting Gisors had been feted so much by the authorities\r\nthat during a triumphal procession through the town she stopped before\r\none of the houses in this street, halting the procession, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the pretty house! How I should like to go through it! To whom does\r\nit belong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey told her the name of the owner, who was sent for and brought, proud\r\nand embarrassed, before the princess. She alighted from her carriage,\r\nwent into the house, wishing to go over it from top to bottom, and even\r\nshut herself in one of the rooms alone for a few seconds.\r\n\r\nWhen she came out, the people, flattered at this honor paid to a citizen\r\nof Gisors, shouted \xe2\x80\x9cLong live the dauphine!\xe2\x80\x9d But a rhymester wrote some\r\nwords to a refrain, and the street retained the title of her royal\r\nhighness, for\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe princess, in a hurry, Without bell, priest, or beadle, But with\r\nsome water only, Had baptized it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to come back to Isidore.\r\n\r\nThey had scattered flowers all along the road as they do for processions\r\nat the Fete-Dieu, and the National Guard was present, acting on the\r\norders of their chief, Commandant Desbarres, an old soldier of the Grand\r\nArmy, who pointed with pride to the beard of a Cossack cut with a single\r\nsword stroke from the chin of its owner by the commandant during the\r\nretreat in Russia, and which hung beside the frame containing the cross\r\nof the Legion of Honor presented to him by the emperor himself.\r\n\r\nThe regiment that he commanded was, besides, a picked regiment\r\ncelebrated all through the province, and the company of grenadiers of\r\nGisors was called on to attend all important ceremonies for a distance\r\nof fifteen to twenty leagues. The story goes that Louis Philippe, while\r\nreviewing the militia of Eure, stopped in astonishment before the\r\ncompany from Gisors, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, who are those splendid grenadiers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe grenadiers of Gisors,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the general.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have known it,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the king.\r\n\r\nSo Commandant Desbarres came at the head of his men, preceded by the\r\nband, to get Isidore in his mother's store.\r\n\r\nAfter a little air had been played by the band beneath the windows, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosier\xe2\x80\x9d himself appeared\xe2\x80\x94on the threshold. He was dressed in white duck\r\nfrom head to foot and wore a straw hat with a little bunch of orange\r\nblossoms as a cockade.\r\n\r\nThe question of his clothes had bothered Mme. Husson a good deal, and\r\nshe hesitated some time between the black coat of those who make their\r\nfirst communion and an entire white suit. But Francoise, her counsellor,\r\ninduced her to decide on the white suit, pointing out that the Rosier\r\nwould look like a swan.\r\n\r\nBehind him came his guardian, his godmother, Mme. Husson, in triumph.\r\nShe took his arm to go out of the store, and the mayor placed himself on\r\nthe other side of the Rosier. The drums beat. Commandant Desbarres gave\r\nthe order \xe2\x80\x9cPresent arms!\xe2\x80\x9d The procession resumed its march towards the\r\nchurch amid an immense crowd of people who has gathered from the\r\nneighboring districts.\r\n\r\nAfter a short mass and an affecting discourse by Abbe Malon, they\r\ncontinued on their way to the couronneaux, where the banquet was served\r\nin a tent.\r\n\r\nBefore taking their seats at table, the mayor gave an address. This is\r\nit, word for word. I learned it by heart:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man, a woman of means, beloved by the poor and respected by the\r\nrich, Mme. Husson, whom the whole country is thanking here, through me,\r\nhad the idea, the happy and benevolent idea, of founding in this town a\r\nprize for virtue, which should serve as a valuable encouragement to the\r\ninhabitants of this beautiful country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, young man, are the first to be rewarded in this dynasty of\r\ngoodness and chastity. Your name will remain at the head of this list of\r\nthe most deserving, and your life, understand me, your whole life, must\r\ncorrespond to this happy commencement. To-day, in presence of this noble\r\nwoman, of these soldier-citizens who have taken up their arms in your\r\nhonor, in presence of this populace, affected, assembled to applaud you,\r\nor, rather, to applaud virtue, in your person, you make a solemn\r\ncontract with the town, with all of us, to continue until your death the\r\nexcellent example of your youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not forget, young man, that you are the first seed cast into this\r\nfield of hope; give us the fruits that we expect of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor advanced three steps, opened his arms and pressed Isidore to\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRosier\xe2\x80\x9d was sobbing without knowing why, from a confused emotion,\r\nfrom pride and a vague and happy feeling of tenderness.\r\n\r\nThen the mayor placed in one hand a silk purse in which gold tingled\r\n\xe2\x80\x94five hundred francs in gold!\xe2\x80\x94and in his other hand a savings bank book.\r\nAnd he said in a solemn tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHomage, glory and riches to virtue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCommandant Desbarres shouted \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d the grenadiers vociferated, and\r\nthe crowd applauded.\r\n\r\nMme. Husson wiped her eyes, in her turn. Then they all sat down at the\r\ntable where the banquet was served.\r\n\r\nThe repast was magnificent and seemed interminable. One course followed\r\nanother; yellow cider and red wine in fraternal contact blended in the\r\nstomach of the guests. The rattle of plates, the sound of voices, and of\r\nmusic softly played, made an incessant deep hum, and was dispersed\r\nabroad in the clear sky where the swallows were flying. Mme. Husson\r\noccasionally readjusted her black wig, which would slip over on one\r\nside, and chatted with Abbe Malon. The mayor, who was excited, talked\r\npolitics with Commandant Desbarres, and Isidore ate, drank, as if he had\r\nnever eaten or drunk before. He helped himself repeatedly to all the\r\ndishes, becoming aware for the first time of the pleasure of having\r\none's belly full of good things which tickle the palate in the first\r\nplace. He had let out a reef in his belt and, without speaking, and\r\nalthough he was a little uneasy at a wine stain on his white waistcoat,\r\nhe ceased eating in order to take up his glass and hold it to his mouth\r\nas long as possible, to enjoy the taste slowly.\r\n\r\nIt was time for the toasts. They were many and loudly applauded. Evening\r\nwas approaching and they had been at the table since noon. Fine, milky\r\nvapors were already floating in the air in the valley, the light night-\r\nrobe of streams and meadows; the sun neared the horizon; the cows were\r\nlowing in the distance amid the mists of the pasture. The feast was\r\nover. They returned to Gisors. The procession, now disbanded, walked in\r\ndetachments. Mme. Husson had taken Isidore's arm and was giving him a\r\nquantity of urgent, excellent advice.\r\n\r\nThey stopped at the door of the fruit store, and the \xe2\x80\x9cRosier\xe2\x80\x9d was left\r\nat his mother's house. She had not come home yet. Having been invited by\r\nher family to celebrate her son's triumph, she had taken luncheon with\r\nher sister after having followed the procession as far as the banqueting\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nSo Isidore remained alone in the store, which was growing dark. He sat\r\ndown on a chair, excited by the wine and by pride, and looked about him.\r\nCarrots, cabbages, and onions gave out their strong odor of vegetables\r\nin the closed room, that coarse smell of the garden blended with the\r\nsweet, penetrating odor of strawberries and the delicate, slight,\r\nevanescent fragrance of a basket of peaches.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRosier\xe2\x80\x9d took one of these and ate it, although he was as full as an\r\negg. Then, all at once, wild with joy, he began to dance about the\r\nstore, and something rattled in his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised, and put his hand in his pocket and brought out the\r\npurse containing the five hundred francs, which he had forgotten in his\r\nagitation. Five hundred francs! What a fortune! He poured the gold\r\npieces out on the counter and spread them out with his big hand with a\r\nslow, caressing touch so as to see them all at the same time. There were\r\ntwenty-five, twenty-five round gold pieces, all gold! They glistened on\r\nthe wood in the dim light and he counted them over and over, one by one.\r\nThen he put them back in the purse, which he replaced in his pocket.\r\n\r\nWho will ever know or who can tell what a terrible conflict took place\r\nin the soul of the \xe2\x80\x9cRosier\xe2\x80\x9d between good and evil, the tumultuous attack\r\nof Satan, his artifices, the temptations which he offered to this timid\r\nvirgin heart? What suggestions, what imaginations, what desires were not\r\ninvented by the evil one to excite and destroy this chosen one? He\r\nseized his hat, Mme. Husson's saint, his hat, which still bore the\r\nlittle bunch of orange blossoms, and going out through the alley at the\r\nback of the house, he disappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\nVirginie, the fruiterer, on learning that her son had returned, went\r\nhome at once, and found the house empty. She waited, without thinking\r\nanything about it at first; but at the end of a quarter of an hour she\r\nmade inquiries. The neighbors had seen Isidore come home and had not\r\nseen him go out again. They began to look for him, but could not find\r\nhim. His mother, in alarm, went to the mayor. The mayor knew nothing,\r\nexcept that he had left him at the door of his home. Mme. Husson had\r\njust retired when they informed her that her protege had disappeared.\r\nShe immediately put on her wig, dressed herself and went to Virginie's\r\nhouse. Virginie, whose plebeian soul was readily moved, was weeping\r\ncopiously amid her cabbages, carrots and onions.\r\n\r\nThey feared some accident had befallen him. What could it be? Commandant\r\nDesbarres notified the police, who made a circuit of the town, and on\r\nthe high road to Pontoise they found the little bunch of orange\r\nblossoms. It was placed on a table around which the authorities were\r\ndeliberating. The \xe2\x80\x9cRosier\xe2\x80\x9d must have been the victim of some stratagem,\r\nsome trick, some jealousy; but in what way? What means had been employed\r\nto kidnap this innocent creature, and with what object?\r\n\r\nWeary of looking for him without any result, Virginie, alone, remained\r\nwatching and weeping.\r\n\r\nThe following evening, when the coach passed by on its return from\r\nParis, Gisors learned with astonishment that its \xe2\x80\x9cRosier\xe2\x80\x9d had stopped\r\nthe vehicle at a distance of about two hundred metres from the town, had\r\nclimbed up on it and paid his fare, handing over a gold piece and\r\nreceiving the change, and that he had quietly alighted in the centre of\r\nthe great city.\r\n\r\nThere was great excitement all through the countryside. Letters passed\r\nbetween the mayor and the chief of police in Paris, but brought no\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe days followed one another, a week passed.\r\n\r\nNow, one morning, Dr. Barbesol, who had gone out early, perceived,\r\nsitting on a doorstep, a man dressed in a grimy linen suit, who was\r\nsleeping with his head leaning against the wall. He approached him and\r\nrecognized Isidore. He tried to rouse him, but did not succeed in doing\r\nso. The ex-\xe2\x80\x9cRosier\xe2\x80\x9d was in that profound, invincible sleep that is\r\nalarming, and the doctor, in surprise, went to seek assistance to help\r\nhim in carrying the young man to Boncheval's drugstore. When they lifted\r\nhim up they found an empty bottle under him, and when the doctor sniffed\r\nat it, he declared that it had contained brandy. That gave a suggestion\r\nas to what treatment he would require. They succeeded in rousing him.\r\n\r\nIsidore was drunk, drunk and degraded by a week of guzzling, drunk and\r\nso disgusting that a ragman would not have touched him. His beautiful\r\nwhite duck suit was a gray rag, greasy, muddy, torn, and destroyed, and\r\nhe smelt of the gutter and of vice.\r\n\r\nHe was washed, sermonized, shut up, and did not leave the house for four\r\ndays. He seemed ashamed and repentant. They could not find on him either\r\nhis purse, containing the five hundred francs, or the bankbook, or even\r\nhis silver watch, a sacred heirloom left by his father, the fruiterer.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day he ventured into the Rue Dauphine, Curious glances\r\nfollowed him and he walked along with a furtive expression in his eyes\r\nand his head bent down. As he got outside the town towards the valley\r\nthey lost sight of him; but two hours later he returned laughing and\r\nrolling against the walls. He was drunk, absolutely drunk.\r\n\r\nNothing could cure him.\r\n\r\nDriven from home by his mother, he became a wagon driver, and drove the\r\ncharcoal wagons for the Pougrisel firm, which is still in existence.\r\n\r\nHis reputation as a drunkard became so well known and spread so far that\r\neven at Evreux they talked of Mme. Husson's \xe2\x80\x9cRosier,\xe2\x80\x9d and the sots of\r\nthe countryside have been given that nickname.\r\n\r\nA good deed is never lost.\r\n\r\nDr. Marambot rubbed his hands as he finished his story. I asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know the 'Rosier'?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I had the honor of closing his eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he die of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn attack of delirium tremens, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had arrived at the old citadel, a pile of ruined walls dominated by\r\nthe enormous tower of St. Thomas of Canterbury and the one called the\r\nPrisoner's Tower.\r\n\r\nMarambot told me the story of this prisoner, who, with the aid of a\r\nnail, covered the walls of his dungeon with sculptures, tracing the\r\nreflections of the sun as it glanced through the narrow slit of a\r\nloophole.\r\n\r\nI also learned that Clothaire II had given the patrimony of Gisors to\r\nhis cousin, Saint Romain, bishop of Rouen; that Gisors ceased to be the\r\ncapital of the whole of Vexin after the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte;\r\nthat the town is the chief strategic centre of all that portion of\r\nFrance, and that in consequence of this advantage she was taken and\r\nretaken over and over again. At the command of William the Red, the\r\neminent engineer, Robert de Bellesme, constructed there a powerful\r\nfortress that was attacked later by Louis le Gros, then by the Norman\r\nbarons, was defended by Robert de Candos, was finally ceded to Louis le\r\nGros by Geoffry Plantagenet, was retaken by the English in consequence\r\nof the treachery of the Knights-Templars, was contested by Philippe-\r\nAugustus and Richard the Lionhearted, was set on fire by Edward III of\r\nEngland, who could not take the castle, was again taken by the English\r\nin 1419, restored later to Charles VIII by Richard de Marbury, was taken\r\nby the Duke of Calabria occupied by the League, inhabited by Henry IV,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nAnd Marambot, eager and almost eloquent, continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat beggars, those English! And what sots, my boy; they are all\r\n'Rosiers,' those hypocrites!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, after a silence, stretching out his arm towards the tiny river\r\nthat glistened in the meadows, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know that Henry Monnier was one of the most untiring fishermen\r\non the banks of the Epte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Bouffe, my boy, Bouffe was a painter on glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are joking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. How is it you do not know these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADOPTED SON\r\n\r\nThe two cottages stood beside each other at the foot of a hill near a\r\nlittle seashore resort. The two peasants labored hard on the\r\nunproductive soil to rear their little ones, and each family had four.\r\n\r\nBefore the adjoining doors a whole troop of urchins played and tumbled\r\nabout from morning till night. The two eldest were six years old, and\r\nthe youngest were about fifteen months; the marriages, and afterward the\r\nbirths, having taken place nearly simultaneously in both families.\r\n\r\nThe two mothers could hardly distinguish their own offspring among the\r\nlot, and as for the fathers, they were altogether at sea. The eight\r\nnames danced in their heads; they were always getting them mixed up; and\r\nwhen they wished to call one child, the men often called three names\r\nbefore getting the right one.\r\n\r\nThe first of the two cottages, as you came up from the bathing beach,\r\nRolleport, was occupied by the Tuvaches, who had three girls and one\r\nboy; the other house sheltered the Vallins, who had one girl and three\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nThey all subsisted frugally on soup, potatoes and fresh air. At seven\r\no'clock in the morning, then at noon, then at six o'clock in the\r\nevening, the housewives got their broods together to give them their\r\nfood, as the gooseherds collect their charges. The children were seated,\r\naccording to age, before the wooden table, varnished by fifty years of\r\nuse; the mouths of the youngest hardly reaching the level of the table.\r\nBefore them was placed a bowl filled with bread, soaked in the water in\r\nwhich the potatoes had been boiled, half a cabbage and three onions; and\r\nthe whole line ate until their hunger was appeased. The mother herself\r\nfed the smallest.\r\n\r\nA small pot roast on Sunday was a feast for all; and the father on this\r\nday sat longer over the meal, repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish we could have this\r\nevery day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, in the month of August, a phaeton stopped suddenly in\r\nfront of the cottages, and a young woman, who was driving the horses,\r\nsaid to the gentleman sitting at her side:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, look at all those children, Henri! How pretty they are, tumbling\r\nabout in the dust, like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man did not answer, accustomed to these outbursts of admiration,\r\nwhich were a pain and almost a reproach to him. The young woman\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must hug them! Oh, how I should like to have one of them\xe2\x80\x94that one\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94the little tiny one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpringing down from the carriage, she ran toward the children, took one\r\nof the two youngest\xe2\x80\x94a Tuvache child\xe2\x80\x94and lifting it up in her arms, she\r\nkissed him passionately on his dirty cheeks, on his tousled hair daubed\r\nwith earth, and on his little hands, with which he fought vigorously, to\r\nget away from the caresses which displeased him.\r\n\r\nThen she got into the carriage again, and drove off at a lively trot.\r\nBut she returned the following week, and seating herself on the ground,\r\ntook the youngster in her arms, stuffed him with cakes; gave candies to\r\nall the others, and played with them like a young girl, while the\r\nhusband waited patiently in the carriage.\r\n\r\nShe returned again; made the acquaintance of the parents, and reappeared\r\nevery day with her pockets full of dainties and pennies.\r\n\r\nHer name was Madame Henri d'Hubieres.\r\n\r\nOne morning, on arriving, her husband alighted with her, and without\r\nstopping to talk to the children, who now knew her well, she entered the\r\nfarmer's cottage.\r\n\r\nThey were busy chopping wood for the fire. They rose to their feet in\r\nsurprise, brought forward chairs, and waited expectantly.\r\n\r\nThen the woman, in a broken, trembling voice, began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good people, I have come to see you, because I should like\xe2\x80\x94I should\r\nlike to take\xe2\x80\x94your little boy with me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe country people, too bewildered to think, did not answer.\r\n\r\nShe recovered her breath, and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are alone, my husband and\r\nI. We would keep it. Are you willing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant woman began to understand. She asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to take Charlot from us? Oh, no, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen M. d'Hubieres intervened:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife has not made her meaning clear. We wish to adopt him, but he\r\nwill come back to see you. If he turns out well, as there is every\r\nreason to expect, he will be our heir. If we, perchance, should have\r\nchildren, he will share equally with them; but if he should not reward\r\nour care, we should give him, when he comes of age, a sum of twenty\r\nthousand francs, which shall be deposited immediately in his name, with\r\na lawyer. As we have thought also of you, we should pay you, until your\r\ndeath, a pension of one hundred francs a month. Do you understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman had arisen, furious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want me to sell you Charlot? Oh, no, that's not the sort of thing\r\nto ask of a mother! Oh, no! That would be an abomination!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man, grave and deliberate, said nothing; but approved of what his\r\nwife said by a continued nodding of his head.\r\n\r\nMadame d'Hubieres, in dismay, began to weep; turning to her husband,\r\nwith a voice full of tears, the voice of a child used to having all its\r\nwishes gratified, she stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not do it, Henri, they will not do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he made a last attempt: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my friends, think of the child's\r\nfuture, of his happiness, of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant woman, however, exasperated, cut him short:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's all considered! It's all understood! Get out of here, and don't\r\nlet me see you again\xe2\x80\x94the idea of wanting to take away a child like\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame d'Hubieres remembered that there were two children, quite little,\r\nand she asked, through her tears, with the tenacity of a wilful and\r\nspoiled woman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is the other little one not yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather Tuvache answered: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is our neighbors'. You can go to them\r\nif you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went back into his house, whence resounded the\r\nindignant voice of his wife.\r\n\r\nThe Vallins were at table, slowly eating slices of bread which they\r\nparsimoniously spread with a little rancid butter on a plate between the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nM. d'Hubieres recommenced his proposals, but with more insinuations,\r\nmore oratorical precautions, more shrewdness.\r\n\r\nThe two country people shook their heads, in sign of refusal, but when\r\nthey learned that they were to have a hundred francs a month, they\r\nconsidered the matter, consulting one another by glances, much\r\ndisturbed. They kept silent for a long time, tortured, hesitating. At\r\nlast the woman asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to it, man?\xe2\x80\x9d In a weighty tone he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI say that it's not to be despised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame d'Hubieres, trembling with anguish, spoke of the future of their\r\nchild, of his happiness, and of the money which he could give them\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe peasant asked: \xe2\x80\x9cThis pension of twelve hundred francs, will it be\r\npromised before a lawyer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. d'Hubieres responded: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly, beginning with to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman, who was thinking it over, continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred francs a month is not enough to pay for depriving us of the\r\nchild. That child would be working in a few years; we must have a\r\nhundred and twenty francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTapping her foot with impatience, Madame d'Hubieres granted it at once,\r\nand, as she wished to carry off the child with her, she gave a hundred\r\nfrancs extra, as a present, while her husband drew up a paper. And the\r\nyoung woman, radiant, carried off the howling brat, as one carries away\r\na wished-for knick-knack from a shop.\r\n\r\nThe Tuvaches, from their door, watched her departure, silent, serious,\r\nperhaps regretting their refusal.\r\n\r\nNothing more was heard of little Jean Vallin. The parents went to the\r\nlawyer every month to collect their hundred and twenty francs. They had\r\nquarrelled with their neighbors, because Mother Tuvache grossly insulted\r\nthem, continually, repeating from door to door that one must be\r\nunnatural to sell one's child; that it was horrible, disgusting,\r\nbribery. Sometimes she would take her Charlot in her arms,\r\nostentatiously exclaiming, as if he understood:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't sell you, I didn't! I didn't sell you, my little one! I'm not\r\nrich, but I don't sell my children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Vallins lived comfortably, thanks to the pension. That was the cause\r\nof the unappeasable fury of the Tuvaches, who had remained miserably\r\npoor. Their eldest went away to serve his time in the army; Charlot\r\nalone remained to labor with his old father, to support the mother and\r\ntwo younger sisters.\r\n\r\nHe had reached twenty-one years when, one morning, a brilliant carriage\r\nstopped before the two cottages. A young gentleman, with a gold watch-\r\nchain, got out, giving his hand to an aged, white-haired lady. The old\r\nlady said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is there, my child, at the second house.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nentered the house of the Vallins as though at home.\r\n\r\nThe old mother was washing her aprons; the infirm father slumbered at\r\nthe chimney-corner. Both raised their heads, and the young man said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, papa; good-morning, mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both stood up, frightened! In a flutter, the peasant woman dropped\r\nher soap into the water, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, my child? Is it you, my child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms and hugged her, repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\r\nmamma,\xe2\x80\x9d while the old man, all a-tremble, said, in his calm tone which\r\nhe never lost: \xe2\x80\x9cHere you are, back again, Jean,\xe2\x80\x9d as if he had just seen\r\nhim a month ago.\r\n\r\nWhen they had got to know one another again, the parents wished to take\r\ntheir boy out in the neighborhood, and show him. They took him to the\r\nmayor, to the deputy, to the cure, and to the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nCharlot, standing on the threshold of his cottage, watched him pass. In\r\nthe evening, at supper, he said to the old people: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have been\r\nstupid to let the Vallins' boy be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother answered, obstinately: \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn't sell my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father remained silent. The son continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unfortunate to be sacrificed like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Father Tuvache, in an angry tone, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to reproach us for having kept you?\xe2\x80\x9d And the young man\r\nsaid, brutally:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I reproach you for having been such fools. Parents like you make\r\nthe misfortune of their children. You deserve that I should leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe old woman wept over her plate. She moaned, as she swallowed the\r\nspoonfuls of soup, half of which she spilled: \xe2\x80\x9cOne may kill one's self\r\nto bring up children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the boy said, roughly: \xe2\x80\x9cI'd rather not have been born than be what\r\nI am. When I saw the other, my heart stood still. I said to myself: 'See\r\nwhat I should have been now!'\xe2\x80\x9d He got up: \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, I feel that I would\r\ndo better not to stay here, because I would throw it up to you from\r\nmorning till night, and I would make your life miserable. I'll never\r\nforgive you for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two old people were silent, downcast, in tears.\r\n\r\nHe continued: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, the thought of that would be too much. I'd rather\r\nlook for a living somewhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened the door. A sound of voices came in at the door. The Vallins\r\nwere celebrating the return of their child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWARD\r\n\r\nIn society he was called \xe2\x80\x9cHandsome Signoles.\xe2\x80\x9d His name was Vicomte\r\nGontran-Joseph de Signoles.\r\n\r\nAn orphan, and possessed of an ample fortune, he cut quite a dash, as it\r\nis called. He had an attractive appearance and manner, could talk well,\r\nhad a certain inborn elegance, an air of pride and nobility, a good\r\nmustache, and a tender eye, that always finds favor with women.\r\n\r\nHe was in great request at receptions, waltzed to perfection, and was\r\nregarded by his own sex with that smiling hostility accorded to the\r\npopular society man. He had been suspected of more than one love affair,\r\ncalculated to enhance the reputation of a bachelor. He lived a happy,\r\npeaceful life\xe2\x80\x94a life of physical and mental well-being. He had won\r\nconsiderable fame as a swordsman, and still more as a marksman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the time comes for me to fight a duel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall choose\r\npistols. With such a weapon I am sure to kill my man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne evening, having accompanied two women friends of his with their\r\nhusbands to the theatre, he invited them to take some ice cream at\r\nTortoni's after the performance. They had been seated a few minutes in\r\nthe restaurant when Signoles noticed that a man was staring persistently\r\nat one of the ladies. She seemed annoyed, and lowered her eyes. At last\r\nshe said to her husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's a man over there looking at me. I don't know him; do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe husband, who had noticed nothing, glanced across at the offender,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not in the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife continued, half smiling, half angry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's very tiresome! He quite spoils my ice cream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe husband shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Don't take any notice of him. If we were to bother our heads\r\nabout all the ill-mannered people we should have no time for anything\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the vicomte abruptly left his seat. He could not allow this insolent\r\nfellow to spoil an ice for a guest of his. It was for him to take\r\ncognizance of the offence, since it was through him that his friends had\r\ncome to the restaurant. He went across to the man and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you are staring at those ladies in a manner I cannot permit. I\r\nmust ask you to desist from your rudeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone, will you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the vicomte between his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cor you will force\r\nme to extreme measures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man replied with a single word\xe2\x80\x94a foul word, which could be heard\r\nfrom one end of the restaurant to the other, and which startled every\r\none there. All those whose backs were toward the two disputants turned\r\nround; all the others raised their heads; three waiters spun round on\r\ntheir heels like tops; the two lady cashiers jumped, as if shot, then\r\nturned their bodies simultaneously, like two automata worked by the same\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThere was dead silence. Then suddenly a sharp, crisp sound. The vicomte\r\nhad slapped his adversary's face. Every one rose to interfere. Cards\r\nwere exchanged.\r\n\r\nWhen the vicomte reached home he walked rapidly up and down his room for\r\nsome minutes. He was in a state of too great agitation to think\r\nconnectedly. One idea alone possessed him: a duel. But this idea aroused\r\nin him as yet no emotion of any kind. He had done what he was bound to\r\ndo; he had proved himself to be what he ought to be. He would be talked\r\nabout, approved, congratulated. He repeated aloud, speaking as one does\r\nwhen under the stress of great mental disturbance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a brute of a man!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he sat down, and began to reflect. He\r\nwould have to find seconds as soon as morning came. Whom should he\r\nchoose? He bethought himself of the most influential and best-known men\r\nof his acquaintance. His choice fell at last on the Marquis de la Tour-\r\nNoire and Colonel Bourdin-a nobleman and a soldier. That would be just\r\nthe thing. Their names would carry weight in the newspapers. He was\r\nthirsty, and drank three glasses of water, one after another; then he\r\nwalked up and down again. If he showed himself brave, determined,\r\nprepared to face a duel in deadly earnest, his adversary would probably\r\ndraw back and proffer excuses. He picked up the card he had taken from\r\nhis pocket and thrown on a table. He read it again, as he had already\r\nread it, first at a glance in the restaurant, and afterward on the way\r\nhome in the light of each gas lamp: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorges Lamil, 51 Rue Moncey.\xe2\x80\x9d That\r\nwas all.\r\n\r\nHe examined closely this collection of letters, which seemed to him\r\nmysterious, fraught with many meanings. Georges Lamil! Who was the man?\r\nWhat was his profession? Why had he stared so at the woman? Was it not\r\nmonstrous that a stranger, an unknown, should thus all at once upset\r\none's whole life, simply because it had pleased him to stare rudely at a\r\nwoman? And the vicomte once more repeated aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a brute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he stood motionless, thinking, his eyes still fixed on the card.\r\nAnger rose in his heart against this scrap of paper\xe2\x80\x94a resentful anger,\r\nmingled with a strange sense of uneasiness. It was a stupid business\r\naltogether! He took up a penknife which lay open within reach, and\r\ndeliberately stuck it into the middle of the printed name, as if he were\r\nstabbing some one.\r\n\r\nSo he would have to fight! Should he choose swords or pistols?\xe2\x80\x94for he\r\nconsidered himself as the insulted party. With the sword he would risk\r\nless, but with the pistol there was some chance of his adversary backing\r\nout. A duel with swords is rarely fatal, since mutual prudence prevents\r\nthe combatants from fighting close enough to each other for a point to\r\nenter very deep. With pistols he would seriously risk his life; but, on\r\nthe other hand, he might come out of the affair with flying colors, and\r\nwithout a duel, after all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be firm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fellow will be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of his own voice startled him, and he looked nervously round\r\nthe room. He felt unstrung. He drank another glass of water, and then\r\nbegan undressing, preparatory to going to bed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was in bed he blew out the light and shut his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have all day to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cfor setting my affairs in\r\norder. I must sleep now, in order to be calm when the time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very warm in bed, but he could not succeed in losing\r\nconsciousness. He tossed and turned, remained for five minutes lying on\r\nhis back, then changed to his left side, then rolled over to his right.\r\nHe was thirsty again, and rose to drink. Then a qualm seized him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible that I am afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy did his heart beat so uncontrollably at every well-known sound in\r\nhis room? When the clock was about to strike, the prefatory grating of\r\nits spring made him start, and for several seconds he panted for breath,\r\nso unnerved was he.\r\n\r\nHe began to reason with himself on the possibility of such a thing:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I by any chance be afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, indeed; he could not be afraid, since he was resolved to proceed to\r\nthe last extremity, since he was irrevocably determined to fight without\r\nflinching. And yet he was so perturbed in mind and body that he asked\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible to be afraid in spite of one's self?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this doubt, this fearful question, took possession of him. If an\r\nirresistible power, stronger than his own will, were to quell his\r\ncourage, what would happen? He would certainly go to the place\r\nappointed; his will would force him that far. But supposing, when there,\r\nhe were to tremble or faint? And he thought of his social standing, his\r\nreputation, his name.\r\n\r\nAnd he suddenly determined to get up and look at himself in the glass.\r\nHe lighted his candle. When he saw his face reflected in the mirror he\r\nscarcely recognized it. He seemed to see before him a man whom he did\r\nnot know. His eyes looked disproportionately large, and he was very\r\npale.\r\n\r\nHe remained standing before the mirror. He put out his tongue, as if to\r\nexamine the state of his health, and all at once the thought flashed\r\ninto his mind:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this time the day after to-morrow I may be dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd his heart throbbed painfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this time the day after to-morrow I may be dead. This person in\r\nfront of me, this 'I' whom I see in the glass, will perhaps be no more.\r\nWhat! Here I am, I look at myself, I feel myself to be alive\xe2\x80\x94and yet in\r\ntwenty-four hours I may be lying on that bed, with closed eyes, dead,\r\ncold, inanimate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round, and could see himself distinctly lying on his back on\r\nthe couch he had just quitted. He had the hollow face and the limp hands\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nThen he became afraid of his bed, and to avoid seeing it went to his\r\nsmoking-room. He mechanically took a cigar, lighted it, and began\r\nwalking back and forth. He was cold; he took a step toward the bell, to\r\nwake his valet, but stopped with hand raised toward the bell rope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would see that I am afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, instead of ringing, he made a fire himself. His hands quivered\r\nnervously as they touched various objects. His head grew dizzy, his\r\nthoughts confused, disjointed, painful; a numbness seized his spirit, as\r\nif he had been drinking.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time he kept on saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do? What will become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis whole body trembled spasmodically; he rose, and, going to the\r\nwindow, drew back the curtains.\r\n\r\nThe day\xe2\x80\x94a summer day-was breaking. The pink sky cast a glow on the city,\r\nits roofs, and its walls. A flush of light enveloped the awakened world,\r\nlike a caress from the rising sun, and the glimmer of dawn kindled new\r\nhope in the breast of the vicomte. What a fool he was to let himself\r\nsuccumb to fear before anything was decided\xe2\x80\x94before his seconds had\r\ninterviewed those of Georges Lamil, before he even knew whether he would\r\nhave to fight or not!\r\n\r\nHe bathed, dressed, and left the house with a firm step.\r\n\r\nHe repeated as he went:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be firm\xe2\x80\x94very firm. I must show that I am not afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis seconds, the marquis and the colonel, placed themselves at his\r\ndisposal, and, having shaken him warmly by the hand, began to discuss\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want a serious duel?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94quite serious,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the vicomte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou insist on pistols?\xe2\x80\x9d put in the marquis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you leave all the other arrangements in our hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a dry, jerky voice the vicomte answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty paces\xe2\x80\x94at a given signal\xe2\x80\x94the arm to be raised, not lowered\xe2\x80\x94shots\r\nto be exchanged until one or other is seriously wounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the colonel in a satisfied tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare a good shot; all the chances are in your favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they parted. The vicomte returned home to wait for them. His\r\nagitation, only temporarily allayed, now increased momentarily. He felt,\r\nin arms, legs and chest, a sort of trembling\xe2\x80\x94a continuous vibration; he\r\ncould not stay still, either sitting or standing. His mouth was parched,\r\nand he made every now and then a clicking movement of the tongue, as if\r\nto detach it from his palate.\r\n\r\nHe attempted, to take luncheon, but could not eat. Then it occurred to\r\nhim to seek courage in drink, and he sent for a decanter of rum, of\r\nwhich he swallowed, one after another, six small glasses.\r\n\r\nA burning warmth, followed by a deadening of the mental faculties,\r\nensued. He said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how to manage. Now it will be all right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at the end of an hour he had emptied the decanter, and his agitation\r\nwas worse than ever. A mad longing possessed him to throw himself on the\r\nground, to bite, to scream. Night fell.\r\n\r\nA ring at the bell so unnerved him that he had not the strength to rise\r\nto receive his seconds.\r\n\r\nHe dared not even to speak to them, wish them good-day, utter a single\r\nword, lest his changed voice should betray him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is arranged as you wished,\xe2\x80\x9d said the colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cYour adversary\r\nclaimed at first the privilege of the offended part; but he yielded\r\nalmost at once, and accepted your conditions. His seconds are two\r\nmilitary men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the vicomte.\r\n\r\nThe marquis added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease excuse us if we do not stay now, for we have a good deal to see\r\nto yet. We shall want a reliable doctor, since the duel is not to end\r\nuntil a serious wound has been inflicted; and you know that bullets are\r\nnot to be trifled with. We must select a spot near some house to which\r\nthe wounded party can be carried if necessary. In fact, the arrangements\r\nwill take us another two or three hours at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vicomte articulated for the second time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're all right?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite calm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly calm, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men withdrew.\r\n\r\nWhen he was once more alone he felt as though he should go mad. His\r\nservant having lighted the lamps, he sat down at his table to write some\r\nletters. When he had traced at the top of a sheet of paper the words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my last will and testament,\xe2\x80\x9d he started from his seat, feeling\r\nhimself incapable of connected thought, of decision in regard to\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nSo he was going to fight! He could no longer avoid it. What, then,\r\npossessed him? He wished to fight, he was fully determined to fight, and\r\nyet, in spite of all his mental effort, in spite of the exertion of all\r\nhis will power, he felt that he could not even preserve the strength\r\nnecessary to carry him through the ordeal. He tried to conjure up a\r\npicture of the duel, his own attitude, and that of his enemy.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then his teeth chattered audibly. He thought he would\r\nread, and took down Chateauvillard's Rules of Dueling. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the other man practiced in the use of the pistol? Is he well known?\r\nHow can I find out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remembered Baron de Vaux's book on marksmen, and searched it from end\r\nto end. Georges Lamil was not mentioned. And yet, if he were not an\r\nadept, would he have accepted without demur such a dangerous weapon and\r\nsuch deadly conditions?\r\n\r\nHe opened a case of Gastinne Renettes which stood on a small table, and\r\ntook from it a pistol. Next he stood in the correct attitude for firing,\r\nand raised his arm. But he was trembling from head to foot, and the\r\nweapon shook in his grasp.\r\n\r\nThen he said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible. I cannot fight like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the little black, death-spitting hole at the end of the\r\npistol; he thought of dishonor, of the whispers at the clubs, the smiles\r\nin his friends' drawing-rooms, the contempt of women, the veiled sneers\r\nof the newspapers, the insults that would be hurled at him by cowards.\r\n\r\nHe still looked at the weapon, and raising the hammer, saw the glitter\r\nof the priming below it. The pistol had been left loaded by some chance,\r\nsome oversight. And the discovery rejoiced him, he knew not why.\r\n\r\nIf he did not maintain, in presence of his opponent, the steadfast\r\nbearing which was so necessary to his honor, he would be ruined forever.\r\nHe would be branded, stigmatized as a coward, hounded out of society!\r\nAnd he felt, he knew, that he could not maintain that calm, unmoved\r\ndemeanor. And yet he was brave, since the thought that followed was not\r\neven rounded to a finish in his mind; but, opening his mouth wide, he\r\nsuddenly plunged the barrel of the pistol as far back as his throat, and\r\npressed the trigger.\r\n\r\nWhen the valet, alarmed at the report, rushed into the room he found his\r\nmaster lying dead upon his back. A spurt of blood had splashed the white\r\npaper on the table, and had made a great crimson stain beneath the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my last will and testament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD MONGILET\r\n\r\nIn the office old Mongilet was considered a type. He was a good old\r\nemployee, who had never been outside Paris but once in his life.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of July, and each of us, every Sunday, went to roll in\r\nthe grass, or soak in the water in the country near by. Asnieres,\r\nArgenteuil, Chatou, Borgival, Maisons, Poissy, had their habitues and\r\ntheir ardent admirers. We argued about the merits and advantages of all\r\nthese places, celebrated and delightful to all Parsian employees.\r\n\r\nDaddy Mongilet declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are like a lot of sheep! It must be pretty, this country you talk\r\nof!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how about you, Mongilet? Don't you ever go on an excursion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed. I go in an omnibus. When I have had a good luncheon,\r\nwithout any hurry, at the wine shop down there, I look up my route with\r\na plan of Paris, and the time table of the lines and connections. And\r\nthen I climb up on the box, open my umbrella and off we go. Oh, I see\r\nlots of things, more than you, I bet! I change my surroundings. It is as\r\nthough I were taking a journey across the world, the people are so\r\ndifferent in one street and another. I know my Paris better than anyone.\r\nAnd then, there is nothing more amusing than the entresols. You would\r\nnot believe what one sees in there at a glance. One guesses at domestic\r\nscenes simply at sight of the face of a man who is roaring; one is\r\namused on passing by a barber's shop, to see the barber leave his\r\ncustomer whose face is covered with lather to look out in the street.\r\nOne exchanges heartfelt glances with the milliners just for fun, as one\r\nhas no time to alight. Ah, how many things one sees!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the drama, the real, the true, the drama of nature, seen as the\r\nhorses trot by. Heavens! I would not give my excursions in the omnibus\r\nfor all your stupid excursions in the woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and try it, Mongilet, come to the country once just to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was there once,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty years ago, and you will never\r\ncatch me there again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us about it, Mongilet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to hear it. This is how it was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew Boivin, the old editorial clerk, whom we called Boileau?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was my office chum. The rascal had a house at Colombes and always\r\ninvited me to spend Sunday with him. He would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come along, Maculotte [he called me Maculotte for fun]. You will see\r\nwhat a nice excursion we will take.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI let myself be entrapped like an animal, and set out, one morning by\r\nthe 8 o'clock train. I arrived at a kind of town, a country town where\r\nthere is nothing to see, and I at length found my way to an old wooden\r\ndoor with an iron bell, at the end of an alley between two walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rang, and waited a long time, and at last the door was opened. What\r\nwas it that opened it? I could not tell at the first glance. A woman or\r\nan ape? The creature was old, ugly, covered with old clothes that looked\r\ndirty and wicked. It had chicken's feathers in its hair and looked as\r\nthough it would devour me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What do you want?' she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Mr. Boivin.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What do you want of him, of Mr. Boivin?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt ill at ease on being questioned by this fury. I stammered: 'Why-\r\nhe expects me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ah, it is you who have come to luncheon?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes,' I stammered, trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, turning toward the house, she cried in an angry tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Boivin, here is your man!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my friend's wife. Little Boivin appeared immediately on the\r\nthreshold of a sort of barrack of plaster covered with zinc, that looked\r\nlike a foot stove. He wore white duck trousers covered with stains and a\r\ndirty Panama hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter shaking my hands warmly, he took me into what he called his\r\ngarden. It was at the end of another alleyway enclosed by high walls and\r\nwas a little square the size of a pocket handkerchief, surrounded by\r\nhouses that were so high that the sun, could reach it only two or three\r\nhours in the day. Pansies, pinks, wallflowers and a few rose bushes were\r\nlanguishing in this well without air, and hot as an oven from the\r\nrefraction of heat from the roofs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have no trees,' said Boivin, 'but the neighbors' walls take their\r\nplace. I have as much shade as in a wood.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he took hold of a button of my coat and said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You can do me a service. You saw the wife. She is not agreeable, eh?\r\nTo-day, as I had invited you, she gave me clean clothes; but if I spot\r\nthem all is lost. I counted on you to water my plants.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agreed. I took off my coat, rolled up my sleeves, and began to work\r\nthe handle of a kind of pump that wheezed, puffed and rattled like a\r\nconsumptive as it emitted a thread of water like a Wallace drinking\r\nfountain. It took me ten minutes to water it and I was in a bath of\r\nperspiration. Boivin directed me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Here\xe2\x80\x94this plant\xe2\x80\x94a little more; enough\xe2\x80\x94now this one.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe watering pot leaked and my feet got more water than the flowers.\r\nThe bottoms of my trousers were soaking and covered with mud. And twenty\r\ntimes running I kept it up, soaking my feet afresh each time, and\r\nperspiring anew as I worked the handle of the pump. And when I was tired\r\nout and wanted to stop, Boivin, in a tone of entreaty, said as he put\r\nhis hand on my arm:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust one more watering pot full\xe2\x80\x94just one, and that will be all.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo thank me he gave me a rose, a big rose, but hardly had it touched my\r\nbutton-hole than it fell to pieces, leaving only a hard little green\r\nknot as a decoration. I was surprised, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMme. Boivin's voice was heard in the distance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Are you ever coming? When you know that luncheon is ready!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went toward the foot stove. If the garden was in the shade, the\r\nhouse, on the other hand, was in the blazing sun, and the sweating room\r\nin the Turkish bath is not as hot as was my friend's dining room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree plates at the side of which were some half-washed forks, were\r\nplaced on a table of yellow wood in the middle of which stood an\r\nearthenware dish containing boiled beef and potatoes. We began to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA large water bottle full of water lightly colored with wine attracted\r\nmy attention. Boivin, embarrassed, said to his wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'See here, my dear, just on a special occasion, are you not going to\r\ngive us some plain wine?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looked at him furiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'So that you may both get tipsy, is that it, and stay here gabbing all\r\nday? A fig for your special occasion!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said no more. After the stew she brought in another dish of potatoes\r\ncooked with bacon. When this dish was finished, still in silence, she\r\nannounced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That is all! Now get out!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoivin looked at her in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'But the pigeon\xe2\x80\x94the pigeon you plucked this morning?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe put her hands on her hips:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Perhaps you have not had enough? Because you bring people here is no\r\nreason why we should devour all that there is in the house. What is\r\nthere for me to eat this evening?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe rose. Solvin whispered\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Wait for me a second, and we will skip.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went into the kitchen where his wife had gone, and I overheard him\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Give me twenty sous, my dear.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What do you want with twenty sons?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why, one does not know what may happen. It is always better to have\r\nsome money.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe yelled so that I should hear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, I will not give it to you! As the man has had luncheon here, the\r\nleast he can do is to pay your expenses for the day.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoivin came back to fetch me. As I wished to be polite I bowed to the\r\nmistress of the house, stammering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Madame\xe2\x80\x94many thanks\xe2\x80\x94kind welcome.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That's all right,' she replied. 'But do not bring him back drunk, for\r\nyou will have to answer to me, you know!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe set out. We had to cross a perfectly bare plain under the burning\r\nsun. I attempted to gather a flower along the road and gave a cry of\r\npain. It had hurt my hand frightfully. They call these plants nettles.\r\nAnd, everywhere, there was a smell of manure, enough to turn your\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoivin said, 'Have a little patience and we will reach the river bank.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe reached the river. Here there was an odor of mud and dirty water,\r\nand the sun blazed down on the water so that it burned my eyes. I begged\r\nBoivin to go under cover somewhere. He took me into a kind of shanty\r\nfilled with men, a river boatmen's tavern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This does not look very grand, but it is very comfortable.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was hungry. I ordered an omelet. But to and behold, at the second\r\nglass of wine, that beggar, Boivin, lost his head, and I understand why\r\nhis wife gave him water diluted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got up, declaimed, wanted to show his strength, interfered in a\r\nquarrel between two drunken men who were fighting, and, but for the\r\nlandlord, who came to the rescue, we should both have been killed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dragged him away, holding him up until we reached the first bush\r\nwhere I deposited him. I lay down beside him and, it seems, I fell\r\nasleep. We must certainly have slept a long time, for it was dark when I\r\nawoke. Boivin was snoring at my side. I shook him; he rose but he was\r\nstill drunk, though a little less so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe set out through the darkness across the plain. Boivin said he knew\r\nthe way. He made me turn to the left, then to the right, then to the\r\nleft. We could see neither sky nor earth, and found ourselves lost in\r\nthe midst of a kind of forest of wooden stakes, that came as high as our\r\nnoses. It was a vineyard and these were the supports. There was not a\r\nsingle light on the horizon. We wandered about in this vineyard for\r\nabout an hour or two, hesitating, reaching out our arms without finding\r\nany limit, for we kept retracing our steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length Boivin fell against a stake that tore his cheek and he\r\nremained in a sitting posture on the ground, uttering with all his might\r\nlong and resounding hallos, while I screamed 'Help! Help!' as loud as I\r\ncould, lighting candle-matches to show the way to our rescuers, and also\r\nto keep up my courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last a belated peasant heard us and put us on our right road. I took\r\nBoivin to his home, but as I was leaving him on the threshold of his\r\ngarden, the door opened suddenly and his wife appeared, a candle in her\r\nhand. She frightened me horribly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as she saw her husband, whom she must have been waiting for\r\nsince dark, she screamed, as she darted toward me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ah, scoundrel, I knew you would bring him back drunk!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy, how I made my escape, running all the way to the station, and as I\r\nthought the fury was pursuing me I shut myself in an inner room as the\r\ntrain was not due for half an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why I never married, and why I never go out of Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOONLIGHT\r\n\r\nMadame Julie Roubere was expecting her elder sister, Madame Henriette\r\nLetore, who had just returned from a trip to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe Letore household had left nearly five weeks before. Madame Henriette\r\nhad allowed her husband to return alone to their estate in Calvados,\r\nwhere some business required his attention, and had come to spend a few\r\ndays in Paris with her sister. Night came on. In the quiet parlor Madame\r\nRoubere was reading in the twilight in an absent-minded way, raising\r\nher, eyes whenever she heard a sound.\r\n\r\nAt last, she heard a ring at the door, and her sister appeared, wrapped\r\nin a travelling cloak. And without any formal greeting, they clasped\r\neach other in an affectionate embrace, only desisting for a moment to\r\ngive each other another hug. Then they talked about their health, about\r\ntheir respective families, and a thousand other things, gossiping,\r\njerking out hurried, broken sentences as they followed each other about,\r\nwhile Madame Henriette was removing her hat and veil.\r\n\r\nIt was now quite dark. Madame Roubere rang for a lamp, and as soon as it\r\nwas brought in, she scanned her sister's face, and was on the point of\r\nembracing her once more. But she held back, scared and astonished at the\r\nother's appearance.\r\n\r\nOn her temples Madame Letore had two large locks of white hair. All the\r\nrest of her hair was of a glossy, raven-black hue; but there alone, at\r\neach side of her head, ran, as it were, two silvery streams which were\r\nimmediately lost in the black mass surrounding them. She was,\r\nnevertheless, only twenty-four years old, and this change had come on\r\nsuddenly since her departure for Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWithout moving, Madame Roubere gazed at her in amazement, tears rising\r\nto her eyes, as she thought that some mysterious and terrible calamity\r\nmust have befallen her sister. She asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you, Henriette?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSmiling with a sad face, the smile of one who is heartsick, the other\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nothing, I assure you. Were you noticing my white hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Madame Roubere impetuously seized her by the shoulders, and with a\r\nsearching glance at her, repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you? Tell me what is the matter with you. And\r\nif you tell me a falsehood, I'll soon find it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey remained face to face, and Madame Henriette, who looked as if she\r\nwere about to faint, had two pearly tears in the corners of her drooping\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHer sister continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened to you? What is the matter with you? Answer me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, in a subdued voice, the other murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have\xe2\x80\x94I have a lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, hiding her forehead on the shoulder of her younger sister, she\r\nsobbed.\r\n\r\nThen, when she had grown a little calmer, when the heaving of her breast\r\nhad subsided, she commenced to unbosom herself, as if to cast forth this\r\nsecret from herself, to empty this sorrow of hers into a sympathetic\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThereupon, holding each other's hands tightly clasped, the two women\r\nwent over to a sofa in a dark corner of the room, into which they sank,\r\nand the younger sister, passing her arm over the elder one's neck, and\r\ndrawing her close to her heart, listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know that there was no excuse for me; I do not understand myself,\r\nand since that day I feel as if I were mad. Be careful, my child, about\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94be careful! If you only knew how weak we are, how quickly we\r\nyield, and fall. It takes so little, so little, so little, a moment of\r\ntenderness, one of those sudden fits of melancholy which come over you,\r\none of those longings to open your arms, to love, to cherish something,\r\nwhich we all have at certain moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know my husband, and you know how fond I am of him; but he is\r\nmature and sensible, and cannot even comprehend the tender vibrations of\r\na woman's heart. He is always the same, always good, always smiling,\r\nalways kind, always perfect. Oh! how I sometimes have wished that he\r\nwould clasp me roughly in his arms, that he would embrace me with those\r\nslow, sweet kisses which make two beings intermingle, which are like\r\nmute confidences! How I have wished that he were foolish, even weak, so\r\nthat he should have need of me, of my caresses, of my tears!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis all seems very silly; but we women are made like that. How can we\r\nhelp it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet the thought of deceiving him never entered my mind. Now it has\r\nhappened, without love, without reason, without anything, simply because\r\nthe moon shone one night on the Lake of Lucerne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the month when we were travelling together, my husband, with his\r\ncalm indifference, paralyzed my enthusiasm, extinguished my poetic\r\nardor. When we were descending the mountain paths at sunrise, when as\r\nthe four horses galloped along with the diligence, we saw, in the\r\ntransparent morning haze, valleys, woods, streams, and villages, I\r\nclasped my hands with delight, and said to him: 'How beautiful it is,\r\ndear! Give me a kiss! Kiss me now!' He only answered, with a smile of\r\nchilling kindliness: 'There is no reason why we should kiss each other\r\nbecause you like the landscape.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his words froze me to the heart. It seems to me that when people\r\nlove each other, they ought to feel more moved by love than ever, in the\r\npresence of beautiful scenes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, I was brimming over with poetry which he kept me from\r\nexpressing. I was almost like a boiler filled with steam and\r\nhermetically sealed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening (we had for four days been staying in a hotel at Fluelen)\r\nRobert, having one of his sick headaches, went to bed immediately after\r\ndinner, and I went to take a walk all alone along the edge of the lake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a night such as one reads of in fairy tales. The full moon\r\nshowed itself in the middle of the sky; the tall mountains, with their\r\nsnowy crests, seemed to wear silver crowns; the waters of the lake\r\nglittered with tiny shining ripples. The air was mild, with that kind of\r\npenetrating warmth which enervates us till we are ready to faint, to be\r\ndeeply affected without any apparent cause. But how sensitive, how\r\nvibrating the heart is at such moments! how quickly it beats, and how\r\nintense is its emotion!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat down on the grass, and gazed at that vast, melancholy, and\r\nfascinating lake, and a strange feeling arose in me; I was seized with\r\nan insatiable need of love, a revolt against the gloomy dullness of my\r\nlife. What! would it never be my fate to wander, arm in arm, with a man\r\nI loved, along a moon-kissed bank like this? Was I never to feel on my\r\nlips those kisses so deep, delicious, and intoxicating which lovers\r\nexchange on nights that seem to have been made by God for tenderness?\r\nWas I never to know ardent, feverish love in the moonlit shadows of a\r\nsummer's night?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I burst out weeping like a crazy woman. I heard something stirring\r\nbehind me. A man stood there, gazing at me. When I turned my head round,\r\nhe recognized me, and, advancing, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are weeping, madame?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a young barrister who was travelling with his mother, and whom\r\nwe had often met. His eyes had frequently followed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so confused that I did not know what answer to give or what to\r\nthink of the situation. I told him I felt ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe walked on by my side in a natural and respectful manner, and began\r\ntalking to me about what we had seen during our trip. All that I had\r\nfelt he translated into words; everything that made me thrill he\r\nunderstood perfectly, better than I did myself. And all of a sudden he\r\nrepeated some verses of Alfred de Musset. I felt myself choking, seized\r\nwith indescribable emotion. It seemed to me that the mountains\r\nthemselves, the lake, the moonlight, were singing to me about things\r\nineffably sweet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it happened, I don't know how, I don't know why, in a sort of\r\nhallucination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for him, I did not see him again till the morning of his departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me his card!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, sinking into her sister's arms, Madame Letore broke into groans\r\n\xe2\x80\x94almost into shrieks.\r\n\r\nThen, Madame Roubere, with a self-contained and serious air, said very\r\ngently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, sister, very often it is not a man that we love, but love\r\nitself. And your real lover that night was the moonlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SNOWFALL\r\n\r\nThe long promenade of La Croisette winds in a curve along the edge of\r\nthe blue water. Yonder, to the right, Esterel juts out into the sea in\r\nthe distance, obstructing the view and shutting out the horizon with its\r\npretty southern outline of pointed summits, numerous and fantastic.\r\n\r\nTo the left, the isles of Sainte Marguerite and Saint Honorat, almost\r\nlevel with the water, display their surface, covered with pine trees.\r\n\r\nAnd all along the great gulf, all along the tall mountains that encircle\r\nCannes, the white villa residences seem to be sleeping in the sunlight.\r\nYou can see them from a distance, the white houses, scattered from the\r\ntop to the bottom of the mountains, dotting the dark greenery with\r\nspecks like snow.\r\n\r\nThose near the water have gates opening on the wide promenade which is\r\nwashed by the quiet waves. The air is soft and balmy. It is one of those\r\nwarm winter days when there is scarcely a breath of cool air. Above the\r\nwalls of the gardens may be seen orange trees and lemon trees full of\r\ngolden fruit. Ladies are walking slowly across the sand of the avenue,\r\nfollowed by children rolling hoops, or chatting with gentlemen.\r\n\r\nA young woman has just passed out through the door of her coquettish\r\nlittle house facing La Croisette. She stops for a moment to gaze at the\r\npromenaders, smiles, and with an exhausted air makes her way toward an\r\nempty bench facing the sea. Fatigued after having gone twenty paces, she\r\nsits down out of breath. Her pale face seems that of a dead woman. She\r\ncoughs, and raises to her lips her transparent fingers as if to stop\r\nthose paroxysms that exhaust her.\r\n\r\nShe gazes at the sky full of sunshine and swallows, at the zigzag\r\nsummits of the Esterel over yonder, and at the sea, the blue, calm,\r\nbeautiful sea, close beside her.\r\n\r\nShe smiles again, and murmurs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how happy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knows, however, that she is going to die, that she will never see\r\nthe springtime, that in a year, along the same promenade, these same\r\npeople who pass before her now will come again to breathe the warm air\r\nof this charming spot, with their children a little bigger, with their\r\nhearts all filled with hopes, with tenderness, with happiness, while at\r\nthe bottom of an oak coffin, the poor flesh which is still left to her\r\nto-day will have decomposed, leaving only her bones lying in the silk\r\nrobe which she has selected for a shroud.\r\n\r\nShe will be no more. Everything in life will go on as before for others.\r\nFor her, life will be over, over forever. She will be no more. She\r\nsmiles, and inhales as well as she can, with her diseased lungs, the\r\nperfumed air of the gardens.\r\n\r\nAnd she sinks into a reverie.\r\n\r\nShe recalls the past. She had been married, four years ago, to a Norman\r\ngentleman. He was a strong young man, bearded, healthy-looking, with\r\nwide shoulders, narrow mind, and joyous disposition.\r\n\r\nThey had been united through financial motives which she knew nothing\r\nabout. She would willingly have said No. She said Yes, with a movement\r\nof the head, in order not to thwart her father and mother. She was a\r\nParisian, gay, and full of the joy of living.\r\n\r\nHer husband brought her home to his Norman chateau. It was a huge stone\r\nbuilding surrounded by tall trees of great age. A high clump of pine\r\ntrees shut out the view in front. On the right, an opening in the trees\r\npresented a view of the plain, which stretched out in an unbroken level\r\nas far as the distant, farmsteads. A cross-road passed before the gate\r\nand led to the high road three kilometres away.\r\n\r\nOh! she recalls everything, her arrival, her first day in her new abode,\r\nand her isolated life afterward.\r\n\r\nWhen she stepped out of the carriage, she glanced at the old building,\r\nand laughingly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not look cheerful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer husband began to laugh in his turn, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! we get used to it! You'll see. I never feel bored in it, for my\r\npart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat day they passed their time in embracing each other, and she did not\r\nfind it too long. This lasted fully a month. The days passed one after\r\nthe other in insignificant yet absorbing occupations. She learned the\r\nvalue and the importance of the little things of life. She knew that\r\npeople can interest themselves in the price of eggs, which cost a few\r\ncentimes more or less according to the seasons.\r\n\r\nIt was summer. She went to the fields to see the men harvesting. The\r\nbrightness of the sunshine found an echo in her heart.\r\n\r\nThe autumn came. Her husband went out shooting. He started in the\r\nmorning with his two dogs Medor and Mirza. She remained alone, without\r\ngrieving, moreover, at Henry's absence. She was very fond of him, but\r\nshe did not miss him. When he returned home, her affection was\r\nespecially bestowed on the dogs. She took care of them every evening\r\nwith a mother's tenderness, caressed them incessantly, gave them a\r\nthousand charming little names which she had no idea of applying to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nHe invariably told her all about his sport. He described the places\r\nwhere he found partridges, expressed his astonishment at not having\r\ncaught any hares in Joseph Ledentu's clever, or else appeared indignant\r\nat the conduct of M. Lechapelier, of Havre, who always went along the\r\nedge of his property to shoot the game that he, Henry de Parville, had\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nShe replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed! it is not right,\xe2\x80\x9d thinking of something else\r\nall the while.\r\n\r\nThe winter came, the Norman winter, cold and rainy. The endless floods\r\nof rain came down on the slates of the great gabled roof, rising like a\r\nknife blade toward the sky. The roads seemed like rivers of mud, the\r\ncountry a plain of mud, and no sound could be heard save that of water\r\nfalling; no movement could be seen save the whirling flight of crows\r\nthat settled down like a cloud on a field and then hurried off again.\r\n\r\nAbout four o'clock, the army of dark, flying creatures came and perched\r\nin the tall beeches at the left of the chateau, emitting deafening\r\ncries. During nearly an hour, they flew from tree top to tree top,\r\nseemed to be fighting, croaked, and made a black disturbance in the gray\r\nbranches. She gazed at them each evening with a weight at her heart, so\r\ndeeply was she impressed by the lugubrious melancholy of the darkness\r\nfalling on the deserted country.\r\n\r\nThen she rang for the lamp, and drew near the fire. She burned heaps of\r\nwood without succeeding in warming the spacious apartments reeking with\r\nhumidity. She was cold all day long, everywhere, in the drawing-room, at\r\nmeals, in her own apartment. It seemed to her she was cold to the marrow\r\nof her bones. Her husband only came in to dinner; he was always out\r\nshooting, or else he was superintending sowing the seed, tilling the\r\nsoil, and all the work of the country.\r\n\r\nHe would come back jovial, and covered with mud, rubbing his hands as he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat wretched weather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOr else:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fire looks comfortable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOr sometimes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how are you to-day? Are you in good spirits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was happy, in good health, without desires, thinking of nothing save\r\nthis simple, healthy, and quiet life.\r\n\r\nAbout December, when the snow had come, she suffered so much from the\r\nicy-cold air of the chateau which seemed to have become chilled in\r\npassing through the centuries just as human beings become chilled with\r\nyears, that she asked her husband one evening:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Henry! You ought to have a furnace put into the house; it\r\nwould dry the walls. I assure you that I cannot keep warm from morning\r\ntill night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first he was stunned at this extravagant idea of introducing a\r\nfurnace into his manor-house. It would have seemed more natural to him\r\nto have his dogs fed out of silver dishes. He gave a tremendous laugh\r\nfrom the bottom of his chest as he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA furnace here! A furnace here! Ha! ha! ha! what a good joke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe persisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you, dear, I feel frozen; you don't feel it because you are\r\nalways moving about; but all the same, I feel frozen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied, still laughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! you'll get used to it, and besides it is excellent for the\r\nhealth. You will only be all the better for it. We are not Parisians,\r\ndamn it! to live in hot-houses. And, besides, the spring is quite near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of January, a great misfortune befell her. Her\r\nfather and mother died in a carriage accident. She came to Paris for the\r\nfuneral. And her sorrow took entire possession of her mind for about six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe mildness of the beautiful summer days finally roused her, and she\r\nlived along in a state of sad languor until autumn.\r\n\r\nWhen the cold weather returned, she was brought face to face, for the\r\nfirst time, with the gloomy future. What was she to do? Nothing. What\r\nwas going to happen to her henceforth? Nothing. What expectation, what\r\nhope, could revive her heart? None. A doctor who was consulted declared\r\nthat she would never have children.\r\n\r\nSharper, more penetrating still than the year before, the cold made her\r\nsuffer continually.\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her shivering hands to the big flames. The glaring\r\nfire burned her face; but icy whiffs seemed to glide down her back and\r\nto penetrate between her skin and her underclothing. And she shivered\r\nfrom head to foot. Innumerable draughts of air appeared to have taken up\r\ntheir abode in the apartment, living, crafty currents of air as cruel as\r\nenemies. She encountered them at every moment; they blew on her\r\nincessantly their perfidious and frozen hatred, now on her face, now on\r\nher hands, and now on her back.\r\n\r\nOnce more she spoke of a furnace; but her husband listened to her\r\nrequest as if she were asking for the moon. The introduction of such an\r\napparatus at Parville appeared to him as impossible as the discovery of\r\nthe Philosopher's Stone.\r\n\r\nHaving been at Rouen on business one day, he brought back to his wife a\r\ndainty foot warmer made of copper, which he laughingly called a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cportable furnace\xe2\x80\x9d; and he considered that this would prevent her\r\nhenceforth from ever being cold.\r\n\r\nToward the end of December she understood that she could not always live\r\nlike this, and she said timidly one evening at dinner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, dear! Are we not going to spend a week or two in Paris before\r\nspring:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was stupefied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Paris? In Paris? But what are we to do there? Ah! no by Jove! We are\r\nbetter off here. What odd ideas come into your head sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might distract us a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want to distract you? Theatres, evening parties, dinners\r\nin town? You knew, however, when you came here, that you ought not to\r\nexpect any distractions of this kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw a reproach in these words, and in the tone in which they were\r\nuttered. She relapsed into silence. She was timid and gentle, without\r\nresisting power and without strength of will.\r\n\r\nIn January the cold weather returned with violence. Then the snow\r\ncovered the earth.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as she watched the great black cloud of crows dispersing\r\namong the trees, she began to weep, in spite of herself.\r\n\r\nHer husband came in. He asked in great surprise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was happy, quite happy, never having dreamed of another life or other\r\npleasures. He had been born and had grown up in this melancholy\r\ndistrict. He felt contented in his own house, at ease in body and mind.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand that one might desire incidents, have a longing\r\nfor changing pleasures; he did not understand that it does not seem\r\nnatural to certain beings to remain in the same place during the four\r\nseasons; he seemed not to know that spring, summer, autumn, and winter\r\nhave, for multitudes of persons, fresh amusements in new places.\r\n\r\nShe could say nothing in reply, and she quickly dried her eyes. At last\r\nshe murmured in a despairing tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I am a little sad\xe2\x80\x94I am a little bored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she was terrified at having even said so much, and added very\r\nquickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, besides\xe2\x80\x94I am\xe2\x80\x94I am a little cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last plea made him angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, still your idea of the furnace. But look here, deuce take it!\r\nyou have not had one cold since you came here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight came on. She went up to her room, for she had insisted on having a\r\nseparate apartment. She went to bed. Even in bed she felt cold. She\r\nthought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be always like this, always, until I die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she thought of her husband. How could he have said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94have not had one cold since you came here\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nShe would have to be ill, to cough before he could understand what she\r\nsuffered!\r\n\r\nAnd she was filled with indignation, the angry indignation of a weak,\r\ntimid being.\r\n\r\nShe must cough. Then, perhaps, he would take pity on her. Well, she\r\nwould cough; he should hear her coughing; the doctor should be called\r\nin; he should see, her husband, he should see.\r\n\r\nShe got out of bed, her legs and her feet bare, and a childish idea made\r\nher smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a furnace, and I must have it. I shall cough so much that he'll\r\nhave to put one in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she sat down in a chair in her nightdress. She waited an hour, two\r\nhours. She shivered, but she did not catch cold. Then she resolved on a\r\nbold expedient.\r\n\r\nShe noiselessly left her room, descended the stairs, and opened the gate\r\ninto the garden.\r\n\r\nThe earth, covered with snows seemed dead. She abruptly thrust forward\r\nher bare foot, and plunged it into the icy, fleecy snow. A sensation of\r\ncold, painful as a wound, mounted to her heart. However, she stretched\r\nout the other leg, and began to descend the steps slowly.\r\n\r\nThen she advanced through the grass saying to herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll go as far as the pine trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked with quick steps, out of breath, gasping every time she\r\nplunged her foot into the snow.\r\n\r\nShe touched the first pine tree with her hand, as if to assure herself\r\nthat she had carried out her plan to the end; then she went back into\r\nthe house. She thought two or three times that she was going to fall, so\r\nnumbed and weak did she feel. Before going in, however, she sat down in\r\nthat icy fleece, and even took up several handfuls to rub on her chest.\r\n\r\nThen she went in and got into bed. It seemed to her at the end of an\r\nhour that she had a swarm of ants in her throat, and that other ants\r\nwere running all over her limbs. She slept, however.\r\n\r\nNext day she was coughing and could not get up.\r\n\r\nShe had inflammation of the lungs. She became delirious, and in her\r\ndelirium she asked for a furnace. The doctor insisted on having one put\r\nin. Henry yielded, but with visible annoyance.\r\n\r\nShe was incurable. Her lungs were seriously affected, and those about\r\nher feared for her life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she remains here, she will not last until the winter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nShe was sent south. She came to Cannes, made the acquaintance of the\r\nsun, loved the sea, and breathed the perfume of orange blossoms.\r\n\r\nThen, in the spring, she returned north.\r\n\r\nBut she now lived with the fear of being cured, with the fear of the\r\nlong winters of Normandy; and as soon as she was better she opened her\r\nwindow by night and recalled the sweet shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nAnd now she is going to die. She knows it and she is happy.\r\n\r\nShe unfolds a newspaper which she has not already opened, and reads this\r\nheading:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first snow in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shivers and then smiles. She looks across at the Esterel, which is\r\nbecoming rosy in the rays of the setting sun. She looks at the vast blue\r\nsky, so blue, so very blue, and the vast blue sea, so very blue also,\r\nand she rises from her seat.\r\n\r\nAnd then she returned to the house with slow steps, only stopping to\r\ncough, for she had remained out too long and she was cold, a little\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nShe finds a letter from her husband. She opens it, still smiling, and\r\nshe reads:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR LOVE: I hope you are well, and that you do not regret too much\r\nour beautiful country. For some days last we have had a good frost,\r\nwhich presages snow. For my part, I adore this weather, and you may\r\nbelieve that I do not light your damned furnace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe ceases reading, quite happy at the thought that she had her furnace\r\nput in. Her right hand, which holds the letter, falls slowly on her lap,\r\nwhile she raises her left hand to her mouth, as if to calm the obstinate\r\ncough which is racking her chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAYS OF A BOURGEOIS\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE EXCURSION\r\n\r\nM. Patissot, born in Paris, after having failed in his examinations at\r\nthe College Henri IV., like many others, had entered the government\r\nservice through the influence of one of his aunts, who kept a tobacco\r\nstore where the head of one of the departments bought his provisions.\r\n\r\nHe advanced very slowly, and would, perhaps, have died a fourth-class\r\nclerk without the aid of a kindly Providence, which sometimes watches\r\nover our destiny. He is today fifty-two years old, and it is only at\r\nthis age that he is beginning to explore, as a tourist, all that part of\r\nFrance which lies between the fortifications and the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe story of his advance might be useful to many employees, just as the\r\ntale of his excursions may be of value to many Parisians who will take\r\nthem as a model for their own outings, and will thus, through his\r\nexample, avoid certain mishaps which occurred to him.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 he only enjoyed a salary of 1,800 francs. Through a peculiar\r\ntrait of his character he was unpopular with all his superiors, who let\r\nhim languish in the eternal and hopeless expectation of the clerk's\r\nideal, an increase of salary. Nevertheless he worked; but he did not\r\nknow how to make himself appreciated. He had too much self-respect, he\r\nclaimed. His self-respect consisted in never bowing to his superiors in\r\na low and servile manner, as did, according to him, certain of his\r\ncolleagues, whom he would not mention. He added that his frankness\r\nembarrassed many people, for, like all the rest, he protested against\r\ninjustice and the favoritism shown to persons entirely foreign to the\r\nbureaucracy. But his indignant voice never passed beyond the little cage\r\nwhere he worked.\r\n\r\nFirst as a government clerk, then as a Frenchman and finally as a man\r\nwho believed in order he would adhere to whatever government was\r\nestablished, having an unbounded reverence for authority, except for\r\nthat of his chiefs.\r\n\r\nEach time that he got the chance he would place himself where he could\r\nsee the emperor pass, in order to have the honor of taking his hat off\r\nto him; and he would go away puffed up with pride at having bowed to the\r\nhead of the state.\r\n\r\nFrom his habit of observing the sovereign he did as many others do; he\r\nimitated the way he trimmed his beard or arranged his hair, the cut of\r\nhis clothes, his walk, his mannerisms. Indeed, how many men in each\r\ncountry seemed to be the living images of the head of the government!\r\nPerhaps he vaguely resembled Napoleon III., but his hair was black;\r\ntherefore he dyed it, and then the likeness was complete; and when he\r\nmet another gentleman in the street also imitating the imperial\r\ncountenance he was jealous and looked at him disdainfully. This need of\r\nimitation soon became his hobby, and, having heard an usher at the\r\nTuilleries imitate the voice of the emperor, he also acquired the same\r\nintonations and studied slowness.\r\n\r\nHe thus became so much like his model that they might easily have been\r\nmistaken for each other, and certain high dignitaries were heard to\r\nremark that they found it unseemly and even vulgar; the matter was\r\nmentioned to the prime minister, who ordered that the employee should\r\nappear before him. But at the sight of him he began to laugh and\r\nrepeated two or three times: \xe2\x80\x9cThat's funny, really funny!\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\nrepeated, and the following day Patissot's immediate superior\r\nrecommended that his subordinate receive an increase of salary of three\r\nhundred francs. He received it immediately.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on his promotions came regularly, thanks to his ape-like\r\nfaculty of imitation. The presentiment that some high honor might come\r\nto him some day caused his chiefs to speak to him with deference.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republic was proclaimed it was a disaster for him. He felt\r\nlost, done for, and, losing his head, he stopped dyeing his hair, shaved\r\nhis face clean and had his hair cut short, thus acquiring a paternal and\r\nbenevolent expression which could not compromise him in any way.\r\n\r\nThen his chiefs took revenge for the long time during which he had\r\nimposed upon them, and, having all turned Republican through an instinct\r\nof self preservation, they cut down his salary and delayed his\r\npromotion. He, too, changed his opinions. But the Republic not being a\r\npalpable and living person whom one can resemble, and the presidents\r\nsucceeding each other with rapidity, he found himself plunged in the\r\ngreatest embarrassment, in terrible distress, and, after an unsuccessful\r\nimitation of his last ideal, M. Thiers, he felt a check put on all his\r\nattempts at imitation. He needed a new manifestation of his personality.\r\nHe searched for a long time; then, one morning, he arrived at the office\r\nwearing a new hat which had on the side a small red, white and blue\r\nrosette. His colleagues were astounded; they laughed all that day, the\r\nnext day, all the week, all the month. But the seriousness of his\r\ndemeanor at last disconcerted them, and once more his superiors became\r\nanxious. What mystery could be hidden under this sign? Was it a simple\r\nmanifestation of patriotism, or an affirmation of his allegiance to the\r\nRepublic, or perhaps the badge of some powerful association? But to wear\r\nit so persistently he must surely have some powerful and hidden\r\nprotection. It would be well to be on one's guard, especially as he\r\nreceived all pleasantries with unruffled calmness. After that he was\r\ntreated with respect, and his sham courage saved him; he was appointed\r\nhead clerk on the first of January, 1880. His whole life had been spent\r\nindoors. He hated noise and bustle, and because of this love of rest and\r\nquiet he had remained a bachelor. He spent his Sundays reading tales of\r\nadventure and ruling guide lines which he afterward offered to his\r\ncolleagues. In his whole existence he had only taken three vacations of\r\na week each, when he was changing his quarters. But sometimes, on a\r\nholiday, he would leave by an excursion train for Dieppe or Havre in\r\norder to elevate his mind by the inspiring sight of the sea.\r\n\r\nHe was full of that common sense which borders on stupidity. For a long\r\ntime he had been living quietly, with economy, temperate through\r\nprudence, chaste by temperament, when suddenly he was assailed by a\r\nterrible apprehension. One evening in the street he suddenly felt an\r\nattack of dizziness which made him fear a stroke of apoplexy. He\r\nhastened to a physician and for five francs obtained the following\r\nprescription:\r\n\r\nM. X-, fifty-five years old, bachelor, clerk. Full-blooded, danger of\r\napoplexy. Cold-water applications, moderate nourishment, plenty of\r\nexercise.    MONTELLIER, M.D.\r\n\r\nPatissot was greatly distressed, and for a whole month, in his office,\r\nhe kept a wet towel wrapped around his head like a turban while the\r\nwater continually dripped on his work, which he would have to do over\r\nagain. Every once in a while he would read the prescription over,\r\nprobably in the hope of finding some hidden meaning, of penetrating into\r\nthe secret thought of the physician, and also of discovering some forms\r\nof exercise which, might perhaps make him immune from apoplexy.\r\n\r\nThen he consulted his friends, showing them the fateful paper. One\r\nadvised boxing. He immediately hunted up an instructor, and, on the\r\nfirst day, he received a punch in the nose which immediately took away\r\nall his ambition in this direction. Single-stick made him gasp for\r\nbreath, and he grew so stiff from fencing that for two days and two\r\nnights he could not get sleep. Then a bright idea struck him. It was to\r\nwalk, every Sunday, to some suburb of Paris and even to certain places\r\nin the capital which he did not know.\r\n\r\nFor a whole week his mind was occupied with thoughts of the equipment\r\nwhich you need for these excursions; and on Sunday, the 30th of May, he\r\nbegan his preparations. After reading all the extraordinary\r\nadvertisements which poor, blind and halt beggars distribute on the\r\nstreet corners, he began to visit the stores with the intention of\r\nlooking about him only and of buying later on. First of all, he visited\r\na so-called American shoe store, where heavy travelling shoes were shown\r\nhim. The clerk brought out a kind of ironclad contrivance, studded with\r\nspikes like a harrow, which he claimed to be made from Rocky Mountain\r\nbison skin. He was so carried away with them that he would willingly\r\nhave bought two pair, but one was sufficient. He carried them away under\r\nhis arm, which soon became numb from the weight. He next invested in a\r\npair of corduroy trousers, such as carpenters wear, and a pair of oiled\r\ncanvas leggings. Then he needed a knapsack for his provisions, a\r\ntelescope so as to recognize villages perched on the slope of distant\r\nhills, and finally, a government survey map to enable him to find his\r\nway about without asking the peasants toiling in the fields. Lastly, in\r\norder more comfortably to stand the heat, he decided to purchase a light\r\nalpaca jacket offered by the famous firm of Raminau, according to their\r\nadvertisement, for the modest sum of six francs and fifty centimes. He\r\nwent to this store and was welcomed by a distinguished-looking young man\r\nwith a marvellous head of hair, nails as pink as those of a lady and a\r\npleasant smile. He showed him the garment. It did not correspond with\r\nthe glowing style of the advertisement. Then Patissot hesitatingly\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, will it wear well?\xe2\x80\x9d The young man turned his\r\neyes away in well-feigned embarrassment, like an honest man who does not\r\nwish to deceive a customer, and, lowering his eyes, he said in a\r\nhesitating manner: \xe2\x80\x9cDear me, monsieur, you understand that for six\r\nfrancs fifty we cannot turn out an article like this for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe showed him a much finer jacket than the first one. Patissot examined\r\nit and asked the price. \xe2\x80\x9cTwelve francs fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d It was very tempting, but\r\nbefore deciding, he once more questioned the big young man, who was\r\nobserving him attentively. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94is that good? Do you guarantee it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\r\ncertainly, monsieur, it is quite good! But, of course, you must not get\r\nit wet! Yes, it's really quite good, but you understand that there are\r\ngoods and goods. It's excellent for the price. Twelve francs fifty, just\r\nthink. Why, that's nothing at all. Naturally a twenty-five-franc coat is\r\nmuch better. For twenty-five francs you get a superior quality, as\r\nstrong as linen, and which wears even better. If it gets wet a little\r\nironing will fix it right up. The color never fades, and it does not\r\nturn red in the sunlight. It is the warmest and lightest material out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe unfolded his wares, holding them up, shaking them, crumpling and\r\nstretching them in order to show the excellent quality of the cloth. He\r\ntalked on convincingly, dispelling all hesitation by words and gesture.\r\nPatissot was convinced; he bought the coat. The pleasant salesman, still\r\ntalking, tied up the bundle and continued praising the value of the\r\npurchase. When it was paid for he was suddenly silent. He bowed with a\r\nsuperior air, and, holding the door open, he watched his customer\r\ndisappear, both arms filled with bundles and vainly trying to reach his\r\nhat to bow.\r\n\r\nM. Patissot returned home and carefully studied the map. He wished to\r\ntry on his shoes, which were more like skates than shoes, owing to the\r\nspikes. He slipped and fell, promising himself to be more careful in the\r\nfuture. Then he spread out all his purchases on a chair and looked at\r\nthem for a long time. He went to sleep with this thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn't it\r\nstrange that I didn't think before of taking an excursion to the\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the whole week Patissot worked without ambition. He was dreaming\r\nof the outing which he had planned for the following Sunday, and he was\r\nseized by a sudden longing for the country, a desire of growing tender\r\nover nature, this thirst for rustic scenes which overwhelms the\r\nParisians in spring time.\r\n\r\nOnly one person gave him any attention; it was a silent old copying\r\nclerk named Boivin, nicknamed Boileau. He himself lived in the country\r\nand had a little garden which he cultivated carefully; his needs were\r\nsmall, and he was perfectly happy, so they said. Patissot was now able\r\nto understand his tastes and the similarity of their ideals made them\r\nimmediately fast friends. Old man Boivin said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I like fishing, monsieur? Why, it's the delight of my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Patissot questioned him with deep interest. Boivin named all the\r\nfish who frolicked under this dirty water\xe2\x80\x94and Patissot thought he could\r\nsee them. Boivin told about the different hooks, baits, spots and times\r\nsuitable for each kind. And Patissot felt himself more like a fisherman\r\nthan Boivin himself. They decided that the following Sunday they would\r\nmeet for the opening of the season for the edification of Patissot, who\r\nwas delighted to have found such an experienced instructor.\r\n\r\nFISHING EXCURSION\r\n\r\nThe day before the one when he was, for the first time in his life, to\r\nthrow a hook into a river, Monsieur Patissot bought, for eighty\r\ncentimes, \xe2\x80\x9cHow to Become a Perfect Fisherman.\xe2\x80\x9d In this work he learned\r\nmany useful things, but he was especially impressed by the style, and he\r\nretained the following passage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a word, if you wish, without books, without rules, to fish\r\nsuccessfully, to the left or to the right, up or down stream, in the\r\nmasterly manner that halts at no difficulty, then fish before, during\r\nand after a storm, when the clouds break and the sky is streaked with\r\nlightning, when the earth shakes with the grumbling thunder; it is then\r\nthat, either through hunger or terror, all the fish forget their habits\r\nin a turbulent flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this confusion follow or neglect all favorable signs, and just go on\r\nfishing; you will march to victory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn order to catch fish of all sizes, he bought three well-perfected\r\npoles, made to be used as a cane in the city, which, on the river, could\r\nbe transformed into a fishing rod by a simple jerk. He bought some\r\nnumber fifteen hooks for gudgeon, number twelve for bream, and with his\r\nnumber seven he expected to fill his basket with carp. He bought no\r\nearth worms because he was sure of finding them everywhere; but he laid\r\nin a provision of sand worms. He had a jar full of them, and in the\r\nevening he watched them with interest. The hideous creatures swarmed in\r\ntheir bath of bran as they do in putrid meat. Patissot wished to\r\npractice baiting his hook. He took up one with disgust, but he had\r\nhardly placed the curved steel point against it when it split open.\r\nTwenty times he repeated this without success, and he might have\r\ncontinued all night had he not feared to exhaust his supply of vermin.\r\n\r\nHe left by the first train. The station was full of people equipped with\r\nfishing lines. Some, like Patissot's, looked like simple bamboo canes;\r\nothers, in one piece, pointed their slender ends to the skies. They\r\nlooked like a forest of slender sticks, which mingled and clashed like\r\nswords or swayed like masts over an ocean of broad-brimmed straw hats.\r\n\r\nWhen the train started fishing rods could be seen sticking out of all\r\nthe windows and doors, giving to the train the appearance of a huge,\r\nbristly caterpillar winding through the fields.\r\n\r\nEverybody got off at Courbevoie and rushed for the stage for Bezons. A\r\ncrowd of fishermen crowded on top of the coach, holding their rods in\r\ntheir hands, giving the vehicle the appearance of a porcupine.\r\n\r\nAll along the road men were travelling in the same direction as though\r\non a pilgrimage to an unknown Jerusalem. They were carrying those long,\r\nslender sticks resembling those carried by the faithful returning from\r\nPalestine. A tin box on a strap was fastened to their backs. They were\r\nin a hurry.\r\n\r\nAt Bezons the river appeared. People were lined along bath banks, men in\r\nfrock coats, others in duck suits, others in blouses, women, children\r\nand even young girls of marriageable age; all were fishing.\r\n\r\nPatissot started for the dam where his friend Boivin was waiting for\r\nhim. The latter greeted him rather coolly. He had just made the\r\nacquaintance of a big, fat man of about fifty, who seemed very strong\r\nand whose skin was tanned. All three hired a big boat and lay off almost\r\nunder the fall of the dam, where the fish are most plentiful.\r\n\r\nBoivin was immediately ready. He baited his line and threw it out, and\r\nthen sat motionless, watching the little float with extraordinary\r\nconcentration. From time to time he would jerk his line out of the water\r\nand cast it farther out. The fat gentleman threw out his well-baited\r\nhooks, put his line down beside him, filled his pipe, lit it, crossed\r\nhis arms, and, without another glance at the cork, he watched the water\r\nflow by. Patissot once more began trying to stick sand worms on his\r\nhooks. After about five minutes of this occupation he called to Boivin;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Boivin, would you be so kind as to help me put these creatures\r\non my hook? Try as I will, I can't seem to succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d Boivin raised his\r\nhead: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don't disturb me, Monsieur Patissot; we are not here for\r\npleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d However, he baited the line, which Patissot then threw out,\r\ncarefully imitating all the motions of his friend.\r\n\r\nThe boat was tossing wildly, shaken by the waves, and spun round like a\r\ntop by the current, although anchored at both ends. Patissot, absorbed\r\nin the sport, felt a vague kind of uneasiness; he was uncomfortably\r\nheavy and somewhat dizzy.\r\n\r\nThey caught nothing. Little Boivin, very nervous, was gesticulating and\r\nshaking his head in despair. Patissot was as sad as though some disaster\r\nhad overtaken him. The fat gentleman alone, still motionless, was\r\nquietly smoking without paying any attention to his line. At last\r\nPatissot, disgusted, turned toward him and said in a mournful voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not biting, are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe quietly replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatissot surprised, looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you ever catch many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Never?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fat man, still smoking like a factory chimney, let out the following\r\nwords, which completely upset his neighbor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would bother me a lot if they did bite. I don't come here to fish; I\r\ncome because I'm very comfortable here; I get shaken up as though I were\r\nat sea. If I take a line along, it's only to do as others do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Patissot, on the other hand, did not feel at all well. His\r\ndiscomfort, at first vague, kept increasing, and finally took on a\r\ndefinite form. He felt, indeed, as though he were being tossed by the\r\nsea, and he was suffering from seasickness. After the first attack had\r\ncalmed down, he proposed leaving, but Boivin grew so furious that they\r\nalmost came to blows. The fat man, moved by pity, rowed the boat back,\r\nand, as soon as Patissot had recovered from his seasickness, they\r\nbethought themselves of luncheon.\r\n\r\nTwo restaurants presented themselves. One of them, very small, looked\r\nlike a beer garden, and was patronized by the poorer fishermen. The\r\nother one, which bore the imposing name of \xe2\x80\x9cLinden Cottage,\xe2\x80\x9d looked like\r\na middle-class residence and was frequented by the aristocracy of the\r\nrod. The two owners, born enemies, watched each other with hatred across\r\na large field, which separated them, and where the white house of the\r\ndam keeper and of the inspector of the life-saving department stood out\r\nagainst the green grass. Moreover, these two officials disagreed, one of\r\nthem upholding the beer garden and the other one defending the Elms, and\r\nthe internal feuds which arose in these three houses reproduced the\r\nwhole history of mankind.\r\n\r\nBoivin, who knew the beer garden, wished to go there, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nfood is very good, and it isn't expensive; you'll see. Anyhow, Monsieur\r\nPatissot, you needn't expect to get me tipsy the way you did last\r\nSunday. My wife was furious, you know; and she has sworn never to\r\nforgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fat gentleman declared that he would only eat at the Elms, because\r\nit was an excellent place and the cooking was as good as in the best\r\nrestaurants in Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as you wish,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Boivin; \xe2\x80\x9cI am going where I am accustomed to\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d He left. Patissot, displeased at his friend's actions, followed the\r\nfat gentleman.\r\n\r\nThey ate together, exchanged ideas, discussed opinions and found that\r\nthey were made for each other.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal everyone started to fish again, but the two new friends\r\nleft together. Following along the banks, they stopped near the railroad\r\nbridge and, still talking, they threw their lines in the water. The fish\r\nstill refused to bite, but Patissot was now making the best of it.\r\n\r\nA family was approaching. The father, whose whiskers stamped him as a\r\njudge, was holding an extraordinarily long rod; three boys of different\r\nsizes were carrying poles of different lengths, according to age; and\r\nthe mother, who was very stout, gracefully manoeuvred a charming rod\r\nwith a ribbon tied to the handle. The father bowed and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this spot good, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d Patissot was going to speak, when his\r\nfriend answered: \xe2\x80\x9cFine!\xe2\x80\x9d The whole family smiled and settled down beside\r\nthe fishermen. The Patissot was seized with a wild desire to catch a\r\nfish, just one, any kind, any size, in order to win the consideration of\r\nthese people; so he began to handle his rod as he had seen Boivin do in\r\nthe morning. He would let the cork follow the current to the end of the\r\nline, jerk the hooks out of the water, make them describe a large circle\r\nin the air and throw them out again a little higher up. He had even, as\r\nhe thought, caught the knack of doing this movement gracefully. He had\r\njust jerked his line out rapidly when he felt it caught in something\r\nbehind him. He tugged, and a scream burst from behind him. He perceived,\r\ncaught on one of his hooks, and describing in the air a curve like a\r\nmeteor, a magnificent hat which he placed right in the middle of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nHe turned around, bewildered, dropping his pole, which followed the hat\r\ndown the stream, while the fat gentleman, his new friend, lay on his\r\nback and roared with laughter. The lady, hatless and astounded, choked\r\nwith anger; her husband was outraged and demanded the price of the hat,\r\nand Patissot paid about three times its value.\r\n\r\nThen the family departed in a very dignified manner.\r\n\r\nPatissot took another rod, and, until nightfall, he gave baths to sand\r\nworms. His neighbor was sleeping peacefully on the grass. Toward seven\r\nin the evening he awoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's go away from here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThen Patissot withdrew his line, gave a cry and sat down hard from\r\nastonishment. At the end of the string was a tiny little fish. When they\r\nlooked at him more closely they found that he had been hooked through\r\nthe stomach; the hook had caught him as it was being drawn out of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nPatissot was filled with a boundless, triumphant joy; he wished to have\r\nthe fish fried for himself alone.\r\n\r\nDuring the dinner the friends grew still more intimate. He learned that\r\nthe fat gentleman lived at Argenteuil and had been sailing boats for\r\nthirty years without losing interest in the sport. He accepted to take\r\nluncheon with him the following Sunday and to take a sail in his\r\nfriend's clipper, Plongeon. He became so interested in the conversation\r\nthat he forgot all about his catch. He did not remember it until after\r\nthe coffee, and he demanded that it be brought him. It was alone in the\r\nmiddle of a platter, and looked like a yellow, twisted match, But he ate\r\nit with pride and relish, and at night, on the omnibus, he told his\r\nneighbors that he had caught fourteen pounds of fish during the day.\r\n\r\nTWO CELEBRITIES\r\n\r\nMonsieur Patissot had promised his friend, the boating man, that he\r\nwould spend the following Sunday with him. An unforeseen occurrence\r\nchanged his plan. One evening, on the boulevard, he met one of his\r\ncousins whom he saw but very seldom. He was a pleasant journalist, well\r\nreceived in all classes of society, who offered to show Patissot many\r\ninteresting things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do next Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going boating at Argenteuil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on! Boating is an awful bore; there is no variety to it. Listen\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I'll take you along with me. I'll introduce you to two celebrities. We\r\nwill visit the homes of two artists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have been ordered to go to the country!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's just where we'll go. On the way we'll call on Meissonier, at his\r\nplace in Poissy; then we'll walk over to Medan, where Zola lives. I have\r\nbeen commissioned to obtain his next novel for our newspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatissot, wild with joy, accepted the invitation. He even bought a new\r\nfrock coat, as his own was too much worn to make a good appearance. He\r\nwas terribly afraid of saying something foolish either to the artist or\r\nto the man of letters, as do people who speak of an art which they have\r\nnever professed.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned his fears to his cousin, who laughed and answered: \xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\r\nJust pay them compliments, nothing but compliments, always compliments;\r\nin that way, if you say anything foolish it will be overlooked. Do you\r\nknow Meissonier's paintings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read the Rougon-Macquart series?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom first to last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's enough. Mention a painting from time to time, speak of a novel\r\nhere and there and add:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Superb! Extraordinary! Delightful technique! Wonderfully powerful!' In\r\nthat way you can always get along. I know that those two are very blase\r\nabout everything, but admiration always pleases an artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSunday morning they left for Poissy.\r\n\r\nJust a few steps from the station, at the end of the church square, they\r\nfound Meissonier's property. After passing through a low door, painted\r\nred, which led into a beautiful alley of vines, the journalist stopped\r\nand, turning toward his companion, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your idea of Meissonier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatissot hesitated. At last he decided: \xe2\x80\x9cA little man, well groomed,\r\nclean shaven, a soldierly appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d The other smiled: \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\r\ncome along.\xe2\x80\x9d A quaint building in the form of a chalet appeared to the\r\nleft; and to the right side, almost opposite, was the main house. It was\r\na strange-looking building, where there was a mixture of everything, a\r\nmingling of Gothic fortress, manor, villa, hut, residence, cathedral,\r\nmosque, pyramid, a, weird combination of Eastern and Western\r\narchitecture. The style was complicated enough to set a classical\r\narchitect crazy, and yet there was something whimsical and pretty about\r\nit. It had been invented and built under the direction of the artist.\r\n\r\nThey went in; a collection of trunks encumbered a little parlor. A\r\nlittle man appeared, dressed in a jumper. The striking thing about him\r\nwas his beard. He bowed to the journalist, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, I\r\nhope that you will excuse me; I only returned yesterday, and everything\r\nis all upset here. Please be seated.\xe2\x80\x9d The other refused, excusing\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear master, I only dropped in to pay my respects while\r\npassing by.\xe2\x80\x9d Patissot, very much embarrassed, was bowing at every word\r\nof his friend's, as though moving automatically, and he murmured,\r\nstammering: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a su\xe2\x80\x94su\xe2\x80\x94superb property!\xe2\x80\x9d The artist, flattered,\r\nsmiled, and suggested visiting it.\r\n\r\nHe led them first to a little pavilion of feudal aspect, where his\r\nformer studio was. Then they crossed a parlor, a dining-room, a\r\nvestibule full of beautiful works of art, of beautiful Beauvais, Gobelin\r\nand Flanders tapestries. But the strange external luxury of\r\nornamentation became, inside, a revel of immense stairways. A\r\nmagnificent grand stairway, a secret stairway in one tower, a servants'\r\nstairway in another, stairways everywhere! Patissot, by chance, opened a\r\ndoor and stepped back astonished. It was a veritable temple, this place\r\nof which respectable people only mention the name in English, an\r\noriginal and charming sanctuary in exquisite taste, fitted up like a\r\npagoda, and the decoration of which must certainly have caused a great\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThey next visited the park, which was complex, varied, with winding\r\npaths and full of old trees. But the journalist insisted on leaving;\r\nand, with many thanks, he took leave of the master: As they left they\r\nmet a gardener; Patissot asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cHas Monsieur Meissonier owned this\r\nplace for a long time?\xe2\x80\x9d The man answered: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, monsieur! that needs\r\nexplaining. I guess he bought the grounds in 1846. But, as for the\r\nhouse! he has already torn down and rebuilt that five or six times. It\r\nmust have cost him at least two millions!\xe2\x80\x9d As Patissot left he was\r\nseized with an immense respect for this man, not on account of his\r\nsuccess, glory or talent, but for putting so much money into a whim,\r\nbecause the bourgeois deprive themselves of all pleasure in order to\r\nhoard money.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing Poissy, they struck out on foot along the road to Medan.\r\nThe road first followed the Seine, which is dotted with charming islands\r\nat this place. Then they went up a hill and crossed the pretty village\r\nof Villaines, went down a little; and finally reached the neighborhood\r\ninhabited by the author of the Rougon-Macquart series.\r\n\r\nA pretty old church with two towers appeared on the left. They walked\r\nalong a short distance, and a passing farmer directed them to the\r\nwriter's dwelling.\r\n\r\nBefore entering, they examined the house. A large building, square and\r\nnew, very high, seemed, as in the fable of the mountain and the mouse,\r\nto have given birth to a tiny little white house, which nestled near it.\r\nThis little house was the original dwelling, and had been built by the\r\nformer owner. The tower had been erected by Zola.\r\n\r\nThey rang the bell. An enormous dog, a cross between a Saint Bernard and\r\na Newfoundland, began to howl so terribly that Patissot felt a vague\r\ndesire to retrace his steps. But a servant ran forward, calmed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBertrand,\xe2\x80\x9d opened the door, and took the journalist's card in order to\r\ncarry it to his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope that he will receive us!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Patissot. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be too\r\nbad if we had come all this distance not to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion smiled and answered: \xe2\x80\x9cNever fear, I have a plan for\r\ngetting in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the servant, who had returned, simply asked them to follow him.\r\n\r\nThey entered the new building, and Patissot, who was quite enthusiastic,\r\nwas panting as he climbed a stairway of ancient style which led to the\r\nsecond story.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he was trying to picture to himself this man whose\r\nglorious name echoes at present in all corners of the earth, amid the\r\nexasperated hatred of some, the real or feigned indignation of society,\r\nthe envious scorn of several of his colleagues, the respect of a mass of\r\nreaders, and the frenzied admiration of a great number. He expected to\r\nsee a kind of bearded giant, of awe-inspiring aspect, with a thundering\r\nvoice and an appearance little prepossessing at first.\r\n\r\nThe door opened on a room of uncommonly large dimensions, broad and\r\nhigh, lighted by an enormous window looking out over the valley. Old\r\ntapestries covered the walls; on the left, a monumental fireplace,\r\nflanked by two stone men, could have burned a century-old oak in one\r\nday. An immense table littered with books, papers and magazines stood in\r\nthe middle of this apartment so vast and grand that it first engrossed\r\nthe eye, and the attention was only afterward drawn to the man,\r\nstretched out when they entered on an Oriental divan where twenty\r\npersons could have slept. He took a few steps toward them, bowed,\r\nmotioned to two seats, and turned back to his divan, where he sat with\r\none leg drawn under him. A book lay open beside him, and in his right\r\nhand he held an ivory paper-cutter, the end of which he observed from\r\ntime to time with one eye, closing the other with the persistency of a\r\nnear-sighted person.\r\n\r\nWhile the journalist explained the purpose of the visit, and the writer\r\nlistened to him without yet answering, at times staring at him fixedly,\r\nPatissot, more and more embarrassed, was observing this celebrity.\r\n\r\nHardly forty, he was of medium height, fairly stout, and with a good-\r\nnatured look. His head (very similar to those found in many Italian\r\npaintings of the sixteenth century), without being beautiful in the\r\nplastic sense of the word, gave an impression of great strength of\r\ncharacter, power and intelligence. Short hair stood up straight on the\r\nhigh, well-developed forehead. A straight nose stopped short, as if cut\r\noff suddenly above the upper lip which was covered with a black\r\nmustache; over the whole chin was a closely-cropped beard. The dark,\r\noften ironical look was piercing, one felt that behind it there was a\r\nmind always actively at work observing people, interpreting words,\r\nanalyzing gestures, uncovering the heart. This strong, round head was\r\nappropriate to his name, quick and short, with the bounding resonance of\r\nthe two vowels.\r\n\r\nWhen the journalist had fully explained his proposition, the writer\r\nanswered him that he did not wish to make any definite arrangement, that\r\nhe would, however, think the matter over, that his plans were not yet\r\nsufficiently defined. Then he stopped. It was a dismissal, and the two\r\nmen, a little confused, arose. A desire seized Patissot; he wished this\r\nwell-known person to say something to him, anything, some word which he\r\ncould repeat to his colleagues; and, growing bold, he stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nmonsieur! If you knew how I appreciate your works!\xe2\x80\x9d The other bowed, but\r\nanswered nothing. Patissot became very bold and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\ngreat honor for me to speak to you to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d The writer once more bowed,\r\nbut with a stiff and impatient look. Patissot noticed it, and,\r\ncompletely losing his head, he added as he retreated: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a su\xe2\x80\x94su\r\n\xe2\x80\x94superb property!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, in the heart of the man of letters, the landowner awoke, and,\r\nsmiling, he opened the window to show them the immense stretch of view.\r\nAn endless horizon broadened out on all sides, giving a view of Triel,\r\nPisse-Fontaine, Chanteloup, all the heights of Hautrie, and the Seine as\r\nfar as the eye could see. The two visitors, delighted, congratulated\r\nhim, and the house was opened to them. They saw everything, down to the\r\ndainty kitchen, whose walls and even ceilings were covered with\r\nporcelain tiles ornamented with blue designs, which excited the wonder\r\nof the farmers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you happen to buy this place?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the journalist.\r\n\r\nThe novelist explained that, while looking for a cottage to hire for the\r\nsummer, he had found the little house, which was for sale for several\r\nthousand francs, a song, almost nothing. He immediately bought it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut everything that you have added must have cost you a good deal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe writer smiled, and answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men left. The journalist, taking Patissot by the arm, was\r\nphilosophizing in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery general has his Waterloo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cevery Balzac has his\r\nJardies, and every artist living in the country feels like a landed\r\nproprietor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey took the train at the station of Villaines, and, on the way home,\r\nPatissot loudly mentioned the names of the famous painter and of the\r\ngreat novelist as though they were his friends. He even allowed people\r\nto think that he had taken luncheon with one and dinner with the other.\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE CELEBRATION\r\n\r\nThe celebration is approaching and preliminary quivers are already\r\nrunning through the streets, just as the ripples disturb the water\r\npreparatory to a storm. The shops, draped with flags, display a variety\r\nof gay-colored bunting materials, and the dry-goods people deceive one\r\nabout the three colors as grocers do about the weight of candles. Little\r\nby little, hearts warm up to the matter; people speak about it in the\r\nstreet after dinner; ideas are exchanged:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a celebration it will be, my friend; what a celebration!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard the news? All the rulers are coming incognito, as\r\nbourgeois, in order to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear that the Emperor of Russia has arrived; he expects to go about\r\neverywhere with the Prince of Wales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly will be a fine celebration!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is going to a celebration; what Monsieur Patissot, Parisian\r\nbourgeois, calls a celebration; one of these nameless tumults which, for\r\nfifteen hours, roll from one end of the city to the other, every ugly\r\nspecimen togged out in its finest, a mob of perspiring bodies, where\r\nside by side are tossed about the stout gossip bedecked in red, white\r\nand blue ribbons, grown fat behind her counter and panting from lack of\r\nbreath, the rickety clerk with his wife and brat in tow, the laborer\r\ncarrying his youngster astride his neck, the bewildered provincial with\r\nhis foolish, dazed expression, the groom, barely shaved and still\r\nspreading the perfume of the stable. And the foreigners dressed like\r\nmonkeys, English women like giraffes, the water-carrier, cleaned up for\r\nthe occasion, and the innumerable phalanx of little bourgeois,\r\ninoffensive little people, amused at everything. All this crowding and\r\npressing, the sweat and dust, and the turmoil, all these eddies of human\r\nflesh, trampling of corns beneath the feet of your neighbors, this city\r\nall topsy-turvy, these vile odors, these frantic efforts toward nothing,\r\nthe breath of millions of people, all redolent of garlic, give to\r\nMonsieur Patissot all the joy which it is possible for his heart to\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the proclamation of the mayor on the walls of his district\r\nhe had made his preparations.\r\n\r\nThis bit of prose said:\r\n\r\nI wish to call your attention particularly to the part of individuals in\r\nthis celebration. Decorate your homes, illuminate your windows. Get\r\ntogether, open up a subscription in order to give to your houses and to\r\nyour street a more brilliant and more artistic appearance than the\r\nneighboring houses and streets.\r\n\r\nThen Monsieur Patissot tried to imagine how he could give to his home an\r\nartistic appearance.\r\n\r\nOne serious obstacle stood in the way. His only window looked out on a\r\ncourtyard, a narrow, dark shaft, where only the rats could have seen his\r\nthree Japanese lanterns.\r\n\r\nHe needed a public opening. He found it. On the first floor of his house\r\nlived a rich man, a nobleman and a royalist, whose coachman, also a\r\nreactionary, occupied a garret-room on the sixth floor, facing the\r\nstreet. Monsieur Patissot supposed that by paying (every conscience can\r\nbe bought) he could obtain the use of the room for the day. He proposed\r\nfive francs to this citizen of the whip for the use of his room from\r\nnoon till midnight. The offer was immediately accepted.\r\n\r\nThen he began to busy himself with the decorations. Three flags, four\r\nlanterns, was that enough to give to this box an artistic appearance\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nexpress all the noble feelings of his soul? No; assuredly not! But,\r\nnotwithstanding diligent search and nightly meditation, Monsieur\r\nPatissot could think of nothing else. He consulted his neighbors, who\r\nwere surprised at the question; he questioned his colleagues\xe2\x80\x94every one\r\nhad bought lanterns and flags, some adding, for the occasion, red, white\r\nand blue bunting.\r\n\r\nThen he began to rack his brains for some original idea. He frequented\r\nthe cafes, questioning the patrons; they lacked imagination. Then one\r\nmorning he went out on top of an omnibus. A respectable-looking\r\ngentleman was smoking a cigar beside him, a little farther away a\r\nlaborer was smoking his pipe upside down, near the driver two rough\r\nfellows were joking, and clerks of every description were going to\r\nbusiness for three cents.\r\n\r\nBefore the stores stacks of flags were resplendent under the rising sun.\r\nPatissot turned to his neighbor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is going to be a fine celebration,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The gentleman looked at\r\nhim sideways and answered in a haughty manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes no difference to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going to take part in it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the surprised clerk. The\r\nother shook his head disdainfully and declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey make me tired with their celebrations! Whose celebration is it?\r\nThe government's? I do not recognize this government, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Patissot, as government employee, took on his superior manner, and\r\nanswered in a stern voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, the Republic is the government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis neighbor was not in the least disturbed, and, pushing his hands down\r\nin his pockets, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what then? It makes no difference to me. Whether it's for the\r\nRepublic or something else, I don't care! What I want, monsieur, is to\r\nknow my government. I saw Charles X. and adhered to him, monsieur; I saw\r\nLouis-Philippe and adhered to him, monsieur; I saw Napoleon and adhered\r\nto him; but I have never seen the Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatissot, still serious, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Republic, monsieur, is represented by its president!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other grumbled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, them, show him to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatissot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one can see him; he's not shut up in a closet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the fat man grew angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, monsieur, he cannot be seen. I have personally tried more\r\nthan a hundred times, monsieur. I have posted myself near the Elysee; he\r\ndid not come out. A passer-by informed me that he was playing billiards\r\nin the cafe opposite; I went to the cafe opposite; he was not there. I\r\nhad been promised that he would go to Melun for the convention; I went\r\nto Melun, I did not see him. At last I became weary. I did not even see\r\nMonsieur Gambetta, and I do not know a single deputy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was, growing excited:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA government, monsieur, is made to be seen; that's what it's there for,\r\nand for nothing else. One must be able to know that on such and such a\r\nday at such an hour the government will pass through such and such a\r\nstreet. Then one goes there and is satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatissot, now calm, was enjoying his arguments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is agreeable to know the people by whom\r\none is governed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman continued more gently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how I would manage the celebration? Well, monsieur, I would\r\nhave a procession of gilded cars, like the chariots used at the crowning\r\nof kings; in them I would parade all the members of the government, from\r\nthe president to the deputies, throughout Paris all day long. In that\r\nmanner, at least, every one would know by sight the personnel of the\r\nstate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut one of the toughs near the coachman turned around, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the fatted ox, where would you put him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA laugh ran round the two benches. Patissot understood the objection,\r\nand murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might not perhaps be very dignified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman thought the matter over and admitted it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would place them in view some place, so that every\r\none could see them without going out of his way; on the Triumphal Arch\r\nat the Place de l'Etoile, for instance; and I would have the whole\r\npopulation pass before them. That would be very imposing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more the tough turned round and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'd have to take telescopes to see their faces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman did not answer; he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's just like the presentation of the flags! There ought to be some\r\npretext, a mimic war ought to be organized, and the banners would be\r\nawarded to the troops as a reward. I had an idea about which I wrote to\r\nthe minister; but he has not deigned to answer me. As the taking of the\r\nBastille has been chosen for the date of the national celebration, a\r\nreproduction of this event might be made; there would be a pasteboard\r\nBastille, fixed up by a scene-painter and concealing within its walls\r\nthe whole Column of July. Then, monsieur, the troop would attack. That\r\nwould be a magnificent spectacle as well as a lesson, to see the army\r\nitself overthrow the ramparts of tyranny. Then this Bastille would be\r\nset fire to and from the midst of the flames would appear the Column\r\nwith the genius of Liberty, symbol of a new order and of the freedom of\r\nthe people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time every one was listening to him and finding his idea excellent.\r\nAn old gentleman exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a great idea, monsieur, which does you honor. It is to be\r\nregretted that the government did not adopt it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA young man declared that actors ought to recite the \xe2\x80\x9cIambes\xe2\x80\x9d of Barbier\r\nthrough the streets in order to teach the people art and liberty\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nThese propositions excited general enthusiasm. Each one wished to have\r\nhis word; all were wrought up. From a passing hand-organ a few strains\r\nof the Marseillaise were heard; the laborer started the song, and\r\neverybody joined in, roaring the chorus. The exalted nature of the song\r\nand its wild rhythm fired the driver, who lashed his horses to a gallop.\r\nMonsieur Patissot was bawling at the top of his lungs, and the\r\npassengers inside, frightened, were wondering what hurricane had struck\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt last they stopped, and Monsieur Patissot, judging his neighbor to be\r\na man of initiative, consulted him about the preparations which he\r\nexpected to make:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLanterns and flags are all right,\xe2\x80\x9d' said Patissot; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I prefer\r\nsomething better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other thought for a long time, but found nothing. Then, in despair,\r\nthe clerk bought three flags and four lanterns.\r\n\r\nAN EXPERIMENT IN LOVE\r\n\r\nMany poets think that nature is incomplete without women, and hence,\r\ndoubtless, come all the flowery comparisons which, in their songs, make\r\nour natural companion in turn a rose, a violet, a tulip, or something of\r\nthat order. The need of tenderness which seizes us at dusk, when the\r\nevening mist begins to roll in from the hills, and when all the perfumes\r\nof the earth intoxicate us, is but imperfectly satisfied by lyric\r\ninvocations. Monsieur Patissot, like all others, was seized with a wild\r\ndesire for tenderness, for sweet kisses exchanged along a path where\r\nsunshine steals in at times, for the pressure of a pair of small hands,\r\nfor a supple waist bending under his embrace.\r\n\r\nHe began to look at love as an unbounded pleasure, and, in his hours of\r\nreverie, he thanked the Great Unknown for having put so much charm into\r\nthe caresses of human beings. But he needed a companion, and he did not\r\nknow where to find one. On the advice of a friend, he went to the\r\nFolies-Bergere. There he saw a complete assortment. He was greatly\r\nperplexed to choose between them, for the desires of his heart were\r\nchiefly composed of poetic impulses, and poetry did not seem to be the\r\nstrong point of these young ladies with penciled eyebrows who smiled at\r\nhim in such a disturbing manner, showing the enamel of their false\r\nteeth. At last his choice fell on a young beginner who seemed poor and\r\ntimid and whose sad look seemed to announce a nature easily influenced\r\nby poetry.\r\n\r\nHe made an appointment with her for the following day at nine o'clock at\r\nthe Saint-Lazare station. She did not come, but she was kind enough to\r\nsend a friend in her stead.\r\n\r\nShe was a tall, red-haired girl, patriotically dressed in three colors,\r\nand covered by an immense tunnel hat, of which her head occupied the\r\ncentre. Monsieur Patissot, a little disappointed, nevertheless accepted\r\nthis substitute. They left for Maisons-Laffite, where regattas and a\r\ngrand Venetian festival had been announced.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were in the car, which was already occupied by two\r\ngentlemen who wore the red ribbon and three ladies who must at least\r\nhave been duchesses, they were so dignified, the big red-haired girl,\r\nwho answered the name of Octavie, announced to Patissot, in a screeching\r\nvoice, that she was a fine girl fond of a good time and loving the\r\ncountry because there she could pick flowers and eat fried fish. She\r\nlaughed with a shrillness which almost shattered the windows, familiarly\r\ncalling her companion \xe2\x80\x9cMy big darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShame overwhelmed Patissot, who as a government employee, had to observe\r\na certain amount of decorum. But Octavie stopped talking, glancing at\r\nher neighbors, seized with the overpowering desire which haunts all\r\nwomen of a certain class to make the acquaintance of respectable women.\r\nAfter about five minutes she thought she had found an opening, and,\r\ndrawing from her pocket a Gil-Blas, she politely offered it to one of\r\nthe amazed ladies, who declined, shaking her head. Then the big, red-\r\nhaired girl began saying things with a double meaning, speaking of women\r\nwho are stuck up without being any better than the others; sometimes she\r\nwould let out a vulgar word which acted like a bomb exploding amid the\r\nicy dignity of the passengers.\r\n\r\nAt last they arrived. Patissot immediately wished to gain the shady\r\nnooks of the park, hoping that the melancholy of the forest would quiet\r\nthe ruffled temper of his companion. But an entirely different effect\r\nresulted. As soon as she was amid the leaves and grass she began to sing\r\nat the top of her lungs snatches from operas which had stuck in her\r\nfrivolous mind, warbling and trilling, passing from \xe2\x80\x9cRobert le Diable\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x9cMuette,\xe2\x80\x9d lingering especially on a sentimental love-song, whose\r\nlast verses she sang in a voice as piercing as a gimlet.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly she grew hungry. Patissot, who was still awaiting the\r\nhoped-for tenderness, tried in vain to retain her. Then she grew angry,\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not here for a dull time, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had to take her to the Petit-Havre restaurant, which was near the\r\nplace where the regatta was to be held.\r\n\r\nShe ordered an endless luncheon, a succession of dishes substantial\r\nenough to feed a regiment. Then, unable to wait, she called for\r\nrelishes. A box of sardines was brought; she started in on it as though\r\nshe intended to swallow the box itself. But when she had eaten two or\r\nthree of the little oily fish she declared that she was no longer hungry\r\nand that she wished to see the preparations for the race.\r\n\r\nPatissot, in despair and in his turn seized with hunger, absolutely\r\nrefused to move. She started off alone, promising to return in time for\r\nthe dessert. He began to eat in lonely silence, not knowing how to lead\r\nthis rebellious nature to the realization of his dreams.\r\n\r\nAs she did not return he set out in search of her. She had found some\r\nfriends, a troop of boatmen, in scanty garb, sunburned to the tips of\r\ntheir ears, and gesticulating, who were loudly arranging the details of\r\nthe race in front of the house of Fourmaise, the builder.\r\n\r\nTwo respectable-looking gentlemen, probably the judges, were listening\r\nattentively. As soon as she saw Patissot, Octavie, who was leaning on\r\nthe tanned arm of a strapping fellow who probably had more muscle than\r\nbrains, whispered a few words in his ears. He answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's an agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned to the clerk full of joy, her eyes sparkling, almost\r\ncaressing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's go for a row,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nPleased to see her so charming, he gave in to this new whim and procured\r\na boat. But she obstinately refused to go to the races, notwithstanding\r\nPatissot's wishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather be alone with you, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis heart thrilled. At last!\r\n\r\nHe took off his coat and began to row madly.\r\n\r\nAn old dilapidated mill, whose worm-eaten wheels hung over the water,\r\nstood with its two arches across a little arm of the river. Slowly they\r\npassed beneath it, and, when they were on the other side, they noticed\r\nbefore them a delightful little stretch of river, shaded by great trees\r\nwhich formed an arch over their heads. The little stream flowed along,\r\nwinding first to the right and then to the left, continually revealing\r\nnew scenes, broad fields on one side and on the other side a hill\r\ncovered with cottages. They passed before a bathing establishment almost\r\nentirely hidden by the foliage, a charming country spot where gentlemen\r\nin clean gloves and beribboned ladies displayed all the ridiculous\r\nawkwardness of elegant people in the country. She cried joyously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater on we will take a dip there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarther on, in a kind of bay, she wished to stop, coaxing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, honey, right close to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her arm around his neck and, leaning her head on his shoulder,\r\nshe murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow nice it is! How delightful it is on the water!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatissot was reveling in happiness. He was thinking of those foolish\r\nboatmen who, without ever feeling the penetrating charm of the river\r\nbanks and the delicate grace of the reeds, row along out of breath,\r\nperspiring and tired out, from the tavern where they take luncheon to\r\nthe tavern where they take dinner.\r\n\r\nHe was so comfortable that he fell asleep. When he awoke, he was alone.\r\nHe called, but no one answered. Anxious, he climbed up on the side of\r\nthe river, fearing that some accident might have happened.\r\n\r\nThen, in the distance, coming in his direction, he saw a long, slender\r\ngig which four oarsmen as black as negroes were driving through the\r\nwater like an arrow. It came nearer, skimming over the water; a woman\r\nwas holding the tiller. Heavens! It looked\xe2\x80\x94it was she! In order to\r\nregulate the rhythm of the stroke, she was singing in her shrill voice a\r\nboating song, which she interrupted for a minute as she got in front of\r\nPatissot. Then, throwing him a kiss, she cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou big goose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA DINNER AND SOME OPINIONS\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the national celebration Monsieur Antoine Perdrix,\r\nchief of Monsieur Patissot's department, was made a knight of the Legion\r\nof Honor. He had been in service for thirty years under preceding\r\ngovernments, and for ten years under the present one. His employees,\r\nalthough grumbling a little at being thus rewarded in the person of\r\ntheir chief, thought it wise, nevertheless, to offer him a cross studded\r\nwith paste diamonds. The new knight, in turn, not wishing to be outdone,\r\ninvited them all to dinner for the following Sunday, at his place at\r\nAsnieres.\r\n\r\nThe house, decorated with Moorish ornaments, looked like a cafe concert,\r\nbut its location gave it value, as the railroad cut through the whole\r\ngarden, passing within a hundred and fifty feet of the porch. On the\r\nregulation plot of grass stood a basin of Roman cement, containing\r\ngoldfish and a stream of water the size of that which comes from a\r\nsyringe, which occasionally made microscopic rainbows at which the\r\nguests marvelled.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of this irrigator was the constant preoccupation of Monsieur\r\nPerdrix, who would sometimes get up at five o'clock in the morning in\r\norder to fill the tank. Then, in his shirt sleeves, his big stomach\r\nalmost bursting from his trousers, he would pump wildly, so that on\r\nreturning from the office he could have the satisfaction of letting the\r\nfountain play and of imagining that it was cooling off the garden.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the official dinner all the guests, one after the other,\r\nwent into ecstasies over the surroundings, and each time they heard a\r\ntrain in the distance, Monsieur Perdrix would announce to them its\r\ndestination: Saint-Germain, Le Havre, Cherbourg, or Dieppe, and they\r\nwould playfully wave to the passengers leaning from the windows.\r\n\r\nThe whole office force was there. First came Monsieur Capitaine, the\r\nassistant chief; Monsieur Patissot, chief clerk; then Messieurs de\r\nSombreterre and Vallin, elegant young employees who only came to the\r\noffice when they had to; lastly Monsieur Rade, known throughout the\r\nministry for the absurd doctrines which he upheld, and the copying\r\nclerk, Monsieur Boivin.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Rade passed for a character. Some called him a dreamer or an\r\nidealist, others a revolutionary; every one agreed that he was very\r\nclumsy. Old, thin and small, with bright eyes and long, white hair, he\r\nhad all his life professed a profound contempt for administrative work.\r\nA book rummager and a great reader, with a nature continually in revolt\r\nagainst everything, a seeker of truth and a despiser of popular\r\nprejudices, he had a clear and paradoxical manner of expressing his\r\nopinions which closed the mouths of self-satisfied fools and of those\r\nthat were discontented without knowing why. People said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat old fool\r\nof a Rade,\xe2\x80\x9d or else: \xe2\x80\x9cThat harebrained Rade\xe2\x80\x9d; and the slowness, of his\r\npromotion seemed to indicate the reason, according to commonplace minds.\r\nHis freedom of speech often made\xe2\x80\x94his colleagues tremble; they asked\r\nthemselves with terror how he had been able to keep his place as long as\r\nhe had. As soon as they had seated themselves, Monsieur Perdrix thanked\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9ccollaborators\xe2\x80\x9d in a neat little speech, promising them his\r\nprotection, the more valuable as his power grew, and he ended with a\r\nstirring peroration in which he thanked and glorified a government so\r\nliberal and just that it knows how to seek out the worthy from among the\r\nhumble.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Capitaine, the assistant chief, answered in the name of the\r\noffice, congratulated, greeted, exalted, sang the praises of all;\r\nfrantic applause greeted these two bits of eloquence. After that they\r\nsettled down seriously to the business of eating.\r\n\r\nEverything went well up to the dessert; lack of conversation went\r\nunnoticed. But after the coffee a discussion arose, and Monsieur Rade\r\nlet himself loose and soon began to overstep the bounds of discretion.\r\n\r\nThey naturally discussed love, and a breath of chivalry intoxicated this\r\nroom full of bureaucrats; they praised and exalted the superior beauty\r\nof woman, the delicacy of her soul, her aptitude for exquisite things,\r\nthe correctness of her judgment, and the refinement of her sentiments.\r\nMonsieur Rade began to protest, energetically refusing to credit the so-\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d sex with all the qualities they ascribed to it; then,\r\namidst the general indignation, he quoted some authors:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchopenhauer, gentlemen, Schopenhauer, the great philosopher, revered\r\nby all Germany, says: 'Man's intelligence must have been terribly\r\ndeadened by love in order to call this sex with the small waist, narrow\r\nshoulders, large hips and crooked legs, the fair sex. All its beauty\r\nlies in the instinct of love. Instead of calling it the fair, it would\r\nhave been better to call it the unaesthetic sex. Women have neither the\r\nappreciation nor the knowledge of music, any more than they have of\r\npoetry or of the plastic arts; with them it is merely an apelike\r\nimitation, pure pretence, affectation cultivated from their desire to\r\nplease.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who said that is an idiot,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Monsieur de Sombreterre.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Rade smilingly continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how about Rousseau, gentlemen? Here is his opinion: 'Women, as a\r\nrule, love no art, are skilled in none, and have no talent.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Sombreterre disdainfully shrugged his shoulders:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Rousseau is as much of a fool as the other, that's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Rade, still smiling, went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is what Lord Byron said, who, nevertheless, loved women: 'They\r\nshould be well fed and well dressed, but not allowed to mingle with\r\nsociety. They should also be taught religion, but they should ignore\r\npoetry and politics, only being allowed to read religious works or cook-\r\nbooks.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Rade continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, gentlemen, all of them study painting and music. But not a\r\nsingle one of them has ever painted a remarkable picture or composed a\r\ngreat opera! Why, gentlemen? Because they are the 'sexes sequior', the\r\nsecondary sex in every sense of the word, made to be kept apart, in the\r\nbackground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Patissot was growing angry, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how about Madame Sand, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the one exception, monsieur, the one exception. I will quote to\r\nyou another passage from another great philosopher, this one an\r\nEnglishman, Herbert Spencer. Here is what he says: 'Each sex is capable,\r\nunder the influence of abnormal stimulation, of manifesting faculties\r\nordinarily reserved for the other one. Thus, for instance, in extreme\r\ncases a special excitement may cause the breasts of men to give milk;\r\nchildren deprived of their mothers have often thus been saved in time of\r\nfamine. Nevertheless, we do not place this faculty of giving milk among\r\nthe male attributes. It is the same with female intelligence, which, in\r\ncertain cases, will give superior products, but which is not to be\r\nconsidered in an estimate of the feminine nature as a social factor.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll Monsieur Patissot's chivalric instincts were wounded and he\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not a Frenchman, monsieur. French gallantry is a form of\r\npatriotism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Rade retorted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have very little patriotism, monsieur, as little as I can get along\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA coolness settled over the company, but he continued quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you admit with me that war is a barbarous thing; that this custom of\r\nkilling off people constitutes a condition of savagery; that it is\r\nodious, when life is the only real good, to see governments, whose duty\r\nis to protect the lives of their subjects, persistently looking for\r\nmeans of destruction? Am I not right? Well, if war is a terrible thing,\r\nwhat about patriotism, which is the idea at the base of it? When a\r\nmurderer kills he has a fixed idea; it is to steal. When a good man\r\nsticks his bayonet through another good man, father of a family, or,\r\nperhaps, a great artist, what idea is he following out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody was shocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one has such thoughts, one should not express them in public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Patissot continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are, however, monsieur, principles which all good people\r\nrecognize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Rade asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhich ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen very solemnly, M. Patissot pronounced: \xe2\x80\x9cMorality, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Rade was beaming; he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust let me give you one example, gentlemen, one little example. What\r\nis your opinion of the gentlemen with the silk caps who thrive along the\r\nboulevard's on the delightful traffic which you know, and who make a\r\nliving out of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA look of disgust ran round the table:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen! only a century ago, when an elegant gentleman, very\r\nticklish about his honor, had for\xe2\x80\x94friend\xe2\x80\x94a beautiful and rich lady, it\r\nwas considered perfectly proper to live at her expense and even to\r\nsquander her whole fortune. This game was considered delightful. This\r\nonly goes to show that the principles of morality are by no means\r\nsettled\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Perdrix, visibly embarrassed, stopped him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. Rade, you are sapping the very foundations of society. One must\r\nalways have principles. Thus, in politics, here is M. de Sombreterre,\r\nwho is a Legitimist; M. Vallin, an Orleanist; M. Patissot and myself,\r\nRepublicans; we all have very different principles, and yet we agree\r\nvery well because we have them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut M. Rade exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also have principles, gentlemen, very distinct ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Patissot raised his head and coldly asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would please me greatly to know them, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Rade did not need to be coaxed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are, monsieur:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst principle\xe2\x80\x94Government by one person is a monstrosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond principle\xe2\x80\x94Restricted suffrage is an injustice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThird principle\xe2\x80\x94Universal suffrage is idiotic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo deliver up millions of men, superior minds, scientists, even\r\ngeniuses, to the caprice and will of a being who, in an instant of\r\ngaiety, madness, intoxication or love, would not hesitate to sacrifice\r\neverything for his exalted fancy, would spend the wealth of the country\r\namassed by others with difficulty, would have thousands of men\r\nslaughtered on the battle-fields, all this appears to me\xe2\x80\x94a simple\r\nlogician\xe2\x80\x94a monstrous aberration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, admitting that a country must govern itself, to exclude, on some\r\nalways debatable pretext, a part of the citizens from the administration\r\nof affairs is such an injustice that it seems to me unworthy of a\r\nfurther discussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere remains universal suffrage. I suppose that you will agree with me\r\nthat geniuses are a rarity. Let us be liberal and say that there are at\r\npresent five in France. Now, let us add, perhaps, two hundred men with a\r\ndecided talent, one thousand others possessing various talents, and ten\r\nthousand superior intellects. This is a staff of eleven thousand two\r\nhundred and five minds. After that you have the army of mediocrities\r\nfollowed by the multitude of fools. As the mediocrities and the fools\r\nalways form the immense majority, it is impossible for them to elect an\r\nintelligent government.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to be fair I admit that logically universal suffrage seems to\r\nme the only admissible principle, but it is impracticable. Here are the\r\nreasons why:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make all the living forces of the country cooperate in the\r\ngovernment, to represent all the interests, to take into account all the\r\nrights, is an ideal dream, but hardly practicable, because the only\r\nforce which can be measured is that very one which should be neglected,\r\nthe stupid strength of numbers, According to your method, unintelligent\r\nnumbers equal genius, knowledge, learning, wealth and industry. When you\r\nare able to give to a member of the Institute ten thousand votes to a\r\nragman's one, one hundred votes for a great land-owner as against his\r\nfarmer's ten, then you will have approached an equilibrium of forces and\r\nobtained a national representation which will really represent the\r\nstrength of the nation. But I challenge you to do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are my conclusions:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFormerly, when a man was a failure at every other profession he turned\r\nphotographer; now he has himself elected a deputy. A government thus\r\ncomposed will always be sadly lacking, incapable of evil as well as of\r\ngood. On the other hand, a despot, if he be stupid, can do a lot of\r\nharm, and, if he be intelligent (a thing which is very scarce), he may\r\ndo good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot decide between these two forms of government; I declare myself\r\nto be an anarchist, that is to say, a partisan of that power which is\r\nthe most unassuming, the least felt, the most liberal, in the broadest\r\nsense of the word, and revolutionary at the same time; by that I mean\r\nthe everlasting enemy of this same power, which can in no way be\r\nanything but defective. That's all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCries of indignation rose about the table, and all, whether Legitimist,\r\nOrleanist or Republican through force of circumstances, grew red with\r\nanger. M. Patissot especially was choking with rage, and, turning toward\r\nM. Rade, he cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, monsieur, you believe in nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other answered quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're absolutely correct, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe anger felt by all the guests prevented M. Rade from continuing, and\r\nM. Perdrix, as chief, closed the discussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, gentlemen! We each have our opinion, and we have no intention\r\nof changing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll agreed with the wise words. But M. Rade, never satisfied, wished to\r\nhave the last word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, however, one moral,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is simple and always\r\napplicable. One sentence embraces the whole thought; here it is: 'Never\r\ndo unto another that which you would not have him do unto you.' I defy\r\nyou to pick any flaw in it, while I will undertake to demolish your most\r\nsacred principles with three arguments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time there was no answer. But as they were going home at night, by\r\ncouples, each one was saying to his companion: \xe2\x80\x9cReally, M. Rade goes\r\nmuch too far. His mind must surely be unbalanced. He ought to be\r\nappointed assistant chief at the Charenton Asylum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RECOLLECTION\r\n\r\nHow many recollections of youth come to me in the soft sunlight of early\r\nspring! It was an age when all was pleasant, cheerful, charming,\r\nintoxicating. How exquisite are the remembrances of those old\r\nspringtimes!\r\n\r\nDo you recall, old friends and brothers, those happy years when life was\r\nnothing but a triumph and an occasion for mirth? Do you recall the days\r\nof wanderings around Paris, our jolly poverty, our walks in the fresh,\r\ngreen woods, our drinks in the wine-shops on the banks of the Seine and\r\nour commonplace and delightful little flirtations?\r\n\r\nI will tell you about one of these. It was twelve years ago and already\r\nappears to me so old, so old that it seems now as if it belonged to the\r\nother end of life, before middle age, this dreadful middle age from\r\nwhich I suddenly perceived the end of the journey.\r\n\r\nI was then twenty-five. I had just come to Paris. I was in a government\r\noffice, and Sundays were to me like unusual festivals, full of exuberant\r\nhappiness, although nothing remarkable occurred.\r\n\r\nNow it is Sunday every day, but I regret the time when I had only one\r\nSunday in the week. How enjoyable it was! I had six francs to spend!\r\n\r\nOn this particular morning I awoke with that sense of freedom that all\r\nclerks know so well\xe2\x80\x94the sense of emancipation, of rest, of quiet and of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nI opened my window. The weather was charming. A blue sky full of\r\nsunlight and swallows spread above the town.\r\n\r\nI dressed quickly and set out, intending to spend the day in the woods\r\nbreathing the air of the green trees, for I am originally a rustic,\r\nhaving been brought up amid the grass and the trees.\r\n\r\nParis was astir and happy in the warmth and the light. The front of the\r\nhouses was bathed in sunlight, the janitress' canaries were singing in\r\ntheir cages and there was an air of gaiety in the streets, in the faces\r\nof the inhabitants, lighting them up with a smile as if all beings and\r\nall things experienced a secret satisfaction at the rising of the\r\nbrilliant sun.\r\n\r\nI walked towards the Seine to take the Swallow, which would land me at\r\nSaint-Cloud.\r\n\r\nHow I loved waiting for the boat on the wharf:\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that I was about to set out for the ends of the world,\r\nfor new and wonderful lands. I saw the boat approaching yonder, yonder\r\nunder the second bridge, looking quite small with its plume of smoke,\r\nthen growing larger and ever larger, as it drew near, until it looked to\r\nme like a mail steamer.\r\n\r\nIt came up to the wharf and I went on board. People were there already\r\nin their Sunday clothes, startling toilettes, gaudy ribbons and bright\r\nscarlet designs. I took up a position in the bows, standing up and\r\nlooking at the quays, the trees, the houses and the bridges disappearing\r\nbehind us. And suddenly I perceived the great viaduct of Point du Jour\r\nwhich blocked the river. It was the end of Paris, the beginning of the\r\ncountry, and behind the double row of arches the Seine, suddenly\r\nspreading out as though it had regained space and liberty, became all at\r\nonce the peaceful river which flows through the plains, alongside the\r\nwooded hills, amid the meadows, along the edge of the forests.\r\n\r\nAfter passing between two islands the Swallow went round a curved\r\nverdant slope dotted with white houses. A voice called out: \xe2\x80\x9cBas Meudon\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand a little further on, \xe2\x80\x9cSevres,\xe2\x80\x9d and still further, \xe2\x80\x9cSaint-Cloud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went on shore and walked hurriedly through the little town to the road\r\nleading to the wood.\r\n\r\nI had brought with me a map of the environs of Paris, so that I might\r\nnot lose my way amid the paths which cross in every direction these\r\nlittle forests where Parisians take their outings.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was unperceived I began to study my guide, which seemed to\r\nbe perfectly clear. I was to turn to the right, then to the left, then\r\nagain to the left and I should reach Versailles by evening in time for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly beneath the young leaves, drinking in the air, fragrant\r\nwith the odor of young buds and sap. I sauntered along, forgetful of\r\nmusty papers, of the offices, of my chief, my colleagues, my documents,\r\nand thinking of the good things that were sure to come to me, of all the\r\nveiled unknown contained in the future. A thousand recollections of\r\nchildhood came over me, awakened by these country odors, and I walked\r\nalong, permeated with the fragrant, living enchantment, the emotional\r\nenchantment of the woods warmed by the sun of June.\r\n\r\nAt times I sat down to look at all sorts of little flowers growing on a\r\nbank, with the names of which I was familiar. I recognized them all just\r\nas if they were the ones I had seen long ago in the country. They were\r\nyellow, red, violet, delicate, dainty, perched on long stems or close to\r\nthe ground. Insects of all colors and shapes, short, long, of peculiar\r\nform, frightful, and microscopic monsters, climbed quietly up the stalks\r\nof grass which bent beneath their weight.\r\n\r\nThen I went to sleep for some hours in a hollow and started off again,\r\nrefreshed by my doze.\r\n\r\nIn front of me lay an enchanting pathway and through its somewhat scanty\r\nfoliage the sun poured down drops of light on the marguerites which grew\r\nthere. It stretched out interminably, quiet and deserted, save for an\r\noccasional big wasp, who would stop buzzing now and then to sip from a\r\nflower, and then continue his way.\r\n\r\nAll at once I perceived at the end of the path two persons, a man and a\r\nwoman, coming towards me. Annoyed at being disturbed in my quiet walk, I\r\nwas about to dive into the thicket, when I thought I heard someone\r\ncalling me. The woman was, in fact, shaking her parasol, and the man, in\r\nhis shirt sleeves, his coat over one arm, was waving the other as a\r\nsignal of distress.\r\n\r\nI went towards them. They were walking hurriedly, their faces very red,\r\nshe with short, quick steps and he with long strides. They both looked\r\nannoyed and fatigued.\r\n\r\nThe woman asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me, monsieur, where we are? My fool of a husband made us\r\nlose our way, although he pretended he knew the country perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied confidently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, you are going towards Saint-Cloud and turning your back on\r\nVersailles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a look of annoyed pity for her husband, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, we are turning our back on Versailles? Why, that is just where we\r\nwant to dine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going there also, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, shrugging her shoulders,\r\nand in that tone of sovereign contempt assumed by women to express their\r\nexasperation.\r\n\r\nShe was quite young, pretty, a brunette with a slight shadow on her\r\nupper lip.\r\n\r\nAs for him, he was perspiring and wiping his forehead. It was assuredly\r\na little Parisian bourgeois couple. The man seemed cast down, exhausted\r\nand distressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear friend, it was you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nShe did not allow him to finish his sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was I! Ah, it is my fault now! Was it I who wanted to go out without\r\ngetting any information, pretending that I knew how to find my way? Was\r\nit I who wanted to take the road to the right on top of the hill,\r\ninsisting that I recognized the road? Was it I who undertook to take\r\ncharge of Cachou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had not finished speaking when her husband, as if he had suddenly\r\ngone crazy, gave a piercing scream, a long, wild cry that could not be\r\ndescribed in any language, but which sounded like 'tuituit'.\r\n\r\nThe young woman did not appear to be surprised or moved and resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, really, some people are so stupid and they pretend they know\r\neverything. Was it I who took the train to Dieppe last year instead of\r\nthe train to Havre\xe2\x80\x94tell me, was it I? Was it I who bet that M.\r\nLetourneur lived in Rue des Martyres? Was it I who would not believe\r\nthat Celeste was a thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on, furious, with a surprising flow of language, accumulating\r\nthe most varied, the most unexpected and the most overwhelming\r\naccusations drawn from the intimate relations of their daily life,\r\nreproaching her husband for all his actions, all his ideas, all his\r\nhabits, all his enterprises, all his efforts, for his life from the time\r\nof their marriage up to the present time.\r\n\r\nHe strove to check her, to calm her and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, it is useless\xe2\x80\x94before monsieur. We are making ourselves\r\nridiculous. This does not interest monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he cast mournful glances into the thicket as though he sought to\r\nsound its peaceful and mysterious depths, in order to flee thither, to\r\nescape and hide from all eyes, and from time to time he uttered a fresh\r\nscream, a prolonged and shrill \xe2\x80\x9ctuituit.\xe2\x80\x9d I took this to be a nervous\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nThe young woman, suddenly turning towards me: and changing her tone with\r\nsingular rapidity, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf monsieur will kindly allow us, we will accompany him on the road, so\r\nas not to lose our way again, and be obliged, possibly, to sleep in the\r\nwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed. She took my arm and began to talk about a thousand things\r\n\xe2\x80\x94about herself, her life, her family, her business. They were glovers in\r\nthe Rue Saint-Lazare.\r\n\r\nHer husband walked beside her, casting wild glances into the thick wood\r\nand screaming \xe2\x80\x9ctuituit\xe2\x80\x9d every few moments.\r\n\r\nAt last I inquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you scream like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost my poor dog,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in a tone of discouragement and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that\xe2\x80\x94you have lost your dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He was just a year old. He had never been outside the shop. I\r\nwanted to take him to have a run in the woods. He had never seen the\r\ngrass nor the leaves and he was almost wild. He began to run about and\r\nbark and he disappeared in the wood. I must also add that he was greatly\r\nafraid of the train. That may have driven him mad. I kept on calling\r\nhim, but he has not come back. He will die of hunger in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout turning towards her husband, the young woman said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had left his chain on, it would not have happened. When people\r\nare as stupid as you are they do not keep a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, it was you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured timidly.\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, and looking into his eyes as if she were going to\r\ntear them out, she began again to cast in his face innumerable\r\nreproaches.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark. The cloud of vapor that covers the country at dusk\r\nwas slowly rising and there was a poetry in the air, induced by the\r\npeculiar and enchanting freshness of the atmosphere that one feels in\r\nthe woods at nightfall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the young man stopped, and feeling his body feverishly,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think that I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not notice that I had my coat on my arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost my pocketbook\xe2\x80\x94my money was in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook with anger and choked with indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was all that was lacking. How stupid you are! how stupid you are!\r\nIs it possible that I could have married such an idiot! Well, go and\r\nlook for it, and see that you find it. I am going on to Versailles with\r\nmonsieur. I do not want to sleep in the wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied gently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall I find you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA restaurant had been recommended to me. I gave him the address.\r\n\r\nHe turned back and, stooping down as he searched the ground with anxious\r\neyes, he moved away, screaming \xe2\x80\x9ctuituit\xe2\x80\x9d every few moments.\r\n\r\nWe could see him for some time until the growing darkness concealed all\r\nbut his outline, but we heard his mournful \xe2\x80\x9ctuituit,\xe2\x80\x9d shriller and\r\nshriller as the night grew darker.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I stepped along quickly and happily in the soft twilight,\r\nwith this little unknown woman leaning on my arm. I tried to say pretty\r\nthings to her, but could think of nothing. I remained silent, disturbed,\r\nenchanted.\r\n\r\nOur path was suddenly crossed by a high road. To the right I perceived a\r\ntown lying in a valley.\r\n\r\nWhat was this place? A man was passing. I asked him. He replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBougival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was dumfounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Bougival? Are you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu, I belong there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little woman burst into an idiotic laugh.\r\n\r\nI proposed that we should take a carriage and drive to Versailles. She\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. This is very funny and I am very hungry. I am really quite\r\ncalm. My husband will find his way all right. It is a treat to me to be\r\nrid of him for a few hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went into a restaurant beside the water and I ventured to ask for a\r\nprivate compartment. We had some supper. She sang, drank champagne,\r\ncommitted all sorts of follies.\r\n\r\nThat was my first serious flirtation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR LETTERS\r\n\r\nEight hours of railway travel induce sleep for some persons and insomnia\r\nfor others; with me, any journey prevents my sleeping on the following\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAt about five o'clock I arrived at the estate of Abelle, which belongs\r\nto my friends, the Murets d'Artus, to spend three weeks there. It is a\r\npretty house, built by one of their grandfathers in the style of the\r\nlatter half of the last century. Therefore it has that intimate\r\ncharacter of dwellings that have always been inhabited, furnished and\r\nenlivened by the same people. Nothing changes; nothing alters the soul\r\nof the dwelling, from which the furniture has never been taken out, the\r\ntapestries never unnailed, thus becoming worn out, faded, discolored, on\r\nthe same walls. None of the old furniture leaves the place; only from\r\ntime to time it is moved a little to make room for a new piece, which\r\nenters there like a new-born infant in the midst of brothers and\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nThe house is on a hill in the center of a park which slopes down to the\r\nriver, where there is a little stone bridge. Beyond the water the fields\r\nstretch out in the distance, and here one can see the cows wandering\r\naround, pasturing on the moist grass; their eyes seem full of the dew,\r\nmist and freshness of the pasture. I love this dwelling, just as one\r\nloves a thing which one ardently desires to possess. I return here every\r\nautumn with infinite delight; I leave with regret.\r\n\r\nAfter I had dined with this friendly family, by whom I was received like\r\na relative, I asked my friend, Paul Muret: \xe2\x80\x9cWhich room did you give me\r\nthis year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Rose's room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hour later, followed by her three children, two little girls and a\r\nboy, Madame Muret d'Artus installed me in Aunt Rose's room, where I had\r\nnot yet slept.\r\n\r\nWhen I was alone I examined the walls, the furniture, the general aspect\r\nof the room, in order to attune my mind to it. I knew it but little, as\r\nI had entered it only once or twice, and I looked indifferently at a\r\npastel portrait of Aunt Rose, who gave her name to the room.\r\n\r\nThis old Aunt Rose, with her curls, looking at me from behind the glass,\r\nmade very little impression on my mind. She looked to me like a woman of\r\nformer days, with principles and precepts as strong on the maxims of\r\nmorality as on cooking recipes, one of these old aunts who are the\r\nbugbear of gaiety and the stern and wrinkled angel of provincial\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nI never had heard her spoken of; I knew nothing of her life or of her\r\ndeath. Did she belong to this century or to the preceding one? Had she\r\nleft this earth after a calm or a stormy existence? Had she given up to\r\nheaven the pure soul of an old maid, the calm soul of a spouse, the\r\ntender one of a mother, or one moved by love? What difference did it\r\nmake? The name alone, \xe2\x80\x9cAunt Rose,\xe2\x80\x9d seemed ridiculous, common, ugly.\r\n\r\nI picked up a candle and looked at her severe face, hanging far up in an\r\nold gilt frame. Then, as I found it insignificant, disagreeable, even\r\nunsympathetic, I began to examine the furniture. It dated from the\r\nperiod of Louis XVI, the Revolution and the Directorate. Not a chair,\r\nnot a curtain had entered this room since then, and it gave out the\r\nsubtle odor of memories, which is the combined odor of wood, cloth,\r\nchairs, hangings, peculiar to places wherein have lived hearts that have\r\nloved and suffered.\r\n\r\nI retired but did not sleep. After I had tossed about for an hour or\r\ntwo, I decided to get up and write some letters.\r\n\r\nI opened a little mahogany desk with brass trimmings, which was placed\r\nbetween the two windows, in hope of finding some ink and paper; but all\r\nI found was a quill-pen, very much worn, and chewed at the end. I was\r\nabout to close this piece of furniture, when a shining spot attracted my\r\nattention it looked like the yellow head of a nail. I scratched it with\r\nmy finger, and it seemed to move. I seized it between two finger-nails,\r\nand pulled as hard as I could. It came toward me gently. It was a long\r\ngold pin which had been slipped into a hole in the wood and remained\r\nhidden there.\r\n\r\nWhy? I immediately thought that it must have served to work some spring\r\nwhich hid a secret, and I looked. It took a long time. After about two\r\nhours of investigation, I discovered another hole opposite the first\r\none, but at the bottom of a groove. Into this I stuck my pin: a little\r\nshelf sprang toward my face, and I saw two packages of yellow letters,\r\ntied with a blue ribbon.\r\n\r\nI read them. Here are two of them:\r\n\r\nSo you wish me to return to you your letters, my dearest friend. Here\r\nthey are, but it pains me to obey. Of what are you afraid? That I might\r\nlose them? But they are under lock and key. Do you fear that they might\r\nbe stolen? I guard against that, for they are my dearest treasure.\r\n\r\nYes, it pains me deeply. I wondered whether, perhaps you might not be\r\nfeeling some regret! Not regret at having loved me, for I know that you\r\nstill do, but the regret of having expressed on white paper this living\r\nlove in hours when your heart did not confide in me, but in the pen that\r\nyou held in your hand. When we love, we have need of confession, need of\r\ntalking or writing, and we either talk or write. Words fly away, those\r\nsweet words made of music, air and tenderness, warm and light, which\r\nescape as soon as they are uttered, which remain in the memory alone,\r\nbut which one can neither see, touch nor kiss, as one can with the words\r\nwritten by your hand.\r\n\r\nYour letters? Yes, I am returning them to you! But with what sorrow!\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, you must have had an after thought of delicate shame at\r\nexpressions that are ineffaceable. In your sensitive and timid soul you\r\nmust have regretted having written to a man that you loved him. You\r\nremembered sentences that called up recollections, and you said to\r\nyourself: \xe2\x80\x9cI will make ashes of those words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBe satisfied, be calm. Here are your letters. I love you.\r\n\r\nMY FRIEND:\r\n\r\nNo, you have not understood me, you have not guessed. I do not regret,\r\nand I never shall, that I told you of my affection.\r\n\r\nI will always write to you, but you must return my letters to me as soon\r\nas you have read them.\r\n\r\nI shall shock you, my friend, when I tell you the reason for this\r\ndemand. It is not poetic, as you imagined, but practical. I am afraid,\r\nnot of you, but of some mischance. I am guilty. I do not wish my fault\r\nto affect others than myself.\r\n\r\nUnderstand me well. You and I may both die. You might fall off your\r\nhorse, since you ride every day; you might die from a sudden attack,\r\nfrom a duel, from heart disease, from a carriage accident, in a thousand\r\nways. For, if there is only one death, there are more ways of its\r\nreaching us than there are days or us to live.\r\n\r\nThen your sisters, your brother, or your sister-in-law might find my\r\nletters! Do you think that they love me? I doubt it. And then, even if\r\nthey adored me, is it possible for two women and one man to know a\r\nsecret\xe2\x80\x94such a secret!\xe2\x80\x94and not to tell of it?\r\n\r\nI seem to be saying very disagreeable things, speaking first of your\r\ndeath, and then suspecting the discreetness of your relatives.\r\n\r\nBut don't all of us die sooner or later? And it is almost certain that\r\none of us will precede the other under the ground. We must therefore\r\nforesee all dangers, even that one.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I will keep your letters beside mine, in the secret of my\r\nlittle desk. I will show them to you there, sleeping side by side in\r\ntheir silken hiding place, full of our love, like lovers in a tomb.\r\n\r\nYou will say to me: \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you should die first, my dear, your husband\r\nwill find these letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh! I fear nothing. First of all, he does not know the secret of my\r\ndesk, and then he will not look for it. And even if he finds it after my\r\ndeath, I fear nothing.\r\n\r\nDid you ever stop to think of all the love letters that have been found\r\nafter death? I have been thinking of this for a long time, and that is\r\nthe reason I decided to ask you for my letters.\r\n\r\nThink that never, do you understand, never, does a woman burn, tear or\r\ndestroy the letters in which it is told her that she is loved. That is\r\nour whole life, our whole hope, expectation and dream. These little\r\npapers which bear our name in caressing terms are relics which we adore;\r\nthey are chapels in which we are the saints. Our love letters are our\r\ntitles to beauty, grace, seduction, the intimate vanity of our\r\nwomanhood; they are the treasures of our heart. No, a woman does not\r\ndestroy these secret and delicious archives of her life.\r\n\r\nBut, like everybody else, we die, and then\xe2\x80\x94then these letters are found!\r\nWho finds them? The husband. Then what does he do? Nothing. He burns\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOh, I have thought a great deal about that! Just think that every day\r\nwomen are dying who have been loved; every day the traces and proofs of\r\ntheir fault fall into the hands of their husbands, and that there is\r\nnever a scandal, never a duel.\r\n\r\nThink, my dear, of what a man's heart is. He avenges himself on a living\r\nwoman; he fights with the man who has dishonored her, kills him while\r\nshe lives, because, well, why? I do not know exactly why. But, if, after\r\nher death, he finds similar proofs, he burns them and no one is the\r\nwiser, and he continues to shake hands with the friend of the dead\r\nwoman, and feels quite at ease that these letters should not have fallen\r\ninto strange hands, and that they are destroyed.\r\n\r\nOh, how many men I know among my friends who must have burned such\r\nproofs, and who pretend to know nothing, and yet who would have fought\r\nmadly had they found them when she was still alive! But she is dead.\r\nHonor has changed. The tomb is the boundary of conjugal sinning.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I can safely keep our letters, which, in your hands, would be\r\na menace to both of us. Do you dare to say that I am not right?\r\n\r\nI love you and kiss you.\r\n\r\nI raised my eyes to the portrait of Aunt Rose, and as I looked at her\r\nsevere, wrinkled face, I thought of all those women's souls which we do\r\nnot know, and which we suppose to be so different from what they really\r\nare, whose inborn and ingenuous craftiness we never can penetrate, their\r\nquiet duplicity; and a verse of De Vigny returned to my memory:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways this comrade whose heart is uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOVE OF LONG AGO\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned chateau was built on a wooded knoll in the midst of\r\ntall trees with dark-green foliage; the park extended to a great\r\ndistance, in one direction to the edge of the forest, in another to the\r\ndistant country. A few yards from the front of the house was a huge\r\nstone basin with marble ladies taking a bath; other, basins were seen at\r\nintervals down to the foot of the slope, and a stream of water fell in\r\ncascades from one basin to another.\r\n\r\nFrom the manor house, which preserved the grace of a superannuated\r\ncoquette, down to the grottos incrusted with shell-work, where slumbered\r\nthe loves of a bygone age, everything in this antique demesne had\r\nretained the physiognomy of former days. Everything seemed to speak\r\nstill of ancient customs, of the manners of long ago, of former\r\ngallantries, and of the elegant trivialities so dear to our\r\ngrandmothers.\r\n\r\nIn a parlor in the style of Louis XV, whose walls were covered with\r\nshepherds paying court to shepherdesses, beautiful ladies in hoop-\r\nskirts, and gallant gentlemen in wigs, a very old woman, who seemed dead\r\nas soon as she ceased to move, was almost lying down in a large easy-\r\nchair, at each side of which hung a thin, mummy-like hand.\r\n\r\nHer dim eyes were gazing dreamily toward the distant horizon as if they\r\nsought to follow through the park the visions of her youth. Through the\r\nopen window every now and then came a breath of air laden with the odor\r\nof grass and the perfume of flowers. It made her white locks flutter\r\naround her wrinkled forehead and old memories float through her brain.\r\n\r\nBeside her, on a tapestried stool, a young girl, with long fair hair\r\nhanging in braids down her back, was embroidering an altar-cloth. There\r\nwas a pensive expression in her eyes, and it was easy to see that she\r\nwas dreaming, while her agile fingers flew over her work.\r\n\r\nBut the old lady turned round her head, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBerthe, read me something out of the newspapers, that I may still know\r\nsometimes what is going on in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl took up a newspaper, and cast a rapid glance over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal about politics, grandmamma; shall I pass that\r\nover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, darling. Are there no love stories? Is gallantry, then, dead\r\nin France, that they no longer talk about abductions or adventures as\r\nthey did formerly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl made a long search through the columns of the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is entitled 'A Love Drama!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman smiled through her wrinkles. \xe2\x80\x9cRead that for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd Berthe commenced. It was a case of vitriol throwing. A wife, in\r\norder to avenge herself on her husband's mistress, had burned her face\r\nand eyes. She had left the Court of Assizes acquitted, declared to be\r\ninnocent, amid the applause of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother moved about excitedly in her chair, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is horrible\xe2\x80\x94why, it is perfectly horrible!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee whether you can find anything else to read to me, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerthe again made a search; and farther down among the reports of\r\ncriminal cases, she read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Gloomy Drama. A shop girl, no longer young, allowed herself to be led\r\nastray by a young man. Then, to avenge herself on her lover, whose heart\r\nproved fickle, she shot him with a revolver. The unhappy man is maimed\r\nfor life. The jury, all men of moral character, condoning the illicit\r\nlove of the murderess, honorably acquitted her.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time the old grandmother appeared quite shocked, and, in a\r\ntrembling voice, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you people are mad nowadays. You are mad! The good God has given\r\nyou love, the only enchantment in life. Man has added to this gallantry\r\nthe only distraction of our dull hours, and here you are mixing up with\r\nit vitriol and revolvers, as if one were to put mud into a flagon of\r\nSpanish wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerthe did not seem to understand her grandmother's indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, grandmamma, this woman avenged herself. Remember she was married,\r\nand her husband deceived her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grandmother gave a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ideas have they been filling your head with, you young girls of\r\ntoday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerthe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut marriage is sacred, grandmamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grandmother's heart, which had its birth in the great age of\r\ngallantry, gave a sudden leap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is love that is sacred,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, child, to an old woman\r\nwho has seen three generations, and who has had a long, long experience\r\nof men and women. Marriage and love have nothing in common. We marry to\r\nfound a family, and we form families in order to constitute society.\r\nSociety cannot dispense with marriage. If society is a chain, each\r\nfamily is a link in that chain. In order to weld those links, we always\r\nseek metals of the same order. When we marry, we must bring together\r\nsuitable conditions; we must combine fortunes, unite similar races and\r\naim at the common interest, which is riches and children. We marry only\r\nonce my child, because the world requires us to do so, but we may love\r\ntwenty times in one lifetime because nature has made us like this.\r\nMarriage, you see, is law, and love is an instinct which impels us,\r\nsometimes along a straight, and sometimes along a devious path. The\r\nworld has made laws to combat our instincts\xe2\x80\x94it was necessary to make\r\nthem; but our instincts are always stronger, and we ought not to resist\r\nthem too much, because they come from God; while the laws only come from\r\nmen. If we did not perfume life with love, as much love as possible,\r\ndarling, as we put sugar into drugs for children, nobody would care to\r\ntake it just as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerthe opened her eyes wide in astonishment. She murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! grandmamma, we can only love once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grandmother raised her trembling hands toward Heaven, as if again to\r\ninvoke the defunct god of gallantries. She exclaimed indignantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have become a race of serfs, a race of common people. Since the\r\nRevolution, it is impossible any longer to recognize society. You have\r\nattached big words to every action, and wearisome duties to every corner\r\nof existence; you believe in equality and eternal passion. People have\r\nwritten poetry telling you that people have died of love. In my time\r\npoetry was written to teach men to love every woman. And we! when we\r\nliked a gentleman, my child, we sent him a page. And when a fresh\r\ncaprice came into our hearts, we were not slow in getting rid of the\r\nlast Lover\xe2\x80\x94unless we kept both of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman smiled a keen smile, and a gleam of roguery twinkled in\r\nher gray eye, the intellectual, skeptical roguery of those people who\r\ndid not believe that they were made of the same clay as the rest, and\r\nwho lived as masters for whom common beliefs were not intended.\r\n\r\nThe young girl, turning very pale, faltered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, then, women have no honor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grandmother ceased to smile. If she had kept in her soul some of\r\nVoltaire's irony, she had also a little of Jean Jacques's glowing\r\nphilosophy: \xe2\x80\x9cNo honor! because we loved, and dared to say so, and even\r\nboasted of it? But, my child, if one of us, among the greatest ladies in\r\nFrance, had lived without a lover, she would have had the entire court\r\nlaughing at her. Those who wished to live differently had only to enter\r\na convent. And you imagine, perhaps, that your husbands will love but\r\nyou alone, all their lives. As if, indeed, this could be the case. I\r\ntell you that marriage is a thing necessary in order that society should\r\nexist, but it is not in the nature of our race, do you understand? There\r\nis only one good thing in life, and that is love. And how you\r\nmisunderstand it! how you spoil it! You treat it as something solemn\r\nlike a sacrament, or something to be bought, like a dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl caught the old woman's trembling hands in her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, I beg of you, grandmamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, on her knees, with tears in her eyes, she prayed to Heaven to\r\nbestow on her a great passion, one sole, eternal passion in accordance\r\nwith the dream of modern poets, while the grandmother, kissing her on\r\nthe forehead, quite imbued still with that charming, healthy reason with\r\nwhich gallant philosophers tinctured the thought of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, my poor darling! If you believe in such folly as that, you\r\nwill be very unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEND JOSEPH\r\n\r\nThey had been great friends all winter in Paris. As is always the case,\r\nthey had lost sight of each other after leaving school, and had met\r\nagain when they were old and gray-haired. One of them had married, but\r\nthe other had remained in single blessedness.\r\n\r\nM. de Meroul lived for six months in Paris and for six months in his\r\nlittle chateau at Tourbeville. Having married the daughter of a\r\nneighboring squire, he had lived a good and peaceful life in the\r\nindolence of a man who has nothing to do. Of a calm and quiet\r\ndisposition, and not over-intelligent he used to spend his time quietly\r\nregretting the past, grieving over the customs and institutions of the\r\nday and continually repeating to his wife, who would lift her eyes, and\r\nsometimes her hands, to heaven, as a sign of energetic assent: \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\ngracious! What a government!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Meroul resembled her husband intellectually as though she had\r\nbeen his sister. She knew, by tradition, that one should above all\r\nrespect the Pope and the King!\r\n\r\nAnd she loved and respected them from the bottom of her heart, without\r\nknowing them, with a poetic fervor, with an hereditary devotion, with\r\nthe tenderness of a wellborn woman. She was good to, the marrow of her\r\nbones. She had had no children, and never ceased mourning the fact.\r\n\r\nOn meeting his old friend, Joseph Mouradour, at a ball, M. de Meroul was\r\nfilled with a deep and simple joy, for in their youth they had been\r\nintimate friends.\r\n\r\nAfter the first exclamations of surprise at the changes which time had\r\nwrought in their bodies and countenances, they told each other about\r\ntheir lives since they had last met.\r\n\r\nJoseph Mouradour, who was from the south of France, had become a\r\ngovernment official. His manner was frank; he spoke rapidly and without\r\nrestraint, giving his opinions without any tact. He was a Republican,\r\none of those good fellows who do not believe in standing on ceremony,\r\nand who exercise an almost brutal freedom of speech.\r\n\r\nHe came to his friend's house and was immediately liked for his easy\r\ncordiality, in spite of his radical ideas. Madame de Meroul would\r\nexclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame! Such a charming man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Meroul would say to his friend in a serious and confidential\r\ntone of voice; \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea the harm that you are doing your\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d He loved him all the same, for nothing is stronger than the\r\nties of childhood taken up again at a riper age. Joseph Mouradour\r\nbantered the wife and the husband, calling them \xe2\x80\x9cmy amiable snails,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsometimes he would solemnly declaim against people who were behind the\r\ntimes, against old prejudices and traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen he was once started on his democratic eloquence, the couple,\r\nsomewhat ill at ease, would keep silent from politeness and good-\r\nbreeding; then the husband would try to turn the conversation into some\r\nother channel in order to avoid a clash. Joseph Mouradour was only seen\r\nin the intimacy of the family.\r\n\r\nSummer came. The Merouls had no greater pleasure than to receive their\r\nfriends at their country home at Tourbeville. It was a good, healthy\r\npleasure, the enjoyments of good people and of country proprietors. They\r\nwould meet their friends at the neighboring railroad station and would\r\nbring them back in their carriage, always on the lookout for compliments\r\non the country, on its natural features, on the condition of the roads,\r\non the cleanliness of the farm-houses, on the size of the cattle grazing\r\nin the fields, on everything within sight.\r\n\r\nThey would call attention to the remarkable speed with which their horse\r\ntrotted, surprising for an animal that did heavy work part of the year\r\nbehind a plow; and they would anxiously await the opinion of the\r\nnewcomer on their family domain, sensitive to the least word, and\r\nthankful for the slightest good intention.\r\n\r\nJoseph Mouradour was invited, and he accepted the invitation.\r\n\r\nHusband and wife had come to the train, delighted to welcome him to\r\ntheir home. As soon as he saw them, Joseph Mouradour jumped from the\r\ntrain with a briskness which increased their satisfaction. He shook\r\ntheir hands, congratulated them, overwhelmed them with compliments.\r\n\r\nAll the way home he was charming, remarking on the height of the trees,\r\nthe goodness of the crops and the speed of the horse.\r\n\r\nWhen he stepped on the porch of the house, Monsieur de Meroul said, with\r\na certain friendly solemnity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider yourself at home now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoseph Mouradour answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, my friend; I expected as much. Anyhow, I never stand on\r\nceremony with my friends. That's how I understand hospitality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went upstairs to dress as a farmer, he said, and he came back\r\nall togged out in blue linen, with a little straw hat and yellow shoes,\r\na regular Parisian dressed for an outing. He also seemed to become more\r\nvulgar, more jovial, more familiar; having put on with his country\r\nclothes a free and easy manner which he judged suitable to the\r\nsurroundings. His new manners shocked Monsieur and Madame de Meroul a\r\nlittle, for they always remained serious and dignified, even in the\r\ncountry, as though compelled by the two letters preceding their name to\r\nkeep up a certain formality even in the closest intimacy.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch they all went out to visit the farms, and the Parisian\r\nastounded the respectful peasants by his tone of comradeship.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the priest came to dinner, an old, fat priest, accustomed\r\nto dining there on Sundays, but who had been especially invited this day\r\nin honor of the new guest.\r\n\r\nJoseph, on seeing him, made a wry face. Then he observed him with\r\nsurprise, as though he were a creature of some peculiar race, which he\r\nhad never been able to observe at close quarters. During the meal he\r\ntold some rather free stories, allowable in the intimacy of the family,\r\nbut which seemed to the Merouls a little out of place in the presence of\r\na minister of the Church. He did not say, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur l'abbe,\xe2\x80\x9d but simply,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d He embarrassed the priest greatly by philosophical\r\ndiscussions about diverse superstitions current all over the world. He\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cYour God, monsieur, is of those who should be respected, but also\r\none of those who should be discussed. Mine is called Reason; he has\r\nalways been the enemy of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Merouls, distressed, tried to turn the trend of the conversation.\r\nThe priest left very early.\r\n\r\nThen the husband said, very quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you went a little bit too far with the priest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Joseph immediately exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that's pretty good! As if I would be on my guard with a\r\nshaveling! And say, do me the pleasure of not imposing him on me any\r\nmore at meals. You can both make use of him as much as you wish, but\r\ndon't serve him up to your friends, hang it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my friends, think of his holy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoseph Mouradour interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know; they have to be treated like 'rosieres.' But let them\r\nrespect my convictions, and I will respect theirs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was all for that day.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Madame de Meroul entered the parlor, the next morning, she\r\nnoticed in the middle of the table three newspapers which made her start\r\nthe Voltaire, the Republique-Francaise and the Justice. Immediately\r\nJoseph Mouradour, still in blue, appeared on the threshold, attentively\r\nreading the Intransigeant. He cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's a great article in this by Rochefort. That fellow is a wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read it aloud, emphasizing the parts which especially pleased him, so\r\ncarried away by enthusiasm that he did not notice his friend's entrance.\r\nMonsieur de Meroul was holding in his hand the Gaulois for himself, the\r\nClarion for his wife.\r\n\r\nThe fiery prose of the master writer who overthrew the empire, spouted\r\nwith violence, sung in the southern accent, rang throughout the peaceful\r\nparsons seemed to spatter the walls and century-old furniture with a\r\nhail of bold, ironical and destructive words.\r\n\r\nThe man and the woman, one standing, the other sitting, were listening\r\nwith astonishment, so shocked that they could not move.\r\n\r\nIn a burst of eloquence Mouradour finished the last paragraph, then\r\nexclaimed triumphantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! that's pretty strong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he noticed the two sheets which his friend was carrying,\r\nand he, in turn, stood speechless from surprise. Quickly walking toward\r\nhim he demanded angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing with those papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Meroul answered hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94those\xe2\x80\x94those are my papers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour papers! What are you doing\xe2\x80\x94making fun of me? You will do me the\r\npleasure of reading mine; they will limber up your ideas, and as for\r\nyours\xe2\x80\x94there! that's what I do with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd before his astonished host could stop him, he had seized the two\r\nnewspapers and thrown them out of the window. Then he solemnly handed\r\nthe Justice to Madame de Meroul, the Voltaire to her husband, while he\r\nsank down into an arm-chair to finish reading the Intransigeant.\r\n\r\nThe couple, through delicacy, made a pretense of reading a little, they\r\nthen handed him back the Republican sheets, which they handled gingerly,\r\nas though they might be poisoned.\r\n\r\nHe laughed and declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne week of this regime and I will have you converted to my ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn truth, at the end of a week he ruled the house. He had closed the\r\ndoor against the priest, whom Madame de Meroul had to visit secretly; he\r\nhad forbidden the Gaulois and the Clarion to be brought into the house,\r\nso that a servant had to go mysteriously to the post-office to get them,\r\nand as soon as he entered they would be hidden under sofa cushions; he\r\narranged everything to suit himself\xe2\x80\x94always charming, always good-\r\nnatured, a jovial and all-powerful tyrant.\r\n\r\nOther friends were expected, pious and conservative friends. The unhappy\r\ncouple saw the impossibility of having them there then, and, not knowing\r\nwhat to do, one evening they announced to Joseph Mouradour that they\r\nwould be obliged to absent themselves for a few days, on business, and\r\nthey begged him to stay on alone. He did not appear disturbed, and\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I don't mind! I will wait here as long as you wish. I have\r\nalready said that there should be no formality between friends. You are\r\nperfectly right-go ahead and attend to your business. It will not offend\r\nme in the least; quite the contrary, it will make me feel much more\r\ncompletely one of the family. Go ahead, my friends, I will wait for\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame de Meroul left the following day.\r\n\r\nHe is still waiting for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFEMINATES\r\n\r\nHow often we hear people say, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is charming, that man, but he is a\r\ngirl, a regular girl.\xe2\x80\x9d They are alluding to the effeminates, the bane of\r\nour land.\r\n\r\nFor we are all girl-like men in France\xe2\x80\x94that is, fickle, fanciful,\r\ninnocently treacherous, without consistency in our convictions or our\r\nwill, violent and weak as women are.\r\n\r\nBut the most irritating of girl\xe2\x80\x94men is assuredly the Parisian and the\r\nboulevardier, in whom the appearance of intelligence is more marked and\r\nwho combines in himself all the attractions and all the faults of those\r\ncharming creatures in an exaggerated degree in virtue of his masculine\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nOur Chamber of Deputies is full of girl-men. They form the greater\r\nnumber of the amiable opportunists whom one might call \xe2\x80\x9cThe Charmers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese are they who control by soft words and deceitful promises, who\r\nknow how to shake hands in such a manner as to win hearts, how to say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend\xe2\x80\x9d in a certain tactful way to people he knows the least,\r\nto change his mind without suspecting it, to be carried away by each new\r\nidea, to be sincere in their weathercock convictions, to let themselves\r\nbe deceived as they deceive others, to forget the next morning what he\r\naffirmed the day before.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers are full of these effeminate men. That is probably where\r\none finds the most, but it is also where they are most needed. The\r\nJournal des Debats and the Gazette de France are exceptions.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, every good journalist must be somewhat effeminate\xe2\x80\x94that is, at\r\nthe command of the public, supple in following unconsciously the shades\r\nof public opinion, wavering and varying, sceptical and credulous, wicked\r\nand devout, a braggart and a true man, enthusiastic and ironical, and\r\nalways convinced while believing in nothing.\r\n\r\nForeigners, our anti-types, as Mme. Abel called them, the stubborn\r\nEnglish and the heavy Germans, regard us with a certain amazement\r\nmingled with contempt, and will continue to so regard us till the end of\r\ntime. They consider us frivolous. It is not that, it is that we are\r\ngirls. And that is why people love us in spite of our faults, why they\r\ncome back to us despite the evil spoken of us; these are lovers'\r\nquarrels! The effeminate man, as one meets him in this world, is so\r\ncharming that he captivates you after five minutes' chat. His smile\r\nseems made for you; one cannot believe that his voice does not assume\r\nspecially tender intonations on their account. When he leaves you it\r\nseems as if one had known him for twenty years. One is quite ready to\r\nlend him money if he asks for it. He has enchanted you, like a woman.\r\n\r\nIf he commits any breach of manners towards you, you cannot bear any\r\nmalice, he is so pleasant when you next meet him. If he asks your pardon\r\nyou long to ask pardon of him. Does he tell lies? You cannot believe it.\r\nDoes he put you off indefinitely with promises that he does not keep?\r\nOne lays as much store by his promises as though he had moved heaven and\r\nearth to render them a service.\r\n\r\nWhen he admires anything he goes into such raptures that he convinces\r\nyou. He once adored Victor Hugo, whom he now treats as a back number. He\r\nwould have fought for Zola, whom he has abandoned for Barbey and\r\nd'Aurevilly. And when he admires, he permits no limitation, he would\r\nslap your face for a word. But when he becomes scornful, his contempt is\r\nunbounded and allows of no protest.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he understands nothing.\r\n\r\nListen to two girls talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are angry with Julia?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI slapped her face.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat had she\r\ndone?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShe told Pauline that I had no money thirteen months out of\r\ntwelve, and Pauline told Gontran\xe2\x80\x94you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou were living\r\ntogether in the Rue Clanzel?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe lived together four years in the Rue\r\nBreda; we quarrelled about a pair of stockings that she said I had worn\r\n\xe2\x80\x94it wasn't true\xe2\x80\x94silk stockings that she had bought at Mother Martin's.\r\nThen I gave her a pounding and she left me at once. I met her six months\r\nago and she asked me to come and live with her, as she has rented a flat\r\nthat is twice too large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne goes on one's way and hears no more. But on the following Sunday as\r\none is on the way to Saint Germain two young women get into the same\r\nrailway carriage. One recognizes one of them at once; it is Julia's\r\nenemy. The other is Julia!\r\n\r\nAnd there are endearments, caresses, plans. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, Julia\xe2\x80\x94listen, Julia,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe girl-man has his friendships of this kind. For three months he\r\ncannot bear to leave his old Jack, his dear Jack. There is no one but\r\nJack in the world. He is the only one who has any intelligence, any\r\nsense, any talent. He alone amounts to anything in Paris. One meets them\r\neverywhere together, they dine together, walk about in company, and\r\nevery evening walk home with each other back and forth without being\r\nable to part with one another.\r\n\r\nThree months later, if Jack is mentioned:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a drinker, a sorry fellow, a scoundrel for you. I know him\r\nwell, you may be sure. And he is not even honest, and ill-bred,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThree months later, and they are living together.\r\n\r\nBut one morning one hears that they have fought a duel, then embraced\r\neach other, amid tears, on the duelling ground.\r\n\r\nJust now they are the dearest friends in the world, furious with each\r\nother half the year, abusing and loving each other by turns, squeezing\r\neach other's hands till they almost crush the bones, and ready to run\r\neach other through the body for a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nFor the relations of these effeminate men are uncertain. Their temper is\r\nby fits and starts, their delight unexpected, their affection turn-\r\nabout-face, their enthusiasm subject to eclipse. One day they love you,\r\nthe next day they will hardly look at you, for they have in fact a\r\ngirl's nature, a girl's charm, a girl's temperament, and all their\r\nsentiments are like the affections of girls.\r\n\r\nThey treat their friends as women treat their pet dogs.\r\n\r\nIt is the dear little Toutou whom they hug, feed with sugar, allow to\r\nsleep on the pillow, but whom they would be just as likely to throw out\r\nof a window in a moment of impatience, whom they turn round like a\r\nsling, holding it by the tail, squeeze in their arms till they almost\r\nstrangle it, and plunge, without any reason, in a pail of cold water.\r\n\r\nThen, what a strange thing it is when one of these beings falls in love\r\nwith a real girl! He beats her, she scratches him, they execrate each\r\nother, cannot bear the sight of each other and yet cannot part, linked\r\ntogether by no one knows what mysterious psychic bonds. She deceives\r\nhim, he knows it, sobs and forgives her. He despises and adores her\r\nwithout seeing that she would be justified in despising him. They are\r\nboth atrociously unhappy and yet cannot separate. They cast invectives,\r\nreproaches and abominable accusations at each other from morning till\r\nnight, and when they have reached the climax and are vibrating with rage\r\nand hatred, they fall into each other's arms and kiss each other\r\nardently.\r\n\r\nThe girl-man is brave and a coward at the same time. He has, more than\r\nanother, the exalted sentiment of honor, but is lacking in the sense of\r\nsimple honesty, and, circumstances favoring him, would defalcate and\r\ncommit infamies which do not trouble his conscience, for he obeys\r\nwithout questioning the oscillations of his ideas, which are always\r\nimpulsive.\r\n\r\nTo him it seems permissible and almost right to cheat a haberdasher. He\r\nconsiders it honorable not to pay his debts, unless they are gambling\r\ndebts\xe2\x80\x94that is, somewhat shady. He dupes people whenever the laws of\r\nsociety admit of his doing so. When he is short of money he borrows in\r\nall ways, not always being scrupulous as to tricking the lenders, but he\r\nwould, with sincere indignation, run his sword through anyone who should\r\nsuspect him of only lacking in politeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD AMABLE\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nThe humid gray sky seemed to weigh down on the vast brown plain. The\r\nodor of autumn, the sad odor of bare, moist lands, of fallen leaves, of\r\ndead grass made the stagnant evening air more thick and heavy. The\r\npeasants were still at work, scattered through the fields, waiting for\r\nthe stroke of the Angelus to call them back to the farmhouses, whose\r\nthatched roofs were visible here and there through the branches of the\r\nleafless trees which protected the apple-gardens against the wind.\r\n\r\nAt the side of the road, on a heap of clothes, a very small boy seated\r\nwith his legs apart was playing with a potato, which he now and then let\r\nfall on his dress, whilst five women were bending down planting slips of\r\ncolza in the adjoining plain. With a slow, continuous movement, all\r\nalong the mounds of earth which the plough had just turned up, they\r\ndrove in sharp wooden stakes and in the hole thus formed placed the\r\nplant, already a little withered, which sank on one side; then they\r\npatted down the earth and went on with their work.\r\n\r\nA man who was passing, with a whip in his hand, and wearing wooden\r\nshoes, stopped near the child, took it up and kissed it. Then one of the\r\nwomen rose up and came across to him. She was a big, red haired girl,\r\nwith large hips, waist and shoulders, a tall Norman woman, with yellow\r\nhair in which there was a blood-red tint.\r\n\r\nShe said in a resolute voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here you are, Cesaire\xe2\x80\x94well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man, a thin young fellow with a melancholy air, murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, nothing at all\xe2\x80\x94always the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't have it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say I ought to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo see the cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they stared at each other. He held the child in his arms all the\r\ntime. He kissed it once more and then put it down again on the woman's\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, between two farm-houses, could be seen a plough drawn\r\nby a horse and driven by a man. They moved on very gently, the horse,\r\nthe plough and the laborer, in the dim evening twilight.\r\n\r\nThe woman went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did your father say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said he would not have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy wouldn't he have it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man pointed toward the child whom he had just put back on the\r\nground, then with a glance he drew her attention to the man drawing the\r\nplough yonder there.\r\n\r\nAnd he said emphatically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause 'tis his\xe2\x80\x94this child of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl shrugged her shoulders and in an angry tone said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, every one knows it well\xe2\x80\x94that it is Victor's. And what about it\r\nafter all? I made a slip. Am I the only woman that did? My mother also\r\nmade a slip before me, and then yours did the same before she married\r\nyour dad! Who is it that hasn't made a slip in the country? I made a\r\nslip with Victor because he took advantage of me while I was asleep in\r\nthe barn, it's true, and afterward it happened between us when I wasn't\r\nasleep. I certainly would have married him if he weren't a servant man.\r\nAm I a worse woman for that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man said simply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for me, I like you just as you are, with or without the child. It's\r\nonly my father that opposes me. All the same, I'll see about settling\r\nthe business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the cure at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he set forth with his heavy peasant's tread, while the girl, with\r\nher hands on her hips, turned round to plant her colza.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the man who thus went off, Cesaire Houlbreque, the son of deaf\r\nold Amable Houlbreque, wanted to marry, in spite of his father, Celeste\r\nLevesque, who had a child by Victor Lecoq, a mere laborer on her\r\nparents' farm, who had been turned out of doors for this act.\r\n\r\nThe hierarchy of caste, however, does not exist in the country, and if\r\nthe laborer is thrifty, he becomes, by taking a farm in his turn, the\r\nequal of his former master.\r\n\r\nSo Cesaire Houlbieque went off, his whip under his arm, brooding over\r\nhis own thoughts and lifting up one after the other his heavy wooden\r\nshoes daubed with clay. Certainly he desired to marry Celeste Levesque.\r\nHe wanted her with her child because she was the wife he wanted. He\r\ncould not say why, but he knew it, he was sure of it. He had only to\r\nlook at her to be convinced of it, to feel quite queer, quite stirred\r\nup, simply stupid with happiness. He even found a pleasure in kissing\r\nthe little boy, Victor's little boy, because he belonged to her.\r\n\r\nAnd he gazed, without hate, at the distant outline of the man who was\r\ndriving his plough along the horizon.\r\n\r\nBut old Amable did not want this marriage. He opposed it with the\r\nobstinacy of a deaf man, with a violent obstinacy.\r\n\r\nCesaire in vain shouted in his ear, in that ear which still heard a few\r\nsounds:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll take good care of you, daddy. I tell you she's a good girl and\r\nstrong, too, and also thrifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as I live I won't see her your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd nothing could get the better of him, nothing could make him waver.\r\nOne hope only was left to Cesaire. Old Amable was afraid of the cure\r\nthrough the apprehension of death which he felt drawing nigh; he had not\r\nmuch fear of God, nor of the Devil, nor of Hell, nor of Purgatory, of\r\nwhich he had no conception, but he dreaded the priest, who represented\r\nto him burial, as one might fear the doctors through horror of diseases.\r\nFor the last tight days Celeste, who knew this weakness of the old man,\r\nhad been urging Cesaire to go and find the cure, but Cesaire always\r\nhesitated, because he had not much liking for the black robe, which\r\nrepresented to him hands always stretched out for collections or for\r\nblessed bread.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had made up his mind, and he proceeded toward the\r\npresbytery, thinking in what manner he would speak about his case.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Raffin, a lively little priest, thin and never shaved, was\r\nawaiting his dinner-hour while warming his feet at his kitchen fire.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw the peasant entering he asked, merely turning his\r\nhead:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Cesaire, what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to have a talk with you, M. le Cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man remained standing, intimidated, holding his cap in one hand and\r\nhis whip in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCesaire looked at the housekeeper, an old woman who dragged her feet\r\nwhile putting on the cover for her master's dinner at the corner of the\r\ntable in front of the window.\r\n\r\nHe stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis\xe2\x80\x94'tis a sort of confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon the Abbe Raffin carefully surveyed his peasant. He saw his\r\nconfused countenance, his air of constraint, his wandering eyes, and he\r\ngave orders to the housekeeper in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarie, go away for five minutes to your room, while I talk to Cesaire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant cast on the man an angry glance and went away grumbling.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, tell your story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young fellow still hesitated, looked down at his wooden shoes, moved\r\nabout his cap, then, all of a sudden, he made up his mind:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is: I want to marry Celeste Levesque.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy, what's there to prevent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe father won't have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does your father say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says she has a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe's not the first to whom that happened, since our Mother Eve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA child by Victor Lecoq, Anthime Loisel's servant man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! So he won't have it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! not at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no more than an ass that won't budge an inch, saving your\r\npresence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to him yourself in order to make him decide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say to him that she's a good girl, and strong, too, and thrifty\r\nalso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this does not make him agree to it. So you want me to speak to\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. You speak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what am I to tell your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what you tell people in your sermons to make them give you sous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the peasant's mind every effort of religion consisted in loosening\r\nthe purse strings, in emptying the pockets of men in order to fill the\r\nheavenly coffer. It was a kind of huge commercial establishment, of\r\nwhich the cures were the clerks; sly, crafty clerks, sharp as any one\r\nmust be who does business for the good God at the expense of the country\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHe knew full well that the priests rendered services, great services to\r\nthe poorest, to the sick and dying, that they assisted, consoled,\r\ncounselled, sustained, but all this by means of money, in exchange for\r\nwhite pieces, for beautiful glittering coins, with which they paid for\r\nsacraments and masses, advice and protection, pardon of sins and\r\nindulgences, purgatory and paradise according to the yearly income and\r\nthe generosity of the sinner.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Raffin, who knew his man and who never lost his temper, burst\r\nout laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, I'll tell your father my little story; but you, my lad,\r\nyou'll come to church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHoulbreque extended his hand in order to give a solemn assurance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the word of a poor man, if you do this for me, I promise that I\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, that's all right. When do you wish me to go and find your\r\nfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the sooner the better-to-night, if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn half an hour, then, after supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's understood. So long, my lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by till we meet again, Monsieur le Cure; many thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Cesaire Houlbreque returned home, his heart relieved of a great\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nHe held on lease a little farm, quite small, for they were not rich, his\r\nfather and he. Alone with a female servant, a little girl of fifteen,\r\nwho made the soup, looked after the fowls, milked the cows and churned\r\nthe butter, they lived frugally, though Cesaire was a good cultivator.\r\nBut they did not possess either sufficient lands or sufficient cattle to\r\nearn more than the indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe old man no longer worked. Sad, like all deaf people, crippled with\r\npains, bent double, twisted, he went through the fields leaning on his\r\nstick, watching the animals and the men with a hard, distrustful eye.\r\nSometimes he sat down on the side of the road and remained there without\r\nmoving for hours, vaguely pondering over the things that had engrossed\r\nhis whole life, the price of eggs, and corn, the sun and the rain which\r\nspoil the crops or make them grow. And, worn out with rheumatism, his\r\nold limbs still drank in the humidity of the soul, as they had drunk in\r\nfor the past sixty years, the moisture of the walls of his low house\r\nthatched with damp straw.\r\n\r\nHe came back at the close of the day, took his place at the end of the\r\ntable in the kitchen and when the earthen bowl containing the soup had\r\nbeen placed before him he placed round it his crooked fingers, which\r\nseemed to have kept the round form of the bowl and, winter and summer,\r\nhe warmed his hands, before commencing to eat, so as to lose nothing,\r\nnot even a particle of the heat that came from the fire, which costs a\r\ngreat deal, neither one drop of soup into which fat and salt have to be\r\nput, nor one morsel of bread, which comes from the wheat.\r\n\r\nThen he climbed up a ladder into a loft, where he had his straw-bed,\r\nwhile his son slept below stairs at the end of a kind of niche near the\r\nchimneypiece and the servant shut herself up in a kind of cellar, a\r\nblack hole which was formerly used to store the potatoes.\r\n\r\nCesaire and his father scarcely ever talked to each other. From time to\r\ntime only, when there was a question of selling a crop or buying a calf,\r\nthe young man would ask his father's advice, and, making a speaking-\r\ntrumpet of his two hands, he would bawl out his views into his ear, and\r\nold Amable either approved of them or opposed them in a slow, hollow\r\nvoice that came from the depths of his stomach.\r\n\r\nSo one evening Cesaire, approaching him as if about to discuss the\r\npurchase of a horse or a heifer, communicated to him at the top of his\r\nvoice his intention to marry Celeste Levesque.\r\n\r\nThen the father got angry. Why? On the score of morality? No, certainly.\r\nThe virtue of a girl is of slight importance in the country. But his\r\navarice, his deep, fierce instinct for saving, revolted at the idea that\r\nhis son should bring up a child which he had not begotten himself. He\r\nhad thought suddenly, in one second, of the soup the little fellow would\r\nswallow before becoming useful on the farm. He had calculated all the\r\npounds of bread, all the pints of cider that this brat would consume up\r\nto his fourteenth year, and a mad anger broke loose from him against\r\nCesaire, who had not bestowed a thought on all this.\r\n\r\nHe replied in an unusually strong voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you lost your senses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon Cesaire began to enumerate his reasons, to speak about\r\nCeleste's good qualities, to prove that she would be worth a thousand\r\ntimes what the child would cost. But the old man doubted these\r\nadvantages, while he could have no doubts as to the child's existence;\r\nand he replied with emphatic repetition, without giving any further\r\nexplanation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not have it! I will not have it! As long as I live, this won't\r\nbe done!\xe2\x80\x9d And at this point they had remained for the last three months\r\nwithout one or the other giving in, resuming at least once a week the\r\nsame discussion, with the same arguments, the same words, the same\r\ngestures and the same fruitlessness.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Celeste had advised Cesaire to go and ask for the\r\ncure's assistance.\r\n\r\nOn arriving home the peasant found his father already seated at table,\r\nfor he came late through his visit to the presbytery.\r\n\r\nThey dined in silence, face to face, ate a little bread and butter after\r\nthe soup and drank a glass of cider. Then they remained motionless in\r\ntheir chairs, with scarcely a glimmer of light, the little servant girl\r\nhaving carried off the candle in order to wash the spoons, wipe the\r\nglasses and cut the crusts of bread to be ready for next morning's\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock, at the door, which was immediately opened, and the\r\npriest appeared. The old man raised toward him an anxious eye full of\r\nsuspicion, and, foreseeing danger, he was getting ready to climb up his\r\nladder when the Abbe Raffin laid his hand on his shoulder and shouted\r\nclose to his temple:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to have a talk with you, Father Amable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCesaire had disappeared, taking advantage of the door being open. He did\r\nnot want to listen, for he was afraid and did not want his hopes to\r\ncrumble slowly with each obstinate refusal of his father. He preferred\r\nto learn the truth at once, good or bad, later on; and he went out into\r\nthe night. It was a moonless, starless night, one of those misty nights\r\nwhen the air seems thick with humidity. A vague odor of apples floated\r\nthrough the farmyard, for it was the season when the earliest applies\r\nwere gathered, the \xe2\x80\x9cearly ripe,\xe2\x80\x9d as they are called in the cider\r\ncountry. As Cesaire passed along by the cattlesheds the warm smell of\r\nliving beasts asleep on manure was exhaled through the narrow windows,\r\nand he heard the stamping of the horses, who were standing at the end of\r\nthe stable, and the sound of their jaws tearing and munching the hay on\r\nthe racks.\r\n\r\nHe went straight ahead, thinking about Celeste. In this simple nature,\r\nwhose ideas were scarcely more than images generated directly by\r\nobjects, thoughts of love only formulated themselves by calling up\r\nbefore the mind the picture of a big red-haired girl standing in a\r\nhollow road and laughing, with her hands on her hips.\r\n\r\nIt was thus he saw her on the day when he first took a fancy for her. He\r\nhad, however, known her from infancy, but never had he been so struck by\r\nher as on that morning. They had stopped to talk for a few minutes and\r\nthen he went away, and as he walked along he kept repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, she's a fine girl, all the same. 'Tis a pity she made a slip\r\nwith Victor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTill evening he kept thinking of her and also on the following morning.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw her again he felt something tickling the end of his throat,\r\nas if a cock's feather had been driven through his mouth into his chest,\r\nand since then, every time he found himself near her, he was astonished\r\nat this nervous tickling which always commenced again.\r\n\r\nIn three months he made up his mind to marry her, so much did she please\r\nhim. He could not have said whence came this power over him, but he\r\nexplained it in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am possessed by her,\xe2\x80\x9d as if the desire for this girl within him were\r\nas dominating as one of the powers of hell. He scarcely bothered himself\r\nabout her transgression. It was a pity, but, after all, it did her no\r\nharm, and he bore no grudge against Victor Lecoq.\r\n\r\nBut if the cure should not succeed, what was he to do? He did not dare\r\nto think of it, the anxiety was such a torture to him.\r\n\r\nHe reached the presbytery and seated himself near the little gateway to\r\nwait for the priest's return.\r\n\r\nHe was there perhaps half an hour when he heard steps on the road, and\r\nalthough the night was very dark, he presently distinguished the still\r\ndarker shadow of the cassock.\r\n\r\nHe rose up, his legs giving way under him, not even venturing to speak,\r\nnot daring to ask a question.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman perceived him and said gaily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my lad, it's all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCesaire stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, 'tisn't possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lad, but not without trouble. What an old ass your father is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tisn't possible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes. Come and look me up to-morrow at midday in order to settle\r\nabout the publication of the banns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man seized the cure's hand. He pressed it, shook it, bruised\r\nit as he stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue-true-true, Monsieur le Cure, on the word of an honest man, you'll\r\nsee me to-morrow-at your sermon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe wedding took place in the middle of December. It was simple, the\r\nbridal pair not being rich. Cesaire, attired in new clothes, was ready\r\nsince eight o'clock in the morning to go and fetch his betrothed and\r\nbring her to the mayor's office, but it was too early. He seated himself\r\nbefore the kitchen table and waited for the members of the family and\r\nthe friends who were to accompany him.\r\n\r\nFor the last eight days it had been snowing, and the brown earth, the\r\nearth already fertilized by the autumn sowing, had become a dead white,\r\nsleeping under a great sheet of ice.\r\n\r\nIt was cold in the thatched houses adorned with white caps, and the\r\nround apples in the trees of the enclosures seemed to be flowering,\r\ncovered with white as they had been in the pleasant month of their\r\nblossoming.\r\n\r\nThis day the big clouds to the north, the big great snow clouds, had\r\ndisappeared and the blue sky showed itself above the white earth on\r\nwhich the rising sun cast silvery reflections.\r\n\r\nCesaire looked straight before him through the window, thinking of\r\nnothing, quite happy.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, two women entered, peasant women in their Sunday\r\nclothes, the aunt and the cousin of the bridegroom; then three men, his\r\ncousins; then a woman who was a neighbor. They sat down on chairs and\r\nremained, motionless and silent, the women on one side of the kitchen,\r\nthe men on the other, suddenly seized with timidity, with that\r\nembarrassed sadness which takes possession of people assembled for a\r\nceremony. One of the cousins soon asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not the hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCesaire replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much afraid it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on! Let us start,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\nThose rose up. Then Cesaire, whom a feeling of uneasiness had taken\r\npossession of, climbed up the ladder of the loft to see whether his\r\nfather was ready. The old man, always as a rule an early riser, had not\r\nyet made his appearance. His son found him on his bed of straw, wrapped\r\nup in his blanket, with his eyes open and a malicious gleam in them.\r\n\r\nHe bawled into his ear: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, daddy, get up. It's time for the\r\nwedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe deaf man murmured-in a doleful tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't get up. I have a sort of chill over me that freezes my back. I\r\ncan't stir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man, dumbfounded, stared at him, guessing that this was a\r\ndodge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, daddy; you must make an effort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here! I'll help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he stooped toward the old man, pulled off his blanket, caught him by\r\nthe arm and lifted him up. But old Amable began to whine, \xe2\x80\x9cOoh! ooh!\r\nooh! What suffering! Ooh! I can't. My back is stiffened up. The cold\r\nwind must have rushed in through this cursed roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you'll get no dinner, as I'm having a spread at Polyte's inn.\r\nThis will teach you what comes of acting mulishly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he hurried down the ladder and started out, accompanied by his\r\nrelatives and guests.\r\n\r\nThe men had turned up the bottoms of their trousers so as not to get\r\nthem wet in the snow. The women held up their petticoats and showed\r\ntheir lean ankles with gray woollen stockings and their bony shanks\r\nresembling broomsticks. And they all moved forward with a swinging gait,\r\none behind the other, without uttering a word, moving cautiously, for\r\nfear of losing the road which was-hidden beneath the flat, uniform,\r\nuninterrupted stretch of snow.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the farmhouses they saw one or two persons waiting to\r\njoin them, and the procession went on without stopping and wound its way\r\nforward, following the invisible outlines of the road, so that it\r\nresembled a living chaplet of black beads undulating through the white\r\ncountryside.\r\n\r\nIn front of the bride's door a large group was stamping up and down the\r\nopen space awaiting the bridegroom. When he appeared they gave him a\r\nloud greeting, and presently Celeste came forth from her room, clad in a\r\nblue dress, her shoulders covered with a small red shawl and her head\r\nadorned with orange flowers.\r\n\r\nBut every one asked Cesaire:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere's your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied with embarrassment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn't move on account of the pains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the farmers tossed their heads with a sly, incredulous air.\r\n\r\nThey directed their steps toward the mayor's office. Behind the pair\r\nabout to be wedded a peasant woman carried Victor's child, as if it were\r\ngoing to be baptized; and the peasants, in pairs now, with arms linked,\r\nwalked through the snow with the movements of a sloop at sea.\r\n\r\nAfter having been united by the mayor in the little municipal house the\r\npair were made one by the cure, in his turn, in the modest house of God.\r\nHe blessed their union by promising them fruitfulness, then he preached\r\nto them on the matrimonial virtues, the simple and healthful virtues of\r\nthe country, work, concord and fidelity, while the child, who was cold,\r\nbegan to fret behind the bride.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the couple reappeared on the threshold of the church shots\r\nwere discharged from the ditch of the cemetery. Only the barrels of the\r\nguns could be seen whence came forth rapid jets of smoke; then a head\r\ncould be seen gazing at the procession. It was Victor Lecoq celebrating\r\nthe marriage of his old sweetheart, wishing her happiness and sending\r\nher his good wishes with explosions of powder. He had employed some\r\nfriends of his, five or six laboring men, for these salvos of musketry.\r\nIt was considered a nice attention.\r\n\r\nThe repast was given in Polyte Cacheprune's inn. Twenty covers were laid\r\nin the great hall where people dined on market days, and the big leg of\r\nmutton turning before the spit, the fowls browned under their own gravy,\r\nthe chitterlings sputtering over the bright, clear fire filled the house\r\nwith a thick odor of live coal sprinkled with fat\xe2\x80\x94the powerful, heavy\r\nodor of rustic fare.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to table at midday and the soup was poured at once into\r\nthe plates. All faces had already brightened up; mouths opened to utter\r\nloud jokes and eyes were laughing with knowing winks. They were going to\r\namuse themselves and no mistake.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and old Amable appeared. He seemed in a bad humor and\r\nhis face wore a scowl as he dragged himself forward on his sticks,\r\nwhining at every step to indicate his suffering. As soon as they saw him\r\nthey stopped talking, but suddenly his neighbor, Daddy Malivoire, a big\r\njoker, who knew all the little tricks and ways of people, began to yell,\r\njust as Cesaire used to do, by making a speaking-trumpet of his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, my cute old boy, you have a good nose on you to be able to smell\r\nPolyte's cookery from your own house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter burst forth from the throats of those present.\r\nMalivoire, excited by his success, went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's nothing for the rheumatics like a chitterling poultice! It\r\nkeeps your belly warm, along with a glass of three-six!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men uttered shouts, banged the table with their fists, laughed,\r\nbending on one side and raising up their bodies again as if they were\r\nworking a pump. The women clucked like hens, while the servants\r\nwriggled, standing against the walls. Old Amable was the only one that\r\ndid not laugh, and, without making any reply, waited till they made room\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nThey found a place for him in the middle of the table, facing his\r\ndaughter-in-law, and, as soon as he was seated, he began to eat. It was\r\nhis son who was paying, after all; it was right he should take his\r\nshare. With each ladleful of soup that went into his stomach, with each\r\nmouthful of bread or meat crushed between his gums, with each glass of\r\ncider or wine that flowed through his gullet he thought he was regaining\r\nsomething of his own property, getting back a little of his money which\r\nall those gluttons were devouring, saving in fact a portion of his own\r\nmeans. And he ate in silence with the obstinacy of a miser who hides his\r\ncoppers, with the same gloomy persistence with which he formerly\r\nperformed his daily labors.\r\n\r\nBut all of a sudden he noticed at the end of the table Celeste's child\r\non a woman's lap, and his eye remained fixed on the little boy. He went\r\non eating, with his glance riveted on the youngster, into whose mouth\r\nthe woman who minded him every now and then put a little morsel which he\r\nnibbled at. And the old man suffered more from the few mouthfuls sucked\r\nby this little chap than from all that the others swallowed.\r\n\r\nThe meal lasted till evening. Then every one went back home.\r\n\r\nCesaire raised up old Amable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, daddy, we must go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nAnd he put the old man's two sticks in his hands.\r\n\r\nCeleste took her child in her arms, and they went on slowly through the\r\npale night whitened by the snow. The deaf old man, three-fourths tipsy,\r\nand even more malicious under the influence of drink, refused to go\r\nforward. Several times he even sat down with the object of making his\r\ndaughter-in-law catch cold, and he kept whining, without uttering a\r\nword, giving vent to a sort of continuous groaning as if he were in\r\npain.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached home he at once climbed up to his loft, while Cesaire\r\nmade a bed for the child near the deep niche where he was going to lie\r\ndown with his wife. But as the newly wedded pair could not sleep\r\nimmediately, they heard the old man for a long time moving about on his\r\nbed of straw, and he even talked aloud several times, whether it was\r\nthat he was dreaming or that he let his thoughts escape through his\r\nmouth, in spite of himself, not being able to keep them back, under the\r\nobsession of a fixed idea.\r\n\r\nWhen he came down his ladder next morning he saw his daughter-in-law\r\nlooking after the housekeeping.\r\n\r\nShe cried out to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, daddy, hurry on! Here's some good soup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she placed at the end of the table the round black earthen bowl\r\nfilled with steaming liquid. He sat down without giving any answer,\r\nseized the hot bowl, warmed his hands with it in his customary fashion,\r\nand, as it was very cold, even pressed it against his breast to try to\r\nmake a little of the living heat of the boiling liquid enter into him,\r\ninto his old body stiffened by so many winters.\r\n\r\nThen he took his sticks and went out into the fields, covered with ice,\r\ntill it was time for dinner, for he had seen Celeste's youngster still\r\nasleep in a big soap-box.\r\n\r\nHe did not take his place in the household. He lived in the thatched\r\nhouse, as in bygone days, but he seemed not to belong to it any longer,\r\nto be no longer interested in anything, to look upon those people, his\r\nson, the wife and the child as strangers whom he did not know, to whom\r\nhe never spoke.\r\n\r\nThe winter glided by. It was long and severe.\r\n\r\nThen the early spring made the seeds sprout forth again, and the\r\npeasants once more, like laborious ants, passed their days in the\r\nfields, toiling from morning till night, under the wind and under the\r\nrain, along the furrows of brown earth which brought forth the bread of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe year promised well for the newly married pair. The crops grew thick\r\nand strong. There were no late frosts, and the apples bursting into\r\nbloom scattered on the grass their rosy white snow which promised a hail\r\nof fruit for the autumn.\r\n\r\nCesaire toiled hard, rose early and left off work late, in order to save\r\nthe expense of a hired man.\r\n\r\nHis wife said to him sometimes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll make yourself ill in the long run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. I'm a good judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless one evening he came home so fatigued that he had to get to\r\nbed without supper. He rose up next morning at the usual hour, but he\r\ncould not eat, in spite of his fast on the previous night, and he had to\r\ncome back to the house in the middle of the afternoon in order to go to\r\nbed again. In the course of the night he began to cough; he turned round\r\non his straw couch, feverish, with his forehead burning, his tongue dry\r\nand his throat parched by a burning thirst.\r\n\r\nHowever, at daybreak he went toward his grounds, but next morning the\r\ndoctor had to be sent for and pronounced him very ill with inflammation\r\nof the lungs.\r\n\r\nAnd he no longer left the dark recess in which he slept. He could be\r\nheard coughing, gasping and tossing about in this hole. In order to see\r\nhim, to give his medicine and to apply cupping-glasses they had to-bring\r\na candle to the entrance. Then one could see his narrow head with his\r\nlong matted beard underneath a thick lacework of spiders' webs, which\r\nhung and floated when stirred by the air. And the hands of the sick man\r\nseemed dead under the dingy sheets.\r\n\r\nCeleste watched him with restless activity, made him take physic,\r\napplied blisters to him, went back and forth in the house, while old\r\nAmable remained at the edge of his loft, watching at a distance the\r\ngloomy cavern where his son lay dying. He did not come near him, through\r\nhatred of the wife, sulking like an ill-tempered dog.\r\n\r\nSix more days passed, then one morning, as Celeste, who now slept on the\r\nground on two loose bundles of straw, was going to see whether her man\r\nwas better, she no longer heard his rapid breathing from the interior of\r\nhis recess. Terror stricken, she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell Cesaire, what sort of a night had you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer. She put out her hand to touch him, and the flesh on\r\nhis face felt cold as ice. She uttered a great cry, the long cry of a\r\nwoman overpowered with fright. He was dead.\r\n\r\nAt this cry the deaf old man appeared at the top of his ladder, and when\r\nhe saw Celeste rushing to call for help, he quickly descended, placed\r\nhis hand on his son's face, and suddenly realizing what had happened,\r\nwent to shut the door from the inside, to prevent the wife from re-\r\nentering and resuming possession of the dwelling, since his son was no\r\nlonger living.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down on a chair by the dead man's side.\r\n\r\nSome of the neighbors arrived, called out and knocked. He did not hear\r\nthem. One of them broke the glass of the window and jumped into the\r\nroom. Others followed. The door was opened again and Celeste reappeared,\r\nall in tears, with swollen face and bloodshot eyes. Then old Amable,\r\nvanquished, without uttering a word, climbed back to his loft.\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place next morning. Then, after the ceremony, the\r\nfather-in-law and the daughter-in-law found themselves alone in the\r\nfarmhouse with the child.\r\n\r\nIt was the usual dinner hour. She lighted the fire, made some soup and\r\nplaced the plates on the table, while the old man sat on the chair\r\nwaiting without appearing to look at her. When the meal was ready she\r\nbawled in his ear\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, daddy, you must eat.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose up, took his seat at the end of the\r\ntable, emptied his soup bowl, masticated his bread and butter, drank his\r\ntwo glasses of cider and then took himself off.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those warm days, one of those enjoyable days when life\r\nferments, pulsates, blooms all over the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nOld Amable pursued a little path across the fields. He looked at the\r\nyoung wheat and the young oats, thinking that his son was now under the\r\nearth, his poor boy! He walked along wearily, dragging his legs after\r\nhim in a limping fashion. And, as he was all alone in the plain, all\r\nalone under the blue sky, in the midst of the growing crops, all alone\r\nwith the larks which he saw hovering above his head, without hearing\r\ntheir light song, he began to weep as he proceeded on his way.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down beside a pond and remained there till evening, gazing\r\nat the little birds that came there to drink. Then, as the night was\r\nfalling, he returned to the house, supped without saying a word and\r\nclimbed up to his loft. And his life went on as in the past. Nothing was\r\nchanged, except that his son Cesaire slept in the cemetery.\r\n\r\nWhat could he, an old man, do? He could work no longer; he was now good\r\nfor nothing except to swallow the soup prepared by his daughter-in-law.\r\nAnd he ate it in silence, morning and evening, watching with an eye of\r\nrage the little boy also taking soup, right opposite him, at the other\r\nside of the table. Then he would go out, prowl about the fields after\r\nthe fashion of a vagabond, hiding behind the barns where he would sleep\r\nfor an hour or two as if he were afraid of being seen and then come back\r\nat the approach of night.\r\n\r\nBut Celeste's mind began to be occupied by graver anxieties. The farm\r\nneeded a man to look after it and cultivate it. Somebody should be there\r\nalways to go through the fields, not a mere hired laborer, but a regular\r\nfarmer, a master who understood the business and would take an interest\r\nin the farm. A lone woman could not manage the farming, watch the price\r\nof corn and direct the sale and purchase of cattle. Then ideas came into\r\nher head, simple practical ideas, which she had turned over in her head\r\nat night. She could not marry again before the end of the year, and it\r\nwas necessary at once to take care of pressing interests, immediate\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nOnly one man could help her out of her difficulties, Victor Lecoq, the\r\nfather of her child. He was strong and understood farming; with a little\r\nmoney in his pocket he would make an excellent cultivator. She was aware\r\nof his skill, having known him while he was working on her parents'\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nSo one morning, seeing him passing along the road with a cart of manure,\r\nshe went out to meet him. When he perceived her, he drew up his horses\r\nand she said to him as if she had met him the night before:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morrow, Victor\xe2\x80\x94are you quite well, the same as ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm quite well, the same as ever\xe2\x80\x94and how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I'd be all right, only that I'm alone in the house, which bothers\r\nme on account of the farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they remained chatting for a long time, leaning against the wheel\r\nof the heavy cart. The man every now and then lifted up his cap to\r\nscratch his forehead and began thinking, while she, with flushed cheeks,\r\nwent on talking warmly, told him about her views, her plans; her\r\nprojects for the future. At last he said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened her hand like a countryman clinching a bargain and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it agreed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed her outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis agreed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's settled, then, for next Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's settled for next Sunday\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-morning, Victor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Madame Houlbreque.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nThis particular Sunday was the day of the village festival, the annual\r\nfestival in honor of the patron saint, which in Normandy is called the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nFor the last eight days quaint-looking vehicles in which live the\r\nfamilies of strolling fair exhibitors, lottery managers, keepers of\r\nshooting galleries and other forms of amusement or exhibitors of\r\ncuriosities whom the peasants call \xe2\x80\x9cwonder-makers\xe2\x80\x9d could be seen coming\r\nalong the roads drawn slowly by gray or sorrel horses.\r\n\r\nThe dirty wagons with their floating curtains, accompanied by a\r\nmelancholy-looking dog, who trotted, with his head down, between the\r\nwheels, drew up one after the other on the green in front of the town\r\nhall. Then a tent was erected in front of each ambulant abode, and\r\ninside this tent could be seen, through the holes in the canvas,\r\nglittering things which excited the envy or the curiosity of the village\r\nyoungsters.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the morning of the fete arrived all the booths were opened,\r\ndisplaying their splendors of glass or porcelain, and the peasants on\r\ntheir way to mass looked with genuine satisfaction at these modest shops\r\nwhich they saw again, nevertheless, each succeeding year.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon there was a crowd on the green. From every\r\nneighboring village the farmers arrived, shaken along with their wives\r\nand children in the two-wheeled open chars-a-bancs, which rattled along,\r\nswaying like cradles. They unharnessed at their friends' houses and the\r\nfarmyards were filled with strange-looking traps, gray, high, lean,\r\ncrooked, like long-clawed creatures from the depths of the sea. And each\r\nfamily, with the youngsters in front and the grown-up ones behind, came\r\nto the assembly with tranquil steps, smiling countenances and open\r\nhands, big hands, red and bony, accustomed to work and apparently tired\r\nof their temporary rest.\r\n\r\nA clown was blowing a trumpet. The barrel-organ accompanying the\r\ncarrousel sent through the air its shrill jerky notes. The lottery-wheel\r\nmade a whirring sound like that of cloth tearing, and every moment the\r\ncrack of the rifle could be heard. And the slow-moving throng passed on\r\nquietly in front of the booths resembling paste in a fluid condition,\r\nwith the motions of a flock of sheep and the awkwardness of heavy\r\nanimals who had escaped by chance.\r\n\r\nThe girls, holding one another's arms in groups of six or eight, were\r\nsinging; the youths followed them, making jokes, with their caps over\r\ntheir ears and their blouses stiffened with starch, swollen out like\r\nblue balloons.\r\n\r\nThe whole countryside was there\xe2\x80\x94masters, laboring men and women\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nOld Amable himself, wearing his old-fashioned green frock coat, had\r\nwished to see the assembly, for he never failed to attend on such an\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the lotteries, stopped in front of the shooting galleries\r\nto criticize the shots and interested himself specially in a very simple\r\ngame which consisted in throwing a big wooden ball into the open mouth\r\nof a mannikin carved and painted on a board.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Daddy Malivoire, who\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, daddy! Come and have a glass of brandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they sat down at the table of an open-air restaurant.\r\n\r\nThey drank one glass of brandy, then two, then three, and old Amable\r\nonce more began wandering through the assembly. His thoughts became\r\nslightly confused, he smiled without knowing why, he smiled in front of\r\nthe lotteries, in front of the wooden horses and especially in front of\r\nthe killing game. He remained there a long time, filled with delight,\r\nwhen he saw a holiday-maker knocking down the gendarme or the cure, two\r\nauthorities whom he instinctively distrusted. Then he went back to the\r\ninn and drank a glass of cider to cool himself. It was late, night came\r\non. A neighbor came to warn him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll get back home late for the stew, daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he set out on his way to the farmhouse. A soft shadow, the warm\r\nshadow of a spring night, was slowly descending on the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the front door he thought he saw through the window\r\nwhich was lighted up two persons in the house. He stopped, much\r\nsurprised, then he went in, and he saw Victor Lecoq seated at the table,\r\nwith a plate filled with potatoes before him, taking his supper in the\r\nvery same place where his son had sat.\r\n\r\nAnd he turned round suddenly as if he wanted to go away. The night was\r\nvery dark now. Celeste started up and shouted at him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome quick, daddy! Here's some good stew to finish off the assembly\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe complied through inertia and sat down, watching in turn the man, the\r\nwoman and the child. Then he began to eat quietly as on ordinary days.\r\n\r\nVictor Lecoq seemed quite at home, talked from time to time to Celeste,\r\ntook up the child in his lap and kissed him. And Celeste again served\r\nhim with food, poured out drink for him and appeared happy while\r\nspeaking to him. Old Amable's eyes followed them attentively, though he\r\ncould not hear what they were saying.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished supper (and he had scarcely eaten anything, there\r\nwas such a weight at his heart) he rose up, and instead of ascending to\r\nhis loft as he did every night he opened the gate of the yard and went\r\nout into the open air.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Celeste, a little uneasy, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor replied in an indifferent tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't bother yourself. He'll come back when he's tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she saw after the house, washed the plates and wiped the table,\r\nwhile the man quietly took off his clothes. Then he slipped into the\r\ndark and hollow bed in which she had slept with Cesaire.\r\n\r\nThe yard gate opened and old Amable again appeared. As soon as he\r\nentered the house he looked round on every side with the air of an old\r\ndog on the scent. He was in search of Victor Lecoq. As he did not see\r\nhim, he took the candle off the table and approached the dark niche in\r\nwhich his son had died. In the interior of it he perceived the man lying\r\nunder the bed clothes and already asleep. Then the deaf man noiselessly\r\nturned round, put back the candle and went out into the yard.\r\n\r\nCeleste had finished her work. She put her son into his bed, arranged\r\neverything and waited for her father-in-law's return before lying down\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe remained sitting on a chair, without moving her hands and with her\r\neyes fixed on vacancy.\r\n\r\nAs he did not come back, she murmured in a tone of impatience and\r\nannoyance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis good-for-nothing old man will make us burn four sous' worth of\r\ncandles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor answered from under the bed clothes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's over an hour since he went out. We ought to see whether he fell\r\nasleep on the bench outside the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll go and see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe rose up, took the light and went out, shading the light with her\r\nhand in order to see through the darkness.\r\n\r\nShe saw nothing in front of the door, nothing on the bench, nothing on\r\nthe dung heap, where the old man used sometimes to sit in hot weather.\r\n\r\nBut, just as she was on the point of going in again, she chanced to\r\nraise her eyes toward the big apple tree, which sheltered the entrance\r\nto the farmyard, and suddenly she saw two feet\xe2\x80\x94two feet at the height of\r\nher face belonging to a man who was hanging.\r\n\r\nShe uttered terrible cries:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictor! Victor! Victor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ran out in his shirt. She could not utter another word, and turning\r\naside her head so as not to see, she pointed toward the tree with her\r\noutstretched arm.\r\n\r\nNot understanding what she meant, he took the candle in order to find\r\nout, and in the midst of the foliage lit up from below he saw old Amable\r\nhanging high up with a stable-halter round his neck.\r\n\r\nA ladder was leaning against the trunk of the apple tree.\r\n\r\nVictor ran to fetch a bill-hook, climbed up the tree and cut the halter.\r\nBut the old man was already cold and his tongue protruded horribly with\r\na frightful grimace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 10.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M.

QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTENING \xe2\x80\x9cWell doctor, a little brandy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old ship's surgeon, holding out his glass, watched it as it slowly\r\nfilled with the golden liquid. Then, holding it in front of his eyes, he\r\nlet the light from the lamp stream through it, smelled it, tasted a few\r\ndrops and smacked his lips with relish. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the charming poison! Or rather the seductive murderer, the\r\ndelightful destroyer of peoples!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou people do not know it the way I do. You may have read that\r\nadmirable book entitled L'Assommoir, but you have not, as I have, seen\r\nalcohol exterminate a whole tribe of savages, a little kingdom of\r\nnegroes\xe2\x80\x94alcohol calmly unloaded by the barrel by red-bearded English\r\nseamen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight near here, in a little village in Brittany near Pont-l'Abbe, I\r\nonce witnessed a strange and terrible tragedy caused by alcohol. I was\r\nspending my vacation in a little country house left me by my father. You\r\nknow this flat coast where the wind whistles day and night, where one\r\nsees, standing or prone, these giant rocks which in the olden times were\r\nregarded as guardians, and which still retain something majestic and\r\nimposing about them. I always expect to see them come to life and start\r\nto walk across the country with the slow and ponderous tread of giants,\r\nor to unfold enormous granite wings and fly toward the paradise of the\r\nDruids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere is the sea, always ready on the slightest provocation to\r\nrise in its anger and shake its foamy mane at those bold enough to brave\r\nits wrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the men who travel on this terrible sea, which, with one motion of\r\nits green back, can overturn and swallow up their frail barks\xe2\x80\x94they go\r\nout in the little boats, day and night, hardy, weary and drunk. They are\r\noften drunk. They have a saying which says: 'When the bottle is full you\r\nsee the reef, but when it is empty you see it no more.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo into one of their huts; you will never find the father there. If you\r\nask the woman what has become of her husband, she will stretch her arms\r\nout over the dark ocean which rumbles and roars along the coast. He\r\nremained, there one night, when he had had too much to drink; so did her\r\noldest son. She has four more big, strong, fair-haired boys. Soon it\r\nwill be their time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I said, I was living in a little house near Pont-l'Abbe. I was there\r\nalone with my servant, an old sailor, and with a native family which\r\ntook care of the grounds in my absence. It consisted of three persons,\r\ntwo sisters and a man, who had married one of them, and who attended to\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA short time before Christmas my gardener's wife presented him with a\r\nboy. The husband asked me to stand as god-father. I could hardly deny\r\nthe request, and so he borrowed ten francs from me for the cost of the\r\nchristening, as he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second day of January was chosen as the date of the ceremony. For a\r\nweek the earth had been covered by an enormous white carpet of snow,\r\nwhich made this flat, low country seem vast and limitless. The ocean\r\nappeared to be black in contrast with this white plain; one could see it\r\nrolling, raging and tossing its waves as though wishing to annihilate\r\nits pale neighbor, which appeared to be dead, it was so calm, quiet and\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt nine o'clock the father, Kerandec, came to my door with his sister-\r\nin-law, the big Kermagan, and the nurse, who carried the infant wrapped\r\nup in a blanket. We started for the church. The weather was so cold that\r\nit seemed to dry up the skin and crack it open. I was thinking of the\r\npoor little creature who was being carried on ahead of us, and I said to\r\nmyself that this Breton race must surely be of iron, if their children\r\nwere able, as soon as they were born, to stand such an outing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe came to the church, but the door was closed; the priest was late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the nurse sat down on one of the steps and began to undress the\r\nchild. At first I thought there must have been some slight accident, but\r\nI saw that they were leaving the poor little fellow naked completely\r\nnaked, in the icy air. Furious at such imprudence, I protested:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why, you are crazy! You will kill the child!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman answered quietly: 'Oh, no, sir; he must wait naked before the\r\nLord.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe father and the aunt looked on undisturbed. It was the custom. If it\r\nwere not adhered to misfortune was sure to attend the little one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scolded, threatened and pleaded. I used force to try to cover the\r\nfrail creature. All was in vain. The nurse ran away from me through the\r\nsnow, and the body of the little one turned purple. I was about to leave\r\nthese brutes when I saw the priest coming across the country, followed.\r\nby the sexton and a young boy. I ran towards him and gave vent to my\r\nindignation. He showed no surprise nor did he quicken his pace in the\r\nleast. He answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What can you expect, sir? It's the custom. They all do it, and it's of\r\nno use trying to stop them.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'But at least hurry up!' I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe answered: 'But I can't go any faster.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe entered the vestry, while we remained outside on the church steps. I\r\nwas suffering. But what about the poor little creature who was howling\r\nfrom the effects of the biting cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last the door opened. He went into the church. But the poor child\r\nhad to remain naked throughout the ceremony. It was interminable. The\r\npriest stammered over the Latin words and mispronounced them horribly.\r\nHe walked slowly and with a ponderous tread. His white surplice chilled\r\nmy heart. It seemed as though, in the name of a pitiless and barbarous\r\ngod, he had wrapped himself in another kind of snow in order to torture\r\nthis little piece of humanity that suffered so from the cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally the christening was finished according to the rites and I saw\r\nthe nurse once more take the frozen, moaning child and wrap it up in the\r\nblanket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest said to me: 'Do you wish to sign the register?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurning to my gardener, I said: 'Hurry up and get home quickly so that\r\nyou can warm that child.' I gave him some advice so as to ward off, if\r\nnot too late, a bad attack of pneumonia. He promised to follow my\r\ninstructions and left with his sister-in-law and the nurse. I followed\r\nthe priest into the vestry, and when I had signed he demanded five\r\nfrancs for expenses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I had already given the father ten francs, I refused to pay twice.\r\nThe priest threatened to destroy the paper and to annul the ceremony. I,\r\nin turn, threatened him with the district attorney. The dispute was\r\nlong, and I finally paid five francs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I reached home I went down to Kerandec's to find out whether\r\neverything was all right. Neither father, nor sister-in-law, nor nurse\r\nhad yet returned. The mother, who had remained alone, was in bed,\r\nshivering with cold and starving, for she had had nothing to eat since\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Where the deuce can they have gone?' I asked. She answered without\r\nsurprise or anger, 'They're going to drink something to celebrate: It\r\nwas the custom. Then I thought, of my ten francs which were to pay the\r\nchurch and would doubtless pay for the alcohol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent some broth to the mother and ordered a good fire to be built in\r\nthe room. I was uneasy and furious and promised myself to drive out\r\nthese brutes, wondering with terror what was going to happen to the poor\r\ninfant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was already six, and they had not yet returned. I told my servant to\r\nwait for them and I went to bed. I soon fell asleep and slept like a\r\ntop. At daybreak I was awakened by my servant, who was bringing me my\r\nhot water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as my eyes were open I asked: 'How about Kerandec?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man hesitated and then stammered: 'Oh! he came back, all right,\r\nafter midnight, and so drunk that he couldn't walk, and so were Kermagan\r\nand the nurse. I guess they must have slept in a ditch, for the little\r\none died and they never even noticed it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI jumped up out of bed, crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What! The child is dead?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, sir. They brought it back to Mother Kerandec. When she saw it she\r\nbegan to cry, and now they are making her drink to console her.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What's that? They are making her drink!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, sir. I only found it out this morning. As Kerandec had no more\r\nbrandy or money, he took some wood alcohol, which monsieur gave him for\r\nthe lamp, and all four of them are now drinking that. The mother is\r\nfeeling pretty sick now.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had hastily put on some clothes, and seizing a stick, with the\r\nintention of applying it to the backs of these human beasts, I hastened\r\ntowards the gardener's house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mother was raving drunk beside the blue body of her dead baby.\r\nKerandec, the nurse, and the Kermagan woman were snoring on the floor. I\r\nhad to take care of the mother, who died towards noon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old doctor was silent. He took up the brandy-bottle and poured out\r\nanother glass. He held it up to the lamp, and the light streaming\r\nthrough it imparted to the liquid the amber color of molten topaz. With\r\none gulp he swallowed the treacherous drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER'S WIFE Said the Baron Rene du Treilles to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come and open the hunting season with me at my farm at\r\nMarinville? I shall be delighted if you will, my dear boy. In the first\r\nplace, I am all alone. It is rather a difficult ground to get at, and\r\nthe place I live in is so primitive that I can invite only my most\r\nintimate friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI accepted his invitation, and on Saturday we set off on the train going\r\nto Normandy. We alighted at a station called Almivare, and Baron Rene,\r\npointing to a carryall drawn by a timid horse and driven by a big\r\ncountryman with white hair, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is our equipage, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe driver extended his hand to his landlord, and the baron pressed it\r\nwarmly, asking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Maitre Lebrument, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the same, M'sieu le Baron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe jumped into this swinging hencoop perched on two enormous wheels, and\r\nthe young horse, after a violent swerve, started into a gallop, pitching\r\nus into the air like balls. Every fall backward on the wooden bench gave\r\nme the most dreadful pain.\r\n\r\nThe peasant kept repeating in his calm, monotonous voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there! All right all right, Moutard, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Moutard scarcely heard, and kept capering along like a goat.\r\n\r\nOur two dogs behind us, in the empty part of the hencoop, were standing\r\nup and sniffing the air of the plains, where they scented game.\r\n\r\nThe baron gazed with a sad eye into the distance at the vast Norman\r\nlandscape, undulating and melancholy, like an immense English park,\r\nwhere the farmyards, surrounded by two or four rows of trees and full of\r\ndwarfed apple trees which hid the houses, gave a vista as far as the eye\r\ncould see of forest trees, copses and shrubbery such as landscape\r\ngardeners look for in laying out the boundaries of princely estates.\r\n\r\nAnd Rene du Treilles suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love this soil; I have my very roots in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a pure Norman, tall and strong, with a slight paunch, and of the\r\nold race of adventurers who went to found kingdoms on the shores of\r\nevery ocean. He was about fifty years of age, ten years less perhaps\r\nthan the farmer who was driving us.\r\n\r\nThe latter was a lean peasant, all skin and bone, one of those men who\r\nlive a hundred years.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours' travelling over stony roads, across that green and\r\nmonotonous plain, the vehicle entered one of those orchard farmyards and\r\ndrew up before in old structure falling into decay, where an old maid-\r\nservant stood waiting beside a young fellow, who took charge of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nWe entered the farmhouse. The smoky kitchen was high and spacious. The\r\ncopper utensils and the crockery shone in the reflection of the hearth.\r\nA cat lay asleep on a chair, a dog under the table. One perceived an\r\nodor of milk, apples, smoke, that indescribable smell peculiar to old\r\nfarmhouses; the odor of the earth, of the walls, of furniture, the odor\r\nof spilled stale soup, of former wash-days and of former inhabitants,\r\nthe smell of animals and of human beings combined, of things and of\r\npersons, the odor of time, and of things that have passed away.\r\n\r\nI went out to have a look at the farmyard. It was very large, full of\r\napple trees, dwarfed and crooked, and laden with fruit which fell on the\r\ngrass around them. In this farmyard the Norman smell of apples was as\r\nstrong as that of the bloom of orange trees on the shores of the south\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nFour rows of beeches surrounded this inclosure. They were so tall that\r\nthey seemed to touch the clouds at this hour of nightfall, and their\r\nsummits, through which the night winds passed, swayed and sang a\r\nmournful, interminable song.\r\n\r\nI reentered the house.\r\n\r\nThe baron was warming his feet at the fire, and was listening to the\r\nfarmer's talk about country matters. He talked about marriages, births\r\nand deaths, then about the fall in the price of grain and the latest\r\nnews about cattle. The \xe2\x80\x9cVeularde\xe2\x80\x9d (as he called a cow that had been\r\nbought at the fair of Veules) had calved in the middle of June. The\r\ncider had not been first-class last year. Apricots were almost\r\ndisappearing from the country.\r\n\r\nThen we had dinner. It was a good rustic meal, simple and abundant, long\r\nand tranquil. And while we were dining I noticed the special kind of\r\nfriendly familiarity which had struck me from the start between the\r\nbaron and the peasant.\r\n\r\nOutside, the beeches continued sighing in the night wind, and our two\r\ndogs, shut up in a shed, were whining and howling in an uncanny fashion.\r\nThe fire was dying out in the big fireplace. The maid-servant had gone\r\nto bed. Maitre Lebrument said in his turn:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don't mind, M'sieu le Baron, I'm going to bed. I am not used to\r\nstaying up late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baron extended his hand toward him and said: \xe2\x80\x9cGo, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d in so\r\ncordial a tone that I said, as soon as the man had disappeared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is devoted to you, this farmer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter than that, my dear fellow! It is a drama, an old drama, simple\r\nand very sad, that attaches him to me. Here is the story:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that my father was colonel in a cavalry regiment. His orderly\r\nwas this young fellow, now an old man, the son of a farmer. When my\r\nfather retired from the army he took this former soldier, then about\r\nforty; as his servant. I was at that time about thirty. We were living\r\nin our old chateau of Valrenne, near Caudebec-en-Caux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this period my mother's chambermaid was one of the prettiest girls\r\nyou could see, fair-haired, slender and sprightly in manner, a genuine\r\nsoubrette of the old type that no longer exists. To-day these creatures\r\nspring up into hussies before their time. Paris, with the aid of the\r\nrailways, attracts them, calls them, takes hold of them, as soon as they\r\nare budding into womanhood, these little sluts who in old times remained\r\nsimple maid-servants. Every man passing by, as recruiting sergeants did\r\nformerly, looking for recruits, with conscripts, entices and ruins them\r\n\xe2\x80\x94these foolish lassies\xe2\x80\x94and we have now only the scum of the female sex\r\nfor servant maids, all that is dull, nasty, common and ill-formed, too\r\nugly, even for gallantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this girl was charming, and I often gave her a kiss in dark\r\ncorners; nothing more, I swear to you! She was virtuous, besides; and I\r\nhad some respect for my mother's house, which is more than can be said\r\nof the blackguards of the present day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, it happened that my man-servant, the ex-soldier, the old farmer\r\nyou have just seen, fell madly in love with this girl, perfectly daft.\r\nThe first thing we noticed was that he forgot everything, he paid no\r\nattention to anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father said incessantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'See here, Jean, what's the matter with you? Are you ill?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, no, M'sieu le Baron. There's nothing the matter with me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe grew thin; he broke glasses and let plates fall when waiting on the\r\ntable. We thought he must have been attacked by some nervous affection,\r\nand sent for the doctor, who thought he could detect symptoms of spinal\r\ndisease. Then my father, full of anxiety about his faithful man-servant,\r\ndecided to place him in a private hospital. When the poor fellow heard\r\nof my father's intentions he made a clean breast of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'M'sieu le Baron'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, my boy?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You see, the thing I want is not physic.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ha! what is it, then?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's marriage!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father turned round and stared at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What's that you say, eh?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Marriage! So, then, you jackass, you're to love.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That's how it is, M'sieu le Baron.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my father began to laugh so immoderately that my mother called out\r\nthrough the wall of the next room:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What in the world is the matter with you, Gontran?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come here, Catherine.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when she came in he told her, with tears in his eyes from sheer\r\nlaughter, that his idiot of a servant-man was lovesick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my mother, instead of laughing, was deeply affected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Who is it that you have fallen in love with, my poor fellow?' she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe answered without hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'With Louise, Madame le Baronne.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother said with the utmost gravity: 'We must try to arrange this\r\nmatter the best way we can.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Louise was sent for and questioned by my mother; and she said in\r\nreply that she knew all about Jean's liking for her, that in fact Jean\r\nhad spoken to her about it several times, but that she did not want him.\r\nShe refused to say why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd two months elapsed during which my father and mother never ceased\r\nto urge this girl to marry Jean. As she declared she was not in love\r\nwith any other man, she could not give any serious reason for her\r\nrefusal. My father at last overcame her resistance by means of a big\r\npresent of money, and started the pair of them on a farm\xe2\x80\x94this very farm.\r\nI did not see them for three years, and then I learned that Louise had\r\ndied of consumption. But my father and mother died, too, in their turn,\r\nand it was two years more before I found myself face to face with Jean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last one autumn day about the end of October the idea came into my\r\nhead to go hunting on this part of my estate, which my father had told\r\nme was full of game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo one evening, one wet evening, I arrived at this house. I was shocked\r\nto find my father's old servant with perfectly white hair, though he was\r\nnot more than forty-five or forty-six years of age. I made him dine with\r\nme, at the very table where we are now sitting. It was raining hard. We\r\ncould hear the rain battering at the roof, the walls, and the windows,\r\nflowing in a perfect deluge into the farmyard; and my dog was howling in\r\nthe shed where the other dogs are howling to-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of a sudden, when the servant-maid had gone to bed, the man said in\r\na timid voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'M'sieu le Baron.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What is it, my dear Jean?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have something to tell you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tell it, my dear Jean.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You remember Louise, my wife.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Certainly, I remember her.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, she left me a message for you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What was it?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94well, it was what you might call a confession.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ha\xe2\x80\x94and what was it about?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It was\xe2\x80\x94it was\xe2\x80\x94I'd rather, all the same, tell you nothing about it\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nI must\xe2\x80\x94I must. Well, it's this\xe2\x80\x94it wasn't consumption she died of at all.\r\nIt was grief\xe2\x80\x94well, that's the long and short of it. As soon as she came\r\nto live here after we were married, she grew thin; she changed so that\r\nyou wouldn't know her, M'sieu le Baron. She was just as I was before I\r\nmarried her, but it was just the opposite, just the opposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I sent for the doctor. He said it was her liver that was affected\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nsaid it was what he called a \xe2\x80\x9chepatic\xe2\x80\x9d complaint\xe2\x80\x94I don't know these big\r\nwords, M'sieu le Baron. Then I bought medicine for her, heaps on heaps\r\nof bottles that cost about three hundred francs. But she'd take none of\r\nthem; she wouldn't have them; she said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's no use, my poor Jean; it\r\nwouldn't do me any good.\xe2\x80\x9d I saw well that she had some hidden trouble;\r\nand then I found her one time crying, and I didn't know what to do, no,\r\nI didn't know what to do. I bought her caps, and dresses, and hair oil,\r\nand earrings. Nothing did her any good. And I saw that she was going to\r\ndie. And so one night at the end of November, one snowy night, after she\r\nhad been in bed the whole day, she told me to send for the cure. So I\r\nwent for him. As soon as he came\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Jean,' she said, 'I am going to make a confession to you. I owe it to\r\nyou, Jean. I have never been false to you, never! never, before or after\r\nyou married me. M'sieu le Cure is there, and can tell you so; he knows\r\nmy soul. Well, listen, Jean. If I am dying, it is because I was not able\r\nto console myself for leaving the chateau, because I was too fond of the\r\nyoung Baron Monsieur Rene, too fond of him, mind you, Jean, there was no\r\nharm in it! This is the thing that's killing me. When I could see him no\r\nmore I felt that I should die. If I could only have seen him, I might\r\nhave lived, only seen him, nothing more. I wish you'd tell him some day,\r\nby and by, when I am no longer here. You will tell him, swear you, will,\r\nJean\xe2\x80\x94swear it\xe2\x80\x94in the presence of M'sieu le Cure! It will console me to\r\nknow that he will know it one day, that this was the cause of my death!\r\nSwear it!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, I gave her my promise, M'sieu le Baron, and on the faith of an\r\nhonest man I have kept my word.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then he ceased speaking, his eyes filling with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! my dear boy, you can't form any idea of the emotion that\r\nfilled me when I heard this poor devil, whose wife I had killed without\r\nsuspecting it, telling me this story on that wet night in this very\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI exclaimed: 'Ah! my poor Jean! my poor Jean!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe murmured: 'Well, that's all, M'sieu le Baron. I could not help it,\r\none way or the other\xe2\x80\x94and now it's all over!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI caught his hand across the table, and I began to weep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked, 'Will you come and see her grave?' I nodded assent, for I\r\ncouldn't speak. He rose, lighted a lantern, and we walked through the\r\nblinding rain by the light of the lantern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe opened a gate, and I saw some crosses of black wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly he stopped before a marble slab and said: 'There it is,' and\r\nhe flashed the lantern close to it so that I could read the inscription:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'TO LOUISE HORTENSE MARINET, \xe2\x80\x9c'Wife of Jean-Francois Lebrument, Farmer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'SHE WAS A FAITHFUL WIFE. GOD REST HER SOUL.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe fell on our knees in the damp grass, he and I, with the lantern\r\nbetween us, and I saw the rain beating on the white marble slab. And I\r\nthought of the heart of her sleeping there in her grave. Ah! poor heart!\r\npoor heart! Since then I come here every year. And I don't know why, but\r\nI feel as if I were guilty of some crime in the presence of this man who\r\nalways looks as if he forgave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL\r\n\r\nThe peasant and the doctor stood on opposite sides of the bed, beside\r\nthe old, dying woman. She was calm and resigned and her mind quite clear\r\nas she looked at them and listened to their conversation. She was going\r\nto die, and she did not rebel at it, for her time was come, as she was\r\nninety-two.\r\n\r\nThe July sun streamed in at the window and the open door and cast its\r\nhot flames on the uneven brown clay floor, which had been stamped down\r\nby four generations of clodhoppers. The smell of the fields came in\r\nalso, driven by the sharp wind and parched by the noontide heat. The\r\ngrass-hoppers chirped themselves hoarse, and filled the country with\r\ntheir shrill noise, which was like that of the wooden toys which are\r\nsold to children at fair time.\r\n\r\nThe doctor raised his voice and said: \xe2\x80\x9cHonore, you cannot leave your\r\nmother in this state; she may die at any moment.\xe2\x80\x9d And the peasant, in\r\ngreat distress, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must get in my wheat, for it has been\r\nlying on the ground a long time, and the weather is just right for it;\r\nwhat do you say about it, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d And the dying old woman, still\r\ntormented by her Norman avariciousness, replied yes with her eyes and\r\nher forehead, and thus urged her son to get in his wheat, and to leave\r\nher to die alone.\r\n\r\nBut the doctor got angry, and, stamping his foot, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are no\r\nbetter than a brute, do you hear, and I will not allow you to do it, do\r\nyou understand? And if you must get in your wheat today, go and fetch\r\nRapet's wife and make her look after your mother; I will have it, do you\r\nunderstand me? And if you do not obey me, I will let you die like a dog,\r\nwhen you are ill in your turn; do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant, a tall, thin fellow with slow movements, who was tormented\r\nby indecision, by his fear of the doctor and his fierce love of saving,\r\nhesitated, calculated, and stammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cHow much does La Rapet charge\r\nfor attending sick people?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\ndepends upon how long she is needed. Settle it with her, by Heaven! But\r\nI want her to be here within an hour, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the man decided. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go for her,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cdon't get angry,\r\ndoctor.\xe2\x80\x9d And the latter left, calling out as he went: \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, be\r\nvery careful, you know, for I do not joke when I am angry!\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as\r\nthey were alone the peasant turned to his mother and said in a resigned\r\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and fetch La Rapet, as the man will have it. Don't\r\nworry till I get back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went out in his turn.\r\n\r\nLa Rapet, old was an old washerwoman, watched the dead and the dying of\r\nthe neighborhood, and then, as soon as she had sewn her customers into\r\nthat linen cloth from which they would emerge no more, she went and took\r\nup her iron to smooth out the linen of the living. Wrinkled like a last\r\nyear's apple, spiteful, envious, avaricious with a phenomenal avarice,\r\nbent double, as if she had been broken in half across the loins by the\r\nconstant motion of passing the iron over the linen, one might have said\r\nthat she had a kind of abnormal and cynical love of a death struggle.\r\nShe never spoke of anything but of the people she had seen die, of the\r\nvarious kinds of deaths at which she had been present, and she related\r\nwith the greatest minuteness details which were always similar, just as\r\na sportsman recounts his luck.\r\n\r\nWhen Honore Bontemps entered her cottage, he found her preparing the\r\nstarch for the collars of the women villagers, and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-\r\nevening; I hope you are pretty well, Mother Rapet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her head round to look at him, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs usual, as usual,\r\nand you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! as for me, I am as well as I could wish, but my mother is\r\nnot well.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my mother!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShe is going to turn up her toes, that's what's the matter with\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman took her hands out of the water and asked with sudden\r\nsympathy: \xe2\x80\x9cIs she as bad as all that?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor says she will not\r\nlast till morning.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen she certainly is very bad!\xe2\x80\x9d Honore hesitated,\r\nfor he wanted to make a few preparatory remarks before coming to his\r\nproposition; but as he could hit upon nothing, he made up his mind\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much will you ask to stay with her till the end? You know that I am\r\nnot rich, and I can not even afford to keep a servant girl. It is just\r\nthat which has brought my poor mother to this state\xe2\x80\x94too much worry and\r\nfatigue! She did the work of ten, in spite of her ninety-two years. You\r\ndon't find any made of that stuff nowadays!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLa Rapet answered gravely: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two prices: Forty sous by day and\r\nthree francs by night for the rich, and twenty sous by day and forty by\r\nnight for the others. You shall pay me the twenty and forty.\xe2\x80\x9d But the,\r\npeasant reflected, for he knew his mother well. He knew how tenacious of\r\nlife, how vigorous and unyielding she was, and she might last another\r\nweek, in spite of the doctor's opinion; and so he said resolutely: \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nI would rather you would fix a price for the whole time until the end. I\r\nwill take my chance, one way or the other. The doctor says she will die\r\nvery soon. If that happens, so much the better for you, and so much the\r\nworse for her, but if she holds out till to-morrow or longer, so much\r\nthe better for her and so much the worse for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse looked at the man in astonishment, for she had never treated a\r\ndeath as a speculation, and she hesitated, tempted by the idea of the\r\npossible gain, but she suspected that he wanted to play her a trick. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan say nothing until I have seen your mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen come with me and see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe washed her hands, and went with him immediately.\r\n\r\nThey did not speak on the road; she walked with short, hasty steps,\r\nwhile he strode on with his long legs, as if he were crossing a brook at\r\nevery step.\r\n\r\nThe cows lying down in the fields, overcome by the heat, raised their\r\nheads heavily and lowed feebly at the two passers-by, as if to ask them\r\nfor some green grass.\r\n\r\nWhen they got near the house, Honore Bontemps murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose it is\r\nall over?\xe2\x80\x9d And his unconscious wish that it might be so showed itself in\r\nthe sound of his voice.\r\n\r\nBut the old woman was not dead. She was lying on her back, on her\r\nwretched bed, her hands covered with a purple cotton counterpane,\r\nhorribly thin, knotty hands, like the claws of strange animals, like\r\ncrabs, half closed by rheumatism, fatigue and the work of nearly a\r\ncentury which she had accomplished.\r\n\r\nLa Rapet went up to the bed and looked at the dying woman, felt her\r\npulse, tapped her on the chest, listened to her breathing, and asked her\r\nquestions, so as to hear her speak; and then, having looked at her for\r\nsome time, she went out of the room, followed by Honore. Her decided\r\nopinion was that the old woman would not last till night. He asked:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d And the sick-nurse replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, she may last two days,\r\nperhaps three. You will have to give me six francs, everything\r\nincluded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix francs! six francs!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you out of your mind? I tell\r\nyou she cannot last more than five or six hours!\xe2\x80\x9d And they disputed\r\nangrily for some time, but as the nurse said she must go home, as the\r\ntime was going by, and as his wheat would not come to the farmyard of\r\nits own accord, he finally agreed to her terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, that is settled; six francs, including everything,\r\nuntil the corpse is taken out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went away, with long strides, to his wheat which was lying on the\r\nground under the hot sun which ripens the grain, while the sick-nurse\r\nwent in again to the house.\r\n\r\nShe had brought some work with her, for she worked without ceasing by\r\nthe side of the dead and dying, sometimes for herself, sometimes for the\r\nfamily which employed her as seamstress and paid her rather more in that\r\ncapacity. Suddenly, she asked: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you received the last sacraments,\r\nMother Bontemps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old peasant woman shook her head, and La Rapet, who was very devout,\r\ngot up quickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, is it possible? I will go and fetch the cure\xe2\x80\x9d; and she\r\nrushed off to the parsonage so quickly that the urchins in the street\r\nthought some accident had happened, when they saw her running.\r\n\r\nThe priest came immediately in his surplice, preceded by a choir boy who\r\nrang a bell to announce the passage of the Host through the parched and\r\nquiet country. Some men who were working at a distance took off their\r\nlarge hats and remained motionless until the white vestment had\r\ndisappeared behind some farm buildings; the women who were making up the\r\nsheaves stood up to make the sign of the cross; the frightened black\r\nhens ran away along the ditch until they reached a well-known hole,\r\nthrough which they suddenly disappeared, while a foal which was tied in\r\na meadow took fright at the sight of the surplice and began to gallop\r\nround and round, kicking cut every now and then. The acolyte, in his red\r\ncassock, walked quickly, and the priest, with his head inclined toward\r\none shoulder and his square biretta on his head, followed him, muttering\r\nsome prayers; while last of all came La Rapet, bent almost double as if\r\nshe wished to prostrate herself, as she walked with folded hands as they\r\ndo in church.\r\n\r\nHonore saw them pass in the distance, and he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is our priest\r\ngoing?\xe2\x80\x9d His man, who was more intelligent, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is taking the\r\nsacrament to your mother, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant was not surprised, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat may be,\xe2\x80\x9d and went on with\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nMother Bontemps confessed, received absolution and communion, and the\r\npriest took his departure, leaving the two women alone in the\r\nsuffocating room, while La Rapet began to look at the dying woman, and\r\nto ask herself whether it could last much longer.\r\n\r\nThe day was on the wane, and gusts of cooler air began to blow, causing\r\na view of Epinal, which was fastened to the wall by two pins, to flap up\r\nand down; the scanty window curtains, which had formerly been white, but\r\nwere now yellow and covered with fly-specks, looked as if they were\r\ngoing to fly off, as if they were struggling to get away, like the old\r\nwoman's soul.\r\n\r\nLying motionless, with her eyes open, she seemed to await with\r\nindifference that death which was so near and which yet delayed its\r\ncoming. Her short breathing whistled in her constricted throat. It would\r\nstop altogether soon, and there would be one woman less in the world; no\r\none would regret her.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall Honore returned, and when he went up to the bed and saw\r\nthat his mother was still alive, he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is she?\xe2\x80\x9d just as he had\r\ndone formerly when she had been ailing, and then he sent La Rapet away,\r\nsaying to her: \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning at five o'clock, without fail.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe replied: \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, at five o'clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came at daybreak, and found Honore eating his soup, which he had\r\nmade himself before going to work, and the sick-nurse asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nis your mother dead?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShe is rather better, on the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied, with a sly look out of the corner of his eyes. And he went out.\r\n\r\nLa Rapet, seized with anxiety, went up to the dying woman, who remained\r\nin the same state, lethargic and impassive, with her eyes open and her\r\nhands clutching the counterpane. The nurse perceived that this might go\r\non thus for two days, four days, eight days, and her avaricious mind was\r\nseized with fear, while she was furious at the sly fellow who had\r\ntricked her, and at the woman who would not die.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she began to work, and waited, looking intently at the\r\nwrinkled face of Mother Bontemps. When Honore returned to breakfast he\r\nseemed quite satisfied and even in a bantering humor. He was decidedly\r\ngetting in his wheat under very favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nLa Rapet was becoming exasperated; every minute now seemed to her so\r\nmuch time and money stolen from her. She felt a mad inclination to take\r\nthis old woman, this, headstrong old fool, this obstinate old wretch,\r\nand to stop that short, rapid breath, which was robbing her of her time\r\nand money, by squeezing her throat a little. But then she reflected on\r\nthe danger of doing so, and other thoughts came into her head; so she\r\nwent up to the bed and said: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever seen the Devil?\xe2\x80\x9d Mother\r\nBontemps murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the sick-nurse began to talk and to tell her tales which were\r\nlikely to terrify the weak mind of the dying woman. Some minutes before\r\none dies the Devil appears, she said, to all who are in the death\r\nthroes. He has a broom in his hand, a saucepan on his head, and he\r\nutters loud cries. When anybody sees him, all is over, and that person\r\nhas only a few moments longer to live. She then enumerated all those to\r\nwhom the Devil had appeared that year: Josephine Loisel, Eulalie Ratier,\r\nSophie Padaknau, Seraphine Grospied.\r\n\r\nMother Bontemps, who had at last become disturbed in mind, moved about,\r\nwrung her hands, and tried to turn her head to look toward the end of\r\nthe room. Suddenly La Rapet disappeared at the foot of the bed. She took\r\na sheet out of the cupboard and wrapped herself up in it; she put the\r\niron saucepan on her head, so that its three short bent feet rose up\r\nlike horns, and she took a broom in her right hand and a tin pail in her\r\nleft, which she threw up suddenly, so that it might fall to the ground\r\nnoisily.\r\n\r\nWhen it came down, it certainly made a terrible noise. Then, climbing\r\nupon a chair, the nurse lifted up the curtain which hung at the bottom\r\nof the bed, and showed herself, gesticulating and uttering shrill cries\r\ninto the iron saucepan which covered her face, while she menaced the old\r\npeasant woman, who was nearly dead, with her broom.\r\n\r\nTerrified, with an insane expression on her face, the dying woman made a\r\nsuperhuman effort to get up and escape; she even got her shoulders and\r\nchest out of bed; then she fell back with a deep sigh. All was over, and\r\nLa Rapet calmly put everything back into its place; the broom into the\r\ncorner by the cupboard the sheet inside it, the saucepan on the hearth,\r\nthe pail on the floor, and the chair against the wall. Then, with\r\nprofessional movements, she closed the dead woman's large eyes, put a\r\nplate on the bed and poured some holy water into it, placing in it the\r\ntwig of boxwood that had been nailed to the chest of drawers, and\r\nkneeling down, she fervently repeated the prayers for the dead, which\r\nshe knew by heart, as a matter of business.\r\n\r\nAnd when Honore returned in the evening he found her praying, and he\r\ncalculated immediately that she had made twenty sows out of him, for she\r\nhad only spent three days and one night there, which made five francs\r\naltogether, instead of the six which he owed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNIPE\r\n\r\nOld Baron des Ravots had for forty years been the champion sportsman of\r\nhis province. But a stroke of paralysis had kept him in his chair for\r\nthe last five or six years. He could now only shoot pigeons from the\r\nwindow of his drawing-room or from the top of his high doorsteps.\r\n\r\nHe spent his time in reading.\r\n\r\nHe was a good-natured business man, who had much of the literary spirit\r\nof a former century. He worshipped anecdotes, those little risque\r\nanecdotes, and also true stories of events that happened in his\r\nneighborhood. As soon as a friend came to see him he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anything new?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he knew how to worm out information like an examining lawyer.\r\n\r\nOn sunny days he had his large reclining chair, similar to a bed,\r\nwheeled to the hall door. A man servant behind him held his guns, loaded\r\nthem and handed them to his master. Another valet, hidden in the bushes,\r\nlet fly a pigeon from time to time at irregular intervals, so that the\r\nbaron should be unprepared and be always on the watch.\r\n\r\nAnd from morning till night he fired at the birds, much annoyed if he\r\nwere taken by surprise and laughing till he cried when the animal fell\r\nstraight to the earth or, turned over in some comical and unexpected\r\nmanner. He would turn to the man who was loading the gun and say, almost\r\nchoking with laughter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid that get him, Joseph? Did you see how he fell?\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph invariably\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, monsieur le baron never misses them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn autumn, when the shooting season opened, he invited his friends as he\r\nhad done formerly, and loved to hear them firing in the distance. He\r\ncounted the shots and was pleased when they followed each other rapidly.\r\nAnd in the evening he made each guest give a faithful account of his\r\nday. They remained three hours at table telling about their sport.\r\n\r\nThey were strange and improbable adventures in which the romancing\r\nspirit of the sportsmen delighted. Some of them were memorable stories\r\nand were repeated regularly. The story of a rabbit that little Vicomte\r\nde Bourril had missed in his vestibule convulsed them with laughter each\r\nyear anew. Every five minutes a fresh speaker would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard 'birr! birr!' and a magnificent covey rose at ten paces from\r\nme. I aimed. Pif! paf! and I saw a shower, a veritable shower of birds.\r\nThere were seven of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they all went into raptures, amazed, but reciprocally credulous.\r\n\r\nBut there was an old custom in the house called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Story of the\r\nSnipe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhenever this queen of birds was in season the same ceremony took place\r\nat each dinner. As they worshipped this incomparable bird, each guest\r\nate one every evening, but the heads were all left in the dish.\r\n\r\nThen the baron, acting the part of a bishop, had a plate brought to him\r\ncontaining a little fat, and he carefully anointed the precious heads,\r\nholding them by the tip of their slender, needle-like beak. A lighted\r\ncandle was placed beside him and everyone was silent in an anxiety of\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nThen he took one of the heads thus prepared, stuck a pin through it and\r\nstuck the pin on a cork, keeping the whole contrivance steady by means\r\nof little crossed sticks, and carefully placed this object on the neck\r\nof a bottle in the manner of a tourniquet.\r\n\r\nAll the guests counted simultaneously in a loud tone\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne-two-three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the baron with a fillip of the finger made this toy whirl round.\r\n\r\nThe guest to whom the long beak pointed when the head stopped became the\r\npossessor of all the heads, a feast fit for a king, which made his\r\nneighbors look askance.\r\n\r\nHe took them one by one and toasted them over the candle. The grease\r\nsputtered, the roasting flesh smoked and the lucky winner ate the head,\r\nholding it by the beak and uttering exclamations of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAnd at each head the diners, raising their glasses, drank to his health.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished the last head he was obliged, at the baron's\r\norders, to tell an anecdote to compensate the disappointed ones.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILL\r\n\r\nI knew that tall young fellow, Rene de Bourneval. He was an agreeable\r\nman, though rather melancholy and seemed prejudiced against everything,\r\nwas very skeptical, and he could with a word tear down social hypocrisy.\r\nHe would often say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no honorable men, or, at least, they are only relatively so\r\nwhen compared with those lower than themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had two brothers, whom he never saw, the Messieurs de Courcils. I\r\nalways supposed they were by another father, on account of the\r\ndifference in the name. I had frequently heard that the family had a\r\nstrange history, but did not know the details. As I took a great liking\r\nto Rene we soon became intimate friends, and one evening, when I had\r\nbeen dining with him alone, I asked him, by chance: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a son of\r\nthe first or second marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d He grew rather pale, and then flushed,\r\nand did not speak for a few moments; he was visibly embarrassed. Then he\r\nsmiled in the melancholy, gentle manner, which was peculiar to him, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, if it will not weary you, I can give you some very\r\nstrange particulars about my life. I know that you are a sensible man,\r\nso I do not fear that our friendship will suffer by my revelations; and\r\nshould it suffer, I should not care about having you for my friend any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother, Madame de Courcils, was a poor little, timid woman, whom her\r\nhusband had married for the sake of her fortune, and her whole life was\r\none of martyrdom. Of a loving, timid, sensitive disposition, she was\r\nconstantly being ill-treated by the man who ought to have been my\r\nfather, one of those boors called country gentlemen. A month after their\r\nmarriage he was living a licentious life and carrying on liaisons with\r\nthe wives and daughters of his tenants. This did not prevent him from\r\nhaving three children by his wife, that is, if you count me in. My\r\nmother said nothing, and lived in that noisy house like a little mouse.\r\nSet aside, unnoticed, nervous, she looked at people with her bright,\r\nuneasy, restless eyes, the eyes of some terrified creature which can\r\nnever shake off its fear. And yet she was pretty, very pretty and fair,\r\na pale blonde, as if her hair had lost its color through her constant\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong the friends of Monsieur de Courcils who constantly came to her\r\nchateau, there was an ex-cavalry officer, a widower, a man who was\r\nfeared, who was at the same time tender and violent, capable of the most\r\ndetermined resolves, Monsieur de Bourneval, whose name I bear. He was a\r\ntall, thin man, with a heavy black mustache. I am very like him. He was\r\na man who had read a great deal, and his ideas were not like those of\r\nmost of his class. His great-grandmother had been a friend of J. J.\r\nRousseau's, and one might have said that he had inherited something of\r\nthis ancestral connection. He knew the Contrat Social, and the Nouvelle\r\nHeloise by heart, and all those philosophical books which prepared in\r\nadvance the overthrow of our old usages, prejudices, superannuated laws\r\nand imbecile morality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that he loved my mother, and she loved him, but their liaison\r\nwas carried on so secretly that no one guessed at its existence. The\r\npoor, neglected, unhappy woman must have clung to him in despair, and in\r\nher intimacy with him must have imbibed all his ways of thinking,\r\ntheories of free thought, audacious ideas of independent love; but being\r\nso timid she never ventured to speak out, and it was all driven back,\r\ncondensed, shut up in her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy two brothers were very hard towards her, like their father, and\r\nnever gave her a caress, and, accustomed to seeing her count for nothing\r\nin the house, they treated her rather like a servant. I was the only one\r\nof her sons who really loved her and whom she loved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she died I was seventeen, and I must add, in order that you may\r\nunderstand what follows, that a lawsuit between my father and mother had\r\nbeen decided in my mother's favor, giving her the bulk of the property,\r\nand, thanks to the tricks of the law, and the intelligent devotion of a\r\nlawyer to her interests, the right to make her will in favor of whom she\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were told that there was a will at the lawyer's office and were\r\ninvited to be present at the reading of it. I can remember it, as if it\r\nwere yesterday. It was an imposing scene, dramatic, burlesque and\r\nsurprising, occasioned by the posthumous revolt of that dead woman, by\r\nthe cry for liberty, by the demands of that martyred one who had been\r\ncrushed by our oppression during her lifetime and who, from her closed\r\ntomb, uttered a despairing appeal for independence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who believed he was my father, a stout, ruddy-faced man, who\r\nlooked like a butcher, and my brothers, two great fellows of twenty and\r\ntwenty-two, were waiting quietly in their chairs. Monsieur de Bourneval,\r\nwho had been invited to be present, came in and stood behind me. He was\r\nvery pale and bit his mustache, which was turning gray. No doubt he was\r\nprepared for what was going to happen. The lawyer double-locked the door\r\nand began to read the will, after having opened, in our presence, the\r\nenvelope, sealed with red wax, of the contents of which he was\r\nignorant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friend stopped talking abruptly, and rising, took from his writing-\r\ntable an old paper, unfolded it, kissed it and then continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nthe will of my beloved mother:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I, the undersigned, Anne Catherine-Genevieve-Mathilde de Croixluce,\r\nthe legitimate wife of Leopold-Joseph Gontran de Councils sound in body\r\nand mind, here express my last wishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI first of all ask God, and then my dear son Rene to pardon me for the\r\nact I am about to commit. I believe that my child's heart is great\r\nenough to understand me, and to forgive me. I have suffered my whole\r\nlife long. I was married out of calculation, then despised,\r\nmisunderstood, oppressed and constantly deceived by my husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I forgive him, but I owe him nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My elder sons never loved me, never petted me, scarcely treated me as\r\na mother, but during my whole life I did my duty towards them, and I owe\r\nthem nothing more after my death. The ties of blood cannot exist without\r\ndaily and constant affection. An ungrateful son is less than a stranger;\r\nhe is a culprit, for he has no right to be indifferent towards his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I have always trembled before men, before their unjust laws, their\r\ninhuman customs, their shameful prejudices. Before God, I have no longer\r\nany fear. Dead, I fling aside disgraceful hypocrisy; I dare to speak my\r\nthoughts, and to avow and to sign the secret of my heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I therefore leave that part of my fortune of which the law allows me\r\nto dispose, in trust to my dear lover, Pierre-Germer-Simon de Bourneval,\r\nto revert afterwards to our dear son Rene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'(This bequest is specified more precisely in a deed drawn up by a\r\nnotary.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And I declare before the Supreme Judge who hears me, that I should\r\nhave cursed heaven and my own existence, if I had not found the deep,\r\ndevoted, tender, unshaken affection of my lover; if I had not felt in\r\nhis arms that the Creator made His creatures to love, sustain and\r\nconsole each other, and to weep together in the hours of sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Monsieur de Courcils is the father of my two eldest sons; Rene, alone,\r\nowes his life to Monsieur de Bourneval. I pray the Master of men and of\r\ntheir destinies, to place father and son above social prejudices, to\r\nmake them love each other until they die, and to love me also in my\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'These are my last thoughts, and my last wish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'MATHILDE DE CROIXLUCE.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Courcils had risen and he cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It is the will of a madwoman.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Monsieur de Bourneval stepped forward and said in a loud,\r\npenetrating voice: 'I, Simon de Bourneval, solemnly declare that this\r\nwriting contains nothing but the strict truth, and I am ready to prove\r\nit by letters which I possess.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn hearing that, Monsieur de Courcils went up to him, and I thought\r\nthat they were going to attack each other. There they stood, both of\r\nthem tall, one stout and the other thin, both trembling. My mother's\r\nhusband stammered out: 'You are a worthless wretch!' And the other\r\nreplied in a loud, dry voice: 'We will meet elsewhere, monsieur. I\r\nshould have already slapped your ugly face and challenged you long since\r\nif I had not, before everything else, thought of the peace of mind\r\nduring her lifetime of that poor woman whom you caused to suffer so\r\ngreatly.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, turning to me, he said: 'You are my son; will you come with me? I\r\nhave no right to take you away, but I shall assume it, if you are\r\nwilling to come with me: I shook his hand without replying, and we went\r\nout together. I was certainly three parts mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo days later Monsieur de Bourneval killed Monsieur de Courcils in a\r\nduel. My brothers, to avoid a terrible scandal, held their tongues. I\r\noffered them and they accepted half the fortune which my mother had left\r\nme. I took my real father's name, renouncing that which the law gave me,\r\nbut which was not really mine. Monsieur de Bourneval died three years\r\nlater and I am still inconsolable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose from his chair, walked up and down the room, and, standing in\r\nfront of me, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I say that my mother's will was one of the most beautiful, the\r\nmost loyal, as well as one of the grandest acts that a woman could\r\nperform. Do you not think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI held out both hands to him, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI most certainly do, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER SCHNAFFS' ADVENTURE\r\n\r\nEver since he entered France with the invading army Walter Schnaffs had\r\nconsidered himself the most unfortunate of men. He was large, had\r\ndifficulty in walking, was short of breath and suffered frightfully with\r\nhis feet, which were very flat and very fat. But he was a peaceful,\r\nbenevolent man, not warlike or sanguinary, the father of four children\r\nwhom he adored, and married to a little blonde whose little\r\ntendernesses, attentions and kisses he recalled with despair every\r\nevening. He liked to rise late and retire early, to eat good things in a\r\nleisurely manner and to drink beer in the saloon. He reflected, besides,\r\nthat all that is sweet in existence vanishes with life, and he\r\nmaintained in his heart a fearful hatred, instinctive as well as\r\nlogical, for cannon, rifles, revolvers and swords, but especially for\r\nbayonets, feeling that he was unable to dodge this dangerous weapon\r\nrapidly enough to protect his big paunch.\r\n\r\nAnd when night fell and he lay on the ground, wrapped in his cape beside\r\nhis comrades who were snoring, he thought long and deeply about those he\r\nhad left behind and of the dangers in his path. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he were killed what\r\nwould become of the little ones? Who would provide for them and bring\r\nthem up?\xe2\x80\x9d Just at present they were not rich, although he had borrowed\r\nwhen he left so as to leave them some money. And Walter Schnaffs wept\r\nwhen he thought of all this.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of a battle his legs became so weak that he would have\r\nfallen if he had not reflected that the entire army would pass over his\r\nbody. The whistling of the bullets gave him gooseflesh.\r\n\r\nFor months he had lived thus in terror and anguish.\r\n\r\nHis company was marching on Normandy, and one day he was sent to\r\nreconnoitre with a small detachment, simply to explore a portion of the\r\nterritory and to return at once. All seemed quiet in the country;\r\nnothing indicated an armed resistance.\r\n\r\nBut as the Prussians were quietly descending into a little valley\r\ntraversed by deep ravines a sharp fusillade made them halt suddenly,\r\nkilling twenty of their men, and a company of sharpshooters, suddenly\r\nemerging from a little wood as large as your hand, darted forward with\r\nbayonets at the end of their rifles.\r\n\r\nWalter Schnaffs remained motionless at first, so surprised and\r\nbewildered that he did not even think of making his escape. Then he was\r\nseized with a wild desire to run away, but he remembered at once that he\r\nran like a tortoise compared with those thin Frenchmen, who came\r\nbounding along like a lot of goats. Perceiving a large ditch full of\r\nbrushwood covered with dead leaves about six paces in front of him, he\r\nsprang into it with both feet together, without stopping to think of its\r\ndepth, just as one jumps from a bridge into the river.\r\n\r\nHe fell like an arrow through a thick layer of vines and thorny brambles\r\nthat tore his face and hands and landed heavily in a sitting posture on\r\na bed of stones. Raising his eyes, he saw the sky through the hole he\r\nhad made in falling through. This aperture might betray him, and he\r\ncrawled along carefully on hands and knees at the bottom of this ditch\r\nbeneath the covering of interlacing branches, going as fast as he could\r\nand getting away from the scene of the skirmish. Presently he stopped\r\nand sat down, crouched like a hare amid the tall dry grass.\r\n\r\nHe heard firing and cries and groans going on for some time. Then the\r\nnoise of fighting grew fainter and ceased. All was quiet and silent.\r\n\r\nSuddenly something stirred, beside him. He was frightfully startled. It\r\nwas a little bird which had perched on a branch and was moving the dead\r\nleaves. For almost an hour Walter Schnaffs' heart beat loud and rapidly.\r\n\r\nNight fell, filling the ravine with its shadows. The soldier began to\r\nthink. What was he to do? What was to become of him? Should he rejoin\r\nthe army? But how? By what road? And he began over again the horrible\r\nlife of anguish, of terror, of fatigue and suffering that he had led\r\nsince the commencement of the war. No! He no longer had the courage! He\r\nwould not have the energy necessary to endure long marches and to face\r\nthe dangers to which one was exposed at every moment.\r\n\r\nBut what should he do? He could not stay in this ravine in concealment\r\nuntil the end of hostilities. No, indeed! If it were not for having to\r\neat, this prospect would not have daunted him greatly. But he had to\r\neat, to eat every day.\r\n\r\nAnd here he was, alone, armed and in uniform, on the enemy's territory,\r\nfar from those who would protect him. A shiver ran over him.\r\n\r\nAll at once he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were only a prisoner!\xe2\x80\x9d And his heart\r\nquivered with a longing, an intense desire to be taken prisoner by the\r\nFrench. A prisoner, he would be saved, fed, housed, sheltered from\r\nbullets and swords, without any apprehension whatever, in a good, well-\r\nkept prison. A prisoner! What a dream:\r\n\r\nHis resolution was formed at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will constitute myself a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, determined to put this plan into execution without a moment's\r\ndelay. But he stood motionless, suddenly a prey to disturbing\r\nreflections and fresh terrors.\r\n\r\nWhere would he make himself a prisoner and how? In What direction? And\r\nfrightful pictures, pictures of death came into his mind.\r\n\r\nHe would run terrible danger in venturing alone through the country with\r\nhis pointed helmet.\r\n\r\nSupposing he should meet some peasants. These peasants seeing a Prussian\r\nwho had lost his way, an unprotected Prussian, would kill him as if he\r\nwere a stray dog! They would murder him with their forks, their picks,\r\ntheir scythes and their shovels. They would make a stew of him, a pie,\r\nwith the frenzy of exasperated, conquered enemies.\r\n\r\nIf he should meet the sharpshooters! These sharpshooters, madmen without\r\nlaw or discipline, would shoot him just for amusement to pass an hour;\r\nit would make them laugh to see his head. And he fancied he was already\r\nleaning against a wall in-front of four rifles whose little black\r\napertures seemed to be gazing at him.\r\n\r\nSupposing he should meet the French army itself. The vanguard would take\r\nhim for a scout, for some bold and sly trooper who had set off alone to\r\nreconnoitre, and they would fire at him. And he could already hear, in\r\nimagination, the irregular shots of soldiers lying in the brush, while\r\nhe himself, standing in the middle of the field, was sinking to the\r\nearth, riddled like a sieve with bullets which he felt piercing his\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nHe sat down again in despair. His situation seemed hopeless.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a dark, black and silent night. He no longer budged,\r\ntrembling at all the slight and unfamiliar sounds that occur at night.\r\nThe sound of a rabbit crouching at the edge of his burrow almost made\r\nhim run. The cry of an owl caused him positive anguish, giving him a\r\nnervous shock that pained like a wound. He opened his big eyes as wide\r\nas possible to try and see through the darkness, and he imagined every\r\nmoment that he heard someone walking close beside him.\r\n\r\nAfter interminable hours in which he suffered the tortures of the\r\ndamned, he noticed through his leafy cover that the sky was becoming\r\nbright. He at once felt an intense relief. His limbs stretched out,\r\nsuddenly relaxed, his heart quieted down, his eyes closed; he fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke the sun appeared to be almost at the meridian. It must be\r\nnoon. No sound disturbed the gloomy silence. Walter Schnaffs noticed\r\nthat he was exceedingly hungry.\r\n\r\nHe yawned, his mouth watering at the thought of sausage, the good\r\nsausage the soldiers have, and he felt a gnawing at his stomach.\r\n\r\nHe rose from the ground, walked a few steps, found that his legs were\r\nweak and sat down to reflect. For two or three hours he again considered\r\nthe pros and cons, changing his mind every moment, baffled, unhappy,\r\ntorn by the most conflicting motives.\r\n\r\nFinally he had an idea that seemed logical and practical. It was to\r\nwatch for a villager passing by alone, unarmed and with no dangerous\r\ntools of his trade, and to run to him and give himself up, making him\r\nunderstand that he was surrendering.\r\n\r\nHe took off his helmet, the point of which might betray him, and put his\r\nhead out of his hiding place with the utmost caution.\r\n\r\nNo solitary pedestrian could be perceived on the horizon. Yonder, to the\r\nright, smoke rose from the chimney of a little village, smoke from\r\nkitchen fires! And yonder, to the left, he saw at the end of an avenue\r\nof trees a large turreted chateau. He waited till evening, suffering\r\nfrightfully from hunger, seeing nothing but flights of crows, hearing\r\nnothing but the silent expostulation of his empty stomach.\r\n\r\nAnd darkness once more fell on him.\r\n\r\nHe stretched himself out in his retreat and slept a feverish sleep,\r\nhaunted by nightmares, the sleep of a starving man.\r\n\r\nDawn again broke above his head and he began to make his observations.\r\nBut the landscape was deserted as on the previous day, and a new fear\r\ncame into Walter Schnaffs' mind\xe2\x80\x94the fear of death by hunger! He pictured\r\nhimself lying at full length on his back at the bottom of his hiding\r\nplace, with his two eyes closed, and animals, little creatures of all\r\nkinds, approached and began to feed on his dead body, attacking it all\r\nover at once, gliding beneath his clothing to bite his cold flesh, and a\r\nbig crow pecked out his eyes with its sharp beak.\r\n\r\nHe almost became crazy, thinking he was going to faint and would not be\r\nable to walk. And he was just preparing to rush off to the village,\r\ndetermined to dare anything, to brave everything, when he perceived\r\nthree peasants walking to the fields with their forks across their\r\nshoulders, and he dived back into his hiding place.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as it grew dark he slowly emerged from the ditch and started\r\noff, stooping and fearful, with beating heart, towards the distant\r\nchateau, preferring to go there rather than to the village, which seemed\r\nto him as formidable as a den of tigers.\r\n\r\nThe lower windows were brilliantly lighted. One of them was open and\r\nfrom it escaped a strong odor of roast meat, an odor which suddenly\r\npenetrated to the olfactories and to the stomach of Walter Schnaffs,\r\ntickling his nerves, making him breathe quickly, attracting him\r\nirresistibly and inspiring his heart with the boldness of desperation.\r\n\r\nAnd abruptly, without reflection, he placed himself, helmet on head, in\r\nfront of the window.\r\n\r\nEight servants were at dinner around a large table. But suddenly one of\r\nthe maids sat there, her mouth agape, her eyes fixed and letting fall\r\nher glass. They all followed the direction of her gaze.\r\n\r\nThey saw the enemy!\r\n\r\nGood God! The Prussians were attacking the chateau!\r\n\r\nThere was a shriek, only one shriek made up of eight shrieks uttered in\r\neight different keys, a terrific screaming of terror, then a tumultuous\r\nrising from their seats, a jostling, a scrimmage and a wild rush to the\r\ndoor at the farther end. Chairs fell over, the men knocked the women\r\ndown and walked over them. In two seconds the room was empty, deserted,\r\nand the table, covered with eatables, stood in front of Walter Schnaffs,\r\nlost in amazement and still standing at the window.\r\n\r\nAfter some moments of hesitation he climbed in at the window and\r\napproached the table. His fierce hunger caused him to tremble as if he\r\nwere in a fever, but fear still held him back, numbed him. He listened.\r\nThe entire house seemed to shudder. Doors closed, quick steps ran along\r\nthe floor above. The uneasy Prussian listened eagerly to these confused\r\nsounds. Then he heard dull sounds, as though bodies were falling to the\r\nground at the foot of the walls, human beings jumping from the first\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThen all motion, all disturbance ceased, and the great chateau became as\r\nsilent as the grave.\r\n\r\nWalter Schnaffs sat down before a clean plate and began to eat. He took\r\ngreat mouthfuls, as if he feared he might be interrupted before he had\r\nswallowed enough. He shovelled the food into his mouth, open like a\r\ntrap, with both hands, and chunks of food went into his stomach,\r\nswelling out his throat as it passed down. Now and then he stopped,\r\nalmost ready to burst like a stopped-up pipe. Then he would take the\r\ncider jug and wash down his esophagus as one washes out a clogged rain\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nHe emptied all the plates, all the dishes and all the bottles. Then,\r\nintoxicated with drink and food, besotted, red in the face, shaken by\r\nhiccoughs, his mind clouded and his speech thick, he unbuttoned his\r\nuniform in order to breathe or he could not have taken a step. His eyes\r\nclosed, his mind became torpid; he leaned his heavy forehead on his\r\nfolded arms on the table and gradually lost all consciousness of things\r\nand events.\r\n\r\nThe last quarter of the moon above the trees in the park shed a faint\r\nlight on the landscape. It was the chill hour that precedes the dawn.\r\n\r\nNumerous silent shadows glided among the trees and occasionally a blade\r\nof steel gleamed in the shadow as a ray of moonlight struck it.\r\n\r\nThe quiet chateau stood there in dark outline. Only two windows were\r\nstill lighted up on the ground floor.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice thundered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForward! nom d'un nom! To the breach, my lads!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in an instant the doors, shutters and window panes fell in beneath a\r\nwave of men who rushed in, breaking, destroying everything, and took the\r\nhouse by storm. In a moment fifty soldiers, armed to the teeth, bounded\r\ninto the kitchen, where Walter Schnaffs was peacefully sleeping, and\r\nplacing to his breast fifty loaded rifles, they overturned him, rolled\r\nhim on the floor, seized him and tied his head and feet together.\r\n\r\nHe gasped in amazement, too besotted to understand, perplexed, bruised\r\nand wild with fear.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a big soldier, covered with gold lace, put his foot on his\r\nstomach, shouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my prisoner. Surrender!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prussian heard only the one word \xe2\x80\x9cprisoner\xe2\x80\x9d and he sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cYa, ya,\r\nya.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was raised from the floor, tied in a chair and examined with lively\r\ncuriosity by his victors, who were blowing like whales. Several of them\r\nsat down, done up with excitement and fatigue.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, actually smiled, secure now that he was at last a prisoner.\r\n\r\nAnother officer came into the room and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, the enemy has escaped; several seem to have been wounded. We\r\nare in possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe big officer, who was wiping his forehead, exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cVictory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he wrote in a little business memorandum book which he took from his\r\npocket:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a desperate encounter the Prussians were obliged to beat a\r\nretreat, carrying with them their dead and wounded, the number of whom\r\nis estimated at fifty men. Several were taken prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young officer inquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat steps shall I take, colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will retire in good order,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid having to\r\nreturn and make another attack with artillery and a larger force of\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he gave the command to set out.\r\n\r\nThe column drew up in line in the darkness beneath the walls of the\r\nchateau and filed out, a guard of six soldiers with revolvers in their\r\nhands surrounding Walter Schnaffs, who was firmly bound.\r\n\r\nScouts were sent ahead to reconnoitre. They advanced cautiously, halting\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak they arrived at the district of La Roche-Oysel, whose\r\nnational guard had accomplished this feat of arms.\r\n\r\nThe uneasy and excited inhabitants were expecting them. When they saw\r\nthe prisoner's helmet tremendous shouts arose. The women raised their\r\narms in wonder, the old people wept. An old grandfather threw his crutch\r\nat the Prussian and struck the nose of one of their own defenders.\r\n\r\nThe colonel roared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee that the prisoner is secure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the town hall. The prison was opened and Walter\r\nSchnaffs, freed from his bonds, cast into it. Two hundred armed men\r\nmounted guard outside the building.\r\n\r\nThen, in spite of the indigestion that had been troubling him for some\r\ntime, the Prussian, wild with joy, began to dance about, to dance\r\nfrantically, throwing out his arms and legs and uttering wild shouts\r\nuntil he fell down exhausted beside the wall.\r\n\r\nHe was a prisoner-saved!\r\n\r\nThat was how the Chateau de Charnpignet was taken from the enemy after\r\nonly six hours of occupation.\r\n\r\nColonel Ratier, a cloth merchant, who had led the assault at the head of\r\na body of the national guard of La Roche-Oysel, was decorated with an\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT SEA The following paragraphs recently appeared in the papers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoulogne-Sur-Mer, January 22.\xe2\x80\x94Our correspondent writes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fearful accident has thrown our sea-faring population, which has\r\nsuffered so much in the last two years, into the greatest consternation.\r\nThe fishing smack commanded by Captain Javel, on entering the harbor was\r\nwrecked on the rocks of the harbor breakwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of the efforts of the life boat and the shooting of life lines\r\nfrom the shore four sailors and the cabin boy were lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rough weather continues. Fresh disasters are anticipated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho is this Captain Javel? Is he the brother of the one-armed man?\r\n\r\nIf the poor man tossed about in the waves and dead, perhaps, beneath his\r\nwrecked boat, is the one I am thinking of, he took part, just eighteen\r\nyears ago, in another tragedy, terrible and simple as are all these\r\nfearful tragedies of the sea.\r\n\r\nJavel, senior, was then master of a trawling smack.\r\n\r\nThe trawling smack is the ideal fishing boat. So solidly built that it\r\nfears no weather, with a round bottom, tossed about unceasingly on the\r\nwaves like a cork, always on top, always thrashed by the harsh salt\r\nwinds of the English Channel, it ploughs the sea unweariedly with\r\nbellying sail, dragging along at its side a huge trawling net, which\r\nscours the depths of the ocean, and detaches and gathers in all the\r\nanimals asleep in the rocks, the flat fish glued to the sand, the heavy\r\ncrabs with their curved claws, and the lobsters with their pointed\r\nmustaches.\r\n\r\nWhen the breeze is fresh and the sea choppy, the boat starts in to\r\ntrawl. The net is fastened all along a big log of wood clamped with iron\r\nand is let down by two ropes on pulleys at either end of the boat. And\r\nthe boat, driven by the wind and the tide, draws along this apparatus\r\nwhich ransacks and plunders the depths of the sea.\r\n\r\nJavel had on board his younger brother, four sailors and a cabin boy. He\r\nhad set sail from Boulogne on a beautiful day to go trawling.\r\n\r\nBut presently a wind sprang up, and a hurricane obliged the smack to run\r\nto shore. She gained the English coast, but the high sea broke against\r\nthe rocks and dashed on the beach, making it impossible to go into port,\r\nfilling all the harbor entrances with foam and noise and danger.\r\n\r\nThe smack started off again, riding on the waves, tossed, shaken,\r\ndripping, buffeted by masses of water, but game in spite of everything;\r\naccustomed to this boisterous weather, which sometimes kept it roving\r\nbetween the two neighboring countries without its being able to make\r\nport in either.\r\n\r\nAt length the hurricane calmed down just as they were in the open, and\r\nalthough the sea was still high the captain gave orders to cast the net.\r\n\r\nSo it was lifted overboard, and two men in the bows and two in the stern\r\nbegan to unwind the ropes that held it. It suddenly touched bottom, but\r\na big wave made the boat heel, and Javel, junior, who was in the bows\r\ndirecting the lowering of the net, staggered, and his arm was caught in\r\nthe rope which the shock had slipped from the pulley for an instant. He\r\nmade a desperate effort to raise the rope with the other hand, but the\r\nnet was down and the taut rope did not give.\r\n\r\nThe man cried out in agony. They all ran to his aid. His brother left\r\nthe rudder. They all seized the rope, trying to free the arm it was\r\nbruising. But in vain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must cut it,\xe2\x80\x9d said a sailor, and he took from\r\nhis pocket a big knife, which, with two strokes, could save young\r\nJavel's arm.\r\n\r\nBut if the rope were cut the trawling net would be lost, and this net\r\nwas worth money, a great deal of money, fifteen hundred francs. And it\r\nbelonged to Javel, senior, who was tenacious of his property.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, do not cut, wait, I will luff,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, in great distress. And he\r\nran to the helm and turned the rudder. But the boat scarcely obeyed it,\r\nbeing impeded by the net which kept it from going forward, and prevented\r\nalso by the force of the tide and the wind.\r\n\r\nJavel, junior, had sunk on his knees, his teeth clenched, his eyes\r\nhaggard. He did not utter a word. His brother came back to him, in dread\r\nof the sailor's knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, wait,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will let down the anchor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey cast anchor, and then began to turn the capstan to loosen the\r\nmoorings of the net. They loosened them at length and disengaged the\r\nimprisoned arm, in its bloody woolen sleeve.\r\n\r\nYoung Javel seemed like an idiot. They took off his jersey and saw a\r\nhorrible sight, a mass of flesh from which the blood spurted as if from\r\na pump. Then the young man looked at his arm and murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cFoutu\xe2\x80\x9d (done\r\nfor).\r\n\r\nThen, as the blood was making a pool on the deck of the boat, one of the\r\nsailors cried: \xe2\x80\x9cHe will bleed to death, we must bind the vein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they took a cord, a thick, brown, tarry cord, and twisting it around\r\nthe arm above the wound, tightened it with all their might. The blood\r\nceased to spurt by slow degrees, and, presently, stopped altogether.\r\n\r\nYoung Javel rose, his arm hanging at his side. He took hold of it with\r\nthe other hand, raised it, turned it over, shook it. It was all mashed,\r\nthe bones broken, the muscles alone holding it together. He looked at it\r\nsadly, reflectively. Then he sat down on a folded sail and his comrades\r\nadvised him to keep wetting the arm constantly to prevent it from\r\nmortifying.\r\n\r\nThey placed a pail of water beside him, and every few minutes he dipped\r\na glass into it and bathed the frightful wound, letting the clear water\r\ntrickle on to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would be better in the cabin,\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother. He went down, but\r\ncame up again in an hour, not caring to be alone. And, besides, he\r\npreferred the fresh air. He sat down again on his sail and began to\r\nbathe his arm.\r\n\r\nThey made a good haul. The broad fish with their white bellies lay\r\nbeside him, quivering in the throes of death; he looked at them as he\r\ncontinued to bathe his crushed flesh.\r\n\r\nAs they were about to return to Boulogne the wind sprang up anew, and\r\nthe little boat resumed its mad course, bounding and tumbling about,\r\nshaking up the poor wounded man.\r\n\r\nNight came on. The sea ran high until dawn. As the sun rose the English\r\ncoast was again visible, but, as the weather had abated a little, they\r\nturned back towards the French coast, tacking as they went.\r\n\r\nTowards evening Javel, junior, called his comrades and showed them some\r\nblack spots, all the horrible tokens of mortification in the portion of\r\nthe arm below the broken bones.\r\n\r\nThe sailors examined it, giving their opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat might be the 'Black,'\xe2\x80\x9d thought one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe should put salt water on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\nThey brought some salt water and poured it on the wound. The injured man\r\nbecame livid, ground his teeth and writhed a little, but did not\r\nexclaim.\r\n\r\nThen, as soon as the smarting had abated, he said to his brother:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brother handed it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold my arm up, quite straight, and pull it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did as he asked them.\r\n\r\nThen he began to cut off his arm. He cut gently, carefully, severing all\r\nthe tendons with this blade that was sharp as a razor. And, presently,\r\nthere was only a stump left. He gave a deep sigh and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had to be done. It was done for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed relieved and breathed loud. He then began again to pour water\r\non the stump of arm that remained.\r\n\r\nThe sea was still rough and they could not make the shore.\r\n\r\nWhen the day broke, Javel, junior, took the severed portion of his arm\r\nand examined it for a long time. Gangrene had set in. His comrades also\r\nexamined it and handed it from one to the other, feeling it, turning it\r\nover, and sniffing at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must throw that into the sea at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother.\r\n\r\nBut Javel, junior, got angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! Oh, no! I don't want to. It belongs to me, does it not, as it\r\nis my arm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he took and placed it between his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will putrefy, just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said the older brother. Then an idea\r\ncame to the injured man. In order to preserve the fish when the boat was\r\nlong at sea, they packed it in salt, in barrels. He asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can I not put it in pickle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that's a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the others.\r\n\r\nThen they emptied one of the barrels, which was full from the haul of\r\nthe last few days; and right at the bottom of the barrel they laid the\r\ndetached arm. They covered it with salt, and then put back the fish one\r\nby one.\r\n\r\nOne of the sailors said by way of joke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope we do not sell it at auction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd everyone laughed, except the two Javels.\r\n\r\nThe wind was still boisterous. They tacked within sight of Boulogne\r\nuntil the following morning at ten o'clock. Young Javel continued to\r\nbathe his wound. From time to time he rose and walked from one end to\r\nthe other of the boat.\r\n\r\nHis brother, who was at the tiller, followed him with glances, and shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nAt last they ran into harbor.\r\n\r\nThe doctor examined the wound and pronounced it to be in good condition.\r\nHe dressed it properly and ordered the patient to rest. But Javel would\r\nnot go to bed until he got back his severed arm, and he returned at once\r\nto the dock to look for the barrel which he had marked with a cross.\r\n\r\nIt was emptied before him and he seized the arm, which was well\r\npreserved in the pickle, had shrunk and was freshened. He wrapped it up\r\nin a towel he had brought for the purpose and took it home.\r\n\r\nHis wife and children looked for a long time at this fragment of their\r\nfather, feeling the fingers, and removing the grains of salt that were\r\nunder the nails. Then they sent for a carpenter to make a little coffin.\r\n\r\nThe next day the entire crew of the trawling smack followed the funeral\r\nof the detached arm. The two brothers, side by side, led the procession;\r\nthe parish beadle carried the corpse under his arm.\r\n\r\nJavel, junior, gave up the sea. He obtained a small position on the\r\ndock, and when he subsequently talked about his accident, he would say\r\nconfidentially to his auditors:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my brother had been willing to cut away the net, I should still have\r\nmy arm, that is sure. But he was thinking only of his property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUET\r\n\r\nGreat misfortunes do not affect me very much, said John Bridelle, an old\r\nbachelor who passed for a sceptic. I have seen war at quite close\r\nquarters; I walked across corpses without any feeling of pity. The great\r\nbrutal facts of nature, or of humanity, may call forth cries of horror\r\nor indignation, but do not cause us that tightening of the heart, that\r\nshudder that goes down your spine at sight of certain little\r\nheartrending episodes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest sorrow that anyone can experience is certainly the loss of\r\na child, to a mother; and the loss of his mother, to a man. It is\r\nintense, terrible, it rends your heart and upsets your mind; but one is\r\nhealed of these shocks, just as large bleeding wounds become healed.\r\nCertain meetings, certain things half perceived, or surmised, certain\r\nsecret sorrows, certain tricks of fate which awake in us a whole world\r\nof painful thoughts, which suddenly unclose to us the mysterious door of\r\nmoral suffering, complicated, incurable; all the deeper because they\r\nappear benign, all the more bitter because they are intangible, all the\r\nmore tenacious because they appear almost factitious, leave in our souls\r\na sort of trail of sadness, a taste of bitterness, a feeling of\r\ndisenchantment, from which it takes a long time to free ourselves.\r\n\r\nI have always present to my mind two or three things that others would\r\nsurely not have noticed, but which penetrated my being like fine, sharp\r\nincurable stings.\r\n\r\nYou might not perhaps understand the emotion that I retained from these\r\nhasty impressions. I will tell you one of them. She was very old, but as\r\nlively as a young girl. It may be that my imagination alone is\r\nresponsible for my emotion.\r\n\r\nI am fifty. I was young then and studying law. I was rather sad,\r\nsomewhat of a dreamer, full of a pessimistic philosophy and did not care\r\nmuch for noisy cafes, boisterous companions, or stupid girls. I rose\r\nearly and one of my chief enjoyments was to walk alone about eight\r\no'clock in the morning in the nursery garden of the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nYou people never knew that nursery garden. It was like a forgotten\r\ngarden of the last century, as pretty as the gentle smile of an old\r\nlady. Thick hedges divided the narrow regular paths,\xe2\x80\x94peaceful paths\r\nbetween two walls of carefully trimmed foliage. The gardener's great\r\nshears were pruning unceasingly these leafy partitions, and here and\r\nthere one came across beds of flowers, lines of little trees looking\r\nlike schoolboys out for a walk, companies of magnificent rose bushes, or\r\nregiments of fruit trees.\r\n\r\nAn entire corner of this charming spot was in habited by bees. Their\r\nstraw hives skillfully arranged at distances on boards had their\r\nentrances\xe2\x80\x94as large as the opening of a thimble\xe2\x80\x94turned towards the sun,\r\nand all along the paths one encountered these humming and gilded flies,\r\nthe true masters of this peaceful spot, the real promenaders of these\r\nquiet paths.\r\n\r\nI came there almost every morning. I sat down on a bench and read.\r\nSometimes I let my book fall on my knees, to dream, to listen to the\r\nlife of Paris around me, and to enjoy the infinite repose of these old-\r\nfashioned hedges.\r\n\r\nBut I soon perceived that I was not the only one to frequent this spot\r\nas soon as the gates were opened, and I occasionally met face to face,\r\nat a turn in the path, a strange little old man.\r\n\r\nHe wore shoes with silver buckles, knee-breeches, a snuff-colored frock\r\ncoat, a lace jabot, and an outlandish gray hat with wide brim and long-\r\nhaired surface that might have come out of the ark.\r\n\r\nHe was thin, very thin, angular, grimacing and smiling. His bright eyes\r\nwere restless beneath his eyelids which blinked continuously. He always\r\ncarried in his hand a superb cane with a gold knob, which must have been\r\nfor him some glorious souvenir.\r\n\r\nThis good man astonished me at first, then caused me the intensest\r\ninterest. I watched him through the leafy walls, I followed him at a\r\ndistance, stopping at a turn in the hedge so as not to be seen.\r\n\r\nAnd one morning when he thought he was quite alone, he began to make the\r\nmost remarkable motions. First he would give some little springs, then\r\nmake a bow; then, with his slim legs, he would give a lively spring in\r\nthe air, clapping his feet as he did so, and then turn round cleverly,\r\nskipping and frisking about in a comical manner, smiling as if he had an\r\naudience, twisting his poor little puppet-like body, bowing pathetic and\r\nridiculous little greetings into the empty air. He was dancing.\r\n\r\nI stood petrified with amazement, asking myself which of us was crazy,\r\nhe or I.\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly, advanced as actors do on the stage, then bowed and\r\nretreated with gracious smiles, and kissing his hand as actors do, his\r\ntrembling hand, to the two rows of trimmed bushes.\r\n\r\nThen he continued his walk with a solemn demeanor.\r\n\r\nAfter that I never lost sight of him, and each morning he began anew his\r\noutlandish exercises.\r\n\r\nI was wildly anxious to speak to him. I decided to risk it, and one day,\r\nafter greeting him, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a beautiful day, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, the weather is just as it used to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA week later we were friends and I knew his history. He had been a\r\ndancing master at the opera, in the time of Louis XV. His beautiful cane\r\nwas a present from the Comte de Clermont. And when we spoke about\r\ndancing he never stopping talking.\r\n\r\nOne day he said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI married La Castris, monsieur. I will introduce you to her if you wish\r\nit, but she does not get here till later. This garden, you see, is our\r\ndelight and our life. It is all that remains of former days. It seems as\r\nthough we could not exist if we did not have it. It is old and\r\ndistingue, is it not? I seem to breathe an air here that has not changed\r\nsince I was young. My wife and I pass all our afternoons here, but I\r\ncome in the morning because I get up early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had finished luncheon I returned to the Luxembourg, and\r\npresently perceived my friend offering his arm ceremoniously to a very\r\nold little lady dressed in black, to whom he introduced me. It was La\r\nCastris, the great dancer, beloved by princes, beloved by the king,\r\nbeloved by all that century of gallantry that seems to have left behind\r\nit in the world an atmosphere of love.\r\n\r\nWe sat down on a bench. It was the month of May. An odor of flowers\r\nfloated in the neat paths; a hot sun glided its rays between the\r\nbranches and covered us with patches of light. The black dress of La\r\nCastris seemed to be saturated with sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe garden was empty. We heard the rattling of vehicles in the distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to the old dancer, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was the minuet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe minuet, monsieur, is the queen of dances, and the dance of queens,\r\ndo you understand? Since there is no longer any royalty, there is no\r\nlonger any minuet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he began in a pompous manner a long dithyrambic eulogy which I could\r\nnot understand. I wanted to have the steps, the movements, the\r\npositions, explained to me. He became confused, was amazed at his\r\ninability to make me understand, became nervous and worried.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, turning to his old companion who had remained silent and\r\nserious, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElise, would you like\xe2\x80\x94say\xe2\x80\x94would you like, it would be very nice of you,\r\nwould you like to show this gentleman what it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned eyes uneasily in all directions, then rose without saying a\r\nword and took her position opposite him.\r\n\r\nThen I witnessed an unheard-of thing.\r\n\r\nThey advanced and retreated with childlike grimaces, smiling, swinging\r\neach other, bowing, skipping about like two automaton dolls moved by\r\nsome old mechanical contrivance, somewhat damaged, but made by a clever\r\nworkman according to the fashion of his time.\r\n\r\nAnd I looked at them, my heart filled with extraordinary emotions, my\r\nsoul touched with an indescribable melancholy. I seemed to see before me\r\na pathetic and comical apparition, the out-of-date ghost of a former\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThey suddenly stopped. They had finished all the figures of the dance.\r\nFor some seconds they stood opposite each other, smiling in an\r\nastonishing manner. Then they fell on each other's necks sobbing.\r\n\r\nI left for the provinces three days later. I never saw them again. When\r\nI returned to Paris, two years later, the nursery had been destroyed.\r\nWhat became of them, deprived of the dear garden of former days, with\r\nits mazes, its odor of the past, and the graceful windings of its\r\nhedges?\r\n\r\nAre they dead? Are they wandering among modern streets like hopeless\r\nexiles? Are they dancing\xe2\x80\x94grotesque spectres\xe2\x80\x94a fantastic minuet in the\r\nmoonlight, amid the cypresses of a cemetery, along the pathways bordered\r\nby graves?\r\n\r\nTheir memory haunts me, obsesses me, torments me, remains with me like a\r\nwound. Why? I do not know.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you think that very absurd?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SON\r\n\r\nThe two old friends were walking in the garden in bloom, where spring\r\nwas bringing everything to life.\r\n\r\nOne was a senator, the other a member of the French Academy, both\r\nserious men, full of very logical but solemn arguments, men of note and\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nThey talked first of politics, exchanging opinions; not on ideas, but on\r\nmen, personalities in this regard taking the predominance over ability.\r\nThen they recalled some memories. Then they walked along in silence,\r\nenervated by the warmth of the air.\r\n\r\nA large bed of wallflowers breathed out a delicate sweetness. A mass of\r\nflowers of all species and color flung their fragrance to the breeze,\r\nwhile a cytisus covered with yellow clusters scattered its fine pollen\r\nabroad, a golden cloud, with an odor of honey that bore its balmy seed\r\nacross space, similar to the sachet-powders of perfumers.\r\n\r\nThe senator stopped, breathed in the cloud of floating pollen, looked at\r\nthe fertile shrub, yellow as the sun, whose seed was floating in the\r\nair, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one considers that these imperceptible fragrant atoms will create\r\nexistences at a hundred leagues from here, will send a thrill through\r\nthe fibres and sap of female trees and produce beings with roots,\r\ngrowing from a germ, just as we do, mortal like ourselves, and who will\r\nbe replaced by other beings of the same order, like ourselves again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, standing in front of the brilliant cytisus, whose live pollen was\r\nshaken off by each breath of air, the senator added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, old fellow, if you had to keep count of all your children you would\r\nbe mightily embarrassed. Here is one who generates freely, and then lets\r\nthem go without a pang and troubles himself no more about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do the same, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the academician.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do not deny it; we let them go sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the senator,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut we are aware that we do, and that constitutes our superiority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is not what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee, my friend, that there is scarcely a man who has not some children\r\nthat he does not know, children\xe2\x80\x94'father unknown'\xe2\x80\x94whom he has generated\r\nalmost unconsciously, just as this tree reproduces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we had to keep account of our amours, we should be just as\r\nembarrassed as this cytisus which you apostrophized would be in counting\r\nup his descendants, should we not?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom eighteen to forty years, in fact, counting in every chance cursory\r\nacquaintanceship, we may well say that we have been intimate with two or\r\nthree hundred women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, my friend, among this number can you be sure that you have\r\nnot had children by at least one of them, and that you have not in the\r\nstreets, or in the bagnio, some blackguard of a son who steals from and\r\nmurders decent people, i.e., ourselves; or else a daughter in some\r\ndisreputable place, or, if she has the good fortune to be deserted by\r\nher mother, as cook in some family?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider, also, that almost all those whom we call 'prostitutes' have\r\none or two children of whose paternal parentage they are ignorant,\r\ngenerated by chance at the price of ten or twenty francs. In every\r\nbusiness there is profit and loss. These wildings constitute the 'loss'\r\nin their profession. Who generated them? You\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94we all did, the men\r\ncalled 'gentlemen'! They are the consequences of our jovial little\r\ndinners, of our gay evenings, of those hours when our comfortable\r\nphysical being impels us to chance liaisons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThieves, marauders, all these wretches, in fact, are our children. And\r\nthat is better for us than if we were their children, for those\r\nscoundrels generate also!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have in my mind a very horrible story that I will relate to you. It\r\nhas caused me incessant remorse, and, further than that, a continual\r\ndoubt, a disquieting uncertainty, that, at times, torments me\r\nfrightfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was twenty-five I undertook a walking tour through Brittany with\r\none of my friends, now a member of the cabinet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter walking steadily for fifteen or twenty days and visiting the\r\nCotes-du-Nord and part of Finistere we reached Douarnenez. From there we\r\nwent without halting to the wild promontory of Raz by the bay of Les\r\nTrepaases, and passed the night in a village whose name ends in 'of.'\r\nThe next morning a strange lassitude kept my friend in bed; I say bed\r\nfrom habit, for our couch consisted simply of two bundles of straw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would never do to be ill in this place. So I made him get up, and we\r\nreached Andierne about four or five o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe following day he felt a little better, and we set out again. But on\r\nthe road he was seized with intolerable pain, and we could scarcely get\r\nas far as Pont Labbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, at least, there was an inn. My friend went to bed, and the\r\ndoctor, who had been sent for from Quimper, announced that he had a high\r\nfever, without being able to determine its nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Pont Labbe? No? Well, then, it is the most Breton of all\r\nthis Breton Brittany, which extends from the promontory of Raz to the\r\nMorbihan, of this land which contains the essence of the Breton manners,\r\nlegends and customs. Even to-day this corner of the country has scarcely\r\nchanged. I say 'even to-day,' for I now go there every year, alas!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old chateau laves the walls of its towers in a great melancholy\r\npond, melancholy and frequented by flights of wild birds. It has an\r\noutlet in a river on which boats can navigate as far as the town. In the\r\nnarrow streets with their old-time houses the men wear big hats,\r\nembroidered waistcoats and four coats, one on top of the other; the\r\ninside one, as large as your hand, barely covering the shoulder-blades,\r\nand the outside one coming to just above the seat of the trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girls, tall, handsome and fresh have their bosoms crushed in a\r\ncloth bodice which makes an armor, compresses them, not allowing one\r\neven to guess at their robust and tortured neck. They also wear a\r\nstrange headdress. On their temples two bands embroidered in colors\r\nframe their face, inclosing the hair, which falls in a shower at the\r\nback of their heads, and is then turned up and gathered on top of the\r\nhead under a singular cap, often woven with gold or silver thread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servant at our inn was eighteen at most, with very blue eyes, a\r\npale blue with two tiny black pupils, short teeth close together, which\r\nshe showed continually when she laughed, and which seemed strong enough\r\nto grind granite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not know a word of French, speaking only Breton, as did most of\r\nher companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs my friend did not improve much, and although he had no definite\r\nmalady, the doctor forbade him to continue his journey yet, ordering\r\ncomplete rest. I spent my days with him, and the little maid would come\r\nin incessantly, bringing either my dinner or some herb tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI teased her a little, which seemed to amuse her, but we did not chat,\r\nof course, as we could not understand each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut one night, after I had stayed quite late with my friend and was\r\ngoing back to my room, I passed the girl, who was going to her room. It\r\nwas just opposite my open door, and, without reflection, and more for\r\nfun than anything else, I abruptly seized her round the waist, and\r\nbefore she recovered from her astonishment I had thrown her down and\r\nlocked her in my room. She looked at me, amazed, excited, terrified, not\r\ndaring to cry out for fear of a scandal and of being probably driven\r\nout, first by her employers and then, perhaps, by her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it as a joke at first. She defended herself bravely, and at the\r\nfirst chance she ran to the door, drew back the bolt and fled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely saw her for several days. She would not let me come near\r\nher. But when my friend was cured and we were to get out on our travels\r\nagain I saw her coming into my room about midnight the night before our\r\ndeparture, just after I had retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe threw herself into my arms and embraced me passionately, giving me\r\nall the assurances of tenderness and despair that a woman can give when\r\nshe does not know a word of our language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA week later I had forgotten this adventure, so common and frequent\r\nwhen one is travelling, the inn servants being generally destined to\r\namuse travellers in this way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thirty before I thought of it again, or returned to Pont Labbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in 1876 I revisited it by chance during a trip into Brittany, which\r\nI made in order to look up some data for a book and to become permeated\r\nwith the atmosphere of the different places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing seemed changed. The chateau still laved its gray wall in the\r\npond outside the little town; the inn was the same, though it had been\r\nrepaired, renovated and looked more modern. As I entered it I was\r\nreceived by two young Breton girls of eighteen, fresh and pretty, bound\r\nup in their tight cloth bodices, with their silver caps and wide\r\nembroidered bands on their ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was about six o'clock in the evening. I sat down to dinner, and as\r\nthe host was assiduous in waiting on me himself, fate, no doubt,\r\nimpelled me to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Did you know the former proprietors of this house? I spent about ten\r\ndays here thirty years ago. I am talking old times.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Those were my parents, monsieur,' he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I told him why we had stayed over at that time, how my comrade had\r\nbeen delayed by illness. He did not let me finish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, I recollect perfectly. I was about fifteen or sixteen. You slept\r\nin the room at the end and your friend in the one I have taken for\r\nmyself, overlooking the street.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only then that the recollection of the little maid came vividly\r\nto my mind. I asked: 'Do you remember a pretty little servant who was\r\nthen in your father's employ, and who had, if my memory does not deceive\r\nme, pretty eyes and fresh-looking teeth?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, monsieur; she died in childbirth some time after.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, pointing to the courtyard where a thin, lame man was stirring up\r\nthe manure, he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That is her son.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to laugh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He is not handsome and does not look much like his mother. No doubt he\r\nlooks like his father.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That is very possible,' replied the innkeeper; 'but we never knew\r\nwhose child it was. She died without telling any one, and no one here\r\nknew of her having a beau. Every one was hugely astonished when they\r\nheard she was enceinte, and no one would believe it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sort of unpleasant chill came over me, one of those painful surface\r\nwounds that affect us like the shadow of an impending sorrow. And I\r\nlooked at the man in the yard. He had just drawn water for the horses\r\nand was carrying two buckets, limping as he walked, with a painful\r\neffort of his shorter leg. His clothes were ragged, he was hideously\r\ndirty, with long yellow hair, so tangled that it looked like strands of\r\nrope falling down at either side of his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He is not worth much,' continued the innkeeper; 'we have kept him for\r\ncharity's sake. Perhaps he would have turned out better if he had been\r\nbrought up like other folks. But what could one do, monsieur? No father,\r\nno mother, no money! My parents took pity on him, but he was not their\r\nchild, you understand.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slept in my old room, and all night long I thought of this frightful\r\nstableman, saying to myself: 'Supposing it is my own son? Could I have\r\ncaused that girl's death and procreated this being? It was quite\r\npossible!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI resolved to speak to this man and to find out the exact date of his\r\nbirth. A variation of two months would set my doubts at rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent for him the next day. But he could not speak French. He looked\r\nas if he could not understand anything, being absolutely ignorant of his\r\nage, which I had inquired of him through one of the maids. He stood\r\nbefore me like an idiot, twirling his hat in 'his knotted, disgusting\r\nhands, laughing stupidly, with something of his mother's laugh in the\r\ncorners of his mouth and of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe landlord, appearing on the scene, went to look for the birth\r\ncertificate of this wretched being. He was born eight months and twenty-\r\nsix days after my stay at Pont Labbe, for I recollect perfectly that we\r\nreached Lorient on the fifteenth of August. The certificate contained\r\nthis description: 'Father unknown.' The mother called herself Jeanne\r\nKerradec.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my heart began to beat rapidly. I could not utter a word, for I\r\nfelt as if I were choking. I looked at this animal whose long yellow\r\nhair reminded me of a straw heap, and the beggar, embarrassed by my\r\ngaze, stopped laughing, turned his head aside, and wanted to get away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll day long I wandered beside the little river, giving way to painful\r\nreflections. But what was the use of reflection? I could be sure of\r\nnothing. For hours and hours I weighed all the pros and cons in favor of\r\nor against the probability of my being the father, growing nervous over\r\ninexplicable suppositions, only to return incessantly to the same\r\nhorrible uncertainty, then to the still more atrocious conviction that\r\nthis man was my son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could eat no dinner, and went to my room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lay awake for a long time, and when I finally fell asleep I was\r\nhaunted by horrible visions. I saw this laborer laughing in my face and\r\ncalling me 'papa.' Then he changed into a dog and bit the calves of my\r\nlegs, and no matter how fast I ran he still followed me, and instead of\r\nbarking, talked and reviled me. Then he appeared before my colleagues at\r\nthe Academy, who had assembled to decide whether I was really his\r\nfather; and one of them cried out: 'There can be no doubt about it! See\r\nhow he resembles him.' And, indeed, I could see that this monster looked\r\nlike me. And I awoke with this idea fixed in my mind and with an insane\r\ndesire to see the man again and assure myself whether or not we had\r\nsimilar features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI joined him as he was going to mass (it was Sunday) and I gave him\r\nfive francs as I gazed at him anxiously. He began to laugh in an idiotic\r\nmanner, took the money, and then, embarrassed afresh at my gaze, he ran\r\noff, after stammering an almost inarticulate word that, no doubt, meant\r\n'thank you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy day passed in the same distress of mind as on the previous night. I\r\nsent for the landlord, and, with the greatest caution, skill and tact, I\r\ntold him that I was interested in this poor creature, so abandoned by\r\nevery one and deprived of everything, and I wished to do something for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the man replied: 'Oh, do not think of it, monsieur; he is of no\r\naccount; you will only cause yourself annoyance. I employ him to clean\r\nout the stable, and that is all he can do. I give him his board and let\r\nhim sleep with the horses. He needs nothing more. If you have an old\r\npair of trousers, you might give them to him, but they will be in rags\r\nin a week.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not insist, intending to think it over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor wretch came home that evening frightfully drunk, came near\r\nsetting fire to the house, killed a horse by hitting it with a pickaxe,\r\nand ended up by lying down to sleep in the mud in the midst of the\r\npouring rain, thanks to my donation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey begged me next day not to give him any more money. Brandy drove\r\nhim crazy, and as soon as he had two sous in his pocket he would spend\r\nit in drink. The landlord added: 'Giving him money is like trying to\r\nkill him.' The man had never, never in his life had more than a few\r\ncentimes, thrown to him by travellers, and he knew of no destination for\r\nthis metal but the wine shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spent several hours in my room with an open book before me which I\r\npretended to read, but in reality looking at this animal, my son! my\r\nson! trying to discover if he looked anything like me. After careful\r\nscrutiny I seemed to recognize a similarity in the lines of the forehead\r\nand the root of the nose, and I was soon convinced that there was a\r\nresemblance, concealed by the difference in garb and the man's hideous\r\nhead of hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not stay here any longer without arousing suspicion, and I went\r\naway, my heart crushed, leaving with the innkeeper some money to soften\r\nthe existence of his servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor six years now I have lived with this idea in my mind, this horrible\r\nuncertainty, this abominable suspicion. And each year an irresistible\r\nforce takes me back to Pont Labbe. Every year I condemn myself to the\r\ntorture of seeing this animal raking the manure, imagining that he\r\nresembles me, and endeavoring, always vainly, to render him some\r\nassistance. And each year I return more uncertain, more tormented, more\r\nworried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to have him taught, but he is a hopeless idiot. I tried to make\r\nhis life less hard. He is an irreclaimable drunkard, and spends in drink\r\nall the money one gives him, and knows enough to sell his new clothes in\r\norder to get brandy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to awaken his master's sympathy, so that he should look after\r\nhim, offering to pay him for doing so. The innkeeper, finally surprised,\r\nsaid, very wisely: 'All that you do for him, monsieur, will only help to\r\ndestroy him. He must be kept like a prisoner. As soon as he has any\r\nspare time, or any comfort, he becomes wicked. If you wish to do good,\r\nthere is no lack of abandoned children, but select one who will\r\nappreciate your attention.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could I say?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I allowed the slightest suspicion of the doubts that tortured me to\r\nescape, this idiot would assuredly become cunning, in order to blackmail\r\nme, to compromise me and ruin me. He would call out 'papa,' as in my\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I said to myself that I had killed the mother and lost this\r\natrophied creature, this larva of the stable, born and raised amid the\r\nmanure, this man who, if brought up like others, would have been like\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you cannot imagine what a strange, embarrassed and intolerable\r\nfeeling comes over me when he stands before me and I reflect that he\r\ncame from myself, that he belongs to me through the intimate bond that\r\nlinks father and son, that, thanks to the terrible law of heredity, he\r\nis my own self in a thousand ways, in his blood and his flesh, and that\r\nhe has even the same germs of disease, the same leaven of emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an incessant restless, distressing longing to see him, and the\r\nsight of him causes me intense suffering, as I look down from my window\r\nand watch him for hours removing and carting the horse manure, saying to\r\nmyself: 'That is my son.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I sometimes feel an irresistible longing to embrace him. I have\r\nnever even touched his dirty hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe academician was silent. His companion, a tactful man, murmured:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, we ought to take a closer interest in children who have no\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gust of wind passing through the tree shook its yellow clusters,\r\nenveloping in a fragrant and delicate mist the two old men, who inhaled\r\nin the fragrance with deep breaths.\r\n\r\nThe senator added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is good to be twenty-five and even to have\r\nchildren like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT PIG OF A MORIN\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Labarbe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have just repeated those five\r\nwords, that pig of a Morin. Why on earth do I never hear Morin's name\r\nmentioned without his being called a pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLabarbe, who is a deputy, looked at me with his owl-like eyes and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that you do not know Morin's story and you come from\r\nLa Rochelle?\xe2\x80\x9d I was obliged to declare that I did not know Morin's\r\nstory, so Labarbe rubbed his hands and began his recital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew Morin, did you not, and you remember his large linen-draper's\r\nshop on the Quai de la Rochelle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then. You must know that in 1862 or '63 Morin went to spend a\r\nfortnight in Paris for pleasure; or for his pleasures, but under the\r\npretext of renewing his stock, and you also know what a fortnight in\r\nParis means to a country shopkeeper; it fires his blood. The theatre\r\nevery evening, women's dresses rustling up against you and continual\r\nexcitement; one goes almost mad with it. One sees nothing but dancers in\r\ntights, actresses in very low dresses, round legs, fat shoulders, all\r\nnearly within reach of one's hands, without daring, or being able, to\r\ntouch them, and one scarcely tastes food. When one leaves the city one's\r\nheart is still all in a flutter and one's mind still exhilarated by a\r\nsort of longing for kisses which tickles one's lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorin was in that condition when he took his ticket for La Rochelle by\r\nthe eight-forty night express. As he was walking up and down the\r\nwaiting-room at the station he stopped suddenly in front of a young lady\r\nwho was kissing an old one. She had her veil up, and Morin murmured with\r\ndelight: 'By Jove what a pretty woman!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she had said 'good-by' to the old lady she went into the waiting-\r\nroom, and Morin followed her; then she went on the platform and Morin\r\nstill followed her; then she got into an empty carriage, and he again\r\nfollowed her. There were very few travellers on the express. The engine\r\nwhistled and the train started. They were alone. Morin devoured her with\r\nhis eyes. She appeared to be about nineteen or twenty and was fair,\r\ntall, with a bold look. She wrapped a railway rug round her and\r\nstretched herself on the seat to sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorin asked himself: 'I wonder who she is?' And a thousand conjectures,\r\na thousand projects went through his head. He said to himself: 'So many\r\nadventures are told as happening on railway journeys that this may be\r\none that is going to present itself to me. Who knows? A piece of good\r\nluck like that happens very suddenly, and perhaps I need only be a\r\nlittle venturesome. Was it not Danton who said: \xe2\x80\x9cAudacity, more audacity\r\nand always audacity\xe2\x80\x9d? If it was not Danton it was Mirabeau, but that\r\ndoes not matter. But then I have no audacity, and that is the\r\ndifficulty. Oh! If one only knew, if one could only read people's minds!\r\nI will bet that every day one passes by magnificent opportunities\r\nwithout knowing it, though a gesture would be enough to let me know her\r\nmind.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he imagined to himself combinations which conducted him to\r\ntriumph. He pictured some chivalrous deed or merely some slight service\r\nwhich he rendered her, a lively, gallant conversation which ended in a\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he could find no opening, had no pretext, and he waited for some\r\nfortunate circumstance, with his heart beating and his mind topsy-turvy.\r\nThe night passed and the pretty girl still slept, while Morin was\r\nmeditating his own fall. The day broke and soon the first ray of\r\nsunlight appeared in the sky, a long, clear ray which shone on the face\r\nof the sleeping girl and woke her. She sat up, looked at the country,\r\nthen at Morin and smiled. She smiled like a happy woman, with an\r\nengaging and bright look, and Morin trembled. Certainly that smile was\r\nintended for him; it was discreet invitation, the signal which he was\r\nwaiting for. That smile meant to say: 'How stupid, what a ninny, what a\r\ndolt, what a donkey you are, to have sat there on your seat like a post\r\nall night!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Just look at me, am I not charming? And you have sat like that for the\r\nwhole night, when you have been alone with a pretty woman, you great\r\nsimpleton!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was still smiling as she looked at him; she even began to laugh;\r\nand he lost his head trying to find something suitable to say, no matter\r\nwhat. But he could think of nothing, nothing, and then, seized with a\r\ncoward's courage, he said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'So much the worse, I will risk everything,' and suddenly, without the\r\nslightest warning, he went toward her, his arms extended, his lips\r\nprotruding, and, seizing her in his arms, he kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sprang up immediately with a bound, crying out: 'Help! help!' and\r\nscreaming with terror; and then she opened the carriage door and waved\r\nher arm out, mad with terror and trying to jump out, while Morin, who\r\nwas almost distracted and feeling sure that she would throw herself out,\r\nheld her by the skirt and stammered: 'Oh, madame! oh, madame!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe train slackened speed and then stopped. Two guards rushed up at the\r\nyoung woman's frantic signals. She threw herself into their arms,\r\nstammering: 'That man wanted\xe2\x80\x94wanted\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94' And then she fainted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were at Mauze station, and the gendarme on duty arrested Morin.\r\nWhen the victim of his indiscreet admiration had regained her\r\nconsciousness, she made her charge against him, and the police drew it\r\nup. The poor linen draper did not reach home till night, with a\r\nprosecution hanging over him for an outrage to morals in a public\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d II\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time I was editor of the Fanal des Charentes, and I used to\r\nmeet Morin every day at the Cafe du Commerce, and the day after his\r\nadventure. he came to see me, as he did not know what to do. I did not\r\nhide my opinion from him, but said to him: 'You are no better than a\r\npig. No decent man behaves like that.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cried. His wife had given him a beating, and he foresaw his trade\r\nruined, his name dragged through the mire and dishonored, his friends\r\nscandalized and taking no notice of him. In the end he excited my pity,\r\nand I sent for my colleague, Rivet, a jocular but very sensible little\r\nman, to give us his advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe advised me to see the public prosecutor, who was a friend of mine,\r\nand so I sent Morin home and went to call on the magistrate. He told me\r\nthat the woman who had been insulted was a young lady, Mademoiselle\r\nHenriette Bonnel, who had just received her certificate as governess in\r\nParis and spent her holidays with her uncle and aunt, who were very\r\nrespectable tradespeople in Mauze. What made Morin's case all the more\r\nserious was that the uncle had lodged a complaint, but the public\r\nofficial had consented to let the matter drop if this complaint were\r\nwithdrawn, so we must try and get him to do this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went back to Morin's and found him in bed, ill with excitement and\r\ndistress. His wife, a tall raw-boned woman with a beard, was abusing him\r\ncontinually, and she showed me into the room, shouting at me: 'So you\r\nhave come to see that pig of a Morin. Well, there he is, the darling!'\r\nAnd she planted herself in front of the bed, with her hands on her hips.\r\nI told him how matters stood, and he begged me to go and see the girl's\r\nuncle and aunt. It was a delicate mission, but I undertook it, and the\r\npoor devil never ceased repeating: 'I assure you I did not even kiss\r\nher; no, not even that. I will take my oath to it!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI replied: 'It is all the same; you are nothing but a pig.' And I took\r\na thousand francs which he gave me to employ as I thought best, but as I\r\ndid not care to venture to her uncle's house alone, I begged Rivet to go\r\nwith me, which he agreed to do on condition that we went immediately,\r\nfor he had some urgent business at La Rochelle that afternoon. So two\r\nhours later we rang at the door of a pretty country house. An attractive\r\ngirl came and opened the door to us assuredly the young lady in\r\nquestion, and I said to Rivet in a low voice: 'Confound it! I begin to\r\nunderstand Morin!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe uncle, Monsieur Tonnelet, subscribed to the Fanal, and was a\r\nfervent political coreligionist of ours. He received us with open arms\r\nand congratulated us and wished us joy; he was delighted at having the\r\ntwo editors in his house, and Rivet whispered to me: 'I think we shall\r\nbe able to arrange the matter of that pig of a Morin for him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe niece had left the room and I introduced the delicate subject. I\r\nwaved the spectre of scandal before his eyes; I accentuated the\r\ninevitable depreciation which the young lady would suffer if such an\r\naffair became known, for nobody would believe in a simple kiss, and the\r\ngood man seemed undecided, but he could not make up his mind about\r\nanything without his wife, who would not be in until late that evening.\r\nBut suddenly he uttered an exclamation of triumph: 'Look here, I have an\r\nexcellent idea; I will keep you here to dine and sleep, and when my wife\r\ncomes home I hope we shall be able to arrange matters:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRivet resisted at first, but the wish to extricate that pig of a Morin\r\ndecided him, and we accepted the invitation, and the uncle got up\r\nradiant, called his niece and proposed that we should take a stroll in\r\nhis grounds, saying: 'We will leave serious matters until the morning.'\r\nRivet and he began to talk politics, while I soon found myself lagging a\r\nlittle behind with 'the girl who was really charming\xe2\x80\x94charming\xe2\x80\x94and with\r\nthe greatest precaution I began to speak to her about her adventure and\r\ntry to make her my ally. She did not, however, appear the least\r\nconfused, and listened to me like a person who was enjoying the whole\r\nthing very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to her: 'Just think, mademoiselle, how unpleasant it will be for\r\nyou. You will have to appear in court, to encounter malicious looks, to\r\nspeak before everybody and to recount that unfortunate occurrence in the\r\nrailway carriage in public. Do you not think, between ourselves, that it\r\nwould have been much better for you to have put that dirty scoundrel\r\nback in his place without calling for assistance, and merely to change\r\nyour carriage?' She began to laugh and replied: 'What you say is quite\r\ntrue, but what could I do? I was frightened, and when one is frightened\r\none does not stop to reason with one's self. As soon as I realized the\r\nsituation I was very sorry, that I had called out, but then it was too\r\nlate. You must also remember that the idiot threw himself upon me like a\r\nmadman, without saying a word and looking like a lunatic. I did not even\r\nknow what he wanted of me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looked me full in the face without being nervous or intimidated and\r\nI said to myself: 'She is a queer sort of girl, that: I can quite see\r\nhow that pig Morin came to make a mistake,' and I went on jokingly:\r\n'Come, mademoiselle, confess that he was excusable, for, after all, a\r\nman cannot find himself opposite such a pretty girl as you are without\r\nfeeling a natural desire to kiss her.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe laughed more than ever and showed her teeth and said: 'Between the\r\ndesire and the act, monsieur, there is room for respect.' It was an odd\r\nexpression to use, although it was not very clear, and I asked abruptly:\r\n'Well, now, suppose I were to kiss you, what would you do?' She stopped\r\nto look at me from head to foot and then said calmly: 'Oh, you? That is\r\nquite another matter.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew perfectly well, by Jove, that it was not the same thing at all,\r\nas everybody in the neighborhood called me 'Handsome Labarbe'\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\nthirty years old in those days\xe2\x80\x94but I asked her: 'And why, pray?' She\r\nshrugged her shoulders and replied: 'Well! because you are not so stupid\r\nas he is.' And then she added, looking at me slyly: 'Nor so ugly,\r\neither: And before she could make a movement to avoid me I had implanted\r\na hearty kiss on her cheek. She sprang aside, but it was too late, and\r\nthen she said: 'Well, you are not very bashful, either! But don't do\r\nthat sort of thing again.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put on a humble look and said in a low voice: 'Oh, mademoiselle! as\r\nfor me, if I long for one thing more than another it is to be summoned\r\nbefore a magistrate for the same reason as Morin.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why?' she asked. And, looking steadily at her, I replied: 'Because you\r\nare one of the most beautiful creatures living; because it would be an\r\nhonor and a glory for me to have wished to offer you violence, and\r\nbecause people would have said, after seeing you: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Labarbe has\r\nrichly deserved what he has got, but he is a lucky fellow, all the\r\nsame.\xe2\x80\x9d'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe began to laugh heartily again and said: 'How funny you are!' And\r\nshe had not finished the word 'funny' before I had her in my arms and\r\nwas kissing her ardently wherever I could find a place, on her forehead,\r\non her eyes, on her lips occasionally, on her cheeks, all over her head,\r\nsome part of which she was obliged to leave exposed, in spite of\r\nherself, to defend the others; but at last she managed to release\r\nherself, blushing and angry. 'You are very unmannerly, monsieur,' she\r\nsaid, 'and I am sorry I listened to you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took her hand in some confusion and stammered out: 'I beg your\r\npardon. I beg your pardon, mademoiselle. I have offended you; I have\r\nacted like a brute! Do not be angry with me for what I have done. If you\r\nknew\xe2\x80\x94' I vainly sought for some excuse, and in a few moments she said:\r\n'There is nothing for me to know, monsieur.' But I had found something\r\nto say, and I cried: 'Mademoiselle, I love you!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was really surprised and raised her eyes to look at me, and I went\r\non: 'Yes, mademoiselle, and pray listen to me. I do not know Morin, and\r\nI do not care anything about him. It does not matter to me the least if\r\nhe is committed for trial and locked up meanwhile. I saw you here last\r\nyear, and I was so taken with you that the thought of you has never left\r\nme since, and it does not matter to me whether you believe me or not. I\r\nthought you adorable, and the remembrance of you took such a hold on me\r\nthat I longed to see you again, and so I made use of that fool Morin as\r\na pretext, and here I am. Circumstances have made me exceed the due\r\nlimits of respect, and I can only beg you to pardon me.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looked at me to see if I was in earnest and was ready to smile\r\nagain. Then she murmured: 'You humbug!' But I raised my hand and said in\r\na sincere voice (and I really believe that I was sincere): 'I swear to\r\nyou that I am speaking the truth,' and she replied quite simply: 'Don't\r\ntalk nonsense!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were alone, quite alone, as Rivet and her uncle had disappeared down\r\na sidewalk, and I made her a real declaration of love, while I squeezed\r\nand kissed her hands, and she listened to it as to something new and\r\nagreeable, without exactly knowing how much of it she was to believe,\r\nwhile in the end I felt agitated, and at last really myself believed\r\nwhat I said. I was pale, anxious and trembling, and I gently put my arm\r\nround her waist and spoke to her softly, whispering into the little\r\ncurls over her ears. She seemed in a trance, so absorbed in thought was\r\nshe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen her hand touched mine, and she pressed it, and I gently squeezed\r\nher waist with a trembling, and gradually firmer, grasp. She did not\r\nmove now, and I touched her cheek with my lips, and suddenly without\r\nseeking them my lips met hers. It was a long, long kiss, and it would\r\nhave lasted longer still if I had not heard a hm! hm! just behind me, at\r\nwhich she made her escape through the bushes, and turning round I saw\r\nRivet coming toward me, and, standing in the middle of the path, he said\r\nwithout even smiling: 'So that is the way you settle the affair of that\r\npig of a Morin.' And I replied conceitedly: 'One does what one can, my\r\ndear fellow. But what about the uncle? How have you got on with him? I\r\nwill answer for the niece.' 'I have not been so fortunate with him,' he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereupon I took his arm and we went indoors.\xe2\x80\x9d III\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner made me lose my head altogether. I sat beside her, and my hand\r\ncontinually met hers under the tablecloth, my foot touched hers and our\r\nglances met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter dinner we took a walk by moonlight, and I whispered all the\r\ntender things I could think of to her. I held her close to me, kissed\r\nher every moment, while her uncle and Rivet were arguing as they walked\r\nin front of us. They went in, and soon a messenger brought a telegram\r\nfrom her aunt, saying that she would not return until the next morning\r\nat seven o'clock by the first train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Very well, Henriette,' her uncle said, 'go and show the gentlemen\r\ntheir rooms.' She showed Rivet his first, and he whispered to me: 'There\r\nwas no danger of her taking us into yours first.' Then she took me to my\r\nroom, and as soon as she was alone with me I took her in my arms again\r\nand tried to arouse her emotion, but when she saw the danger she escaped\r\nout of the room, and I retired very much put out and excited and feeling\r\nrather foolish, for I knew that I should not sleep much, and I was\r\nwondering how I could have committed such a mistake, when there was a\r\ngentle knock at my door, and on my asking who was there a low voice\r\nreplied: 'I'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dressed myself quickly and opened the door, and she came in. 'I\r\nforgot to ask you what you take in the morning,' she said; 'chocolate,\r\ntea or coffee?' I put my arms round her impetuously and said, devouring\r\nher with kisses: 'I will take\xe2\x80\x94I will take\xe2\x80\x94'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she freed herself from my arms, blew out my candle and disappeared\r\nand left me alone in the dark, furious, trying to find some matches, and\r\nnot able to do so. At last I got some and I went into the passage,\r\nfeeling half mad, with my candlestick in my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was I about to do? I did not stop to reason, I only wanted to find\r\nher, and I would. I went a few steps without reflecting, but then I\r\nsuddenly thought: 'Suppose I should walk into the uncle's room what\r\nshould I say?' And I stood still, with my head a void and my heart\r\nbeating. But in a few moments I thought of an answer: 'Of course, I\r\nshall say that I was looking for Rivet's room to speak to him about an\r\nimportant matter,' and I began to inspect all the doors, trying to find\r\nhers, and at last I took hold of a handle at a venture, turned it and\r\nwent in. There was Henriette, sitting on her bed and looking at me in\r\ntears. So I gently turned the key, and going up to her on tiptoe I said:\r\n'I forgot to ask you for something to read, mademoiselle.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was stealthily returning to my room when a rough hand seized me and a\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94it was Rivet's\xe2\x80\x94whispered in my ear: 'So you have not yet quite\r\nsettled that affair of Morin's?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt seven o'clock the next morning Henriette herself brought me a cup of\r\nchocolate. I never have drunk anything like it, soft, velvety, perfumed,\r\ndelicious. I could hardly take away my lips from the cup, and she had\r\nhardly left the room when Rivet came in. He seemed nervous and\r\nirritable, like a man who had not slept, and he said to me crossly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'If you go on like this you will end by spoiling the affair of that pig\r\nof a Morin!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt eight o'clock the aunt arrived. Our discussion was very short, for\r\nthey withdrew their complaint, and I left five hundred francs for the\r\npoor of the town. They wanted to keep us for the day, and they arranged\r\nan excursion to go and see some ruins. Henriette made signs to me to\r\nstay, behind her parents' back, and I accepted, but Rivet was determined\r\nto go, and though I took him aside and begged and prayed him to do this\r\nfor me, he appeared quite exasperated and kept saying to me: 'I have had\r\nenough of that pig of a Morin's affair, do you hear?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I was obliged to leave also, and it was one of the hardest\r\nmoments of my life. I could have gone on arranging that business as long\r\nas I lived, and when we were in the railway carriage, after shaking\r\nhands with her in silence, I said to Rivet: 'You are a mere brute!' And\r\nhe replied: 'My dear fellow, you were beginning to annoy me\r\nconfoundedly.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn getting to the Fanal office, I saw a crowd waiting for us, and as\r\nsoon as they saw us they all exclaimed: 'Well, have you settled the\r\naffair of that pig of a Morin?' All La Rochelle was excited about it,\r\nand Rivet, who had got over his ill-humor on the journey, had great\r\ndifficulty in keeping himself from laughing as he said: 'Yes, we have\r\nmanaged it, thanks to Labarbe: And we went to Morin's.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was sitting in an easy-chair with mustard plasters on his legs and\r\ncold bandages on his head, nearly dead with misery. He was coughing with\r\nthe short cough of a dying man, without any one knowing how he had\r\ncaught it, and his wife looked at him like a tigress ready to eat him,\r\nand as soon as he saw us he trembled so violently as to make his hands\r\nand knees shake, so I said to him immediately: 'It is all settled, you\r\ndirty scamp, but don't do such a thing again.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got up, choking, took my hands and kissed them as if they had\r\nbelonged to a prince, cried, nearly fainted, embraced Rivet and even\r\nkissed Madame Morin, who gave him such a push as to send him staggering\r\nback into his chair; but he never got over the blow; his mind had been\r\ntoo much upset. In all the country round, moreover, he was called\r\nnothing but 'that pig of a Morin,' and that epithet went through him\r\nlike a sword-thrust every time he heard it. When a street boy called\r\nafter him 'Pig!' he turned his head instinctively. His friends also\r\noverwhelmed him with horrible jokes and used to ask him, whenever they\r\nwere eating ham, 'Is it a bit of yourself?' He died two years later.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for myself, when I was a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies in\r\n1875, I called on the new notary at Fousserre, Monsieur Belloncle, to\r\nsolicit his vote, and a tall, handsome and evidently wealthy lady\r\nreceived me. 'You do not know me again?' she said. And I stammered out:\r\n'Why\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94madame.' 'Henriette Bonnel.' 'Ah!' And I felt myself turning\r\npale, while she seemed perfectly at her ease and looked at me with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as she had left me alone with her husband he took both my\r\nhands, and, squeezing them as if he meant to crush them, he said: 'I\r\nhave been intending to go and see you for a long time, my dear sir, for\r\nmy wife has very often talked to me about you. I know\xe2\x80\x94yes, I know under\r\nwhat painful circumstances you made her acquaintance, and I know also\r\nhow perfectly you behaved, how full of delicacy, tact and devotion you\r\nshowed yourself in the affair\xe2\x80\x94' He hesitated and then said in a lower\r\ntone, as if he had been saying something low and coarse, 'in the affair\r\nof that pig of a Morin.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT ANTHONY\r\n\r\nThey called him Saint Anthony, because his name was Anthony, and also,\r\nperhaps, because he was a good fellow, jovial, a lover of practical\r\njokes, a tremendous eater and a heavy drinker and a gay fellow, although\r\nhe was sixty years old.\r\n\r\nHe was a big peasant of the district of Caux, with a red face, large\r\nchest and stomach, and perched on two legs that seemed too slight for\r\nthe bulk of his body.\r\n\r\nHe was a widower and lived alone with his two men servants and a maid on\r\nhis farm, which he conducted with shrewd economy. He was careful of his\r\nown interests, understood business and the raising of cattle, and\r\nfarming. His two sons and his three daughters, who had married well,\r\nwere living in the neighborhood and came to dine with their father once\r\na month. His vigor of body was famous in all the countryside. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is as\r\nstrong as Saint Anthony,\xe2\x80\x9d had become a kind of proverb.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Prussian invasion Saint Anthony, at the wine shop,\r\npromised to eat an army, for he was a braggart, like a true Norman, a\r\nbit of a coward and a blusterer. He banged his fist on the wooden table,\r\nmaking the cups and the brandy glasses dance, and cried with the assumed\r\nwrath of a good fellow, with a flushed face and a sly look in his eye:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to eat some of them, nom de Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d He reckoned that the\r\nPrussians would not come as far as Tanneville, but when he heard they\r\nwere at Rautot he never went out of the house, and constantly watched\r\nthe road from the little window of his kitchen, expecting at any moment\r\nto see the bayonets go by.\r\n\r\nOne morning as he was eating his luncheon with the servants the door\r\nopened and the mayor of the commune, Maitre Chicot, appeared, followed\r\nby a soldier wearing a black copper-pointed helmet. Saint Anthony\r\nbounded to his feet and his servants all looked at him, expecting to see\r\nhim slash the Prussian. But he merely shook hands with the mayor, who\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is one for you, Saint Anthony. They came last night. Don't do\r\nanything foolish, above all things, for they talked of shooting and\r\nburning everything if there is the slightest unpleasantness, I have\r\ngiven you warning. Give him something to eat; he looks like a good\r\nfellow. Good-day. I am going to call on the rest. There are enough for\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went out.\r\n\r\nFather Anthony, who had turned pale, looked at the Prussian. He was a\r\nbig, young fellow with plump, white skin, blue eyes, fair hair, unshaven\r\nto his cheek bones, who looked stupid, timid and good. The shrewd Norman\r\nread him at once, and, reassured, he made him a sign to sit down. Then\r\nhe said: \xe2\x80\x9cWill you take some soup?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger did not understand. Anthony then became bolder, and pushing\r\na plateful of soup right under his nose, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cHere, swallow that,\r\nbig pig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier answered \xe2\x80\x9cYa,\xe2\x80\x9d and began to eat greedily, while the farmer,\r\ntriumphant, feeling he had regained his reputation, winked his eye at\r\nthe servants, who were making strange grimaces, what with their terror\r\nand their desire to laugh.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prussian had devoured his soup, Saint Anthony gave him another\r\nplateful, which disappeared in like manner; but he flinched at the third\r\nwhich the farmer tried to insist on his eating, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, put that\r\ninto your stomach; 'twill fatten you or it is your own fault, eh, pig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier, understanding only that they wanted to make him eat all his\r\nsoup, laughed in a contented manner, making a sign to show that he could\r\nnot hold any more.\r\n\r\nThen Saint Anthony, become quite familiar, tapped him on the stomach,\r\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cMy, there is plenty in my pig's belly!\xe2\x80\x9d But suddenly he began\r\nto writhe with laughter, unable to speak. An idea had struck him which\r\nmade him choke with mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's it, that's it, Saint Anthony and his\r\npig. There's my pig!\xe2\x80\x9d And the three servants burst out laughing in their\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nThe old fellow was so pleased that he had the brandy brought in, good\r\nstuff, 'fil en dix', and treated every one. They clinked glasses with\r\nthe Prussian, who clacked his tongue by way of flattery to show that he\r\nenjoyed it. And Saint Anthony exclaimed in his face: \xe2\x80\x9cEh, is not that\r\nsuperfine? You don't get anything like that in your home, pig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom that time Father Anthony never went out without his Prussian. He\r\nhad got what he wanted. This was his vengeance, the vengeance of an old\r\nrogue. And the whole countryside, which was in terror, laughed to split\r\nits sides at Saint Anthony's joke. Truly, there was no one like him when\r\nit came to humor. No one but he would have thought of a thing like that.\r\nHe was a born joker!\r\n\r\nHe went to see his neighbors every day, arm in arm with his German, whom\r\nhe introduced in a jovial manner, tapping him on the shoulder: \xe2\x80\x9cSee,\r\nhere is my pig; look and see if he is not growing fat, the animal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the peasants would beam with smiles. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is so comical, that\r\nreckless fellow, Antoine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will sell him to you, Cesaire, for three pistoles\xe2\x80\x9d (thirty francs).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take him, Antoine, and I invite you to eat some black pudding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want is his feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel his belly; you will see that it is all fat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they all winked at each other, but dared not laugh too loud, for\r\nfear the Prussian might finally suspect they were laughing at him.\r\nAnthony, alone growing bolder every day, pinched his thighs, exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but fat\xe2\x80\x9d; tapped him on the back, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is all\r\nbacon\xe2\x80\x9d; lifted him up in his arms as an old Colossus that could have\r\nlifted an anvil, declaring, \xe2\x80\x9cHe weighs six hundred and no waste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had got into the habit of making people offer his \xe2\x80\x9cpig\xe2\x80\x9d something to\r\neat wherever they went together. This was the chief pleasure, the great\r\ndiversion every day. \xe2\x80\x9cGive him whatever you please, he will swallow\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d And they offered the man bread and butter, potatoes, cold\r\nmeat, chitterlings, which caused the remark, \xe2\x80\x9cSome of your own, and\r\nchoice ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier, stupid and gentle, ate from politeness, charmed at these\r\nattentions, making himself ill rather than refuse, and he was actually\r\ngrowing fat and his uniform becoming tight for him. This delighted Saint\r\nAnthony, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, my pig, that we shall have to have another\r\ncage made for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had, however, become the best friends in the world, and when the\r\nold fellow went to attend to his business in the neighborhood the\r\nPrussian accompanied him for the simple pleasure of being with him.\r\n\r\nThe weather was severe; it was freezing hard. The terrible winter of\r\n1870 seemed to bring all the scourges on France at one time.\r\n\r\nFather Antoine, who made provision beforehand, and took advantage of\r\nevery opportunity, foreseeing that manure would be scarce for the spring\r\nfarming, bought from a neighbor who happened to be in need of money all\r\nthat he had, and it was agreed that he should go every evening with his\r\ncart to get a load.\r\n\r\nSo every day at twilight he set out for the farm of Haules, half a\r\nleague distant, always accompanied by his \xe2\x80\x9cpig.\xe2\x80\x9d And each time it was a\r\nfestival, feeding the animal. All the neighbors ran over there as they\r\nwould go to high mass on Sunday.\r\n\r\nBut the soldier began to suspect something, be mistrustful, and when\r\nthey laughed too loud he would roll his eyes uneasily, and sometimes\r\nthey lighted up with anger.\r\n\r\nOne evening when he had eaten his fill he refused to swallow another\r\nmorsel, and attempted to rise to leave the table. But Saint Anthony\r\nstopped him by a turn of the wrist and, placing his two powerful hands\r\non his shoulders, he sat him down again so roughly that the chair\r\nsmashed under him.\r\n\r\nA wild burst of laughter broke forth, and Anthony, beaming, picked up\r\nhis pig, acted as though he were dressing his wounds, and exclaimed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you will not eat, you shall drink, nom de Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d And they went to\r\nthe wine shop to get some brandy.\r\n\r\nThe soldier rolled his eyes, which had a wicked expression, but he\r\ndrank, nevertheless; he drank as long as they wanted him, and Saint\r\nAnthony held his head to the great delight of his companions.\r\n\r\nThe Norman, red as a tomato, his eyes ablaze, filled up the glasses and\r\nclinked, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cHere's to you!\xe2\x80\x9d. And the Prussian, without speaking a\r\nword, poured down one after another glassfuls of cognac.\r\n\r\nIt was a contest, a battle, a revenge! Who would drink the most, nom\r\nd'un nom! They could neither of them stand any more when the liter was\r\nemptied. But neither was conquered. They were tied, that was all. They\r\nwould have to begin again the next day.\r\n\r\nThey went out staggering and started for home, walking beside the dung\r\ncart which was drawn along slowly by two horses.\r\n\r\nSnow began to fall and the moonless night was sadly lighted by this dead\r\nwhiteness on the plain. The men began to feel the cold, and this\r\naggravated their intoxication. Saint Anthony, annoyed at not being the\r\nvictor, amused himself by shoving his companion so as to make him fall\r\nover into the ditch. The other would dodge backwards, and each time he\r\ndid he uttered some German expression in an angry tone, which made the\r\npeasant roar with laughter. Finally the Prussian lost his temper, and\r\njust as Anthony was rolling towards him he responded with such a\r\nterrific blow with his fist that the Colossus staggered.\r\n\r\nThen, excited by the brandy, the old man seized the pugilist round the\r\nwaist, shook him for a few moments as he would have done with a little\r\nchild, and pitched him at random to the other side of the road. Then,\r\nsatisfied with this piece of work, he crossed his arms and began to\r\nlaugh afresh.\r\n\r\nBut the soldier picked himself up in a hurry, his head bare, his helmet\r\nhaving rolled off, and drawing his sword he rushed over to Father\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw him coming the peasant seized his whip by the top of the\r\nhandle, his big holly wood whip, straight, strong and supple as the\r\nsinew of an ox.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian approached, his head down, making a lunge with his sword,\r\nsure of killing his adversary. But the old fellow, squarely hitting the\r\nblade, the point of which would have pierced his stomach, turned it\r\naside, and with the butt end of the whip struck the soldier a sharp blow\r\non the temple and he fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThen he, gazed aghast, stupefied with amazement, at the body, twitching\r\nconvulsively at first and then lying prone and motionless. He bent over\r\nit, turned it on its back, and gazed at it for some time. The man's eyes\r\nwere closed, and blood trickled from a wound at the side of his\r\nforehead. Although it was dark, Father Anthony could distinguish the\r\nbloodstain on the white snow.\r\n\r\nHe remained there, at his wit's end, while his cart continued slowly on\r\nits way.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do? He would be shot! They would burn his farm, ruin his\r\ndistrict! What should he do? What should he do? How could he hide the\r\nbody, conceal the fact of his death, deceive the Prussians? He heard\r\nvoices in the distance, amid the utter stillness of the snow. All at\r\nonce he roused himself, and picking up the helmet he placed it on his\r\nvictim's head. Then, seizing him round the body, he lifted him up in his\r\narms, and thus running with him, he overtook his team, and threw the\r\nbody on top of the manure. Once in his own house he would think up some\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly, racking his brain, but without result. He saw, he\r\nfelt, that he was lost. He entered his courtyard. A light was shining in\r\none of the attic windows; his maid was not asleep. He hastily backed his\r\nwagon to the edge of the manure hollow. He thought that by overturning\r\nthe manure the body lying on top of it would fall into the ditch and be\r\nburied beneath it, and he dumped the cart.\r\n\r\nAs he had foreseen, the man was buried beneath the manure. Anthony\r\nevened it down with his fork, which he stuck in the ground beside it. He\r\ncalled his stableman, told him to put up the horses, and went to his\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHe went to bed, still thinking of what he had best do, but no ideas came\r\nto him. His apprehension increased in the quiet of his room. They would\r\nshoot him! He was bathed in perspiration from fear, his teeth chattered,\r\nhe rose shivering, not being able to stay in bed.\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs to the kitchen, took the bottle of brandy from the\r\nsideboard and carried it upstairs. He drank two large glasses, one after\r\nanother, adding a fresh intoxication to the late one, without quieting\r\nhis mental anguish. He had done a pretty stroke of work, nom de Dieu,\r\nidiot!\r\n\r\nHe paced up and down, trying to think of some stratagem, some\r\nexplanations, some cunning trick, and from time to time he rinsed his\r\nmouth with a swallow of \xe2\x80\x9cfil en dix\xe2\x80\x9d to give him courage.\r\n\r\nBut no ideas came to him, not one.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight his watch dog, a kind of cross wolf called \xe2\x80\x9cDevorant,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbegan to howl frantically. Father Anthony shuddered to the marrow of his\r\nbones, and each time the beast began his long and lugubrious wail the\r\nold man's skin turned to goose flesh.\r\n\r\nHe had sunk into a chair, his legs weak, stupefied, done up, waiting\r\nanxiously for \xe2\x80\x9cDevorant\xe2\x80\x9d to set up another howl, and starting\r\nconvulsively from nervousness caused by terror.\r\n\r\nThe clock downstairs struck five. The dog was still howling. The peasant\r\nwas almost insane. He rose to go and let the dog loose, so that he\r\nshould not hear him. He went downstairs, opened the hall door, and\r\nstepped out into the darkness. The snow was still falling. The earth was\r\nall white, the farm buildings standing out like black patches. He\r\napproached the kennel. The dog was dragging at his chain. He unfastened\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cDevorant\xe2\x80\x9d gave a bound, then stopped short, his hair bristling, his\r\nlegs rigid, his muzzle in the air, his nose pointed towards the manure\r\nheap.\r\n\r\nSaint Anthony, trembling from head to foot, faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter with you, you dirty hound?\xe2\x80\x9d and he walked a few steps\r\nforward, gazing at the indistinct outlines, the sombre shadow of the\r\ncourtyard.\r\n\r\nThen he saw a form, the form of a man sitting on the manure heap!\r\n\r\nHe gazed at it, paralyzed by fear, and breathing hard. But all at once\r\nhe saw, close by, the handle of the manure fork which was sticking in\r\nthe ground. He snatched it up and in one of those transports of fear\r\nthat will make the greatest coward brave he rushed forward to see what\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nIt was he, his Prussian, come to life, covered with filth from his bed\r\nof manure which had kept him warm. He had sat down mechanically, and\r\nremained there in the snow which sprinkled down, all covered with dirt\r\nand blood as he was, and still stupid from drinking, dazed by the blow\r\nand exhausted from his wound.\r\n\r\nHe perceived Anthony, and too sodden to understand anything, he made an\r\nattempt to rise. But the moment the old man recognized him, he foamed\r\nwith rage like a wild animal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, pig! pig!\xe2\x80\x9d he sputtered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not dead! You are going to\r\ndenounce me now\xe2\x80\x94wait\xe2\x80\x94wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd rushing on the German with all the strength of leis arms he flung\r\nthe raised fork like a lance and buried the four prongs full length in\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\nThe soldier fell over on his back, uttering a long death moan, while the\r\nold peasant, drawing the fork out of his breast, plunged it over and\r\nover again into his abdomen, his stomach, his throat, like a madman,\r\npiercing the body from head to foot, as it still quivered, and the blood\r\ngushed out in streams.\r\n\r\nFinally he stopped, exhausted by his arduous work, swallowing great\r\nmouthfuls of air, calmed down at the completion of the murder.\r\n\r\nAs the cocks were beginning to crow in the poultry yard and it was near\r\ndaybreak, he set to work to bury the man.\r\n\r\nHe dug a hole in the manure till he reached the earth, dug down further,\r\nworking wildly, in a frenzy of strength with frantic motions of his arms\r\nand body.\r\n\r\nWhen the pit was deep enough he rolled the corpse into it with the fork,\r\ncovered it with earth, which he stamped down for some time, and then put\r\nback the manure, and he smiled as he saw the thick snow finishing his\r\nwork and covering up its traces with a white sheet.\r\n\r\nHe then stuck the fork in the manure and went into the house. His\r\nbottle, still half full of brandy stood on the table. He emptied it at a\r\ndraught, threw himself on his bed and slept heavily.\r\n\r\nHe woke up sober, his mind calm and clear, capable of judgment and\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour he was going about the country making inquiries\r\neverywhere for his soldier. He went to see the Prussian officer to find\r\nout why they had taken away his man.\r\n\r\nAs everyone knew what good friends they were, no one suspected him. He\r\neven directed the research, declaring that the Prussian went to see the\r\ngirls every evening.\r\n\r\nAn old retired gendarme who had an inn in the next village, and a pretty\r\ndaughter, was arrested and shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLASTING LOVE\r\n\r\nIt was the end of the dinner that opened the shooting season. The\r\nMarquis de Bertrans with his guests sat around a brightly lighted table,\r\ncovered with fruit and flowers. The conversation drifted to love.\r\nImmediately there arose an animated discussion, the same eternal\r\ndiscussion as to whether it were possible to love more than once.\r\nExamples were given of persons who had loved once; these were offset by\r\nthose who had loved violently many times. The men agreed that passion,\r\nlike sickness, may attack the same person several times, unless it\r\nstrikes to kill. This conclusion seemed quite incontestable. The women,\r\nhowever, who based their opinion on poetry rather than on practical\r\nobservation, maintained that love, the great passion, may come only once\r\nto mortals. It resembles lightning, they said, this love. A heart once\r\ntouched by it becomes forever such a waste, so ruined, so consumed, that\r\nno other strong sentiment can take root there, not even a dream. The\r\nmarquis, who had indulged in many love affairs, disputed this belief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it is possible to love several times with all one's heart\r\nand soul. You quote examples of persons who have killed themselves for\r\nlove, to prove the impossibility of a second passion. I wager that if\r\nthey had not foolishly committed suicide, and so destroyed the\r\npossibility of a second experience, they would have found a new love,\r\nand still another, and so on till death. It is with love as with drink.\r\nHe who has once indulged is forever a slave. It is a thing of\r\ntemperament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey chose the old doctor as umpire. He thought it was as the marquis\r\nhad said, a thing of temperament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI once knew of a love which lasted fifty-five\r\nyears without one day's respite, and which ended only with death.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nwife of the marquis clasped her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is beautiful! Ah, what a dream to be loved in such a way! What\r\nbliss to live for fifty-five years enveloped in an intense, unwavering\r\naffection! How this happy being must have blessed his life to be so\r\nadored!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not mistaken, madame, on this point the loved one was a man.\r\nYou even know him; it is Monsieur Chouquet, the chemist. As to the\r\nwoman, you also know her, the old chair-mender, who came every year to\r\nthe chateau.\xe2\x80\x9d The enthusiasm of the women fell. Some expressed their\r\ncontempt with \xe2\x80\x9cPouah!\xe2\x80\x9d for the loves of common people did not interest\r\nthem. The doctor continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThree months ago I was called to the\r\ndeathbed of the old chair-mender. The priest had preceded me. She wished\r\nto make us the executors of her will. In order that we might understand\r\nher conduct, she told us the story of her life. It is most singular and\r\ntouching: Her father and mother were both chair-menders. She had never\r\nlived in a house. As a little child she wandered about with them, dirty,\r\nunkempt, hungry. They visited many towns, leaving their horse, wagon and\r\ndog just outside the limits, where the child played in the grass alone\r\nuntil her parents had repaired all the broken chairs in the place. They\r\nseldom spoke, except to cry, 'Chairs! Chairs! Chair-mender!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the little one strayed too far away, she would be called back by\r\nthe harsh, angry voice of her father. She never heard a word of\r\naffection. When she grew older, she fetched and carried the broken\r\nchairs. Then it was she made friends with the children in the street,\r\nbut their parents always called them away and scolded them for speaking\r\nto the barefooted child. Often the boys threw stones at her. Once a kind\r\nwoman gave her a few pennies. She saved them most carefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day\xe2\x80\x94she was then eleven years old\xe2\x80\x94as she was walking through a\r\ncountry town she met, behind the cemetery, little Chouquet, weeping\r\nbitterly, because one of his playmates had stolen two precious liards\r\n(mills). The tears of the small bourgeois, one of those much-envied\r\nmortals, who, she imagined, never knew trouble, completely upset her.\r\nShe approached him and, as soon as she learned the cause of his grief,\r\nshe put into his hands all her savings. He took them without hesitation\r\nand dried his eyes. Wild with joy, she kissed him. He was busy counting\r\nhis money, and did not object. Seeing that she was not repulsed, she\r\nthrew her arms round him and gave him a hug\xe2\x80\x94then she ran away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was going on in her poor little head? Was it because she had\r\nsacrificed all her fortune that she became madly fond of this youngster,\r\nor was it because she had given him the first tender kiss? The mystery\r\nis alike for children and for those of riper years. For months she\r\ndreamed of that corner near the cemetery and of the little chap. She\r\nstole a sou here and, there from her parents on the chair money or\r\ngroceries she was sent to buy. When she returned to the spot near the\r\ncemetery she had two francs in her pocket, but he was not there. Passing\r\nhis father's drug store, she caught sight of him behind the counter. He\r\nwas sitting between a large red globe and a blue one. She only loved him\r\nthe more, quite carried away at the sight of the brilliant-colored\r\nglobes. She cherished the recollection of it forever in her heart. The\r\nfollowing year she met him near the school playing marbles. She rushed\r\nup to him, threw her arms round him, and kissed him so passionately that\r\nhe screamed, in fear. To quiet him, she gave him all her money. Three\r\nfrancs and twenty centimes! A real gold mine, at which he gazed with\r\nstaring eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter this he allowed her to kiss him as much as she wished. During the\r\nnext four years she put into his hands all her savings, which he\r\npocketed conscientiously in exchange for kisses. At one time it was\r\nthirty sous, at another two francs. Again, she only had twelve sous. She\r\nwept with grief and shame, explaining brokenly that it had been a poor\r\nyear. The next time she brought five francs, in one whole piece, which\r\nmade her laugh with joy. She no longer thought of any one but the boy,\r\nand he watched for her with impatience; sometimes he would run to meet\r\nher. This made her heart thump with joy. Suddenly he disappeared. He had\r\ngone to boarding school. She found this out by careful investigation.\r\nThen she used great diplomacy to persuade her parents to change their\r\nroute and pass by this way again during vacation. After a year of\r\nscheming she succeeded. She had not seen him for two years, and scarcely\r\nrecognized him, he was so changed, had grown taller, better looking and\r\nwas imposing in his uniform, with its brass buttons. He pretended not to\r\nsee her, and passed by without a glance. She wept for two days and from\r\nthat time loved and suffered unceasingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery year he came home and she passed him, not daring to lift her\r\neyes. He never condescended to turn his head toward her. She loved him\r\nmadly, hopelessly. She said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He is the only man whom I have ever seen. I don't even know if another\r\nexists.' Her parents died. She continued their work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day, on entering the village, where her heart always remained, she\r\nsaw Chouquet coming out of his pharmacy with a young lady leaning on his\r\narm. She was his wife. That night the chair-mender threw herself into\r\nthe river. A drunkard passing the spot pulled her out and took her to\r\nthe drug store. Young Chouquet came down in his dressing gown to revive\r\nher. Without seeming to know who she was he undressed her and rubbed\r\nher; then he said to her, in a harsh voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are mad! People must not do stupid things like that.' His voice\r\nbrought her to life again. He had spoken to her! She was happy for a\r\nlong time. He refused remuneration for his trouble, although she\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll her life passed in this way. She worked, thinking always of him.\r\nShe began to buy medicines at his pharmacy; this gave her a chance to\r\ntalk to him and to see him closely. In this way, she was still able to\r\ngive him money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I said before, she died this spring. When she had closed her\r\npathetic story she entreated me to take her earnings to the man she\r\nloved. She had worked only that she might leave him something to remind\r\nhim of her after her death. I gave the priest fifty francs for her\r\nfuneral expenses. The next morning I went to see the Chouquets. They\r\nwere finishing breakfast, sitting opposite each other, fat and red,\r\nimportant and self-satisfied. They welcomed me and offered me some\r\ncoffee, which I accepted. Then I began my story in a trembling voice,\r\nsure that they would be softened, even to tears. As soon as Chouquet\r\nunderstood that he had been loved by 'that vagabond! that chair-mender!\r\nthat wanderer!' he swore with indignation as though his reputation had\r\nbeen sullied, the respect of decent people lost, his personal honor,\r\nsomething precious and dearer to him than life, gone. His exasperated\r\nwife kept repeating: 'That beggar! That beggar!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeming unable to find words suitable to the enormity, he stood up and\r\nbegan striding about. He muttered: 'Can you understand anything so\r\nhorrible, doctor? Oh, if I had only known it while she was alive, I\r\nshould have had her thrown into prison. I promise you she would not have\r\nescaped.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was dumfounded; I hardly knew what to think or say, but I had to\r\nfinish my mission. 'She commissioned me,' I said, 'to give you her\r\nsavings, which amount to three thousand five hundred francs. As what I\r\nhave just told you seems to be very disagreeable, perhaps you would\r\nprefer to give this money to the poor.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey looked at me, that man and woman,' speechless with amazement. I\r\ntook the few thousand francs from out of my pocket. Wretched-looking\r\nmoney from every country. Pennies and gold pieces all mixed together.\r\nThen I asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What is your decision?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Chouquet spoke first. 'Well, since it is the dying woman's wish,\r\nit seems to me impossible to refuse it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer husband said, in a shamefaced manner: 'We could buy something for\r\nour children with it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answered dryly: 'As you wish.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe replied: 'Well, give it to us anyhow, since she commissioned you to\r\ndo so; we will find a way to put it to some good purpose.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave them the money, bowed and left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day Chouquet came to me and said brusquely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'That woman left her wagon here\xe2\x80\x94what have you done with it?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Nothing; take it if you wish.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's just what I wanted,' he added, and walked off. I called him back\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'She also left her old horse and two dogs. Don't you need them?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stared at me surprised: 'Well, no! Really, what would I do with\r\nthem?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Dispose of them as you like.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe laughed and held out his hand to me. I shook it. What could I do?\r\nThe doctor and the druggist in a country village must not be at enmity.\r\nI have kept the dogs. The priest took the old horse. The wagon is useful\r\nto Chouquet, and with the money he has bought railroad stock. That is\r\nthe only deep, sincere love that I have ever known in all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked up. The marquise, whose eyes were full of tears,\r\nsighed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no denying the fact, only women know how to love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERROT\r\n\r\nMme. Lefevre was a country dame, a widow, one of these half peasants,\r\nwith ribbons and bonnets with trimming on them, one of those persons who\r\nclipped her words and put on great airs in public, concealing the soul\r\nof a pretentious animal beneath a comical and bedizened exterior, just\r\nas the country-folks hide their coarse red hands in ecru silk gloves.\r\n\r\nShe had a servant, a good simple peasant, called Rose.\r\n\r\nThe two women lived in a little house with green shutters by the side of\r\nthe high road in Normandy, in the centre of the country of Caux. As they\r\nhad a narrow strip of garden in front of the house, they grew some\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nOne night someone stole twelve onions. As soon as Rose became aware of\r\nthe theft, she ran to tell madame, who came downstairs in her woolen\r\npetticoat. It was a shame and a disgrace! They had robbed her, Mme.\r\nLefevre! As there were thieves in the country, they might come back.\r\n\r\nAnd the two frightened women examined the foot tracks, talking, and\r\nsupposing all sorts of things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, they went that way! They stepped on the wall, they jumped into the\r\ngarden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they became apprehensive for the future. How could they sleep in\r\npeace now!\r\n\r\nThe news of the theft spread. The neighbors came, making examinations\r\nand discussing the matter in their turn, while the two women explained\r\nto each newcomer what they had observed and their opinion.\r\n\r\nA farmer who lived near said to them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is true, they ought to have a dog, if it were only to give the\r\nalarm. Not a big dog. Heavens! what would they do with a big dog? He\r\nwould eat their heads off. But a little dog (in Normandy they say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cquin\xe2\x80\x9d), a little puppy who would bark.\r\n\r\nAs soon as everyone had left, Mme. Lefevre discussed this idea of a dog\r\nfor some time. On reflection she made a thousand objections, terrified\r\nat the idea of a bowl full of soup, for she belonged to that race of\r\nparsimonious country women who always carry centimes in their pocket to\r\ngive alms in public to beggars on the road and to put in the Sunday\r\ncollection plate.\r\n\r\nRose, who loved animals, gave her opinion and defended it shrewdly. So\r\nit was decided that they should have a dog, a very small dog.\r\n\r\nThey began to look for one, but could find nothing but big dogs, who\r\nwould devour enough soup to make one shudder. The grocer of Rolleville\r\nhad one, a tiny one, but he demanded two francs to cover the cost of\r\nsending it. Mme. Lefevre declared that she would feed a \xe2\x80\x9cquin,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nwould not buy one.\r\n\r\nThe baker, who knew all that occurred, brought in his wagon one morning\r\na strange little yellow animal, almost without paws, with the body of a\r\ncrocodile, the head of a fox, and a curly tail\xe2\x80\x94a true cockade, as big as\r\nall the rest of him. Mme. Lefevre thought this common cur that cost\r\nnothing was very handsome. Rose hugged it and asked what its name was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPierrot,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the baker.\r\n\r\nThe dog was installed in an old soap box and they gave it some water\r\nwhich it drank. They then offered it a piece of bread. He ate it. Mme.\r\nLefevre, uneasy, had an idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he is thoroughly accustomed to the house we can let him run. He\r\ncan find something to eat, roaming about the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey let him run, in fact, which did not prevent him from being\r\nfamished. Also he never barked except to beg for food, and then he\r\nbarked furiously.\r\n\r\nAnyone might come into the garden, and Pierrot would run up and fawn on\r\neach one in turn and not utter a bark.\r\n\r\nMme. Lefevre, however, had become accustomed to the animal. She even\r\nwent so far as to like it and to give it from time to time pieces of\r\nbread soaked in the gravy on her plate.\r\n\r\nBut she had not once thought of the dog tax, and when they came to\r\ncollect eight francs\xe2\x80\x94eight francs, madame\xe2\x80\x94for this puppy who never even\r\nbarked, she almost fainted from the shock.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately decided that they must get rid of Pierrot. No one\r\nwanted him. Every one declined to take him for ten leagues around. Then\r\nthey resolved, not knowing what else to do, to make him \xe2\x80\x9cpiquer du mas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPiquer du mas\xe2\x80\x9d means to eat chalk. When one wants to get rid of a dog\r\nthey make him \xe2\x80\x9cPiquer du mas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the midst of an immense plain one sees a kind of hut, or rather a\r\nvery small roof standing above the ground. This is the entrance to the\r\nclay pit. A big perpendicular hole is sunk for twenty metres underground\r\nand ends in a series of long subterranean tunnels.\r\n\r\nOnce a year they go down into the quarry at the time they fertilize the\r\nground. The rest of the year it serves as a cemetery for condemned dogs,\r\nand as one passed by this hole plaintive howls, furious or despairing\r\nbarks and lamentable appeals reach one's ear.\r\n\r\nSportsmen's dogs and sheep dogs flee in terror from this mournful place,\r\nand when one leans over it one perceives a disgusting odor of\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nFrightful dramas are enacted in the darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal has suffered down there for ten or twelve days, nourished\r\non the foul remains of his predecessors, another animal, larger and more\r\nvigorous, is thrown into the hole. There they are, alone, starving, with\r\nglittering eyes. They watch each other, follow each other, hesitate in\r\ndoubt. But hunger impels them; they attack each other, fight desperately\r\nfor some time, and the stronger eats the weaker, devours him alive.\r\n\r\nWhen it was decided to make Pierrot \xe2\x80\x9cpiquer du mas\xe2\x80\x9d they looked round\r\nfor an executioner. The laborer who mended the road demanded six sous to\r\ntake the dog there. That seemed wildly exorbitant to Mme. Lefevre. The\r\nneighbor's hired boy wanted five sous; that was still too much. So Rose\r\nhaving observed that they had better carry it there themselves, as in\r\nthat way it would not be brutally treated on the way and made to suspect\r\nits fate, they resolved to go together at twilight.\r\n\r\nThey offered the dog that evening a good dish of soup with a piece of\r\nbutter in it. He swallowed every morsel of it, and as he wagged his tail\r\nwith delight Rose put him in her apron.\r\n\r\nThey walked quickly, like thieves, across the plain. They soon perceived\r\nthe chalk pit and walked up to it. Mme. Lefevre leaned over to hear if\r\nany animal was moaning. No, there were none there; Pierrot would be\r\nalone. Then Rose, who was crying, kissed the dog and threw him into the\r\nchalk pit, and they both leaned over, listening.\r\n\r\nFirst they heard a dull sound, then the sharp, bitter, distracting cry\r\nof an animal in pain, then a succession of little mournful cries, then\r\ndespairing appeals, the cries of a dog who is entreating, his head\r\nraised toward the opening of the pit.\r\n\r\nHe yelped, oh, how he yelped!\r\n\r\nThey were filled with remorse, with terror, with a wild inexplicable\r\nfear, and ran away from the spot. As Rose went faster Mme. Lefevre\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x9cWait for me, Rose, wait for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt night they were haunted by frightful nightmares.\r\n\r\nMme. Lefevre dreamed she was sitting down at table to eat her soup, but\r\nwhen she uncovered the tureen Pierrot was in it. He jumped out and bit\r\nher nose.\r\n\r\nShe awoke and thought she heard him yelping still. She listened, but she\r\nwas mistaken.\r\n\r\nShe fell asleep again and found herself on a high road, an endless road,\r\nwhich she followed. Suddenly in the middle of the road she perceived a\r\nbasket, a large farmer's basket, lying there, and this basket frightened\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe ended by opening it, and Pierrot, concealed in it, seized her hand\r\nand would not let go. She ran away in terror with the dog hanging to the\r\nend of her arm, which he held between his teeth.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak she arose, almost beside herself, and ran to the chalk pit.\r\n\r\nHe was yelping, yelping still; he had yelped all night. She began to sob\r\nand called him by all sorts of endearing names. He answered her with all\r\nthe tender inflections of his dog's voice.\r\n\r\nThen she wanted to see him again, promising herself that she would give\r\nhim a good home till he died.\r\n\r\nShe ran to the chalk digger, whose business it was to excavate for\r\nchalk, and told him the situation. The man listened, but said nothing.\r\nWhen she had finished he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want your dog? That will cost four francs.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave a jump. All\r\nher grief was at an end at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour francs!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would die of it! Four francs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I am going to bring my ropes, my windlass, and set it\r\nup, and go down there with my boy and let myself be bitten, perhaps, by\r\nyour cursed dog for the pleasure of giving it back to you? You should\r\nnot have thrown it down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked away, indignant. Four francs!\r\n\r\nAs soon as she entered the house she called Rose and told her of the\r\nquarryman's charges. Rose, always resigned, repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour francs! That is a good deal of money, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nwe could throw him something to eat, the poor dog, so he will not die of\r\nhunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Lefevre approved of this and was quite delighted. So they set out\r\nagain with a big piece of bread and butter.\r\n\r\nThey cut it in mouthfuls, which they threw down one after the other,\r\nspeaking by turns to Pierrot. As soon as the dog finished one piece he\r\nyelped for the next.\r\n\r\nThey returned that evening and the next day and every day. But they made\r\nonly one trip.\r\n\r\nOne morning as they were just letting fall the first mouthful they\r\nsuddenly heard a tremendous barking in the pit. There were two dogs\r\nthere. Another had been thrown in, a large dog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPierrot!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rose. And Pierrot yelped and yelped. Then they began to\r\nthrow down some food. But each time they noticed distinctly a terrible\r\nstruggle going on, then plaintive cries from Pierrot, who had been\r\nbitten by his companion, who ate up everything as he was the stronger.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that they specified, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is for you, Pierrot.\xe2\x80\x9d Pierrot evidently got nothing.\r\n\r\nThe two women, dumfounded, looked at each other and Mme. Lefevre said in\r\na sour tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not feed all the dogs they throw in there! We must give it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, suffocating at the thought of all the dogs living at her expense,\r\nshe went away, even carrying back what remained of the bread, which she\r\nate as she walked along.\r\n\r\nRose followed her, wiping her eyes on the corner of her blue apron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NORMANDY JOKE\r\n\r\nIt was a wedding procession that was coming along the road between the\r\ntall trees that bounded the farms and cast their shadow on the road. At\r\nthe head were the bride and groom, then the family, then the invited\r\nguests, and last of all the poor of the neighborhood. The village\r\nurchins who hovered about the narrow road like flies ran in and out of\r\nthe ranks or climbed up the trees to see it better.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom was a good-looking young fellow, Jean Patu, the richest\r\nfarmer in the neighborhood, but he was above all things, an ardent\r\nsportsman who seemed to take leave of his senses in order to satisfy\r\nthat passion, and who spent large sums on his dogs, his keepers, his\r\nferrets and his guns. The bride, Rosalie Roussel, had been courted by\r\nall the likely young fellows in the district, for they all thought her\r\nhandsome and they knew that she would have a good dowry. But she had\r\nchosen Patu; partly, perhaps, because she liked him better than she did\r\nthe others, but still more, like a careful Normandy girl, because he had\r\nmore crown pieces.\r\n\r\nAs they entered the white gateway of the husband's farm, forty shots\r\nresounded without their seeing those who fired, as they were hidden in\r\nthe ditches. The noise seemed to please the men, who were slouching\r\nalong heavily in their best clothes, and Patu left his wife, and running\r\nup to a farm servant whom he perceived behind a tree, took his gun and\r\nfired a shot himself, as frisky as a young colt. Then they went on,\r\nbeneath the apple trees which were heavy with fruit, through the high\r\ngrass and through the midst of the calves, who looked at them with their\r\ngreat eyes, got up slowly and remained standing, with their muzzles\r\nturned toward the wedding party.\r\n\r\nThe men became serious when they came within measurable distance of the\r\nwedding dinner. Some of them, the rich ones, had on tall, shining silk\r\nhats, which seemed altogether out of place there; others had old head-\r\ncoverings with a long nap, which might have been taken for moleskin,\r\nwhile the humblest among them wore caps. All the women had on shawls,\r\nwhich they wore loosely on their back, holding the tips ceremoniously\r\nunder their arms. They were red, parti-colored, flaming shawls, and\r\ntheir brightness seemed to astonish the black fowls on the dung-heap,\r\nthe ducks on the side of the pond and the pigeons on the thatched roofs.\r\n\r\nThe extensive farm buildings seemed to be waiting there at the end of\r\nthat archway of apple trees, and a sort of vapor came out of open door\r\nand windows and an almost overpowering odor of eatables was exhaled from\r\nthe vast building, from all its openings and from its very walls. The\r\nstring of guests extended through the yard; but when the foremost of\r\nthem reached the house, they broke the chain and dispersed, while those\r\nbehind were still coming in at the open gate. The ditches were now lined\r\nwith urchins and curious poor people, and the firing did not cease, but\r\ncame from every side at once, and a cloud of smoke, and that odor which\r\nhas the same intoxicating effect as absinthe, blended with the\r\natmosphere. The women were shaking their dresses outside the door, to\r\nget rid of the dust, were undoing their cap-strings and pulling their\r\nshawls over their arms, and then they went into the house to lay them\r\naside altogether for the time. The table was laid in the great kitchen\r\nthat would hold a hundred persons; they sat down to dinner at two\r\no'clock; and at eight o'clock they were still eating, and the men, in\r\ntheir shirt-sleeves, with their waistcoats unbuttoned and with red\r\nfaces, were swallowing down the food and drink as if they had been\r\nwhirlpools. The cider sparkled merrily, clear and golden in the large\r\nglasses, by the side of the dark, blood-colored wine, and between every\r\ndish they made a \xe2\x80\x9chole,\xe2\x80\x9d the Normandy hole, with a glass of brandy which\r\ninflamed the body and put foolish notions into the head. Low jokes were\r\nexchanged across the table until the whole arsenal of peasant wit was\r\nexhausted. For the last hundred years the same broad stories had served\r\nfor similar occasions, and, although every one knew them, they still hit\r\nthe mark and made both rows of guests roar with laughter.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the table four young fellows, who were neighbors, were\r\npreparing some practical jokes for the newly married couple, and they\r\nseemed to have got hold of a good one by the way they whispered and\r\nlaughed, and suddenly one of them, profiting by a moment of silence,\r\nexclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cThe poachers will have a good time to-night, with this moon!\r\nI say, Jean, you will not be looking at the moon, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nbridegroom turned to him quickly and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly let them come,\r\nthat's all!\xe2\x80\x9d But the other young fellow began to laugh, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI do\r\nnot think you will pay much attention to them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole table was convulsed with laughter, so that the glasses shook,\r\nbut the bridegroom became furious at the thought that anybody would\r\nprofit by his wedding to come and poach on his land, and repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nonly say-just let them come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen there was a flood of talk with a double meaning which made the\r\nbride blush somewhat, although she was trembling with expectation; and\r\nwhen they had emptied the kegs of brandy they all went to bed. The young\r\ncouple went into their own room, which was on the ground floor, as most\r\nrooms in farmhouses are. As it was very warm, they opened the window and\r\nclosed the shutters. A small lamp in bad taste, a present from the\r\nbride's father, was burning on the chest of drawers, and the bed stood\r\nready to receive the young people.\r\n\r\nThe young woman had already taken off her wreath and her dress, and she\r\nwas in her petticoat, unlacing her boots, while Jean was finishing his\r\ncigar and looking at her out of the corners of his eyes. Suddenly, with\r\na brusque movement, like a man who is about to set to work, he took off\r\nhis coat. She had already taken off her boots, and was now pulling off\r\nher stockings, and then she said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cGo and hide yourself behind\r\nthe curtains while I get into bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed as if he were about to refuse; but at last he did as she asked\r\nhim, and in a moment she unfastened her petticoat, which slipped down,\r\nfell at her feet and lay on the ground. She left it there, stepped over\r\nit in her loose chemise and slipped into the bed, whose springs creaked\r\nbeneath her weight. He immediately went up to the bed, and, stooping\r\nover his wife, he sought her lips, which she hid beneath the pillow,\r\nwhen a shot was heard in the distance, in the direction of the forest of\r\nRapees, as he thought.\r\n\r\nHe raised himself anxiously, with his heart beating, and running to the\r\nwindow, he opened the shutters. The full moon flooded the yard with\r\nyellow light, and the reflection of the apple trees made black shadows\r\nat their feet, while in the distance the fields gleamed, covered with\r\nthe ripe corn. But as he was leaning out, listening to every sound in\r\nthe still night, two bare arms were put round his neck, and his wife\r\nwhispered, trying to pull him back: \xe2\x80\x9cDo leave them alone; it has nothing\r\nto do with you. Come to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round, put his arms round her, and drew her toward him, but\r\njust as he was laying her on the bed, which yielded beneath her weight,\r\nthey heard another report, considerably nearer this time, and Jean,\r\ngiving way to his tumultuous rage, swore aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cDamn it! They will\r\nthink I do not go out and see what it is because of you! Wait, wait a\r\nfew minutes!\xe2\x80\x9d He put on his shoes again, took down his gun, which was\r\nalways hanging within reach against the wall, and, as his wife threw\r\nherself on her knees in her terror, imploring him not to go, he hastily\r\nfreed himself, ran to the window and jumped into the yard.\r\n\r\nShe waited one hour, two hours, until daybreak, but her husband did not\r\nreturn. Then she lost her head, aroused the house, related how angry\r\nJean was, and said that he had gone after the poachers, and immediately\r\nall the male farm-servants, even the boys, went in search of their\r\nmaster. They found him two leagues from the farm, tied hand and foot,\r\nhalf dead with rage, his gun broken, his trousers turned inside out, and\r\nwith three dead hares hanging round his neck, and a placard on his chest\r\nwith these words: \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes on the chase loses his place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn later years, when he used to tell this story of his wedding night, he\r\nusually added: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! as far as a joke went it was a good joke. They\r\ncaught me in a snare, as if I had been a rabbit, the dirty brutes, and\r\nthey shoved my head into a bag. But if I can only catch them some day\r\nthey had better look out for themselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is how they amuse themselves in Normandy on a wedding day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER MATTHEW\r\n\r\nWe had just left Rouen and were galloping along the road to Jumieges.\r\nThe light carriage flew along across the level country. Presently the\r\nhorse slackened his pace to walk up the hill of Cantelen.\r\n\r\nOne sees there one of the most magnificent views in the world. Behind us\r\nlay Rouen, the city of churches, with its Gothic belfries, sculptured\r\nlike ivory trinkets; before us Saint Sever, the manufacturing suburb,\r\nwhose thousands of smoking chimneys rise amid the expanse of sky,\r\nopposite the thousand sacred steeples of the old city.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand the spire of the cathedral, the highest of human\r\nmonuments, on the other the engine of the power-house, its rival, and\r\nalmost as high, and a metre higher than the tallest pyramid in Egypt.\r\n\r\nBefore us wound the Seine, with its scattered islands and bordered by\r\nwhite banks, covered with a forest on the right and on the left immense\r\nmeadows, bounded by another forest yonder in the distance.\r\n\r\nHere and there large ships lay at anchor along the banks of the wide\r\nriver. Three enormous steam boats were starting out, one behind the\r\nother, for Havre, and a chain of boats, a bark, two schooners and a\r\nbrig, were going upstream to Rouen, drawn by a little tug that emitted a\r\ncloud of black smoke.\r\n\r\nMy companion, a native of the country, did not glance at this wonderful\r\nlandscape, but he smiled continually; he seemed to be amused at his\r\nthoughts. Suddenly he cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you will soon see something comical\xe2\x80\x94Father Matthew's chapel. That\r\nis a sweet morsel, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him in surprise. He continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you a whiff of Normandy that will stay by you. Father\r\nMatthew is the handsomest Norman in the province and his chapel is one\r\nof the wonders of the world, nothing more nor less. But I will first\r\ngive you a few words of explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Matthew, who is also called Father 'La Boisson,' is an old\r\nsergeant-major who has come back to his native land. He combines in\r\nadmirable proportions, making a perfect whole, the humbug of the old\r\nsoldier and the sly roguery of the Norman. On his return to Normandy,\r\nthanks to influence and incredible cleverness, he was made doorkeeper of\r\na votive chapel, a chapel dedicated to the Virgin and frequented chiefly\r\nby young women who have gone astray . . . . He composed and had painted\r\na special prayer to his 'Good Virgin.' This prayer is a masterpiece of\r\nunintentional irony, of Norman wit, in which jest is blended with fear\r\nof the saint and with the superstitious fear of the secret influence of\r\nsomething. He has not much faith in his protectress, but he believes in\r\nher a little through prudence, and he is considerate of her through\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is how this wonderful prayer begins:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Our good Madame Virgin Mary, natural protectress of girl mothers in\r\nthis land and all over the world, protect your servant who erred in a\r\nmoment of forgetfulness . . .'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ends thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Do not forget me, especially when you are with your holy spouse, and\r\nintercede with God the Father that he may grant me a good husband, like\r\nyour own.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis prayer, which was suppressed by the clergy of the district, is\r\nsold by him privately, and is said to be very efficacious for those who\r\nrecite it with unction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact he talks of the good Virgin as the valet de chambre of a\r\nredoubted prince might talk of his master who confided in him all his\r\nlittle private secrets. He knows a number of amusing anecdotes at his\r\nexpense which he tells confidentially among friends as they sit over\r\ntheir glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will see for yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the fees coming from the Virgin did not appear sufficient to him, he\r\nadded to the main figure a little business in saints. He has them all,\r\nor nearly all. There was not room enough in the chapel, so he stored\r\nthem in the wood-shed and brings them forth as soon as the faithful ask\r\nfor them. He carved these little wooden statues himself\xe2\x80\x94they are comical\r\nin the extreme\xe2\x80\x94and painted them all bright green one year when they were\r\npainting his house. You know that saints cure diseases, but each saint\r\nhas his specialty, and you must not confound them or make any blunders.\r\nThey are as jealous of each other as mountebanks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order that they may make no mistake, the old women come and consult\r\nMatthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'For diseases of the ear which saint is the best?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why, Saint Osyme is good and Saint Pamphilius is not bad.' But that is\r\nnot all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs Matthew has some time to spare, he drinks; but he drinks like a\r\nprofessional, with conviction, so much so that he is intoxicated\r\nregularly every evening. He is drunk, but he is aware of it. He is so\r\nwell aware of it that he notices each day his exact degree of\r\nintoxication. That is his chief occupation; the chapel is a secondary\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has invented\xe2\x80\x94listen and catch on\xe2\x80\x94he has invented the\r\n'Saoulometre.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such instrument, but Matthew's observations are as precise\r\nas those of a mathematician. You may hear him repeating incessantly:\r\n'Since Monday I have had more than forty-five,' or else 'I was between\r\nfifty-two and fifty-eight,' or else 'I had at least sixty-six to\r\nseventy,' or 'Hullo, cheat, I thought I was in the fifties and here I\r\nfind I had had seventy-five!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never makes a mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe declares that he never reached his limit, but as he acknowledges\r\nthat his observations cease to be exact when he has passed ninety, one\r\ncannot depend absolutely on the truth of that statement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Matthew acknowledges that he has passed ninety, you may rest\r\nassured that he is blind drunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn these occasions his wife, Melie, another marvel, flies into a fury.\r\nShe waits for him at the door of the house, and as he enters she roars\r\nat him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'So there you are, slut, hog, giggling sot!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Matthew, who is not laughing any longer, plants himself opposite\r\nher and says in a severe tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Be still, Melie; this is no time to talk; wait till to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she keeps on shouting at him, he goes up to her and says in a shaky\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Don't bawl any more. I have had about ninety; I am not counting any\r\nmore. Look out, I am going to hit you!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Melie beats a retreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf, on the following day, she reverts to the subject, he laughs in her\r\nface and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come, come! We have said enough. It is past. As long as I have not\r\nreached my limit there is no harm done. But if I go past that, I will\r\nallow you to correct me, my word on it!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had reached the top of the hill. The road entered the delightful\r\nforest of Roumare.\r\n\r\nAutumn, marvellous autumn, blended its gold and purple with the\r\nremaining traces of verdure. We passed through Duclair. Then, instead of\r\ngoing on to Jumieges, my friend turned to the left and, taking a\r\ncrosscut, drove in among the trees.\r\n\r\nAnd presently from the top of a high hill we saw again the magnificent\r\nvalley of the Seine and the winding river beneath us.\r\n\r\nAt our right a very small slate-covered building, with a bell tower as\r\nlarge as a sunshade, adjoined a pretty house with green Venetian blinds,\r\nand all covered with honeysuckle and roses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are some friends!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a big voice, and Matthew appeared on the\r\nthreshold. He was a man about sixty, thin and with a goatee and long,\r\nwhite mustache.\r\n\r\nMy friend shook him by the hand and introduced me, and Matthew took us\r\ninto a clean kitchen, which served also as a dining-room. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no elegant apartment, monsieur. I do not like to get too far\r\naway from the food. The saucepans, you see, keep me company.\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\nturning to my friend:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come on Thursday? You know quite well that this is the day\r\nI consult my Guardian Saint. I cannot go out this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd running to the door, he uttered a terrific roar: \xe2\x80\x9cMelie!\xe2\x80\x9d which must\r\nhave startled the sailors in the ships along the stream in the valley\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nMelie did not reply.\r\n\r\nThen Matthew winked his eye knowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not pleased with me, you see, because yesterday I was in the\r\nnineties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friend began to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the nineties, Matthew! How did you manage\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew. \xe2\x80\x9cLast year I found only twenty rasieres\r\n(an old dry measure) of apricots. There are no more, but those are the\r\nonly things to make cider of. So I made some, and yesterday I tapped the\r\nbarrel. Talk of nectar! That was nectar. You shall tell me what you\r\nthink of it. Polyte was here, and we sat down and drank a glass and\r\nanother without being satisfied (one could go on drinking it until to-\r\nmorrow), and at last, with glass after glass, I felt a chill at my\r\nstomach. I said to Polyte: 'Supposing we drink a glass of cognac to warm\r\nourselves?' He agreed. But this cognac, it sets you on fire, so that we\r\nhad to go back to the cider. But by going from chills to heat and heat\r\nto chills, I saw that I was in the nineties. Polyte was not far from his\r\nlimit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Melie appeared. At once, before bidding us good-day,\r\nshe cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat hog, you have both of you reached your limit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't say that, Melie; don't say that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, getting angry. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave never reached my limit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey gave us a delicious luncheon outside beneath two lime trees, beside\r\nthe little chapel and overlooking the vast landscape. And Matthew told\r\nus, with a mixture of humor and unexpected credulity, incredible stories\r\nof miracles.\r\n\r\nWe had drunk a good deal of delicious cider, sparkling and sweet, fresh\r\nand intoxicating, which he preferred to all other drinks, and were\r\nsmoking our pipes astride our chairs when two women appeared.\r\n\r\nThey were old, dried up and bent. After greeting us they asked for Saint\r\nBlanc. Matthew winked at us as he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will get him for you.\xe2\x80\x9d And he disappeared in his wood shed. He\r\nremained there fully five minutes. Then he came back with an expression\r\nof consternation. He raised his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know where he is. I cannot find him. I am quite sure that I had\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d Then making a speaking trumpet of his hands, he roared once more:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeli-e-a!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d replied his wife from the end of the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere's Saint Blanc? I cannot find him in the wood shed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Melie explained it this way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas not that the one you took last week to stop up a hole in the rabbit\r\nhutch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew gave a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy thunder, that may be!\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to the women, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey followed him. We did the same, almost choking with suppressed\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nSaint Blanc was indeed stuck into the earth like an ordinary stake,\r\ncovered with mud and dirt, and forming a corner for the rabbit hutch.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they perceived him, the two women fell on their knees,\r\ncrossed themselves and began to murmur an \xe2\x80\x9cOremus.\xe2\x80\x9d But Matthew darted\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are in the mud; I will get you a bundle of straw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to fetch the straw and made them a priedieu. Then, looking at\r\nhis muddy saint and doubtless afraid of bringing discredit on his\r\nbusiness, he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will clean him off a little for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a pail of water and a brush and began to scrub the wooden image\r\nvigorously, while the two old women kept on praying.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow he is all right.\xe2\x80\x9d And he took us back to the house to drink another\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nAs he was carrying the glass to his lips he stopped and said in a rather\r\nconfused manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, when I put Saint Blanc out with the rabbits I thought he\r\nwould not make any more money. For two years no one had asked for him.\r\nBut the saints, you see, they are never out of date.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 11.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UMBRELLA\r\n\r\nMme. Oreille was a very economical woman; she knew the value of a\r\ncentime, and possessed a whole storehouse of strict principles with\r\nregard to the multiplication of money, so that her cook found the\r\ngreatest difficulty in making what the servants call their market-penny,\r\nand her husband was hardly allowed any pocket money at all. They were,\r\nhowever, very comfortably off, and had no children; but it really pained\r\nMme. Oreille to see any money spent; it was like tearing at her\r\nheartstrings when she had to take any of those nice crown-pieces out of\r\nher pocket; and whenever she had to spend anything, no matter how\r\nnecessary it might be, she slept badly the next night.\r\n\r\nOreille was continually saying to his wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really might be more liberal, as we have no children, and never\r\nspend our income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't know what may happen,\xe2\x80\x9d she used to reply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is better to\r\nhave too much than too little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a little woman of about forty, very active, rather hasty,\r\nwrinkled, very neat and tidy, and with a very short temper.\r\n\r\nHer husband frequently complained of all the privations she made him\r\nendure; some of them were particularly painful to him, as they touched\r\nhis vanity.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the head clerks in the War Office, and only stayed on\r\nthere in obedience to his wife's wish, to increase their income which\r\nthey did not nearly spend.\r\n\r\nFor two years he had always come to the office with the same old patched\r\numbrella, to the great amusement of his fellow clerks. At last he got\r\ntired of their jokes, and insisted upon his wife buying him a new one.\r\nShe bought one for eight francs and a half, one of those cheap articles\r\nwhich large houses sell as an advertisement. When the men in the office\r\nsaw the article, which was being sold in Paris by the thousand, they\r\nbegan their jokes again, and Oreille had a dreadful time of it. They\r\neven made a song about it, which he heard from morning till night all\r\nover the immense building.\r\n\r\nOreille was very angry, and peremptorily told his wife to get him a new\r\none, a good silk one, for twenty francs, and to bring him the bill, so\r\nthat he might see that it was all right.\r\n\r\nShe bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger\r\nas she gave it to her husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will last you for five years at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOreille felt quite triumphant, and received a small ovation at the\r\noffice with his new acquisition.\r\n\r\nWhen he went home in the evening his wife said to him, looking at the\r\numbrella uneasily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not leave it fastened up with the elastic; it will very\r\nlikely cut the silk. You must take care of it, for I shall not buy you a\r\nnew one in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it, unfastened it, and remained dumfounded with astonishment\r\nand rage; in the middle of the silk there was a hole as big as a six-\r\npenny-piece; it had been made with the end of a cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed.\r\n\r\nHer husband replied quietly, without looking at it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was choking with rage, and could hardly get out a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94have\xe2\x80\x94burned\xe2\x80\x94your umbrella! Why\xe2\x80\x94you must be\xe2\x80\x94mad! Do you wish to\r\nruin us outright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round, and felt that he was growing pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that you have burned your umbrella. Just look here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd rushing at him, as if she were going to beat him, she violently\r\nthrust the little circular burned hole under his nose.\r\n\r\nHe was so utterly struck dumb at the sight of it that he could only\r\nstammer out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat-what is it? How should I know? I have done nothing, I will swear.\r\nI don't know what is the matter with the umbrella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been playing tricks with it at the office; you have been\r\nplaying the fool and opening it, to show it off!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only opened it once, to let them see what a nice one it was, that is\r\nall, I swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she shook with rage, and got up one of those conjugal scenes which\r\nmake a peaceable man dread the domestic hearth more than a battlefield\r\nwhere bullets are raining.\r\n\r\nShe mended it with a piece of silk cut out of the old umbrella, which\r\nwas of a different color, and the next day Oreille went off very humbly\r\nwith the mended article in his hand. He put it into a cupboard, and\r\nthought no more of it than of some unpleasant recollection.\r\n\r\nBut he had scarcely got home that evening when his wife took the\r\numbrella from him, opened it, and nearly had a fit when she saw what had\r\nbefallen it, for the disaster was irreparable. It was covered with small\r\nholes, which evidently proceeded from burns, just as if some one had\r\nemptied the ashes from a lighted pipe on to it. It was done for utterly,\r\nirreparably.\r\n\r\nShe looked at it without a word, in too great a passion to be able to\r\nsay anything. He, also, when he saw the damage, remained almost\r\ndumfounded, in a state of frightened consternation.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other, then he looked at the floor; and the next\r\nmoment she threw the useless article at his head, screaming out in a\r\ntransport of the most violent rage, for she had recovered her voice by\r\nthat time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you brute! you brute! You did it on purpose, but I will pay you out\r\nfor it. You shall not have another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the scene began again, and after the storm had raged for an\r\nhour, he at last was able to explain himself. He declared that he could\r\nnot understand it at all, and that it could only proceed from malice or\r\nfrom vengeance.\r\n\r\nA ring at the bell saved him; it was a friend whom they were expecting\r\nto dinner.\r\n\r\nMme. Oreille submitted the case to him. As for buying a new umbrella,\r\nthat was out of the question; her husband should not have another. The\r\nfriend very sensibly said that in that case his clothes would be\r\nspoiled, and they were certainly worth more than the umbrella. But the\r\nlittle woman, who was still in a rage, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, when it rains he may have the kitchen umbrella, for I\r\nwill not give him a new silk one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOreille utterly rebelled at such an idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthen I shall resign my post. I am not going to\r\nthe office with the kitchen umbrella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friend interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave this one re-covered; it will not cost much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mme. Oreille, being in the temper that she was, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will cost at least eight francs to re-cover it. Eight and eighteen\r\nare twenty-six. Just fancy, twenty-six francs for an umbrella! It is\r\nutter madness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friend, who was only a poor man of the middle classes, had an\r\ninspiration:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake your fire assurance pay for it. The companies pay for all articles\r\nthat are burned, as long as the damage has been done in your own house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing this advice the little woman calmed down immediately, and\r\nthen, after a moment's reflection, she said to her husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, before going to your office, you will go to the Maternelle\r\nAssurance Company, show them the state your umbrella is in, and make\r\nthem pay for the damage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Oreille fairly jumped, he was so startled at the proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not do it for my life! It is eighteen francs lost, that is all.\r\nIt will not ruin us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning he took a walking-stick when he went out, and, luckily,\r\nit was a fine day.\r\n\r\nLeft at home alone, Mme. Oreille could not get over the loss of her\r\neighteen francs by any means. She had put the umbrella on the dining-\r\nroom table, and she looked at it without being able to come to any\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nEvery moment she thought of the assurance company, but she did not dare\r\nto encounter the quizzical looks of the gentlemen who might receive her,\r\nfor she was very timid before people, and blushed at a mere nothing, and\r\nwas embarrassed when she had to speak to strangers.\r\n\r\nBut the regret at the loss of the eighteen francs pained her as if she\r\nhad been wounded. She tried not to think of it any more, and yet every\r\nmoment the recollection of the loss struck her painfully. What was she\r\nto do, however? Time went on, and she could not decide; but suddenly,\r\nlike all cowards, on making a resolve, she became determined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go, and we will see what will happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut first of all she was obliged to prepare the umbrella so that the\r\ndisaster might be complete, and the reason of it quite evident. She took\r\na match from the mantelpiece, and between the ribs she burned a hole as\r\nbig as the palm of her hand; then she delicately rolled it up, fastened\r\nit with the elastic band, put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quickly\r\ntoward the Rue de Rivoli, where the assurance office was.\r\n\r\nBut the nearer she got, the slower she walked. What was she going to\r\nsay, and what reply would she get?\r\n\r\nShe looked at the numbers of the houses; there were still twenty-eight.\r\nThat was all right, so she had time to consider, and she walked slower\r\nand slower. Suddenly she saw a door on which was a large brass plate\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x9cLa Maternelle Fire Assurance Office\xe2\x80\x9d engraved on it. Already! She\r\nwaited a moment, for she felt nervous and almost ashamed; then she\r\nwalked past, came back, walked past again, and came back again.\r\n\r\nAt last she said to herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go in, however, so I may as well do it sooner as later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not help noticing, however, how her heart beat as she entered.\r\nShe went into an enormous room with grated doors all round it, and above\r\nthem little openings at which a man's head appeared, and as a gentleman\r\ncarrying a number of papers passed her, she stopped him and said\r\ntimidly: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, monsieur, but can you tell me where I must\r\napply for payment for anything that has been accidentally burned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied in a sonorous voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first door on the left; that is the department you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis frightened her still more, and she felt inclined to run away, to\r\nput in no claim, to sacrifice her eighteen francs. But the idea of that\r\nsum revived her courage, and she went upstairs, out of breath, stopping\r\nat almost every other step.\r\n\r\nShe knocked at a door which she saw on the first landing, and a clear\r\nvoice said, in answer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe obeyed mechanically, and found herself in a large room where three\r\nsolemn gentlemen, all with a decoration in their buttonholes, were\r\nstanding talking.\r\n\r\nOne of them asked her: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could hardly get out her words, but stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cI have come\xe2\x80\x94I have\r\ncome on account of an accident, something\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c.\r\n\r\nHe very politely pointed out a seat to her,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will kindly sit down I will attend to you in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, returning to the other two, he went on with the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe company, gentlemen, does not consider that it is under any\r\nobligation to you for more than four hundred thousand francs, and we can\r\npay no attention to your claim to the further sum of a hundred thousand,\r\nwhich you wish to make us pay. Besides that, the surveyor's valuation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the others interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite enough, monsieur; the law courts will decide between us,\r\nand we have nothing further to do than to take our leave.\xe2\x80\x9d And they went\r\nout after mutual ceremonious bows.\r\n\r\nOh! if she could only have gone away with them, how gladly she would\r\nhave done it; she would have run away and given up everything. But it\r\nwas too late, for the gentleman came back, and said, bowing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could scarcely speak, but at last she managed to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come-for this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manager looked at the object which she held out to him in mute\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nWith trembling fingers she tried to undo the elastic, and succeeding,\r\nafter several attempts, she hastily opened the damaged remains of the\r\numbrella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks to me to be in a very bad state of health,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\ncompassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cost me twenty francs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with some hesitation.\r\n\r\nHe seemed astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cReally! As much as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was a capital article, and I wanted you to see the condition it\r\nis in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I see; very well. But I really do not understand what it can\r\nhave to do with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to feel uncomfortable; perhaps this company did not pay for\r\nsuch small articles, and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94it is burned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not deny it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nShe remained open-mouthed, not knowing what to say next; then, suddenly\r\nrecollecting that she had left out the main thing, she said hastily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Mme. Oreille; we are assured in La Maternelle, and I have come to\r\nclaim the value of this damage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only want you to have it re-covered,\xe2\x80\x9d she added quickly, fearing a\r\npositive refusal.\r\n\r\nThe manager was rather embarrassed, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, really, madame, we\r\ndo not sell umbrellas; we cannot undertake such kinds of repairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little woman felt her courage reviving; she was not going to give up\r\nwithout a struggle; she was not even afraid any more, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only want you to pay me the cost of repairing it; I can quite well\r\nget it done myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman seemed rather confused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, madame, it is such a very small matter! We are never asked to\r\ngive compensation for such trivial losses. You must allow that we cannot\r\nmake good pocket-handkerchiefs, gloves, brooms, slippers, all the small\r\narticles which are every day exposed to the chances of being burned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got red in the face, and felt inclined to fly into a rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, monsieur, last December one of our chimneys caught fire, and\r\ncaused at least five hundred francs' damage; M. Oreille made no claim on\r\nthe company, and so it is only just that it should pay for my umbrella\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manager, guessing that she was telling a lie, said, with a smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must acknowledge, madame, that it is very surprising that M.\r\nOreille should have asked no compensation for damages amounting to five\r\nhundred francs, and should now claim five or six francs for mending an\r\numbrella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was not the least put out, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, monsieur, the five hundred francs affected M.\r\nOreille's pocket, whereas this damage, amounting to eighteen francs,\r\nconcerns Mme. Oreille's pocket only, which is a totally different\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he saw that he had no chance of getting rid of her, and that he would\r\nonly be wasting his time, he said resignedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you kindly tell me how the damage was done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt that she had won the victory, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is how it happened, monsieur: In our hall there is a bronze stick\r\nand umbrella stand, and the other day, when I came in, I put my umbrella\r\ninto it. I must tell you that just above there is a shelf for the\r\ncandlesticks and matches. I put out my hand, took three or four matches,\r\nand struck one, but it missed fire, so I struck another, which ignited,\r\nbut went out immediately, and a third did the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manager interrupted her to make a joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they were government matches, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not understand him, and went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely. At any rate, the fourth caught fire, and I lit my candle,\r\nand went into my room to go to bed; but in a quarter of an hour I\r\nfancied that I smelt something burning, and I have always been terribly\r\nafraid of fire. If ever we have an accident it will not be my fault, I\r\nassure you. I am terribly nervous since our chimney was on fire, as I\r\ntold you; so I got up, and hunted about everywhere, sniffing like a dog\r\nafter game, and at last I noticed that my umbrella was burning. Most\r\nlikely a match had fallen between the folds and burned it. You can see\r\nhow it has damaged it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manager had taken his cue, and asked her: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you estimate the\r\ndamage at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not know what to say, as she was not certain what value to put\r\non it, but at last she replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you had better get it done yourself. I will leave it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe, however, naturally refused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madame, I cannot do that. Tell me the amount of your claim, that is\r\nall I want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think that\xe2\x80\x94Look here, monsieur, I do not want to make any money\r\nout of you, so I will tell you what we will do. I will take my umbrella\r\nto the maker, who will re-cover it in good, durable silk, and I will\r\nbring the bill to you. Will that suit you, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, madame; we will settle it so. Here is a note for the\r\ncashier, who will repay you whatever it costs you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave Mme. Oreille a slip of paper, who took it, got up and went out,\r\nthanking him, for she was in a hurry to escape lest he should change his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nShe went briskly through the streets, looking out for a really good\r\numbrella maker, and when she found a shop which appeared to be a first-\r\nclass one, she went in, and said, confidently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want this umbrella re-covered in silk, good silk. Use the very best\r\nand strongest you have; I don't mind what it costs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELHOMME'S BEAST\r\n\r\nThe coach for Havre was ready to leave Criquetot, and all the passengers\r\nwere waiting for their names to be called out, in the courtyard of the\r\nCommercial Hotel kept by Monsieur Malandain, Jr.\r\n\r\nIt was a yellow wagon, mounted on wheels which had once been yellow, but\r\nwere now almost gray through the accumulation of mud. The front wheels\r\nwere very small, the back ones, high and fragile, carried the large body\r\nof the vehicle, which was swollen like the belly of an animal. Three\r\nwhite horses, with enormous heads and great round knees, were the first\r\nthings one noticed. They were harnessed ready to draw this coach, which\r\nhad something of the appearance of a monster in its massive structure.\r\nThe horses seemed already asleep in front of the strange vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe driver, Cesaire Horlaville, a little man with a big paunch, supple\r\nnevertheless, through his constant habit of climbing over the wheels to\r\nthe top of the wagon, his face all aglow from exposure to the brisk air\r\nof the plains, to rain and storms, and also from the use of brandy, his\r\neyes twitching from the effect of constant contact with wind and hail,\r\nappeared in the doorway of the hotel, wiping his mouth on the back of\r\nhis hand. Large round baskets, full of frightened poultry, were standing\r\nin front of the peasant women. Cesaire Horlaville took them one after\r\nthe other and packed them on the top of his coach; then more gently, he\r\nloaded on those containing eggs; finally he tossed up from below several\r\nlittle bags of grain, small packages wrapped in handkerchiefs, pieces of\r\ncloth, or paper. Then he opened the back door, and drawing a list from\r\nhis pocket he called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le cure de Gorgeville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest advanced. He was a large, powerful, robust man with a red\r\nface and a genial expression. He hitched up his cassock to lift his\r\nfoot, just as the women hold up their skirts, and climbed into the\r\ncoach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe schoolmaster of Rollebose-les-Grinets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man hastened forward, tall, timid, wearing a long frock coat which\r\nfell to his knees, and he in turn disappeared through the open door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaitre Poiret, two seats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoiret approached, a tall, round-shouldered man, bent by the plow,\r\nemaciated through abstinence, bony, with a skin dried by a sparing use\r\nof water. His wife followed him, small and thin, like a tired animal,\r\ncarrying a large green umbrella in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaitre Rabot, two seats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRabot hesitated, being of an undecided nature. He asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe driver was going to answer with a jest, when Rabot dived head first\r\ntowards the door, pushed forward by a vigorous shove from his wife, a\r\ntall, square woman with a large, round stomach like a barrel, and hands\r\nas large as hams.\r\n\r\nRabot slipped into the wagon like a rat entering a hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaitre Caniveau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA large peasant, heavier than an ox, made the springs bend, and was in\r\nturn engulfed in the interior of the yellow chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaitre Belhomme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBelhomme, tall and thin, came forward, his neck bent, his head hanging,\r\na handkerchief held to his ear as if he were suffering from a terrible\r\ntoothache.\r\n\r\nAll these people wore the blue blouse over quaint and antique coats of a\r\nblack or greenish cloth, Sunday clothes which they would only uncover in\r\nthe streets of Havre. Their heads were covered by silk caps at high as\r\ntowers, the emblem of supreme elegance in the small villages of\r\nNormandy.\r\n\r\nCesaire Horlaville closed the door, climbed up on his box and snapped\r\nhis whip.\r\n\r\nThe three horses awoke and, tossing their heads, shook their bells.\r\n\r\nThe driver then yelling \xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d as loud as he could, whipped up his\r\nhorses. They shook themselves, and, with an effort, started off at a\r\nslow, halting gait. And behind them came the coach, rattling its shaky\r\nwindows and iron springs, making a terrible clatter of hardware and\r\nglass, while the passengers were tossed hither and thither like so many\r\nrubber balls.\r\n\r\nAt first all kept silent out of respect for the priest, that they might\r\nnot shock him. Being of a loquacious and genial disposition, he started\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Maitre Caniveau,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chow are you getting along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe enormous farmer who, on account of his size, girth and stomach, felt\r\na bond of sympathy for the representative of the Church, answered with a\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, Monsieur le cure, pretty well. And how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I'm always well and healthy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Maitre Poiret?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the abbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I'd be all right only the colzas ain't a-goin' to give much this\r\nyear, and times are so hard that they are the only things worth while\r\nraisin'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what can you expect? Times are hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHub! I should say they were hard,\xe2\x80\x9d sounded the rather virile voice of\r\nRabot's big consort.\r\n\r\nAs she was from a neighboring village, the priest only knew her by name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Blondel?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I'm the one that married Rabot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRabot, slender, timid, and self-satisfied, bowed smilingly, bending his\r\nhead forward as though to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I'm the Rabot whom Blondel\r\nmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly Maitre Belhomme, still holding his handkerchief to his ear,\r\nbegan groaning in a pitiful fashion. He was going \xe2\x80\x9cOh-oh-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nstamping his foot in order to show his terrible suffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have an awful toothache,\xe2\x80\x9d said the priest.\r\n\r\nThe peasant stopped moaning for a minute and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Monsieur le cure, it is not the teeth. It's my ear-away down at the\r\nbottom of my ear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what have you got in your ear? A lump of wax?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know whether it's wax; but I know that it is a bug, a big bug,\r\nthat crawled in while I was asleep in the haystack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bug! Are you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I sure? As sure as I am of heaven, Monsieur le cure! I can feel it\r\ngnawing at the bottom of my ear! It's eating my head for sure! It's\r\neating my head! Oh-oh-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to stamp his foot again.\r\n\r\nGreat interest had been aroused among the spectators. Each one gave his\r\nbit of advice. Poiret claimed that it was a spider, the teacher, thought\r\nit might be a caterpillar. He had already seen such a thing once, at\r\nCampemuret, in Orne, where he had been for six years. In this case the\r\ncaterpillar had gone through the head and out at the nose. But the man\r\nremained deaf in that ear ever after, the drum having been pierced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's more likely to be a worm,\xe2\x80\x9d said the priest.\r\n\r\nMaitre Belhomme, his head resting against the door, for he had been the\r\nlast one to enter, was still moaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94oh\xe2\x80\x94oh! I think it must be an ant, a big ant\xe2\x80\x94there it is biting\r\nagain. Oh, Monsieur le cure, how it hurts! how it hurts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen the doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Caniveau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fear of the doctor seemed to cure Belhomme. He straightened up\r\nwithout, however, dropping his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You have money for them, for those loafers? He would have come\r\nonce, twice, three times, four times, five times! That means two five-\r\nfranc pieces, two five-franc pieces, for sure. And what would he have\r\ndone, the loafer, tell me, what would he have done? Can you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaniveau was laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't know. Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to Havre, to see Chambrelan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Chambrelan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe healer, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat healer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe healer who cured my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the healer who cured my father years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the matter with your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA draught caught him in the back, so that he couldn't move hand or\r\nfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did your friend Chambrelan do to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kneaded his back with both hands as though he were making bread! And\r\nhe was all right in a couple of hours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBelhomme thought that Chambrelan must also have used some charm, but he\r\ndid not dare say so before the priest. Caniveau replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure it isn't a rabbit that you have in your ear? He might have\r\ntaken that hole for his home. Wait, I'll make him run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon Caniveau, making a megaphone of his hands, began to mimic the\r\nbarking of hounds. He snapped, howled, growled, barked. And everybody in\r\nthe carriage began to roar, even the schoolmaster, who, as a rule, never\r\never smiled.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Belhomme seemed angry at their making fun of him, the priest\r\nchanged the conversation and turning to Rabot's big wife, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a large family, haven't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, Monsieur le cure\xe2\x80\x94and it's a pretty hard matter to bring them\r\nup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRabot agreed, nodding his head as though to say: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, it's a hard\r\nthing to bring up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied authoritatively in a strong, clear voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixteen children, Monsieur le cure, fifteen of them by my husband!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Rabot smiled broadly, nodding his head. He was responsible for\r\nfifteen, he alone, Rabot! His wife said so! Therefore there could be no\r\ndoubt about it. And he was proud!\r\n\r\nAnd whose was the sixteenth? She didn't tell. It was doubtless the\r\nfirst. Perhaps everybody knew, for no one was surprised. Even Caniveau\r\nkept mum.\r\n\r\nBut Belhomme began to moan again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh-oh-oh! It's scratching about in the bottom of my ear! Oh, dear, oh,\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coach just then stopped at the Cafe Polyto. The priest said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf someone were to pour a little water into your ear, it might perhaps\r\ndrive it out. Do you want to try?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure! I am willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd everybody got out in order to witness the operation. The priest\r\nasked for a bowl, a napkin and a glass of water, then he told the\r\nteacher to hold the patient's head over on one side, and, as soon as the\r\nliquid should have entered the ear, to turn his head over suddenly on\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\nBut Caniveau, who was already peering into Belhomme's ear to see if he\r\ncouldn't discover the beast, shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh! What a mess! You'll have to clear that out, old man. Your rabbit\r\ncould never get through that; his feet would stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest in turn examined the passage and saw that it was too narrow\r\nand too congested for him to attempt to expel the animal. It was the\r\nteacher who cleared out this passage by means of a match and a bit of\r\ncloth. Then, in the midst of the general excitement, the priest poured\r\ninto the passage half a glass of water, which trickled over the face\r\nthrough the hair and down the neck of the patient. Then the schoolmaster\r\nquickly twisted the head round over the bowl, as though he were trying\r\nto unscrew it. A couple of drops dripped into the white bowl. All the\r\npassengers rushed forward. No insect had come out.\r\n\r\nHowever, Belhomme exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cI don't feel anything any more.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\npriest triumphantly exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it has been drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEverybody was happy and got back into the coach.\r\n\r\nBut hardly had they started when Belhomme began to cry out again. The\r\nbug had aroused itself and had become furious. He even declared that it\r\nhad now entered his head and was eating his brain. He was howling with\r\nsuch contortions that Poiret's wife, thinking him possessed by the\r\ndevil, began to cry and to cross herself. Then, the pain abating a\r\nlittle, the sick man began to tell how it was running round in his ear.\r\nWith his finger he imitated the movements of the body, seeming to see\r\nit, to follow it with his eyes: \xe2\x80\x9cThere it goes up again! Oh\xe2\x80\x94oh\xe2\x80\x94oh\xe2\x80\x94what\r\ntorture!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaniveau was getting impatient. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's the water that is making the bug\r\nangry. It is probably more accustomed to wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed, and he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we get to the Cafe Bourbeux,\r\ngive it some brandy, and it won't bother you any more, I wager.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Belhomme could contain himself no longer; he began howling as though\r\nhis soul were being torn from his body. The priest was obliged to hold\r\nhis head for him. They asked Cesaire Horlaville to stop at the nearest\r\nhouse. It was a farmhouse at the side of the road. Belhomme was carried\r\ninto it and laid on the kitchen table in order to repeat the operation.\r\nCaniveau advised mixing brandy and water in order to benumb and perhaps\r\nkill the insect. But the priest preferred vinegar.\r\n\r\nThey poured the liquid in drop by drop this time, that it might\r\npenetrate down to the bottom, and they left it several minutes in the\r\norgan that the beast had chosen for its home.\r\n\r\nA bowl had once more been brought; Belhomme was turned over bodily by\r\nthe priest and Caniveau, while the schoolmaster was tapping on the\r\nhealthy ear in order to empty the other.\r\n\r\nCesaire Horlaville himself, whip in hand, had come in to observe the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at the bottom of the bowl appeared a little brown spot, no\r\nbigger than a tiny seed. However, it was moving. It was a flea! First\r\nthere were cries of astonishment and then shouts of laughter. A flea!\r\nWell, that was a good joke, a mighty good one! Caniveau was slapping his\r\nthigh, Cesaire Horlaville snapped his whip, the priest laughed like a\r\nbraying donkey, the teacher cackled as though he were sneezing, and the\r\ntwo women were giving little screams of joy, like the clucking of hens.\r\n\r\nBelhomme had seated himself on the table and had taken the bowl between\r\nhis knees; he was observing, with serious attention and a vengeful anger\r\nin his eye, the conquered insect which was twisting round in the water.\r\nHe grunted, \xe2\x80\x9cYou rotten little beast!\xe2\x80\x9d and he spat on it.\r\n\r\nThe driver, wild with joy, kept repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cA flea, a flea, ah! there\r\nyou are, damned little flea, damned little flea, damned little flea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen having calmed down a little, he cried: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, back to the coach!\r\nWe've lost enough time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY\r\n\r\nThe steamer was crowded with people and the crossing promised to be\r\ngood. I was going from Havre to Trouville.\r\n\r\nThe ropes were thrown off, the whistle blew for the last time, the whole\r\nboat started to tremble, and the great wheels began to revolve, slowly\r\nat first, and then with ever-increasing rapidity.\r\n\r\nWe were gliding along the pier, black with people. Those on board were\r\nwaving their handkerchiefs, as though they were leaving for America, and\r\ntheir friends on shore were answering in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe big July sun was shining down on the red parasols, the light\r\ndresses, the joyous faces and on the ocean, barely stirred by a ripple.\r\nWhen we were out of the harbor, the little vessel swung round the big\r\ncurve and pointed her nose toward the distant shore which was barely\r\nvisible through the early morning mist. On our left was the broad\r\nestuary of the Seine, her muddy water, which never mingles with that of\r\nthe ocean, making large yellow streaks clearly outlined against the\r\nimmense sheet of the pure green sea.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I am on a boat I feel the need of walking to and fro, like a\r\nsailor on watch. Why? I do not know. Therefore I began to thread my way\r\nalong the deck through the crowd of travellers. Suddenly I heard my name\r\ncalled. I turned around. I beheld one of my old friends, Henri Sidoine,\r\nwhom I had not seen for ten years.\r\n\r\nWe shook hands and continued our walk together, talking of one thing or\r\nanother. Suddenly Sidoine, who had been observing the crowd of\r\npassengers, cried out angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's disgusting, the boat is full of English people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed full of them. The men were standing about, looking over\r\nthe ocean with an all-important air, as though to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the\r\nEnglish, the lords of the sea! Here we are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girls, formless, with shoes which reminded one of the naval\r\nconstructions of their fatherland, wrapped in multi-colored shawls, were\r\nsmiling vacantly at the magnificent scenery. Their small heads, planted\r\nat the top of their long bodies, wore English hats of the strangest\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\nAnd the old maids, thinner yet, opening their characteristic jaws to the\r\nwind, seemed to threaten one with their long, yellow teeth. On passing\r\nthem, one could notice the smell of rubber and of tooth wash.\r\n\r\nSidoine repeated, with growing anger:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting! Can we never stop their coming to France?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got against them? As far as I am concerned, they don't\r\nworry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe snapped out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they don't worry you! But I married one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stopped and laughed at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead and tell me about it. Does she make you very unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she\xe2\x80\x94is not true to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, she is. That would be cause for a divorce, and I could\r\nget rid of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I'm afraid I don't understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't understand? I'm not surprised. Well, she simply learned how\r\nto speak French\xe2\x80\x94that's all! Listen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't have the least desire of getting married when I went to spend\r\nthe summer at Etretat two years ago. There is nothing more dangerous\r\nthan watering-places. You have no idea how it suits young girls. Paris\r\nis the place for women and the country for young girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonkey rides, surf-bathing, breakfast on the grass, all these things\r\nare traps set for the marriageable man. And, really, there is nothing\r\nprettier than a child about eighteen, running through a field or picking\r\nflowers along the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made the acquaintance of an English family who were stopping at the\r\nsame hotel where I was. The father looked like those men you see over\r\nthere, and the mother was like all other Englishwomen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had two sons, the kind of boys who play rough games with balls,\r\nbats or rackets from morning till night; then came two daughters, the\r\nelder a dry, shrivelled-up Englishwoman, the younger a dream of beauty,\r\na heavenly blonde. When those chits make up their minds to be pretty,\r\nthey are divine. This one had blue eyes, the kind of blue which seems to\r\ncontain all the poetry, all the dreams, all the hopes and happiness of\r\nthe world!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an infinity of dreams is caused by two such eyes! How well they\r\nanswer the dim, eternal question of our heart!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must not be forgotten either that we Frenchmen adore foreign women.\r\nAs soon as we meet a Russian, an Italian, a Swede, a Spaniard, or an\r\nEnglishwoman with a pretty face, we immediately fall in love with her.\r\nWe enthuse over everything which comes from outside\xe2\x80\x94clothes, hats,\r\ngloves, guns and\xe2\x80\x94women. But what a blunder!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that that which pleases us in foreign women is their accent.\r\nAs soon as a woman speaks our language badly we think she is charming,\r\nif she uses the wrong word she is exquisite and if she jabbers in an\r\nentirely unintelligible jargon, she becomes irresistible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little English girl, Kate, spoke a language to be marvelled at. At\r\nthe beginning I could understand nothing, she invented so many new\r\nwords; then I fell absolutely in love with this queer, amusing dialect.\r\nAll maimed, strange, ridiculous terms became delightful in her mouth.\r\nEvery evening, on the terrace of the Casino, we had long conversations\r\nwhich resembled spoken enigmas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI married her! I loved her wildly, as one can only love in a dream. For\r\ntrue lovers only love a dream which has taken the form of a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear fellow, the most foolish thing I ever did was to give my\r\nwife a French teacher. As long as she slaughtered the dictionary and\r\ntortured the grammar I adored her. Our conversations were simple. They\r\nrevealed to me her surprising gracefulness and matchless elegance; they\r\nshowed her to me as a wonderful speaking jewel, a living doll made to be\r\nkissed, knowing, after a fashion, how to express what she loved. She\r\nreminded me of the pretty little toys which say 'papa' and 'mamma' when\r\nyou pull a string.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow she talks\xe2\x80\x94badly\xe2\x80\x94very badly. She makes as many mistakes as ever\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nI can understand her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have opened my doll to look inside\xe2\x80\x94and I have seen. And now I have to\r\ntalk to her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you don't know, as I do, the opinions, the ideas, the theories of a\r\nwell-educated young English girl, whom I can blame in nothing, and who\r\nrepeats to me from morning till night sentences from a French reader\r\nprepared in England for the use of young ladies' schools.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen those cotillon favors, those pretty gilt papers, which\r\nenclose candies with an abominable taste. I have one of them. I tore it\r\nopen. I wished to eat what was inside and it disgusted me so that I feel\r\nnauseated at seeing her compatriots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have married a parrot to whom some old English governess might have\r\ntaught French. Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe harbor of Trouville was now showing its wooden piers covered with\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took her back to Etretat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Oh, I am going to rest up here at Trouville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea what a fool a woman can be at times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACCURSED BREAD\r\n\r\nDaddy Taille had three daughters: Anna, the eldest, who was scarcely\r\never mentioned in the family; Rose, the second girl, who was eighteen,\r\nand Clara, the youngest, who was a girl of fifteen.\r\n\r\nOld Taille was a widower and a foreman in M. Lebrument's button\r\nmanufactory. He was a very upright man, very well thought of,\r\nabstemious; in fact, a sort of model workman. He lived at Havre, in the\r\nRue d'Angouleme.\r\n\r\nWhen Anna ran away from home the old man flew into a fearful rage. He\r\nthreatened to kill the head clerk in a large draper's establishment in\r\nthat town, whom he suspected. After a time, when he was told by various\r\npeople that she was very steady and investing money in government\r\nsecurities, that she was no gadabout, but was a great friend of Monsieur\r\nDubois, who was a judge of the Tribunal of Commerce, the father was\r\nappeased.\r\n\r\nHe even showed some anxiety as to how she was getting on, and asked some\r\nof her old friends who had been to see her, and when told that she had\r\nher own furniture, and that her mantelpiece was covered with vases and\r\nthe walls with pictures, that there were clocks and carpets everywhere,\r\nhe gave a broad contented smile. He had been working for thirty years to\r\nget together a wretched five or six thousand francs. This girl was\r\nevidently no fool.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning the son of Touchard, the cooper, at the other end of\r\nthe street, came and asked him for the hand of Rose, the second girl.\r\nThe old man's heart began to beat, for the Touchards were rich and in a\r\ngood position. He was decidedly lucky with his girls.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was agreed upon, and it was settled that it should be a\r\ngrand affair, and the wedding dinner was to be held at Sainte-Adresse,\r\nat Mother Jusa's restaurant. It would cost a lot certainly, but never\r\nmind, it did not matter just for once in a way.\r\n\r\nBut one morning, just as the old man was going home to luncheon with his\r\ntwo daughters, the door opened suddenly, and Anna appeared. She was well\r\ndressed and looked undeniably pretty and nice. She threw her arms round\r\nher father's neck before he could say a word, then fell into her\r\nsisters' arms with many tears and then asked for a plate, so that she\r\nmight share the family soup. Taille was moved to tears in his turn and\r\nsaid several times:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right, dear, that is right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she told them about herself. She did not wish Rose's wedding to\r\ntake place at Sainte-Adresse\xe2\x80\x94certainly not. It should take place at her\r\nhouse and would cost her father nothing. She had settled everything and\r\narranged everything, so it was \xe2\x80\x9cno good to say any more about it\xe2\x80\x94there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, my dear! very well!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will leave it\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d But then he felt some doubt. Would the Touchards consent? But Rose,\r\nthe bride-elect, was surprised and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should they object, I\r\nshould like to know? Just leave that to me; I will talk to Philip about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe mentioned it to her lover the very same day, and he declared it\r\nwould suit him exactly. Father and Mother Touchard were naturally\r\ndelighted at the idea of a good dinner which would cost them nothing and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be quite sure that everything will be in first-rate style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey asked to be allowed to bring a friend, Madame Florence, the cook on\r\nthe first floor, and Anna agreed to everything.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was fixed for the last Tuesday of the month.\r\n\r\nAfter the civil formalities and the religious ceremony the wedding party\r\nwent to Anna's house. Among those whom the Tailles had brought was a\r\ncousin of a certain age, a Monsieur Sauvetanin, a man given to\r\nphilosophical reflections, serious, and always very self-possessed, and\r\nMadame Lamondois, an old aunt.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sautevanin had been told off to give Anna his arm, as they were\r\nlooked upon as the two most important persons in the company.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had arrived at the door of Anna's house she let go her\r\ncompanion's arm, and ran on ahead, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI will show you the way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand ran upstairs while the invited guests followed more slowly; and,\r\nwhen they got upstairs, she stood on one side to let them pass, and they\r\nrolled their eyes and turned their heads in all directions to admire\r\nthis mysterious and luxurious dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe table was laid in the drawing-room, as the dining-room had been\r\nthought too small. Extra knives, forks and spoons had been hired from a\r\nneighboring restaurant, and decanters stood full of wine under the rays\r\nof the sun which shone in through the window.\r\n\r\nThe ladies went into the bedroom to take off their shawls and bonnets,\r\nand Father Touchard, who was standing at the door, made funny and\r\nsuggestive signs to the men, with many a wink and nod. Daddy Taille, who\r\nthought a great deal of himself, looked with fatherly pride at his\r\nchild's well-furnished rooms and went from one to the other, holding his\r\nhat in his hand, making a mental inventory of everything, and walking\r\nlike a verger in a church.\r\n\r\nAnna went backward and forward, ran about giving orders and hurrying on\r\nthe wedding feast. Soon she appeared at the door of the dining-room and\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, all of you, for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d and as the twelve guests\r\nentered the room they saw twelve glasses of Madeira on a small table.\r\n\r\nRose and her husband had their arms round each other's waists and were\r\nkissing each other in every corner. Monsieur Sauvetanin never took his\r\neyes off Anna.\r\n\r\nThey sat down, and the wedding breakfast began, the relations sitting at\r\none end of the table and the young people at the other. Madame Touchard,\r\nthe mother, presided on the right and the bride on the left. Anna looked\r\nafter everybody, saw that the glasses were kept filled and the plates\r\nwell supplied. The guests evidently felt a certain respectful\r\nembarrassment at the sight of all the sumptuousness of the rooms and at\r\nthe lavish manner in which they were treated. They all ate heartily of\r\nthe good things provided, but there were no jokes such as are prevalent\r\nat weddings of that sort; it was all too grand, and it made them feel\r\nuncomfortable. Old Madame Touchard, who was fond of a bit of fun, tried\r\nto enliven matters a little, and at the beginning of the dessert she\r\nexclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Philip, do sing us something.\xe2\x80\x9d The neighbors in their\r\nstreet considered that he had the finest voice in all Havre.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom got up, smiled, and, turning to his sister-in-law, from\r\npoliteness and gallantry, tried to think of something suitable for the\r\noccasion, something serious and correct, to harmonize with the\r\nseriousness of the repast.\r\n\r\nAnna had a satisfied look on her face, and leaned back in her chair to\r\nlisten, and all assumed looks of attention, though prepared to smile\r\nshould smiles be called for.\r\n\r\nThe singer announced \xe2\x80\x9cThe Accursed Bread,\xe2\x80\x9d and, extending his right arm,\r\nwhich made his coat ruck up into his neck, he began.\r\n\r\nIt was decidedly long, three verses of eight lines each, with the last\r\nline and the last but one repeated twice.\r\n\r\nAll went well for the first two verses; they were the usual commonplaces\r\nabout bread gained by honest labor and by dishonesty. The aunt and the\r\nbride wept outright. The cook, who was present, at the end of the first\r\nverse looked at a roll which she held in her hand, with streaming eyes,\r\nas if it applied to her, while all applauded vigorously. At the end of\r\nthe second verse the two servants, who were standing with their backs to\r\nthe wall, joined loudly in the chorus, and the aunt and the bride wept\r\noutright.\r\n\r\nDaddy Taille blew his nose with the noise of a trombone, and old\r\nTouchard brandished a whole loaf half over the table, and the cook shed\r\nsilent tears on the crust which she was still holding.\r\n\r\nAmid the general emotion Monsieur Sauvetanin said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the right sort of song; very different from the nasty, risky\r\nthings one generally hears at weddings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnna, who was visibly affected, kissed her hand to her sister and\r\npointed to her husband with an affectionate nod, as if to congratulate\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIntoxicated by his success, the young man continued, and unfortunately\r\nthe last verse contained words about the \xe2\x80\x9cbread of dishonor\xe2\x80\x9d gained by\r\nyoung girls who had been led astray. No one took up the refrain about\r\nthis bread, supposed to be eaten with tears, except old Touchard and the\r\ntwo servants. Anna had grown deadly pale and cast down her eyes, while\r\nthe bridegroom looked from one to the other without understanding the\r\nreason for this sudden coldness, and the cook hastily dropped the crust\r\nas if it were poisoned.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sauvetanin said solemnly, in order to save the situation: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nlast couplet is not at all necessary\xe2\x80\x9d; and Daddy Taille, who had got red\r\nup to his ears, looked round the table fiercely.\r\n\r\nThen Anna, her eyes swimming in tears, told the servants in the\r\nfaltering voice of a woman trying to stifle her sobs, to bring the\r\nchampagne.\r\n\r\nAll the guests were suddenly seized with exuberant joy, and all their\r\nfaces became radiant again. And when old Touchard, who had seen, felt\r\nand understood nothing of what was going on, and pointing to the guests\r\nso as to emphasize his words, sang the last words of the refrain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren, I warn you all to eat not of that bread,\xe2\x80\x9d the whole company,\r\nwhen they saw the champagne bottles, with their necks covered with gold\r\nfoil, appear, burst out singing, as if electrified by the sight:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren, I warn you all to eat not of that bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOWRY\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Maitre Simon Lebrument with Mademoiselle Jeanne Cordier\r\nwas a surprise to no one. Maitre Lebrument had bought out the practice\r\nof Maitre Papillon; naturally, he had to have money to pay for it; and\r\nMademoiselle Jeanne Cordier had three hundred thousand francs clear in\r\ncurrency, and in bonds payable to bearer.\r\n\r\nMaitre Lebrument was a handsome man. He was stylish, although in a\r\nprovincial way; but, nevertheless, he was stylish\xe2\x80\x94a rare thing at\r\nBoutigny-le-Rebours.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Cordier was graceful and fresh-looking, although a trifle\r\nawkward; nevertheless, she was a handsome girl, and one to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony turned all Boutigny topsy-turvy. Everybody admired\r\nthe young couple, who quickly returned home to domestic felicity, having\r\ndecided simply to take a short trip to Paris, after a few days of\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nThis tete-a-tete was delightful, Maitre Lebrument having shown just the\r\nproper amount of delicacy. He had taken as his motto: \xe2\x80\x9cEverything comes\r\nto him who waits.\xe2\x80\x9d He knew how to be at the same time patient and\r\nenergetic. His success was rapid and complete.\r\n\r\nAfter four days, Madame Lebrument adored her husband. She could not get\r\nalong without him. She would sit on his knees, and taking him by the\r\nears she would say: \xe2\x80\x9cOpen your mouth and shut your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d He would open\r\nhis mouth wide and partly close his eyes, and he would try to nip her\r\nfingers as she slipped some dainty between his teeth. Then she would\r\ngive him a kiss, sweet and long, which would make chills run up and down\r\nhis spine. And then, in his turn, he would not have enough caresses to\r\nplease his wife from morning to night and from night to morning.\r\n\r\nWhen the first week was over, he said to his young companion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish, we will leave for Paris next Tuesday. We will be like two\r\nlovers, we will go to the restaurants, the theatres, the concert halls,\r\neverywhere, everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was ready to dance for joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, yes. Let us go as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, as we must forget nothing, ask your father to have your dowry\r\nready; I shall pay Maitre Papillon on this trip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right: I will tell him to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he took her in his arms once more, to renew those sweet games of\r\nlove which she had so enjoyed for the past week.\r\n\r\nThe following Tuesday, father-in-law and mother-in-law went to the\r\nstation with their daughter and their son-in-law who were leaving for\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nThe father-in-law said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it is very imprudent to carry so much money about in a\r\npocketbook.\xe2\x80\x9d And the young lawyer smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't worry; I am accustomed to such things. You understand that, in my\r\nprofession, I sometimes have as much as a million about me. In this\r\nmanner, at least we avoid a great amount of red tape and delay. You\r\nneedn't worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conductor was crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll aboard for Paris!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey scrambled into a car, where two old ladies were already seated.\r\n\r\nLebrument whispered into his wife's ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a bother! I won't be able to smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered in a low voice\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt annoys me too, but not an account of your cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whistle blew and the train started. The trip lasted about an hour,\r\nduring which time they did not say very much to each other, as the two\r\nold ladies did not go to sleep.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were in front of the Saint-Lazare Station, Maitre\r\nLebrument said to his wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearie, let us first go over to the Boulevard and get something to eat;\r\nthen we can quietly return and get our trunk and bring it to the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe immediately assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes. Let's eat at the restaurant. Is it far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it's quite a distance, but we will take the omnibus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was surprised:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't we take a cab?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to scold her smilingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way you save money? A cab for a five minutes' ride at six\r\ncents a minute! You would deprive yourself of nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little embarrassed.\r\n\r\nA big omnibus was passing by, drawn by three big horses, which were\r\ntrotting along. Lebrument called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConductor! Conductor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe heavy carriage stopped. And the young lawyer, pushing his wife, said\r\nto her quickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo inside; I'm going up on top, so that I may smoke at least one\r\ncigarette before lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had no time to answer. The conductor, who had seized her by the arm\r\nto help her up the step, pushed her inside, and she fell into a seat,\r\nbewildered, looking through the back window at the feet of her husband\r\nas he climbed up to the top of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nAnd she sat there motionless, between a fat man who smelled of cheap\r\ntobacco and an old woman who smelled of garlic.\r\n\r\nAll the other passengers were lined up in silence\xe2\x80\x94a grocer's boy, a\r\nyoung girl, a soldier, a gentleman with gold-rimmed spectacles and a big\r\nsilk hat, two ladies with a self-satisfied and crabbed look, which\r\nseemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are riding in this thing, but we don't have to,\xe2\x80\x9d two\r\nsisters of charity and an undertaker. They looked like a collection of\r\ncaricatures.\r\n\r\nThe jolting of the wagon made them wag their heads and the shaking of\r\nthe wheels seemed to stupefy them\xe2\x80\x94they all looked as though they were\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nThe young woman remained motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn't he come inside with me?\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying to herself. An\r\nunaccountable sadness seemed to be hanging over her. He really need not\r\nhave acted so.\r\n\r\nThe sisters motioned to the conductor to stop, and they got off one\r\nafter the other, leaving in their wake the pungent smell of camphor. The\r\nbus started tip and soon stopped again. And in got a cook, red-faced and\r\nout of breath. She sat down and placed her basket of provisions on her\r\nknees. A strong odor of dish-water filled the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's further than I imagined,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Jeanne.\r\n\r\nThe undertaker went out, and was replaced by a coachman who seemed to\r\nbring the atmosphere of the stable with him. The young girl had as a\r\nsuccessor a messenger, the odor of whose feet showed that he was\r\ncontinually walking.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer's wife began to feel ill at ease, nauseated, ready to cry\r\nwithout knowing why.\r\n\r\nOther persons left and others entered. The stage went on through\r\ninterminable streets, stopping at stations and starting again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far it is!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Jeanne. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope he hasn't gone to sleep! He has\r\nbeen so tired the last few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle by little all the passengers left. She was left alone, all alone.\r\nThe conductor cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVaugirard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that she did not move, he repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVaugirard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, understanding that he was speaking to her, as there\r\nwas no one else there. For the third time the man said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVaugirard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered gruffly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe're at Vaugirard, of course! I have been yelling it for the last half\r\nhour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it far from the Boulevard?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich boulevard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Boulevard des Italiens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe passed that a long time ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind telling my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband! Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the top of the bus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the top! There hasn't been anybody there for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started, terrified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? That's impossible! He got on with me. Look well! He must be\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conductor was becoming uncivil:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, little one, you've talked enough! You can find ten men for\r\nevery one that you lose. Now run along. You'll find another one\r\nsomewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears were coming to her eyes. She insisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, monsieur, you are mistaken; I assure you that you must be\r\nmistaken. He had a big portfolio under his arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man began to laugh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA big portfolio! Oh, yes! He got off at the Madeleine. He got rid of\r\nyou, all right! Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stage had stopped. She got out and, in spite of herself, she looked\r\nup instinctively to the roof of the bus. It was absolutely deserted.\r\n\r\nThen she began to cry, and, without thinking that anybody was listening\r\nor watching her, she said out loud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is going to become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn inspector approached:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conductor answered, in a bantering tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a lady who got left by her husband during the trip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that's nothing. You go about your business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he turned on his heels and walked away.\r\n\r\nShe began to walk straight ahead, too bewildered, too crazed even to\r\nunderstand what had happened to her. Where was she to go? What could she\r\ndo? What could have happened to him? How could he have made such a\r\nmistake? How could he have been so forgetful?\r\n\r\nShe had two francs in her pocket. To whom could she go? Suddenly she\r\nremembered her cousin Barral, one of the assistants in the offices of\r\nthe Ministry of the Navy.\r\n\r\nShe had just enough to pay for a cab. She drove to his house. He met her\r\njust as he was leaving for his office. He was carrying a large portfolio\r\nunder his arm, just like Lebrument.\r\n\r\nShe jumped out of the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, astonished:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanne! Here\xe2\x80\x94all alone! What are you doing? Where have you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes full of tears, she stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband has just got lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost! Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn an omnibus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn an omnibus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeeping, she told him her whole adventure.\r\n\r\nHe listened, thought, and then asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas his mind clear this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Did he have much money with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he was carrying my dowry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour dowry! The whole of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole of it\xe2\x80\x94in order to pay for the practice which he bought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear cousin, by this time your husband must be well on his way\r\nto Belgium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not understand. She kept repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband\xe2\x80\x94you say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that he has disappeared with your\xe2\x80\x94your capital\xe2\x80\x94that's all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood there, a prey to conflicting emotions, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is\xe2\x80\x94he is\xe2\x80\x94he is a villain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, faint from excitement, she leaned her head on her cousin's shoulder\r\nand wept.\r\n\r\nAs people were stopping to look at them, he pushed her gently into the\r\nvestibule of his house, and, supporting her with his arm around her\r\nwaist, he led her up the stairs, and as his astonished servant opened\r\nthe door, he ordered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSophie, run to the restaurant and get a luncheon for two. I am not\r\ngoing to the office to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIARY OF A MADMAN\r\n\r\nHe was dead\xe2\x80\x94the head of a high tribunal, the upright magistrate whose\r\nirreproachable life was a proverb in all the courts of France.\r\nAdvocates, young counsellors, judges had greeted him at sight of his\r\nlarge, thin, pale face lighted up by two sparkling deep-set eyes, bowing\r\nlow in token of respect.\r\n\r\nHe had passed his life in pursuing crime and in protecting the weak.\r\nSwindlers and murderers had no more redoubtable enemy, for he seemed to\r\nread the most secret thoughts of their minds.\r\n\r\nHe was dead, now, at the age of eighty-two, honored by the homage and\r\nfollowed by the regrets of a whole people. Soldiers in red trousers had\r\nescorted him to the tomb and men in white cravats had spoken words and\r\nshed tears that seemed to be sincere beside his grave.\r\n\r\nBut here is the strange paper found by the dismayed notary in the desk\r\nwhere he had kept the records of great criminals! It was entitled: WHY?\r\n\r\n20th June, 1851. I have just left court. I have condemned Blondel to\r\ndeath! Now, why did this man kill his five children? Frequently one\r\nmeets with people to whom the destruction of life is a pleasure. Yes,\r\nyes, it should be a pleasure, the greatest of all, perhaps, for is not\r\nkilling the next thing to creating? To make and to destroy! These two\r\nwords contain the history of the universe, all the history of worlds,\r\nall that is, all! Why is it not intoxicating to kill?\r\n\r\n25th June. To think that a being is there who lives, who walks, who\r\nruns. A being? What is a being? That animated thing, that bears in it\r\nthe principle of motion and a will ruling that motion. It is attached to\r\nnothing, this thing. Its feet do not belong to the ground. It is a grain\r\nof life that moves on the earth, and this grain of life, coming I know\r\nnot whence, one can destroy at one's will. Then nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing more. It\r\nperishes, it is finished.\r\n\r\n26th June. Why then is it a crime to kill? Yes, why? On the contrary, it\r\nis the law of nature. The mission of every being is to kill; he kills to\r\nlive, and he kills to kill. The beast kills without ceasing, all day,\r\nevery instant of his existence. Man kills without ceasing, to nourish\r\nhimself; but since he needs, besides, to kill for pleasure, he has\r\ninvented hunting! The child kills the insects he finds, the little\r\nbirds, all the little animals that come in his way. But this does not\r\nsuffice for the irresistible need to massacre that is in us. It is not\r\nenough to kill beasts; we must kill man too. Long ago this need was\r\nsatisfied by human sacrifices. Now the requirements of social life have\r\nmade murder a crime. We condemn and punish the assassin! But as we\r\ncannot live without yielding to this natural and imperious instinct of\r\ndeath, we relieve ourselves, from time to time, by wars. Then a whole\r\nnation slaughters another nation. It is a feast of blood, a feast that\r\nmaddens armies and that intoxicates civilians, women and children, who\r\nread, by lamplight at night, the feverish story of massacre.\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that those destined to accomplish these butcheries of\r\nmen would be despised! No, they are loaded with honors. They are clad in\r\ngold and in resplendent garments; they wear plumes on their heads and\r\nornaments on their breasts, and they are given crosses, rewards, titles\r\nof every kind. They are proud, respected, loved by women, cheered by the\r\ncrowd, solely because their mission is to shed human blood; They drag\r\nthrough the streets their instruments of death, that the passer-by, clad\r\nin black, looks on with envy. For to kill is the great law set by nature\r\nin the heart of existence! There is nothing more beautiful and honorable\r\nthan killing!\r\n\r\n30th June. To kill is the law, because nature loves eternal youth. She\r\nseems to cry in all her unconscious acts: \xe2\x80\x9cQuick! quick! quick!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nmore she destroys, the more she renews herself.\r\n\r\n2d July. A human being\xe2\x80\x94what is a human being? Through thought it is a\r\nreflection of all that is; through memory and science it is an abridged\r\nedition of the universe whose history it represents, a mirror of things\r\nand of nations, each human being becomes a microcosm in the macrocosm.\r\n\r\n3d July. It must be a pleasure, unique and full of zest, to kill; to\r\nhave there before one the living, thinking being; to make therein a\r\nlittle hole, nothing but a little hole, to see that red thing flow which\r\nis the blood, which makes life; and to have before one only a heap of\r\nlimp flesh, cold, inert, void of thought!\r\n\r\n5th August. I, who have passed my life in judging, condemning, killing\r\nby the spoken word, killing by the guillotine those who had killed by\r\nthe knife, I, I, if I should do as all the assassins have done whom I\r\nhave smitten, I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94who would know it?\r\n\r\n10th August. Who would ever know? Who would ever suspect me, me, me,\r\nespecially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing away\r\nwith?\r\n\r\n15th August. The temptation has come to me. It pervades my whole being;\r\nmy hands tremble with the desire to kill.\r\n\r\n22d August. I could resist no longer. I killed a little creature as an\r\nexperiment, for a beginning. Jean, my servant, had a goldfinch in a cage\r\nhung in the office window. I sent him on an errand, and I took the\r\nlittle bird in my hand, in my hand where I felt its heart beat. It was\r\nwarm. I went up to my room. From time to time I squeezed it tighter; its\r\nheart beat faster; this was atrocious and delicious. I was near choking\r\nit. But I could not see the blood.\r\n\r\nThen I took scissors, short-nail scissors, and I cut its throat with\r\nthree slits, quite gently. It opened its bill, it struggled to escape\r\nme, but I held it, oh! I held it\xe2\x80\x94I could have held a mad dog\xe2\x80\x94and I saw\r\nthe blood trickle.\r\n\r\nAnd then I did as assassins do\xe2\x80\x94real ones. I washed the scissors, I\r\nwashed my hands. I sprinkled water and took the body, the corpse, to the\r\ngarden to hide it. I buried it under a strawberry-plant. It will never\r\nbe found. Every day I shall eat a strawberry from that plant. How one\r\ncan enjoy life when one knows how!\r\n\r\nMy servant cried; he thought his bird flown. How could he suspect me?\r\nAh! ah!\r\n\r\n25th August. I must kill a man! I must\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n30th August. It is done. But what a little thing! I had gone for a walk\r\nin the forest of Vernes. I was thinking of nothing, literally nothing. A\r\nchild was in the road, a little child eating a slice of bread and\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nHe stops to see me pass and says, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, Mr. President.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the thought enters my head, \xe2\x80\x9cShall I kill him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answer: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are alone, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll alone in the wood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wish to kill him intoxicated me like wine. I approached him quite\r\nsoftly, persuaded that he was going to run away. And, suddenly, I seized\r\nhim by the throat. He looked at me with terror in his eyes\xe2\x80\x94such eyes! He\r\nheld my wrists in his little hands and his body writhed like a feather\r\nover the fire. Then he moved no more. I threw the body in the ditch, and\r\nsome weeds on top of it. I returned home, and dined well. What a little\r\nthing it was! In the evening I was very gay, light, rejuvenated; I\r\npassed the evening at the Prefect's. They found me witty. But I have not\r\nseen blood! I am tranquil.\r\n\r\n31st August. The body has been discovered. They are hunting for the\r\nassassin. Ah! ah!\r\n\r\n1st September. Two tramps have been arrested. Proofs are lacking.\r\n\r\n2d September. The parents have been to see me. They wept! Ah! ah!\r\n\r\n6th October. Nothing has been discovered. Some strolling vagabond must\r\nhave done the deed. Ah! ah! If I had seen the blood flow, it seems to me\r\nI should be tranquil now! The desire to kill is in my blood; it is like\r\nthe passion of youth at twenty.\r\n\r\n20th October. Yet another. I was walking by the river, after breakfast.\r\nAnd I saw, under a willow, a fisherman asleep. It was noon. A spade was\r\nstanding in a potato-field near by, as if expressly, for me.\r\n\r\nI took it. I returned; I raised it like a club, and with one blow of the\r\nedge I cleft the fisherman's head. Oh! he bled, this one! Rose-colored\r\nblood. It flowed into the water, quite gently. And I went away with a\r\ngrave step. If I had been seen! Ah! ah! I should have made an excellent\r\nassassin.\r\n\r\n25th October. The affair of the fisherman makes a great stir. His\r\nnephew, who fished with him, is charged with the murder.\r\n\r\n26th October. The examining magistrate affirms that the nephew is\r\nguilty. Everybody in town believes it. Ah! ah!\r\n\r\n27th October. The nephew makes a very poor witness. He had gone to the\r\nvillage to buy bread and cheese, he declared. He swore that his uncle\r\nhad been killed in his absence! Who would believe him?\r\n\r\n28th October. The nephew has all but confessed, they have badgered him\r\nso. Ah! ah! justice!\r\n\r\n15th November. There are overwhelming proofs against the nephew, who was\r\nhis uncle's heir. I shall preside at the sessions.\r\n\r\n25th January. To death! to death! to death! I have had him condemned to\r\ndeath! Ah! ah! The advocate-general spoke like an angel! Ah! ah! Yet\r\nanother! I shall go to see him executed!\r\n\r\n10th March. It is done. They guillotined him this morning. He died very\r\nwell! very well! That gave me pleasure! How fine it is to see a man's\r\nhead cut off!\r\n\r\nNow, I shall wait, I can wait. It would take such a little thing to let\r\nmyself be caught.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript contained yet other pages, but without relating any new\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nAlienist physicians to whom the awful story has been submitted declare\r\nthat there are in the world many undiscovered madmen as adroit and as\r\nmuch to be feared as this monstrous lunatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASK\r\n\r\nThere was a masquerade ball at the Elysee-Montmartre that evening. It\r\nwas the 'Mi-Careme', and the crowds were pouring into the brightly\r\nlighted passage which leads to the dance ball, like water flowing\r\nthrough the open lock of a canal. The loud call of the orchestra,\r\nbursting like a storm of sound, shook the rafters, swelled through the\r\nwhole neighborhood and awoke, in the streets and in the depths of the\r\nhouses, an irresistible desire to jump, to get warm, to have fun, which\r\nslumbers within each human animal.\r\n\r\nThe patrons came from every quarter of Paris; there were people of all\r\nclasses who love noisy pleasures, a little low and tinged with debauch.\r\nThere were clerks and girls\xe2\x80\x94girls of every description, some wearing\r\ncommon cotton, some the finest batiste; rich girls, old and covered with\r\ndiamonds, and poor girls of sixteen, full of the desire to revel, to\r\nbelong to men, to spend money. Elegant black evening suits, in search of\r\nfresh or faded but appetizing novelty, wandering through the excited\r\ncrowds, looking, searching, while the masqueraders seemed moved above\r\nall by the desire for amusement. Already the far-famed quadrilles had\r\nattracted around them a curious crowd. The moving hedge which encircled\r\nthe four dancers swayed in and out like a snake, sometimes nearer and\r\nsometimes farther away, according to the motions of the performers. The\r\ntwo women, whose lower limbs seemed to be attached to their bodies by\r\nrubber springs, were making wonderful and surprising motions with their\r\nlegs. Their partners hopped and skipped about, waving their arms about.\r\nOne could imagine their panting breath beneath their masks.\r\n\r\nOne of them, who had taken his place in the most famous quadrille, as\r\nsubstitute for an absent celebrity, the handsome \xe2\x80\x9cSonge-au-Gosse,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\ntrying to keep up with the tireless \xe2\x80\x9cArete-de-Veau\xe2\x80\x9d and was making\r\nstrange fancy steps which aroused the joy and sarcasm of the audience.\r\n\r\nHe was thin, dressed like a dandy, with a pretty varnished mask on his\r\nface. It had a curly blond mustache and a wavy wig. He looked like a wax\r\nfigure from the Musee Grevin, like a strange and fantastic caricature of\r\nthe charming young man of fashion plates, and he danced with visible\r\neffort, clumsily, with a comical impetuosity. He appeared rusty beside\r\nthe others when he tried to imitate their gambols: he seemed overcome by\r\nrheumatism, as heavy as a great Dane playing with greyhounds. Mocking\r\nbravos encouraged him. And he, carried away with enthusiasm, jigged\r\nabout with such frenzy that suddenly, carried away by a wild spurt, he\r\npitched head foremost into the living wall formed by the audience, which\r\nopened up before him to allow him to pass, then closed around the\r\ninanimate body of the dancer, stretched out on his face.\r\n\r\nSome men picked him up and carried him away, calling for a doctor. A\r\ngentleman stepped forward, young and elegant, in well-fitting evening\r\nclothes, with large pearl studs. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a professor of the Faculty of\r\nMedicine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a modest voice. He was allowed to pass, and he\r\nentered a small room full of little cardboard boxes, where the still\r\nlifeless dancer had been stretched out on some chairs. The doctor at\r\nfirst wished to take off the mask, and he noticed that it was attached\r\nin a complicated manner, with a perfect network of small metal wires\r\nwhich cleverly bound it to his wig and covered the whole head. Even the\r\nneck was imprisoned in a false skin which continued the chin and was\r\npainted the color of flesh, being attached to the collar of the shirt.\r\n\r\nAll this had to be cut with strong scissors. When the physician had slit\r\nopen this surprising arrangement, from the shoulder to the temple, he\r\nopened this armor and found the face of an old man, worn out, thin and\r\nwrinkled. The surprise among those who had brought in this seemingly\r\nyoung dancer was so great that no one laughed, no one said a word.\r\n\r\nAll were watching this sad face as he lay on the straw chairs, his eyes\r\nclosed, his face covered with white hair, some long, falling from the\r\nforehead over the face, others short, growing around the face and the\r\nchin, and beside this poor head, that pretty little, neat varnished,\r\nsmiling mask.\r\n\r\nThe man regained consciousness after being inanimate for a long time,\r\nbut he still seemed to be so weak and sick that the physician feared\r\nsome dangerous complication. He asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old dancer seemed to be making an effort to remember, and then he\r\nmentioned the name of the street, which no one knew. He was asked for\r\nmore definite information about the neighborhood. He answered with a\r\ngreat slowness, indecision and difficulty, which revealed his upset\r\nstate of mind. The physician continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take you home myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCuriosity had overcome him to find out who this strange dancer, this\r\nphenomenal jumper might be. Soon the two rolled away in a cab to the\r\nother side of Montmartre.\r\n\r\nThey stopped before a high building of poor appearance. They went up a\r\nwinding staircase. The doctor held to the banister, which was so grimy\r\nthat the hand stuck to it, and he supported the dizzy old man, whose\r\nforces were beginning to return. They stopped at the fourth floor.\r\n\r\nThe door at which they had knocked was opened by an old woman, neat\r\nlooking, with a white nightcap enclosing a thin face with sharp\r\nfeatures, one of those good, rough faces of a hard-working and faithful\r\nwoman. She cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor goodness sake! What's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told her the whole affair in a few words. She became reassured and\r\neven calmed the physician himself by telling him that the same thing had\r\nhappened many times. She said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be put to bed, monsieur, that is\r\nall. Let him sleep and tomorrow he will be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor continued: \xe2\x80\x9cBut he can hardly speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that's just a little drink, nothing more; he has eaten no dinner,\r\nin order to be nimble, and then he took a few absinthes in order to work\r\nhimself up to the proper pitch. You see, drink gives strength to his\r\nlegs, but it stops his thoughts and words. He is too old to dance as he\r\ndoes. Really, his lack of common sense is enough to drive one mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, surprised, insisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why does he dance like that at his age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders and turned red from the anger which was\r\nslowly rising within her and she cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, why? So that the people will think him young under his mask;\r\nso that the women will still take him for a young dandy and whisper\r\nnasty things into his ears; so that he can rub up against all their\r\ndirty skins, with their perfumes and powders and cosmetics. Ah! it's a\r\nfine business! What a life I have had for the last forty years! But we\r\nmust first get him to bed, so that he may have no ill effects. Would you\r\nmind helping me? When he is like that I can't do anything with him\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man was sitting on his bed, with a tipsy look, his long white\r\nhair falling over his face. His companion looked at him with tender yet\r\nindignant eyes. She continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see the fine head he has for his age, and yet he has to go and\r\ndisguise himself in order to make people think that he is young. It's a\r\nperfect shame! Really, he has a fine head, monsieur! Wait, I'll show it\r\nto you before putting him to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to a table on which stood the washbasin a pitcher of water,\r\nsoap and a comb and brush. She took the brush, returned to the bed and\r\npushed back the drunkard's tangled hair. In a few seconds she made him\r\nlook like a model fit for a great painter, with his long white locks\r\nflowing on his neck. Then she stepped back in order to observe him,\r\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cThere! Isn't he fine for his age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the doctor, who was beginning to be highly amused.\r\n\r\nShe added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you had known him when he was twenty-five! But we\r\nmust get him to bed, otherwise the drink will make him sick. Do you mind\r\ndrawing off that sleeve? Higher-like that-that's right. Now the\r\ntrousers. Wait, I will take his shoes off\xe2\x80\x94that's right. Now, hold him\r\nupright while I open the bed. There\xe2\x80\x94let us put him in. If you think that\r\nhe is going to disturb himself when it is time for me to get in you are\r\nmistaken. I have to find a little corner any place I can. That doesn't\r\nbother him! Bah! You old pleasure seeker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he felt himself stretched out in his sheets the old man\r\nclosed his eyes, opened them closed them again, and over his whole face\r\nappeared an energetic resolve to sleep. The doctor examined him with an\r\never-increasing interest and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he go to all the fancy balls\r\nand try to be a young man?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo all of them, monsieur, and he comes back\r\nto me in the morning in a deplorable condition. You see, it's regret\r\nthat leads him on and that makes him put a pasteboard face over his own.\r\nYes, the regret of no longer being what he was and of no longer making\r\nany conquests!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was sleeping now and beginning to snore. She looked at him with a\r\npitying expression and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! how many conquests that man has\r\nmade! More than one could believe, monsieur, more than the finest\r\ngentlemen of the world, than all the tenors and all the generals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? What did he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it will surprise you at first, as you did not know him in his palmy\r\ndays. When I met him it was also at a ball, for he has always frequented\r\nthem. As soon as I saw him I was caught\xe2\x80\x94caught like a fish on a hook.\r\nAh! how pretty he was, monsieur, with his curly raven locks and black\r\neyes as large as saucers! Indeed, he was good looking! He took me away\r\nthat evening and I never have left him since, never, not even for a day,\r\nno matter what he did to me! Oh! he has often made it hard for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered simply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, otherwise he would have dropped me\r\nas he did the others. I have been his wife and his servant, everything,\r\neverything that he wished. How he has made me cry\xe2\x80\x94tears which I did not\r\nshow him; for he would tell all his adventures to me\xe2\x80\x94to me,\r\nmonsieur\xe2\x80\x94without understanding how it hurt me to listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what was his business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's so. I forgot to tell you. He was the foreman at Martel's\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nforeman such as they never had had\xe2\x80\x94an artist who averaged ten francs an\r\nhour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartel?\xe2\x80\x94who is Martel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hairdresser, monsieur, the great hairdresser of the Opera, who had\r\nall the actresses for customers. Yes, sir, all the smartest actresses\r\nhad their hair dressed by Ambrose and they would give him tips that made\r\na fortune for him. Ah! monsieur, all the women are alike, yes, all of\r\nthem. When a man pleases their fancy they offer themselves to him. It is\r\nso easy\xe2\x80\x94and it hurt me so to hear about it. For he would tell me\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x94he simply could not hold his tongue\xe2\x80\x94it was impossible. Those\r\nthings please the men so much! They seem to get even more enjoyment out\r\nof telling than doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I would see him coming in the evening, a little pale, with a\r\npleased look and a bright eye, would say to myself: 'One more. I am sure\r\nthat he has caught one more.' Then I felt a wild desire to question him\r\nand then, again, not to know, to stop his talking if he should begin.\r\nAnd we would look at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that he would not keep still, that he would come to the point. I\r\ncould feel that from his manner, which seemed to laugh and say: 'I had a\r\nfine adventure to-day, Madeleine.' I would pretend to notice nothing, to\r\nguess nothing; I would set the table, bring on the soup and sit down\r\nopposite him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt those times, monsieur, it was as if my friendship for him had been\r\ncrushed in my body as with a stone. It hurt. But he did not understand;\r\nhe did not know; he felt a need to tell all those things to some one, to\r\nboast, to show how much he was loved, and I was the only one he had to\r\nwhom he could talk-the only one. And I would have to listen and drink it\r\nin, like poison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would begin to take his soup and then he would say: 'One more,\r\nMadeleine.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I would think: 'Here it comes! Goodness! what a man! Why did I ever\r\nmeet him?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he would begin: 'One more! And a beauty, too.' And it would be\r\nsome little one from the Vaudeville or else from the Varietes, and some\r\nof the big ones, too, some of the most famous. He would tell me their\r\nnames, how their apartments were furnished, everything, everything,\r\nmonsieur. Heartbreaking details. And he would go over them and tell his\r\nstory over again from beginning to end, so pleased with himself that I\r\nwould pretend to laugh so that he would not get angry with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything may not have been true! He liked to glorify himself and was\r\nquite capable of inventing such things! They may perhaps also have been\r\ntrue! On those evenings he would pretend to be tired and wish to go to\r\nbed after supper. We would take supper at eleven, monsieur, for he could\r\nnever get back from work earlier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he had finished telling about his adventure he would walk round\r\nthe room and smoke cigarettes, and he was so handsome, with his mustache\r\nand curly hair, that I would think: 'It's true, just the same, what he\r\nis telling. Since I myself am crazy about that man, why should not\r\nothers be the same?' Then I would feel like crying, shrieking, running\r\naway and jumping out of the window while I was clearing the table and he\r\nwas smoking. He would yawn in order to show how tired he was, and he\r\nwould say two or three times before going to bed: 'Ah! how well I shall\r\nsleep this evening!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bear him no ill will, because he did not know how he was hurting me.\r\nNo, he could not know! He loved to boast about the women just as a\r\npeacock loves to show his feathers. He got to the point where he thought\r\nthat all of them looked at him and desired him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was hard when he grew old. Oh, monsieur, when I saw his first white\r\nhair I felt a terrible shock and then a great joy\xe2\x80\x94a wicked joy\xe2\x80\x94but so\r\ngreat, so great! I said to myself: 'It's the end-it's the end.' It\r\nseemed as if I were about to be released from prison. At last I could\r\nhave him to myself, all to myself, when the others would no longer want\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was one morning in bed. He was still sleeping and I leaned over him\r\nto wake him up with a kiss, when I noticed in his curls, over his\r\ntemple, a little thread which shone like silver. What a surprise! I\r\nshould not have thought it possible! At first I thought of tearing it\r\nout so that he would not see it, but as I looked carefully I noticed\r\nanother farther up. White hair! He was going to have white hair! My\r\nheart began to thump and perspiration stood out all over me, but away\r\ndown at the bottom I was happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was mean to feel thus, but I did my housework with a light heart\r\nthat morning, without waking him up, and, as soon as he opened his eyes\r\nof his own accord, I said to him: 'Do you know what I discovered while\r\nyou were asleep?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I found white hairs.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe started up as if I had tickled him and said angrily: 'It's not\r\ntrue!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, it is. There are four of them over your left temple.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe jumped out of bed and ran over to the mirror. He could not find\r\nthem. Then I showed him the first one, the lowest, the little curly one,\r\nand I said: 'It's no wonder, after the life that you have been leading.\r\nIn two years all will be over for you.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, I had spoken true; two years later one could not\r\nrecognize him. How quickly a man changes! He was still handsome, but he\r\nhad lost his freshness, and the women no longer ran after him. Ah! what\r\na life I led at that time! How he treated me! Nothing suited him. He\r\nleft his trade to go into the hat business, in which he ate up all his\r\nmoney. Then he unsuccessfully tried to be an actor, and finally he began\r\nto frequent public balls. Fortunately, he had had common sense enough to\r\nsave a little something on which we now live. It is sufficient, but it\r\nis not enormous. And to think that at one time he had almost a fortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you see what he does. This habit holds him like a frenzy. He has to\r\nbe young; he has to dance with women who smell of perfume and cosmetics.\r\nYou poor old darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was looking at her old snoring husband fondly, ready to cry. Then,\r\ngently tiptoeing up to him, she kissed his hair. The physician had risen\r\nand was getting ready to leave, finding nothing to say to this strange\r\ncouple. Just as he was leaving she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind giving me your address? If he should grow worse, I could\r\ngo and get you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PENGUINS' ROCK This is the season for penguins.\r\n\r\nFrom April to the end of May, before the Parisian visitors arrive, one\r\nsees, all at once, on the little beach at Etretat several old gentlemen,\r\nbooted and belted in shooting costume. They spend four or five days at\r\nthe Hotel Hauville, disappear, and return again three weeks later. Then,\r\nafter a fresh sojourn, they go away altogether.\r\n\r\nOne sees them again the following spring.\r\n\r\nThese are the last penguin hunters, what remain of the old set. There\r\nwere about twenty enthusiasts thirty or forty years ago; now there are\r\nonly a few of the enthusiastic sportsmen.\r\n\r\nThe penguin is a very rare bird of passage, with peculiar habits. It\r\nlives the greater part of the year in the latitude of Newfoundland and\r\nthe islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. But in the breeding season a\r\nflight of emigrants crosses the ocean and comes every year to the same\r\nspot to lay their eggs, to the Penguins' Rock near Etretat. They are\r\nfound nowhere else, only there. They have always come there, have always\r\nbeen chased away, but return again, and will always return. As soon as\r\nthe young birds are grown they all fly away, and disappear for a year.\r\n\r\nWhy do they not go elsewhere? Why not choose some other spot on the long\r\nwhite, unending cliff that extends from the Pas-de-Calais to Havre? What\r\nforce, what invincible instinct, what custom of centuries impels these\r\nbirds to come back to this place? What first migration, what tempest,\r\npossibly, once cast their ancestors on this rock? And why do the\r\nchildren, the grandchildren, all the descendants of the first parents\r\nalways return here?\r\n\r\nThere are not many of them, a hundred at most, as if one single family,\r\nmaintaining the tradition, made this annual pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nAnd each spring, as soon as the little wandering tribe has taken up its\r\nabode an the rock, the same sportsmen also reappear in the village. One\r\nknew them formerly when they were young; now they are old, but constant\r\nto the regular appointment which they have kept for thirty or forty\r\nyears. They would not miss it for anything in the world.\r\n\r\nIt was an April evening in one of the later years. Three of the old\r\nsportsmen had arrived; one was missing\xe2\x80\x94M. d'Arnelles.\r\n\r\nHe had written to no one, given no account of himself. But he was not\r\ndead, like so many of the rest; they would have heard of it. At length,\r\ntired of waiting for him, the other three sat down to table. Dinner was\r\nalmost over when a carriage drove into the yard of the hotel, and the\r\nlate corner presently entered the dining room.\r\n\r\nHe sat down, in a good humor, rubbing his hands, and ate with zest. When\r\none of his comrades remarked with surprise at his being in a frock-coat,\r\nhe replied quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had no time to change my clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey retired on leaving the table, for they had to set out before\r\ndaybreak in order to take the birds unawares.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so pretty as this sport, this early morning expedition.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the morning the sailors awoke the sportsmen by\r\nthrowing sand against the windows. They were ready in a few minutes and\r\nwent down to the beach. Although it was still dark, the stars had paled\r\na little. The sea ground the shingle on the beach. There was such a\r\nfresh breeze that it made one shiver slightly in spite of one's heavy\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nPresently two boats were pushed down the beach, by the sailors, with a\r\nsound as of tearing cloth, and were floated on the nearest waves. The\r\nbrown sail was hoisted, swelled a little, fluttered, hesitated and\r\nswelling out again as round as a paunch, carried the boats towards the\r\nlarge arched entrance that could be faintly distinguished in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe sky became clearer, the shadows seemed to melt away. The coast still\r\nseemed veiled, the great white coast, perpendicular as a wall.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the Manne-Porte, an enormous arch beneath which a\r\nship could sail; they doubled the promontory of La Courtine, passed the\r\nlittle valley of Antifer and the cape of the same name; and suddenly\r\ncaught sight of a beach on which some hundreds of seagulls were perched.\r\n\r\nThat was the Penguins' Rock. It was just a little protuberance of the\r\ncliff, and on the narrow ledges of rock the birds' heads might be seen\r\nwatching the boats.\r\n\r\nThey remained there, motionless, not venturing to fly off as yet. Some\r\nof them perched on the edges, seated upright, looked almost like\r\nbottles, for their little legs are so short that when they walk they\r\nglide along as if they were on rollers. When they start to fly they\r\ncannot make a spring and let themselves fall like stones almost down to\r\nthe very men who are watching them.\r\n\r\nThey know their limitation and the danger to which it subjects them, and\r\ncannot make up their minds to fly away.\r\n\r\nBut the boatmen begin to shout, beating the sides of the boat with the\r\nwooden boat pins, and the birds, in affright, fly one by one into space\r\nuntil they reach the level of the waves. Then, moving their wings\r\nrapidly, they scud, scud along until they reach the open sea; if a\r\nshower of lead does not knock them into the water.\r\n\r\nFor an hour the firing is kept up, obliging them to give up, one after\r\nanother. Sometimes the mother birds will not leave their nests, and are\r\nriddled with shot, causing drops of blood to spurt out on the white\r\ncliff, and the animal dies without having deserted her eggs.\r\n\r\nThe first day M. d'Arnelles fired at the birds with his habitual zeal;\r\nbut when the party returned toward ten o'clock, beneath a brilliant sun,\r\nwhich cast great triangles of light on the white cliffs along the coast\r\nhe appeared a little worried, and absentminded, contrary to his\r\naccustomed manner.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got on shore a kind of servant dressed in black came up\r\nto him and said something in a low tone. He seemed to reflect, hesitate,\r\nand then replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe following day they set out again. This time M, d'Arnelles frequently\r\nmissed his aim, although the birds were close by. His friends teased\r\nhim, asked him if he were in love, if some secret sorrow was troubling\r\nhis mind and heart. At length he confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, I have to leave soon, and that annoys me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you must leave? And why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have some business that calls me back. I cannot stay any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey then talked of other matters.\r\n\r\nAs soon as breakfast was over the valet in black appeared. M. d'Arnelles\r\nordered his carriage, and the man was leaving the room when the three\r\nsportsmen interfered, insisting, begging, and praying their friend to\r\nstay. One of them at last said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, this cannot be a matter of such importance, for you have\r\nalready waited two days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. d'Arnelles, altogether perplexed, began to think, evidently baffled,\r\ndivided between pleasure and duty, unhappy and disturbed.\r\n\r\nAfter reflecting for some time he stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is\xe2\x80\x94the fact is\xe2\x80\x94I am not alone here. I have my son-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were exclamations and shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cYour son-in-law! Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe suddenly appeared confused and his face grew red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! do you not know? Why\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94he is in the coach house. He is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were all silent in amazement.\r\n\r\nM. d'Arnelles continued, more and more disturbed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the misfortune to lose him; and as I was taking the body to my\r\nhouse, in Briseville, I came round this way so as not to miss our\r\nappointment. But you can see that I cannot wait any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen one of the sportsmen, bolder than the rest said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but\xe2\x80\x94since he is dead\xe2\x80\x94it seems to me that he can wait a day\r\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others chimed in:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cannot be denied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. d'Arnelles appeared to be relieved of a great weight, but a little\r\nuneasy, nevertheless, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, frankly\xe2\x80\x94do you think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three others, as one man, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu! my dear boy, two days more or less can make no difference in\r\nhis present condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, perfectly calmly, the father-in-law turned to the undertaker's\r\nassistant, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, my friend, it will be the day after tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAMILY\r\n\r\nI was to see my old friend, Simon Radevin, of whom I had lost sight for\r\nfifteen years. At one time he was my most intimate friend, the friend\r\nwho knows one's thoughts, with whom one passes long, quiet, happy\r\nevenings, to whom one tells one's secret love affairs, and who seems to\r\ndraw out those rare, ingenious, delicate thoughts born of that sympathy\r\nthat gives a sense of repose.\r\n\r\nFor years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, travelled,\r\nthought and dreamed together; had liked the same things, had admired the\r\nsame books, understood the same authors, trembled with the same\r\nsensations, and very often laughed at the same individuals, whom we\r\nunderstood completely by merely exchanging a glance.\r\n\r\nThen he married. He married, quite suddenly, a little girl from the\r\nprovinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How in the\r\nworld could that little thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands,\r\nher light, vacant eyes, and her clear, silly voice, who was exactly like\r\na hundred thousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent,\r\nclever young fellow? Can any one understand these things? No doubt he\r\nhad hoped for happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in\r\nthe arms of a good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in\r\nthe transparent looks of that schoolgirl with light hair.\r\n\r\nHe had not dreamed of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man\r\ngrows weary of everything as soon as he understands the stupid reality,\r\nunless, indeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nWhat would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty, light-\r\nhearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor induced by\r\nprovincial life? A man may change greatly in the course of fifteen\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nThe train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage,\r\na stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to\r\nme with open arms, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge!\xe2\x80\x9d I embraced him, but I had not\r\nrecognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! You have not\r\ngrown thin!\xe2\x80\x9d And he replied with a laugh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you expect? Good living, a good table and good nights! Eating\r\nand sleeping, that is my existence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him closely, trying to discover in that broad face the\r\nfeatures I held so dear. His eyes alone had not changed, but I no longer\r\nsaw the same expression in them, and I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the\r\nexpression be the reflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are\r\nnot what they used to be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet his eyes were bright, full of happiness and friendship, but they had\r\nnot that clear, intelligent expression which shows as much as words the\r\nbrightness of the intellect. Suddenly he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are my two eldest children.\xe2\x80\x9d A girl of fourteen, who was almost a\r\nwoman, and a boy of thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a Lycee, came\r\nforward in a hesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low voice:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they yours?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOf course they are,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many\r\nhave you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFive! There are three more at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said this in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I\r\nfelt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt, for this\r\nvainglorious and simple reproducer of his species.\r\n\r\nI got into a carriage which he drove himself, and we set off through the\r\ntown, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town where nothing was moving in the\r\nstreets except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there\r\na shopkeeper, standing at his door, took off his hat, and Simon returned\r\nhis salute and told me the man's name; no doubt to show me that he knew\r\nall the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was\r\nthinking of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream\r\nof all those who bury themselves in the provinces.\r\n\r\nWe were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden that\r\nwas an imitation of a park, and stopped in front of a turreted house,\r\nwhich tried to look like a chateau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my den,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simon, so that I might compliment him on it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis charming,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\nA lady appeared on the steps, dressed for company, and with company\r\nphrases all ready prepared. She was no longer the light-haired, insipid\r\ngirl I had seen in church fifteen years previously, but a stout lady in\r\ncurls and flounces, one of those ladies of uncertain age, without\r\nintellect, without any of those things that go to make a woman. In\r\nshort, she was a mother, a stout, commonplace mother, a human breeding\r\nmachine which procreates without any other preoccupation but her\r\nchildren and her cook-book.\r\n\r\nShe welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged\r\naccording to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen\r\nbefore a mayor, and I said: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah! so there are the others?\xe2\x80\x9d Simon,\r\nradiant with pleasure, introduced them: \xe2\x80\x9cJean, Sophie and Gontran.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door of the drawing-room was open. I went in, and in the depths of\r\nan easy-chair, I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man.\r\nMadame Radevin came forward and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my grandfather, monsieur;\r\nhe is eighty-seven.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she shouted into the shaking old man's\r\nears: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a friend of Simon's, papa.\xe2\x80\x9d The old gentleman tried to\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cgood-day\xe2\x80\x9d to me, and he muttered: \xe2\x80\x9cOua, oua, oua,\xe2\x80\x9d and waved his\r\nhand, and I took a seat saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cSo! You have made\r\ngrandpapa's acquaintance. He is a treasure, that old man; he is the\r\ndelight of the children. But he is so greedy that he almost kills\r\nhimself at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were\r\nallowed to do as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He looks at\r\nall the sweets as if they were so many girls. You never saw anything so\r\nfunny; you will see presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was then shown to my room, to change my dress for dinner, and hearing\r\na great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all\r\nthe children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nMy windows looked out across a dreary, interminable plain, an ocean of\r\ngrass, of wheat and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising\r\nground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be\r\nleading in that house.\r\n\r\nA bell rang; it was for dinner, and I went downstairs. Madame Radevin\r\ntook my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we passed into the dining-room.\r\nA footman wheeled in the old man in his armchair. He gave a greedy and\r\ncurious look at the dessert, as he turned his shaking head with\r\ndifficulty from one dish to the other.\r\n\r\nSimon rubbed his hands: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be amused,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and all the\r\nchildren understanding that I was going to be indulged with the sight of\r\ntheir greedy grandfather, began to laugh, while their mother merely\r\nsmiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making a speaking trumpet\r\nof his hands, shouted at the old man: \xe2\x80\x9cThis evening there is sweet\r\ncreamed rice!\xe2\x80\x9d The wrinkled face of the grandfather brightened, and he\r\ntrembled more violently, from head to foot, showing that he had\r\nunderstood and was very pleased. The dinner began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look!\xe2\x80\x9d Simon whispered. The old man did not like the soup, and\r\nrefused to eat it; but he was obliged to do it for the good of his\r\nhealth, and the footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old\r\nman blew so energetically, so as not to swallow the soup, that it was\r\nscattered like a spray all over the table and over his neighbors. The\r\nchildren writhed with laughter at the spectacle, while their father, who\r\nwas also amused, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIs not the old man comical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the whole meal they were taken up solely with him. He devoured\r\nthe dishes on the table with his eyes, and tried to seize them and pull\r\nthem over to him with his trembling hands. They put them almost within\r\nhis reach, to see his useless efforts, his trembling clutches at them,\r\nthe piteous appeal of his whole nature, of his eyes, of his mouth and of\r\nhis nose as he smelt them, and he slobbered on his table napkin with\r\neagerness, while uttering inarticulate grunts. And the whole family was\r\nhighly amused at this horrible and grotesque scene.\r\n\r\nThen they put a tiny morsel on his plate, and he ate with feverish\r\ngluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when\r\nthe sweetened rice was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with\r\ngreediness, and Gontran called out to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have eaten too much already; you can have no more.\xe2\x80\x9d And they\r\npretended not to give him any. Then he began to cry; he cried and\r\ntrembled more violently than ever, while all the children laughed. At\r\nlast, however, they gave him his helping, a very small piece; and as he\r\nate the first mouthful, he made a comical noise in his throat, and a\r\nmovement with his neck as ducks do when they swallow too large a morsel,\r\nand when he had swallowed it, he began to stamp his feet, so as to get\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and\r\ninterposed on his behalf:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, give him a little more rice!\xe2\x80\x9d But Simon replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, my dear\r\nfellow, if he were to eat too much, it would harm him, at his age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI held my tongue, and thought over those words. Oh, ethics! Oh, logic!\r\nOh, wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only remaining\r\npleasure out of regard for his health! His health! What would he do with\r\nit, inert and trembling wreck that he was? They were taking care of his\r\nlife, so they said. His life? How many days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a\r\nhundred? Why? For his own sake? Or to preserve for some time longer the\r\nspectacle of his impotent greediness in the family.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing whatever. He\r\nhad one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not grant him that last\r\nsolace until he died?\r\n\r\nAfter we had played cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to\r\nbed; I was low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! and I sat at my window. Not a\r\nsound could be heard outside but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a\r\ntree, somewhere in the distance. No doubt the bird was singing in a low\r\nvoice during the night, to lull his mate, who was asleep on her eggs.\r\nAnd I thought of my poor friend's five children, and pictured him to\r\nmyself, snoring by the side of his ugly wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUICIDES To Georges Legrand.\r\n\r\nHardly a day goes by without our reading a news item like the following\r\nin some newspaper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Wednesday night the people living in No. 40 Rue de\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94-, were awakened\r\nby two successive shots. The explosions seemed to come from the\r\napartment occupied by M. X\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. The door was broken in and the man was\r\nfound bathed in his blood, still holding in one hand the revolver with\r\nwhich he had taken his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. X\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94was fifty-seven years of age, enjoying a comfortable income, and\r\nhad everything necessary to make him happy. No cause can be found for\r\nhis action.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat terrible grief, what unknown suffering, hidden despair, secret\r\nwounds drive these presumably happy persons to suicide? We search, we\r\nimagine tragedies of love, we suspect financial troubles, and, as we\r\nnever find anything definite, we apply to these deaths the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA letter found on the desk of one of these \xe2\x80\x9csuicides without cause,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwritten during his last night, beside his loaded revolver, has come into\r\nour hands. We deem it rather interesting. It reveals none of those great\r\ncatastrophes which we always expect to find behind these acts of\r\ndespair; but it shows us the slow succession of the little vexations of\r\nlife, the disintegration of a lonely existence, whose dreams have\r\ndisappeared; it gives the reason for these tragic ends, which only\r\nnervous and high-strung people can understand.\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is midnight. When I have finished this letter I shall kill myself.\r\nWhy? I shall attempt to give the reasons, not for those who may read\r\nthese lines, but for myself, to kindle my waning courage, to impress\r\nupon myself the fatal necessity of this act which can, at best, be only\r\ndeferred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was brought up by simple-minded parents who were unquestioning\r\nbelievers. And I believed as they did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dream lasted a long time. The last veil has just been torn from my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the last few years a strange change has been taking place within\r\nme. All the events of Life, which formerly had to me the glow of a\r\nbeautiful sunset, are now fading away. The true meaning of things has\r\nappeared to me in its brutal reality; and the true reason for love has\r\nbred in me disgust even for this poetic sentiment: 'We are the eternal\r\ntoys of foolish and charming illusions, which are always being renewed.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn growing older, I had become partly reconciled to the awful mystery\r\nof life, to the uselessness of effort; when the emptiness of everything\r\nappeared to me in a new light, this evening, after dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFormerly, I was happy! Everything pleased me: the passing women, the\r\nappearance of the streets, the place where I lived; and I even took an\r\ninterest in the cut of my clothes. But the repetition of the same sights\r\nhas had the result of filling my heart with weariness and disgust, just\r\nas one would feel were one to go every night to the same theatre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last thirty years I have been rising at the same hour; and, at\r\nthe same restaurant, for thirty years, I have been eating at the same\r\nhours the same dishes brought me by different waiters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have tried travel. The loneliness which one feels in strange places\r\nterrified me. I felt so alone, so small on the earth that I quickly\r\nstarted on my homeward journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut here the unchanging expression of my furniture, which has stood for\r\nthirty years in the same place, the smell of my apartments (for, with\r\ntime, each dwelling takes on a particular odor) each night, these and\r\nother things disgust me and make me sick of living thus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything repeats itself endlessly. The way in which I put my key in\r\nthe lock, the place where I always find my matches, the first object\r\nwhich meets my eye when I enter the room, make me feel like jumping out\r\nof the window and putting an end to those monotonous events from which\r\nwe can never escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach day, when I shave, I feel an inordinate desire to cut my throat;\r\nand my face, which I see in the little mirror, always the same, with\r\nsoap on my cheeks, has several times made me weak from sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I even hate to be with people whom I used to meet with pleasure; I\r\nknow them so well, I can tell just what they are going to say and what I\r\nam going to answer. Each brain is like a circus, where the same horse\r\nkeeps circling around eternally. We must circle round always, around the\r\nsame ideas, the same joys, the same pleasures, the same habits, the same\r\nbeliefs, the same sensations of disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fog was terrible this evening. It enfolded the boulevard, where the\r\nstreet lights were dimmed and looked like smoking candles. A heavier\r\nweight than usual oppressed me. Perhaps my digestion was bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor good digestion is everything in life. It gives the inspiration to\r\nthe artist, amorous desires to young people, clear ideas to thinkers,\r\nthe joy of life to everybody, and it also allows one to eat heartily\r\n(which is one of the greatest pleasures). A sick stomach induces\r\nscepticism unbelief, nightmares and the desire for death. I have often\r\nnoticed this fact. Perhaps I would not kill myself, if my digestion had\r\nbeen good this evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I sat down in the arm-chair where I have been sitting every day\r\nfor thirty years, I glanced around me, and just then I was seized by\r\nsuch a terrible distress that I thought I must go mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to think of what I could do to run away from myself. Every\r\noccupation struck me as being worse even than inaction. Then I bethought\r\nme of putting my papers in order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a long time I have been thinking of clearing out my drawers; for,\r\nfor the last thirty years, I have been throwing my letters and bills\r\npell-mell into the same desk, and this confusion has often caused me\r\nconsiderable trouble. But I feel such moral and physical laziness at the\r\nsole idea of putting anything in order that I have never had the courage\r\nto begin this tedious business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI therefore opened my desk, intending to choose among my old papers and\r\ndestroy the majority of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first I was bewildered by this array of documents, yellowed by age,\r\nthen I chose one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! if you cherish life, never disturb the burial place of old letters!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if, perchance, you should, take the contents by the handful, close\r\nyour eyes that you may not read a word, so that you may not recognize\r\nsome forgotten handwriting which may plunge you suddenly into a sea of\r\nmemories; carry these papers to the fire; and when they are in ashes,\r\ncrush them to an invisible powder, or otherwise you are lost\xe2\x80\x94just as I\r\nhave been lost for an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first letters which I read did not interest me greatly. They were\r\nrecent, and came from living men whom I still meet quite often, and\r\nwhose presence does not move me to any great extent. But all at once one\r\nenvelope made me start. My name was traced on it in a large, bold\r\nhandwriting; and suddenly tears came to my eyes. That letter was from my\r\ndearest friend, the companion of my youth, the confidant of my hopes;\r\nand he appeared before me so clearly, with his pleasant smile and his\r\nhand outstretched, that a cold shiver ran down my back. Yes, yes, the\r\ndead come back, for I saw him! Our memory is a more perfect world than\r\nthe universe: it gives back life to those who no longer exist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith trembling hand and dimmed eyes I reread everything that he told\r\nme, and in my poor sobbing heart I felt a wound so painful that I began\r\nto groan as a man whose bones are slowly being crushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I travelled over my whole life, just as one travels along a river.\r\nI recognized people, so long forgotten that I no longer knew their\r\nnames. Their faces alone lived in me. In my mother's letters I saw again\r\nthe old servants, the shape of our house and the little insignificant\r\nodds and ends which cling to our minds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suddenly saw again all my mother's old gowns, the different\r\nstyles which she adopted and the several ways in which she dressed her\r\nhair. She haunted me especially in a silk dress, trimmed with old lace;\r\nand I remembered something she said one day when she was wearing this\r\ndress. She said: 'Robert, my child, if you do not stand up straight you\r\nwill be round-shouldered all your life.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, opening another drawer, I found myself face to face with memories\r\nof tender passions: a dancing-pump, a torn handkerchief, even a garter,\r\nlocks of hair and dried flowers. Then the sweet romances of my life,\r\nwhose living heroines are now white-haired, plunged me into the deep\r\nmelancholy of things. Oh, the young brows where blond locks curl, the\r\ncaress of the hands, the glance which speaks, the hearts which beat,\r\nthat smile which promises the lips, those lips which promise the\r\nembrace! And the first kiss-that endless kiss which makes you close your\r\neyes, which drowns all thought in the immeasurable joy of approaching\r\npossession!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaking these old pledges of former love in both my hands, I covered\r\nthem with furious caresses, and in my soul, torn by these memories, I\r\nsaw them each again at the hour of surrender; and I suffered a torture\r\nmore cruel than all the tortures invented in all the fables about hell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne last letter remained. It was written by me and dictated fifty years\r\nago by my writing teacher. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'MY DEAR LITTLE MAMMA:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am seven years old to-day. It is the age of reason. I take advantage\r\nof it to thank you for having brought me into this world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Your little son, who loves you\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'ROBERT.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all over. I had gone back to the beginning, and suddenly I turned\r\nmy glance on what remained to me of life. I saw hideous and lonely old\r\nage, and approaching infirmities, and everything over and gone. And\r\nnobody near me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy revolver is here, on the table. I am loading it . . . . Never reread\r\nyour old letters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd that is how many men come to kill themselves; and we search in vain\r\nto discover some great sorrow in their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARTIFICE\r\n\r\nThe old doctor sat by the fireside, talking to his fair patient who was\r\nlying on the lounge. There was nothing much the matter with her, except\r\nthat she had one of those little feminine ailments from which pretty\r\nwomen frequently suffer\xe2\x80\x94slight anaemia, a nervous attack, etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never be able to understand a woman\r\ndeceiving her husband. Even allowing that she does not love him, that\r\nshe pays no heed to her vows and promises, how can she give herself to\r\nanother man? How can she conceal the intrigue from other people's eyes?\r\nHow can it be possible to love amid lies and treason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled, and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is perfectly easy, and I can assure\r\nyou that a woman does not think of all those little subtle details when\r\nshe has made up her mind to go astray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for dissimulation, all women have plenty of it on hand for such\r\noccasions, and the simplest of them are wonderful, and extricate\r\nthemselves from the greatest dilemmas in a remarkable manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman, however, seemed incredulous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cone never thinks until after it has happened of\r\nwhat one ought to have done in a critical situation, and women are\r\ncertainly more liable than men to lose their head on such occasions:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor raised his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter it has happened, you say! Now I will\r\ntell you something that happened to one of my female patients, whom I\r\nalways considered an immaculate woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happened in a provincial town, and one night when I was asleep, in\r\nthat deep first sleep from which it is so difficult to rouse us, it\r\nseemed to me, in my dreams, as if the bells in the town were sounding a\r\nfire alarm, and I woke up with a start. It was my own bell, which was\r\nringing wildly, and as my footman did not seem to be answering the door,\r\nI, in turn, pulled the bell at the head of my bed, and soon I heard a\r\nbanging, and steps in the silent house, and Jean came into my room, and\r\nhanded me a letter which said: 'Madame Lelievre begs Dr. Simeon to come\r\nto her immediately.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought for a few moments, and then I said to myself: 'A nervous\r\nattack, vapors; nonsense, I am too tired.' And so I replied: 'As Dr.\r\nSimeon is not at all well, he must beg Madame Lelievre to be kind enough\r\nto call in his colleague, Monsieur Bonnet.' I put the note into an\r\nenvelope and went to sleep again, but about half an hour later the\r\nstreet bell rang again, and Jean came to me and said: 'There is somebody\r\ndownstairs; I do not quite know whether it is a man or a woman, as the\r\nindividual is so wrapped up, but they wish to speak to you immediately.\r\nThey say it is a matter of life and death for two people.' Whereupon I\r\nsat up in bed and told him to show the person in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA kind of black phantom appeared and raised her veil as soon as Jean\r\nhad left the room. It was Madame Berthe Lelievre, quite a young woman,\r\nwho had been married for three years to a large merchant in the town,\r\nwho was said to have married the prettiest girl in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was terribly pale, her face was contracted as the faces of insane\r\npeople are, occasionally, and her hands trembled violently. Twice she\r\ntried to speak without being able to utter a sound, but at last she\r\nstammered out: 'Come\xe2\x80\x94quick\xe2\x80\x94quick, doctor. Come\xe2\x80\x94my\xe2\x80\x94friend has just died\r\nin my bedroom.' She stopped, half suffocated with emotion, and then went\r\non: 'My husband will be coming home from the club very soon.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI jumped out of bed without even considering that I was only in my\r\nnightshirt, and dressed myself in a few moments, and then I said: 'Did\r\nyou come a short time ago?' 'No,' she said, standing like a statue\r\npetrified with horror. 'It was my servant\xe2\x80\x94she knows.' And then, after a\r\nshort silence, she went on: 'I was there\xe2\x80\x94by his side.' And she uttered a\r\nsort of cry of horror, and after a fit of choking, which made her gasp,\r\nshe wept violently, and shook with spasmodic sobs for a minute: or two.\r\nThen her tears suddenly ceased, as if by an internal fire, and with an\r\nair of tragic calmness, she said: 'Let us make haste.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was ready, but exclaimed: 'I quite forgot to order my carriage.' 'I\r\nhave one,' she said; 'it is his, which was waiting for him!' She wrapped\r\nherself up, so as to completely conceal her face, and we started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she was by my side in the carriage she suddenly seized my hand,\r\nand crushing it in her delicate fingers, she said, with a shaking voice,\r\nthat proceeded from a distracted heart: 'Oh! if you only knew, if you\r\nonly knew what I am suffering! I loved him, I have loved him\r\ndistractedly, like a madwoman, for the last six months.' 'Is anyone up\r\nin your house?' I asked. 'No, nobody except those, who knows\r\neverything.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe stopped at the door, and evidently everybody was asleep. We went in\r\nwithout making any noise, by means of her latch-key, and walked upstairs\r\non tiptoe. The frightened servant was sitting on the top of the stairs\r\nwith a lighted candle by her side, as she was afraid to remain with the\r\ndead man, and I went into the room, which was in great disorder. Wet\r\ntowels, with which they had bathed the young man's temples, were lying\r\non the floor, by the side of a washbasin and a glass, while a strong\r\nsmell of vinegar pervaded the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dead man's body was lying at full length in the middle of the room,\r\nand I went up to it, looked at it, and touched it. I opened the eyes and\r\nfelt the hands, and then, turning to the two women, who were shaking as\r\nif they were freezing, I said to them: 'Help me to lift him on to the\r\nbed.' When we had laid him gently on it, I listened to his heart and put\r\na looking-glass to his lips, and then said: 'It is all over.' It was a\r\nterrible sight!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at the man, and said: 'You ought to arrange his hair a\r\nlittle.' The girl went and brought her mistress' comb and brush, but as\r\nshe was trembling, and pulling out his long, matted hair in doing it,\r\nMadame Lelievre took the comb out of her hand, and arranged his hair as\r\nif she were caressing him. She parted it, brushed his beard, rolled his\r\nmustaches gently round her fingers, then, suddenly, letting go of his\r\nhair, she took the dead man's inert head in her hands and looked for a\r\nlong time in despair at the dead face, which no longer could smile at\r\nher, and then, throwing herself on him, she clasped him in her arms and\r\nkissed him ardently. Her kisses fell like blows on his closed mouth and\r\neyes, his forehead and temples; and then, putting her lips to his ear,\r\nas if he could still hear her, and as if she were about to whisper\r\nsomething to him, she said several times, in a heartrending voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Good-by, my darling!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust then the clock struck twelve, and I started up. 'Twelve o'clock!'\r\nI exclaimed. 'That is the time when the club closes. Come, madame, we\r\nhave not a moment to lose!' She started up, and I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'We must carry him into the drawing-room.' And when we had done this, I\r\nplaced him on a sofa, and lit the chandeliers, and just then the front\r\ndoor was opened and shut noisily. 'Rose, bring me the basin and the\r\ntowels, and make the room look tidy. Make haste, for Heaven's sake!\r\nMonsieur Lelievre is coming in.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard his steps on the stairs, and then his hands feeling along the\r\nwalls. 'Come here, my dear fellow,' I said; 'we have had an accident.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the astonished husband appeared in the door with a cigar in his\r\nmouth, and said: 'What is the matter? What is the meaning of this?' 'My\r\ndear friend,' I said, going up to him, 'you find us in great\r\nembarrassment. I had remained late, chatting with your wife and our\r\nfriend, who had brought me in his carriage, when he suddenly fainted,\r\nand in spite of all we have done, he has remained unconscious for two\r\nhours. I did not like to call in strangers, and if you will now help me\r\ndownstairs with him, I shall be able to attend to him better at his own\r\nhouse.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe husband, who was surprised, but quite unsuspicious, took off his\r\nhat, and then he took his rival, who would be quite inoffensive for the\r\nfuture, under the arms. I got between his two legs, as if I had been a\r\nhorse between the shafts, and we went downstairs, while his wife held a\r\nlight for us. When we got outside I stood the body up, so as to deceive\r\nthe coachman, and said: 'Come, my friend; it is nothing; you feel better\r\nalready I expect. Pluck up your courage, and make an effort. It will\r\nsoon be over.' But as I felt that he was slipping out of my hands, I\r\ngave him a slap on the shoulder, which sent him forward and made him\r\nfall into the carriage, and then I got in after him. Monsieur Lelievre,\r\nwho was rather alarmed, said to me: 'Do you think it is anything\r\nserious?' To which I replied: 'No,' with a smile, as I looked at his\r\nwife, who had put her arm into that of her husband, and was trying to\r\nsee into the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shook hands with them and told my coachman to start, and during the\r\nwhole drive the dead man kept falling against me. When we got to his\r\nhouse I said that he had become unconscious on the way home, and helped\r\nto carry him upstairs, where I certified that he was dead, and acted\r\nanother comedy to his distracted family, and at last I got back to bed,\r\nnot without swearing at lovers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor ceased, though he was still smiling, and the young woman, who\r\nwas in a very nervous state, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you told me that terrible\r\nstory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave her a gallant bow, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that I may offer you my services if they should be needed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDREAMS\r\n\r\nThey had just dined together, five old friends, a writer, a doctor and\r\nthree rich bachelors without any profession.\r\n\r\nThey had talked about everything, and a feeling of lassitude came over\r\nthem, that feeling which precedes and leads to the departure of guests\r\nafter festive gatherings. One of those present, who had for the last\r\nfive minutes been gazing silently at the surging boulevard dotted with\r\ngas-lamps, with its rattling vehicles, said suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you've nothing to do from morning till night, the days are long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the nights too,\xe2\x80\x9d assented the guest who sat next to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI sleep\r\nvery little; pleasures fatigue me; conversation is monotonous. Never do\r\nI come across a new idea, and I feel, before talking to any one, a\r\nviolent longing to say nothing and to listen to nothing. I don't know\r\nwhat to do with my evenings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe third idler remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would pay a great deal for anything that would help me to pass just\r\ntwo pleasant hours every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe writer, who had just thrown his overcoat across his arm, turned\r\nround to them, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who could discover a new vice and introduce it among his fellow\r\ncreatures, even if it were to shorten their lives, would render a\r\ngreater service to humanity than the man who found the means of securing\r\nto them eternal salvation and eternal youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor burst out laughing, and, while he chewed his cigar, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it is not so easy to discover it. Men have however crudely,\r\nbeen seeking for\xe2\x80\x94and working for the object you refer to since the\r\nbeginning of the world. The men who came first reached perfection at\r\nonce in this way. We are hardly equal to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the three idlers murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, after a minute's pause, he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we could only sleep, sleep well, without feeling hot or cold, sleep\r\nwith that perfect unconsciousness we experience on nights when we are\r\nthoroughly fatigued, sleep without dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy without dreams?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the guest sitting next to him.\r\n\r\nThe other replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause dreams are not always pleasant; they are always fantastic,\r\nimprobable, disconnected; and because when we are asleep we cannot have\r\nthe sort of dreams we like. We ought to dream waking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what's to prevent you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the writer.\r\n\r\nThe doctor flung away the end of his cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, in order to dream when you are awake, you need great\r\npower and great exercise of will, and when you try to do it, great\r\nweariness is the result. Now, real dreaming, that journey of our\r\nthoughts through delightful visions, is assuredly the sweetest\r\nexperience in the world; but it must come naturally, it must not be\r\nprovoked in a painful, manner, and must be accompanied by absolute\r\nbodily comfort. This power of dreaming I can give you, provided you\r\npromise that you will not abuse it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe writer shrugged his shoulders:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, I know\xe2\x80\x94hasheesh, opium, green tea\xe2\x80\x94artificial paradises. I have\r\nread Baudelaire, and I even tasted the famous drug, which made me very\r\nsick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the doctor, without stirring from his seat, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; ether, nothing but ether; and I would suggest that you literary men\r\nshould use it sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three rich bachelors drew closer to the doctor.\r\n\r\nOne of them said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain to us the effects of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us put aside big words, shall we not? I am not talking of medicine\r\nor morality; I am talking of pleasure. You give yourselves up every day\r\nto excesses which consume your lives. I want to indicate to you a new\r\nsensation, possible only to intelligent men\xe2\x80\x94let us say even very\r\nintelligent men\xe2\x80\x94dangerous, like everything else that overexcites our\r\norgans, but exquisite. I might add that you would require a certain\r\npreparation, that is to say, practice, to feel in all their completeness\r\nthe singular effects of ether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are different from the effects of hasheesh, of opium, or morphia,\r\nand they cease as soon as the absorption of the drug is interrupted,\r\nwhile the other generators of day dreams continue their action for\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am now going to try to analyze these feelings as clearly as possible.\r\nBut the thing is not easy, so facile, so delicate, so almost\r\nimperceptible, are these sensations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was when I was attacked by violent neuralgia that I made use of this\r\nremedy, which since then I have, perhaps, slightly abused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had acute pains in my head and neck, and an intolerable heat of the\r\nskin, a feverish restlessness. I took up a large bottle of ether, and,\r\nlying down, I began to inhale it slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of some minutes I thought I heard a vague murmur, which ere\r\nlong became a sort of humming, and it seemed to me that all the interior\r\nof my body had become light, light as air, that it was dissolving into\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen came a sort of torpor, a sleepy sensation of comfort, in spite of\r\nthe pains which still continued, but which had ceased to make themselves\r\nfelt. It was one of those sensations which we are willing to endure and\r\nnot any of those frightful wrenches against which our tortured body\r\nprotests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon the strange and delightful sense of emptiness which I felt in my\r\nchest extended to my limbs, which, in their turn, became light, as light\r\nas if the flesh and the bones had been melted and the skin only were\r\nleft, the skin necessary to enable me to realize the sweetness of\r\nliving, of bathing in this sensation of well-being. Then I perceived\r\nthat I was no longer suffering. The pain had gone, melted away,\r\nevaporated. And I heard voices, four voices, two dialogues, without\r\nunderstanding what was said. At one time there were only indistinct\r\nsounds, at another time a word reached my ear. But I recognized that\r\nthis was only the humming I had heard before, but emphasized. I was not\r\nasleep; I was not awake; I comprehended, I felt, I reasoned with the\r\nutmost clearness and depth, with extraordinary energy and intellectual\r\npleasure, with a singular intoxication arising from this separation of\r\nmy mental faculties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not like the dreams caused by hasheesh or the somewhat sickly\r\nvisions that come from opium; it was an amazing acuteness of reasoning,\r\na new way of seeing, judging and appreciating the things of life, and\r\nwith the certainty, the absolute consciousness that this was the true\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the old image of the Scriptures suddenly came back to my mind. It\r\nseemed to me that I had tasted of the Tree of Knowledge, that all the\r\nmysteries were unveiled, so much did I find myself under the sway of a\r\nnew, strange and irrefutable logic. And arguments, reasonings, proofs\r\nrose up in a heap before my brain only to be immediately displaced by\r\nsome stronger proof, reasoning, argument. My head had, in fact, become a\r\nbattleground of ideas. I was a superior being, armed with invincible\r\nintelligence, and I experienced a huge delight at the manifestation of\r\nmy power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt lasted a long, long time. I still kept inhaling the ether from my\r\nflagon. Suddenly I perceived that it was empty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four men exclaimed at the same time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor, a prescription at once for a liter of ether!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the doctor, putting on his hat, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that, certainly not; go and let some one else poison you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he left them.\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, what is your opinion on the subject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON'S PAPA\r\n\r\nNoon had just struck. The school door opened and the youngsters darted\r\nout, jostling each other in their haste to get out quickly. But instead\r\nof promptly dispersing and going home to dinner as usual, they stopped a\r\nfew paces off, broke up into knots, and began whispering.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that, that morning, Simon, the son of La Blanchotte, had,\r\nfor the first time, attended school.\r\n\r\nThey had all of them in their families heard talk of La Blanchotte; and,\r\nalthough in public she was welcome enough, the mothers among themselves\r\ntreated her with a somewhat disdainful compassion, which the children\r\nhad imitated without in the least knowing why.\r\n\r\nAs for Simon himself, they did not know him, for he never went out, and\r\ndid not run about with them in the streets of the village, or along the\r\nbanks of the river. And they did not care for him; so it was with a\r\ncertain delight, mingled with considerable astonishment, that they met\r\nand repeated to each other what had been said by a lad of fourteen or\r\nfifteen who appeared to know all about it, so sagaciously did he wink.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know\xe2\x80\x94Simon\xe2\x80\x94well, he has no papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then La Blanchotte's son appeared in the doorway of the school.\r\n\r\nHe was seven or eight years old, rather pale, very neat, with a timid\r\nand almost awkward manner.\r\n\r\nHe was starting home to his mother's house when the groups of his\r\nschoolmates, whispering and watching him with the mischievous and\r\nheartless eyes of children bent upon playing a nasty trick, gradually\r\nclosed in around him and ended by surrounding him altogether. There he\r\nstood in their midst, surprised and embarrassed, not understanding what\r\nthey were going to do with him. But the lad who had brought the news,\r\npuffed up with the success he had met with already, demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name, you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cSimon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimon what?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the other.\r\n\r\nThe child, altogether bewildered, repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cSimon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lad shouted at him: \xe2\x80\x9cOne is named Simon something\xe2\x80\x94that is not a\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94Simon indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child, on the brink of tears, replied for the third time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Simon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe urchins began to laugh. The triumphant tormentor cried: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see\r\nplainly that he has no papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep silence ensued. The children were dumfounded by this\r\nextraordinary, impossible, monstrous thing\xe2\x80\x94a boy who had not a papa;\r\nthey looked upon him as a phenomenon, an unnatural being, and they felt\r\nthat hitherto inexplicable contempt of their mothers for La Blanchotte\r\ngrowing upon them. As for Simon, he had leaned against a tree to avoid\r\nfalling, and he remained as if prostrated by an irreparable disaster. He\r\nsought to explain, but could think of nothing-to say to refute this\r\nhorrible charge that he had no papa. At last he shouted at them quite\r\nrecklessly: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the boy.\r\n\r\nSimon was silent, he did not know. The children roared, tremendously\r\nexcited; and those country boys, little more than animals, experienced\r\nthat cruel craving which prompts the fowls of a farmyard to destroy one\r\nof their number as soon as it is wounded. Simon suddenly espied a little\r\nneighbor, the son of a widow, whom he had seen, as he himself was to be\r\nseen, always alone with his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no more have you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cno more have you a papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI have one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the brat, with superb dignity; \xe2\x80\x9che is in the\r\ncemetery, is my papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA murmur of approval rose among the little wretches as if this fact of\r\npossessing a papa dead in a cemetery had caused their comrade to grow\r\nbig enough to crush the other one who had no papa at all. And these\r\nboys, whose fathers were for the most part bad men, drunkards, thieves,\r\nand who beat their wives, jostled each other to press closer and closer,\r\nas though they, the legitimate ones, would smother by their pressure one\r\nwho was illegitimate.\r\n\r\nThe boy who chanced to be next Simon suddenly put his tongue out at him\r\nwith a mocking air and shouted at him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo papa! No papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimon seized him by the hair with both hands and set to work to disable\r\nhis legs with kicks, while he bit his cheek ferociously. A tremendous\r\nstruggle ensued between the two combatants, and Simon found himself\r\nbeaten, torn, bruised, rolled on the ground in the midst of the ring of\r\napplauding schoolboys. As he arose, mechanically brushing with his hand\r\nhis little blouse all covered with dust, some one shouted at him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell your papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he felt a great sinking at his heart. They were stronger than he\r\nwas, they had beaten him, and he had no answer to give them, for he knew\r\nwell that it was true that he had no papa. Full of pride, he attempted\r\nfor some moments to struggle against the tears which were choking him.\r\nHe had a feeling of suffocation, and then without any sound he commenced\r\nto weep, with great shaking sobs. A ferocious joy broke out among his\r\nenemies, and, with one accord, just like savages in their fearful\r\nfestivals, they took each other by the hand and danced round him in a\r\ncircle, repeating as a refrain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo papa! No papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut suddenly Simon ceased sobbing. He became ferocious. There were\r\nstones under his feet; he picked them up and with all his strength\r\nhurled them at his tormentors. Two or three were struck and rushed off\r\nyelling, and so formidable did he appear that the rest became panic-\r\nstricken. Cowards, as the mob always is in presence of an exasperated\r\nman, they broke up and fled. Left alone, the little fellow without a\r\nfather set off running toward the fields, for a recollection had been\r\nawakened in him which determined his soul to a great resolve. He made up\r\nhis mind to drown himself in the river.\r\n\r\nHe remembered, in fact, that eight days before, a poor devil who begged\r\nfor his livelihood had thrown himself into the water because he had no\r\nmore money. Simon had been there when they fished him out again; and the\r\nwretched man, who usually seemed to him so miserable, and ugly, had then\r\nstruck him as being so peaceful with his pale cheeks, his long drenched\r\nbeard, and his open eyes full of calm. The bystanders had said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd some one had said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is quite happy now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Simon wished to drown himself also, because he had no father, just\r\nlike the wretched being who had no money.\r\n\r\nHe reached the water and watched it flowing. Some fish were sporting\r\nbriskly in the clear stream and occasionally made a little bound and\r\ncaught the flies flying on the surface. He stopped crying in order to\r\nwatch them, for their maneuvers interested him greatly. But, at\r\nintervals, as in a tempest intervals of calm alternate suddenly with\r\ntremendous gusts of wind, which snap off the trees and then lose\r\nthemselves in the horizon, this thought would return to him with intense\r\npain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to drown myself because I have no papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very warm, fine weather. The pleasant sunshine warmed the grass.\r\nThe water shone like a mirror. And Simon enjoyed some minutes of\r\nhappiness, of that languor which follows weeping, and felt inclined to\r\nfall asleep there upon the grass in the warm sunshine.\r\n\r\nA little green frog leaped from under his feet. He endeavored to catch\r\nit. It escaped him. He followed it and lost it three times in\r\nsuccession. At last he caught it by one of its hind legs and began to\r\nlaugh as he saw the efforts the creature made to escape. It gathered\r\nitself up on its hind legs and then with a violent spring suddenly\r\nstretched them out as stiff as two bars; while it beat the air with its\r\nfront legs as though they were hands, its round eyes staring in their\r\ncircle of yellow. It reminded him of a toy made of straight slips of\r\nwood nailed zigzag one on the other; which by a similar movement\r\nregulated the movements of the little soldiers fastened thereon. Then he\r\nthought of his home, and then of his mother, and, overcome by sorrow, he\r\nagain began to weep. A shiver passed over him. He knelt down and said\r\nhis prayers as before going to bed. But he was unable to finish them,\r\nfor tumultuous, violent sobs shook his whole frame. He no longer\r\nthought, he no longer saw anything around him, and was wholly absorbed\r\nin crying.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a heavy hand was placed upon his shoulder, and a rough voice\r\nasked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that causes you so much grief, my little man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimon turned round. A tall workman with a beard and black curly hair was\r\nstaring at him good-naturedly. He answered with his eyes and throat full\r\nof tears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey beat me\xe2\x80\x94because\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I have no\xe2\x80\x94papa\xe2\x80\x94no papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, everybody has one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child answered painfully amid his spasms of grief:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the workman became serious. He had recognized La Blanchotte's son,\r\nand, although himself a new arrival in the neighborhood, he had a vague\r\nidea of her history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cconsole yourself, my boy, and come with me home to\r\nyour mother. They will give you\xe2\x80\x94a papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so they started on the way, the big fellow holding the little fellow\r\nby the hand, and the man smiled, for he was not sorry to see this\r\nBlanchotte, who was, it was said, one of the prettiest girls of the\r\ncountryside, and, perhaps, he was saying to himself, at the bottom of\r\nhis heart, that a lass who had erred might very well err again.\r\n\r\nThey arrived in front of a very neat little white house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the child, and he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA woman appeared, and the workman instantly left off smiling, for he saw\r\nat once that there was no fooling to be done with the tall pale girl who\r\nstood austerely at her door as though to defend from one man the\r\nthreshold of that house where she had already been betrayed by another.\r\nIntimidated, his cap in his hand, he stammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, madame, I have brought you back your little boy who had lost\r\nhimself near the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Simon flung his arms about his mother's neck and told her, as he\r\nagain began to cry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mamma, I wished to drown myself, because the others had beaten me\r\n\xe2\x80\x94had beaten me\xe2\x80\x94because I have no papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA burning redness covered the young woman's cheeks; and, hurt to the\r\nquick, she embraced her child passionately, while the tears coursed down\r\nher face. The man, much moved, stood there, not knowing how to get away.\r\n\r\nBut Simon suddenly ran to him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be my papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep silence ensued. La Blanchotte, dumb and tortured with shame,\r\nleaned herself against the wall, both her hands upon her heart. The\r\nchild, seeing that no answer was made him, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will not, I shall go back and drown myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workman took the matter as a jest and answered, laughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, certainly I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the child, \xe2\x80\x9cso that I may tell the others\r\nwhen they wish to know your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the man:\r\n\r\nSimon was silent a moment so that he might get the name well into his\r\nhead; then he stretched out his arms, quite consoled, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Philip, you are my papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workman, lifting him from the ground, kissed him hastily on both\r\ncheeks, and then walked away very quickly with great strides. When the\r\nchild returned to school next day he was received with a spiteful laugh,\r\nand at the end of school, when the lads were on the point of\r\nrecommencing, Simon threw these words at their heads as he would have\r\ndone a stone: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is named Philip, my papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYells of delight burst out from all sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip who? Philip what? What on earth is Philip? Where did you pick up\r\nyour Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimon answered nothing; and, immovable in his faith, he defied them with\r\nhis eye, ready to be martyred rather than fly before them. The school\r\nmaster came to his rescue and he returned home to his mother.\r\n\r\nDuring three months, the tall workman, Philip, frequently passed by La\r\nBlanchotte's house, and sometimes he made bold to speak to her when he\r\nsaw her sewing near the window. She answered him civilly, always\r\nsedately, never joking with him, nor permitting him to enter her house.\r\nNotwithstanding, being, like all men, a bit of a coxcomb, he imagined\r\nthat she was often rosier than usual when she chatted with him.\r\n\r\nBut a lost reputation is so difficult to regain and always remains so\r\nfragile that, in spite of the shy reserve of La Blanchotte, they already\r\ngossiped in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAs for Simon he loved his new papa very much, and walked with him nearly\r\nevery evening when the day's work was done. He went regularly to school,\r\nand mixed with great dignity with his schoolfellows without ever\r\nanswering them back.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, the lad who had first attacked him said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have lied. You have not a papa named Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Simon, much disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe youth rubbed his hands. He replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if you had one he would be your mamma's husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimon was confused by the truth of this reasoning; nevertheless, he\r\nretorted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my papa, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat can very well be,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the urchin with a sneer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is\r\nnot being your papa altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLa Blanchotte's little one bowed his head and went off dreaming in the\r\ndirection of the forge belonging to old Loizon, where Philip worked.\r\nThis forge was as though buried beneath trees. It was very dark there;\r\nthe red glare of a formidable furnace alone lit up with great flashes\r\nfive blacksmiths; who hammered upon their anvils with a terrible din.\r\nThey were standing enveloped in flame, like demons, their eyes fixed on\r\nthe red-hot iron they were pounding; and their dull ideas rose and fell\r\nwith their hammers.\r\n\r\nSimon entered without being noticed, and went quietly to pluck his\r\nfriend by the sleeve. The latter turned round. All at once the work came\r\nto a standstill, and all the men looked on, very attentive. Then, in the\r\nmidst of this unaccustomed silence, rose the slender pipe of Simon:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Philip, the Michaude boy told me just now that you were not\r\naltogether my papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the blacksmith,\r\n\r\nThe child replied with all innocence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are not my mamma's husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one laughed. Philip remained standing, leaning his forehead upon the\r\nback of his great hands, which supported the handle of his hammer\r\nstanding upright upon the anvil. He mused. His four companions watched\r\nhim, and Simon, a tiny mite among these giants, anxiously waited.\r\nSuddenly, one of the smiths, answering to the sentiment of all, said to\r\nPhilip:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Blanchotte is a good, honest girl, and upright and steady in spite\r\nof her misfortune, and would make a worthy wife for an honest man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the three others.\r\n\r\nThe smith continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it the girl's fault if she went wrong? She had been promised\r\nmarriage; and I know more than one who is much respected to-day, and who\r\nsinned every bit as much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the three men in chorus.\r\n\r\nHe resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow hard she has toiled, poor thing, to bring up her child all alone,\r\nand how she has wept all these years she has never gone out except to\r\nchurch, God only knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is also true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the others.\r\n\r\nThen nothing was heard but the bellows which fanned the fire of the\r\nfurnace. Philip hastily bent himself down to Simon:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell your mother that I am coming to speak to her this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen he pushed the child out by the shoulders. He returned to his work,\r\nand with a single blow the five hammers again fell upon their anvils.\r\nThus they wrought the iron until nightfall, strong, powerful, happy,\r\nlike contented hammers. But just as the great bell of a cathedral\r\nresounds upon feast days above the jingling of the other bells, so\r\nPhilip's hammer, sounding above the rest, clanged second after second\r\nwith a deafening uproar. And he stood amid the flying sparks plying his\r\ntrade vigorously.\r\n\r\nThe sky was full of stars as he knocked at La Blanchotte's door. He had\r\non his Sunday blouse, a clean shirt, and his beard was trimmed. The\r\nyoung woman showed herself upon the threshold, and said in a grieved\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is ill to come thus when night has fallen, Mr. Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wished to answer, but stammered and stood confused before her.\r\n\r\nShe resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand, do you not, that it will not do for me to be talked\r\nabout again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter to me, if you will be my wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo voice replied to him, but he believed that he heard in the shadow of\r\nthe room the sound of a falling body. He entered quickly; and Simon, who\r\nhad gone to bed, distinguished the sound of a kiss and some words that\r\nhis mother murmured softly. Then, all at once, he found himself lifted\r\nup by the hands of his friend, who, holding him at the length of his\r\nherculean arms, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will tell them, your schoolmates, that your papa is Philip Remy,\r\nthe blacksmith, and that he will pull the ears of all who do you any\r\nharm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, when the school was full and lessons were about to begin,\r\nlittle Simon stood up, quite pale with trembling lips:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a clear voice, \xe2\x80\x9cis Philip Remy, the blacksmith,\r\nand he has promised to pull the ears of all who does me any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time no one laughed, for he was very well known, was Philip Remy,\r\nthe blacksmith, and was a papa of whom any one in the world would have\r\nbeen proud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 12.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHILD\r\n\r\nLemonnier had remained a widower with one child. He had loved his wife\r\ndevotedly, with a tender and exalted love, without a slip, during their\r\nentire married life. He was a good, honest man, perfectly simple,\r\nsincere, without suspicion or malice.\r\n\r\nHe fell in love with a poor neighbor, proposed and was accepted. He was\r\nmaking a very comfortable living out of the wholesale cloth business,\r\nand he did not for a minute suspect that the young girl might have\r\naccepted him for anything else but himself.\r\n\r\nShe made him happy. She was everything to him; he only thought of her,\r\nlooked at her continually, with worshiping eyes. During meals he would\r\nmake any number of blunders, in order not to have to take his eyes from\r\nthe beloved face; he would pour the wine in his plate and the water in\r\nthe salt-cellar, then he would laugh like a child, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I love you too much; that makes me crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would smile with a calm and resigned look; then she would look away,\r\nas though embarrassed by the adoration of her husband, and try to make\r\nhim talk about something else; but he would take her hand under the\r\ntable and he would hold it in his, whispering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little Jeanne, my darling little Jeanne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sometimes lost patience and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, be reasonable; eat and let me eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would sigh and break off a mouthful of bread, which he would then\r\nchew slowly.\r\n\r\nFor five years they had no children. Then suddenly she announced to him\r\nthat this state of affairs would soon cease. He was wild with joy. He no\r\nlonger left her for a minute, until his old nurse, who had brought him\r\nup and who often ruled the house, would push him out and close the door\r\nbehind him, in order to compel him to go out in the fresh air.\r\n\r\nHe had grown very intimate with a young man who had known his wife since\r\nchildhood, and who was one of the prefect's secretaries. M. Duretour\r\nwould dine three times a week with the Lemonniers, bringing flowers to\r\nmadame, and sometimes a box at the theater; and often, at the end of the\r\ndinner, Lemonnier, growing tender, turning towards his wife, would\r\nexplain: \xe2\x80\x9cWith a companion like you and a friend like him, a man is\r\ncompletely happy on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe died in childbirth. The shock almost killed him. But the sight of\r\nthe child, a poor, moaning little creature, gave him courage.\r\n\r\nHe loved it with a passionate and sorrowful love, with a morbid love in\r\nwhich stuck the memory of death, but in which lived something of his\r\nworship for the dead mother. It was the flesh of his wife, her being\r\ncontinued, a sort of quintessence of herself. This child was her very\r\nlife transferred to another body; she had disappeared that it might\r\nexist, and the father would smother it in with kisses. But also, this\r\nchild had killed her; he had stolen this beloved creature, his life was\r\nat the cost of hers. And M. Lemonnier would place his son in the cradle\r\nand would sit down and watch him. He would sit this way by the hour,\r\nlooking at him, dreaming of thousands of things, sweet or sad. Then,\r\nwhen the little one was asleep, he would bend over him and sob.\r\n\r\nThe child grew. The father could no longer spend an hour away from him;\r\nhe would stay near him, take him out for walks, and himself dress him,\r\nwash him, make him eat. His friend, M. Duretour, also seemed to love the\r\nboy; he would kiss him wildly, in those frenzies of tenderness which are\r\ncharacteristic of parents. He would toss him in his arms, he would trot\r\nhim on his knees, by the hour, and M. Lemonnier, delighted, would\r\nmutter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't he a darling? Isn't he a darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd M. Duretour would hug the child in his arms and tickle his neck with\r\nhis mustache.\r\n\r\nCeleste, the old nurse, alone, seemed to have no tenderness for the\r\nlittle one. She would grow angry at his pranks, and seemed impatient at\r\nthe caresses of the two men. She would exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you expect to bring a child up like that? You'll make a perfect\r\nmonkey out of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYears went by, and Jean was nine years old. He hardly knew how to read;\r\nhe had been so spoiled, and only did as he saw fit. He was willful,\r\nstubborn and quick-tempered. The father always gave in to him and let\r\nhim have his own way. M. Duretour would always buy him all the toys he\r\nwished, and he fed him on cake and candies. Then Celeste would grow\r\nangry and exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a shame, monsieur, a shame. You are spoiling this child. But it\r\nwill have to stop; yes, sir, I tell you it will have to stop, and before\r\nlong, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Lemonnier would answer, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you expect? I love him too much, I can't resist him; you must\r\nget used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJean was delicate, rather. The doctor said that he was anaemic,\r\nprescribed iron, rare meat and broth.\r\n\r\nBut the little fellow loved only cake and refused all other nourishment;\r\nand the father, in despair, stuffed him with cream-puffs and chocolate\r\neclairs.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as they were sitting down to supper, Celeste brought on the\r\nsoup with an air of authority and an assurance which she did not usually\r\nhave. She took off the cover and, dipping the ladle into the dish, she\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is some broth such as I have never made; the young one will have\r\nto take some this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Lemonnier, frightened, bent his head. He saw a storm brewing.\r\n\r\nCeleste took his plate, filled it herself and placed it in front of him.\r\n\r\nHe tasted the soup and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, indeed, excellent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant took the boy's plate and poured a spoonful of soup in it.\r\nThen she retreated a few steps and waited.\r\n\r\nJean smelled the food and pushed his plate away with an expression of\r\ndisgust. Celeste, suddenly pale, quickly stepped forward and forcibly\r\npoured a spoonful down the child's open mouth.\r\n\r\nHe choked, coughed, sneezed, spat; howling, he seized his glass and\r\nthrew it at his nurse. She received it full in the stomach. Then,\r\nexasperated, she took the young shaver's head under her arm and began\r\npouring spoonful after spoonful of soup down his throat. He grew as red\r\nas a beet, and he would cough it up, stamping, twisting, choking,\r\nbeating the air with his hands.\r\n\r\nAt first the father was so surprised that he could not move. Then,\r\nsuddenly, he rushed forward, wild with rage, seized the servant by the\r\nthroat and threw her up against the wall stammering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut! Out! Out! you brute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she shook him off, and, her hair streaming down her back, her eyes\r\nsnapping, she cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's gettin' hold of you? You're trying to thrash me because I am\r\nmaking this child eat soup when you are filling him with sweet stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kept repeating, trembling from head to foot:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut! Get out-get out, you brute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, wild, she turned to him and, pushing her face up against his, her\r\nvoice trembling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94you think-you think that you can treat me like that? Oh! no. And\r\nfor whom?\xe2\x80\x94for that brat who is not even yours. No, not yours! No, not\r\nyours\xe2\x80\x94not yours! Everybody knows it, except yourself! Ask the grocer,\r\nthe butcher, the baker, all of them, any one of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was growling and mumbling, choked with passion; then she stopped and\r\nlooked at him.\r\n\r\nHe was motionless livid, his arms hanging by his sides. After a short\r\npause, he murmured in a faint, shaky voice, instinct with deep feeling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say? you say? What do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained silent, frightened by his appearance. Once more he stepped\r\nforward, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say\xe2\x80\x94what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen in a calm voice, she answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say what I know, what everybody knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized her and, with the fury of a beast, he tried to throw her down.\r\nBut, although old, she was strong and nimble. She slipped under his arm,\r\nand running around the table once more furious, she screamed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at him, just look at him, fool that you are! Isn't he the living\r\nimage of M. Durefour? just look at his nose and his eyes! Are yours like\r\nthat? And his hair! Is it like his mother's? I tell you that everyone\r\nknows it, everyone except yourself! It's the joke of the town! Look at\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to the door, opened it, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nJean, frightened, sat motionless before his plate of soup.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour, she returned gently, to see how matters stood.\r\nThe child, after doing away with all the cakes and a pitcher full of\r\ncream and one of syrup, was now emptying the jam-pot with his soup-\r\nspoon.\r\n\r\nThe father had gone out.\r\n\r\nCeleste took the child, kissed him, and gently carried him to his room\r\nand put him to bed. She came back to the dining-room, cleared the table,\r\nput everything in place, feeling very uneasy all the time.\r\n\r\nNot a single sound could be heard throughout the house. She put her ear\r\nagainst her master's door. He seemed to be perfectly still. She put her\r\neye to the keyhole. He was writing, and seemed very calm.\r\n\r\nThen she returned to the kitchen and sat down, ready for any emergency.\r\nShe slept on a chair and awoke at daylight.\r\n\r\nShe did the rooms as she had been accustomed to every morning; she swept\r\nand dusted, and, towards eight o'clock, prepared M. Lemonnier's\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nBut she did not dare bring it to her master, knowing too well how she\r\nwould be received; she waited for him to ring. But he did not ring. Nine\r\no'clock, then ten o'clock went by.\r\n\r\nCeleste, not knowing what to think, prepared her tray and started up\r\nwith it, her heart beating fast.\r\n\r\nShe stopped before the door and listened. Everything was still. She\r\nknocked; no answer. Then, gathering up all her courage, she opened the\r\ndoor and entered. With a wild shriek, she dropped the breakfast tray\r\nwhich she had been holding in her hand.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room, M. Lemonnier was hanging by a rope from a\r\nring in the ceiling. His tongue was sticking out horribly. His right\r\nslipper was lying on the ground, his left one still on his foot. An\r\nupturned chair had rolled over to the bed.\r\n\r\nCeleste, dazed, ran away shrieking. All the neighbors crowded together.\r\nThe physician declared that he had died at about midnight.\r\n\r\nA letter addressed to M. Duretdur was found on the table of the suicide.\r\nIt contained these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave and entrust the child to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COUNTRY EXCURSION\r\n\r\nFor five months they had been talking of going to take luncheon in one\r\nof the country suburbs of Paris on Madame Dufour's birthday, and as they\r\nwere looking forward very impatiently to the outing, they rose very\r\nearly that morning. Monsieur Dufour had borrowed the milkman's wagon and\r\ndrove himself. It was a very tidy, two-wheeled conveyance, with a cover\r\nsupported by four iron rods, with curtains that had been drawn up,\r\nexcept the one at the back, which floated out like a sail. Madame\r\nDufour, resplendent in a wonderful, cherry colored silk dress, sat by\r\nthe side of her husband.\r\n\r\nThe old grandmother and a girl sat behind them on two chairs, and a boy\r\nwith yellow hair was lying at the bottom of the wagon, with nothing to\r\nbe seen of him except his head.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the bridge of Neuilly, Monsieur Dufour said: \xe2\x80\x9cHere we\r\nare in the country at last!\xe2\x80\x9d and at that signal his wife grew\r\nsentimental about the beauties of nature. When they got to the\r\ncrossroads at Courbevoie they were seized with admiration for the\r\ndistant landscape. On the right was Argenteuil with its bell tower, and\r\nabove it rose the hills of Sannois and the mill of Orgemont, while on\r\nthe left the aqueduct of Marly stood out against the clear morning sky,\r\nand in the distance they could see the terrace of Saint-Germain; and\r\nopposite them, at the end of a low chain of hills, the new fort of\r\nCormeilles. Quite in the distance; a very long way off, beyond the\r\nplains and village, one could see the sombre green of the forests.\r\n\r\nThe sun was beginning to burn their faces, the dust got into their eyes,\r\nand on either side of the road there stretched an interminable tract of\r\nbare, ugly country with an unpleasant odor. One might have thought that\r\nit had been ravaged by a pestilence, which had even attacked the\r\nbuildings, for skeletons of dilapidated and deserted houses, or small\r\ncottages, which were left in an unfinished state, because the\r\ncontractors had not been paid, reared their four roofless walls on each\r\nside.\r\n\r\nHere and there tall factory chimneys rose up from the barren soil. The\r\nonly vegetation on that putrid land, where the spring breezes wafted an\r\nodor of petroleum and slate, blended with another odor that was even\r\nless agreeable. At last, however, they crossed the Seine a second time,\r\nand the bridge was a delight. The river sparkled in the sun, and they\r\nhad a feeling of quiet enjoyment, felt refreshed as they drank in the\r\npurer air that was not impregnated by the black smoke of factories nor\r\nby the miasma from the deposits of night soil. A man whom they met told\r\nthem that the name of the place was Bezons. Monsieur Dufour pulled up\r\nand read the attractive announcement outside an eating house: Restaurant\r\nPoulin, matelottes and fried fish, private rooms, arbors, and swings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Madame Dufour, will this suit you? Will you make up your mind at\r\nlast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe read the announcement in her turn and then looked at the house for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nIt was a white country inn, built by the roadside, and through the open\r\ndoor she could see the bright zinc of the counter, at which sat two\r\nworkmen in their Sunday clothes. At last she made up her mind and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this will do; and, besides, there is a view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey drove into a large field behind the inn, separated from the river\r\nby the towing path, and dismounted. The husband sprang out first and\r\nthen held out his arms for his wife, and as the step was very high\r\nMadame Dufour, in order to reach him, had to show the lower part of her\r\nlimbs, whose former slenderness had disappeared in fat, and Monsieur\r\nDufour, who was already getting excited by the country air, pinched her\r\ncalf, and then, taking her in his arms, he set her on the ground, as if\r\nshe had been some enormous bundle. She shook the dust out of the silk\r\ndress and then looked round to see in what sort of a place she was.\r\n\r\nShe was a stout woman, of about thirty-six, full-blown, and delightful\r\nto look at. She could hardly breathe, as her corsets were laced too\r\ntightly, and their pressure forced her superabundant bosom up to her\r\ndouble chin. Next the girl placed her hand on her father's shoulder and\r\njumped down lightly. The boy with the yellow hair had got down by\r\nstepping on the wheel, and he helped Monsieur Dufour to lift his\r\ngrandmother out. Then they unharnessed the horse, which they had tied to\r\na tree, and the carriage fell back, with both shafts in the air. The men\r\ntook off their coats and washed their hands in a pail of water and then\r\nwent and joined the ladies, who had already taken possession of the\r\nswings.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Dufour was trying to swing herself standing up, but she\r\ncould not succeed in getting a start. She was a pretty girl of about\r\neighteen, one of those women who suddenly excite your desire when you\r\nmeet them in the street and who leave you with a vague feeling of\r\nuneasiness and of excited senses. She was tall, had a small waist and\r\nlarge hips, with a dark skin, very large eyes and very black hair. Her\r\ndress clearly marked the outlines of her firm, full figure, which was\r\naccentuated by the motion of her hips as she tried to swing herself\r\nhigher. Her arms were stretched upward to hold the rope, so that her\r\nbosom rose at every movement she made. Her hat, which a gust of wind had\r\nblown off, was hanging behind her, and as the swing gradually rose\r\nhigher and higher, she showed her delicate limbs up to the knees each\r\ntime, and the breeze from her flying skirts, which was more heady than\r\nthe fumes of wine, blew into the faces of the two men, who were looking\r\nat her and smiling.\r\n\r\nSitting in the other swing, Madame Dufour kept saying in a monotonous\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCyprian, come and swing me; do come and swing me, Cyprian!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last he went, and turning up his shirt sleeves, as if undertaking a\r\nhard piece of work, with much difficulty he set his wife in motion. She\r\nclutched the two ropes and held her legs out straight, so as not to\r\ntouch the ground. She enjoyed feeling dizzy at the motion of the swing,\r\nand her whole figure shook like a jelly on a dish, but as she went\r\nhigher and higher; she became too giddy and was frightened. Each time\r\nthe swing came down she uttered a piercing scream, which made all the\r\nlittle urchins in the neighborhood come round, and down below, beneath\r\nthe garden hedge, she vaguely saw a row of mischievous heads making\r\nvarious grimaces as they laughed.\r\n\r\nWhen a servant girl came out they ordered luncheon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome fried fish, a rabbit saute, salad and dessert,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Dufour\r\nsaid, with an important air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring two quarts of beer and a bottle of claret,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will have lunch on the grass,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl added.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother, who had an affection for cats, had been running after\r\none that belonged to the house, trying to coax it to come to her for the\r\nlast ten minutes. The animal, who was no doubt secretly flattered by her\r\nattentions, kept close to the good woman, but just out of reach of her\r\nhand, and quietly walked round the trees, against which she rubbed\r\nherself, with her tail up, purring with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly exclaimed the young man with the yellow hair, who was\r\nwandering about. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are two swell boats!\xe2\x80\x9d They all went to look at\r\nthem and saw two beautiful canoes in a wooden shed; they were as\r\nbeautifully finished as if they had been ornamental furniture. They hung\r\nside by side, like two tall, slender girls, in their narrow shining\r\nlength, and made one wish to float in them on warm summer mornings and\r\nevenings along the flower-covered banks of the river, where the trees\r\ndip their branches into the water, where the rushes are continually\r\nrustling in the breeze and where the swift kingfishers dart about like\r\nflashes of blue lightning.\r\n\r\nThe whole family looked at them with great respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they are indeed swell boats!\xe2\x80\x9d Monsieur Dufour repeated gravely, as\r\nhe examined them like a connoiseur. He had been in the habit of rowing\r\nin his younger days, he said, and when he had spat in his hands\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\nwent through the action of pulling the oars\xe2\x80\x94he did not care a fig for\r\nanybody. He had beaten more than one Englishman formerly at the\r\nJoinville regattas. He grew quite excited at last and offered to make a\r\nbet that in a boat like that he could row six leagues an hour without\r\nexerting himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuncheon is ready,\xe2\x80\x9d the waitress said, appearing at the entrance to the\r\nboathouse, and they all hurried off. But two young men had taken the\r\nvery seats that Madame Dufour had selected and were eating their\r\nluncheon. No doubt they were the owners of the sculls, for they were in\r\nboating costume. They were stretched out, almost lying on the chairs;\r\nthey were sun-browned and their thin cotton jerseys, with short sleeves,\r\nshowed their bare arms, which were as strong as a blacksmith's. They\r\nwere two strong, athletic fellows, who showed in all their movements\r\nthat elasticity and grace of limb which can only be acquired by exercise\r\nand which is so different to the deformity with which monotonous heavy\r\nwork stamps the mechanic.\r\n\r\nThey exchanged a rapid smile when they saw the mother and then a glance\r\non seeing the daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us give up our place,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them said; \xe2\x80\x9cit will make us\r\nacquainted with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other got up immediately, and holding his black and red boating cap\r\nin his hand, he politely offered the ladies the only shady place in the\r\ngarden. With many excuses they accepted, and that it might be more\r\nrural, they sat on the grass, without either tables or chairs.\r\n\r\nThe two young men took their plates, knives, forks, etc., to a table a\r\nlittle way off and began to eat again, and their bare arms, which they\r\nshowed continually, rather embarrassed the girl. She even pretended to\r\nturn her head aside and not to see them, while Madame Dufour, who was\r\nrather bolder, tempted by feminine curiosity, looked at them every\r\nmoment, and, no doubt, compared them with the secret unsightliness of\r\nher husband. She had squatted herself on ground, with her legs tucked\r\nunder her, after the manner of tailors, and she kept moving about\r\nrestlessly, saying that ants were crawling about her somewhere. Monsieur\r\nDufour, annoyed at the presence of the polite strangers, was trying to\r\nfind a comfortable position which he did not, however, succeed in doing,\r\nand the young man with the yellow hair was eating as silently as an\r\nogre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is lovely weather, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d the stout lady said to one of the\r\nboating men. She wished to be friendly because they had given up their\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, indeed, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you often go into the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, only once or twice a year to get a little fresh air. And you,\r\nmonsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come and sleep here every night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that must be very nice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it is, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d And he gave them such a practical account of\r\nhis daily life that it awakened afresh in the hearts of these\r\nshopkeepers who were deprived of the meadows and who longed for country\r\nwalks, to that foolish love of nature which they all feel so strongly\r\nthe whole year round behind the counter in their shop.\r\n\r\nThe girl raised her eyes and looked at the oarsman with emotion and\r\nMonsieur Dufour spoke for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed a happy life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And then he added: \xe2\x80\x9cA little more\r\nrabbit, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, and turning to the young men again, and\r\npointing to their arms, asked: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you never feel cold like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both began to laugh, and they astonished the family with an account\r\nof the enormous fatigue they could endure, of their bathing while in a\r\nstate of tremendous perspiration, of their rowing in the fog at night;\r\nand they struck their chests violently to show how hollow they sounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You look very strong,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband, who did not talk any more\r\nof the time when he used to beat the English. The girl was looking at\r\nthem sideways now, and the young fellow with the yellow hair, who had\r\nswallowed some wine the wrong way, was coughing violently and\r\nbespattering Madame Dufour's cherry-colored silk dress. She got angry\r\nand sent for some water to wash the spots.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it had grown unbearably hot, the sparkling river looked like a\r\nblaze of fire and the fumes of the wine were getting into their heads.\r\nMonsieur Dufour, who had a violent hiccough, had unbuttoned his\r\nwaistcoat and the top button of his trousers, while his wife, who felt\r\nchoking, was gradually unfastening her dress. The apprentice was shaking\r\nhis yellow wig in a happy frame of mind, and kept helping himself to\r\nwine, and the old grandmother, feeling the effects of the wine, was very\r\nstiff and dignified. As for the girl, one noticed only a peculiar\r\nbrightness in her eyes, while the brown cheeks became more rosy.\r\n\r\nThe coffee finished, they suggested singing, and each of them sang or\r\nrepeated a couplet, which the others applauded frantically. Then they\r\ngot up with some difficulty, and while the two women, who were rather\r\ndizzy, were trying to get a breath of air, the two men, who were\r\naltogether drunk, were attempting gymnastics. Heavy, limp and with\r\nscarlet faces they hung or, awkwardly to the iron rings, without being\r\nable to raise themselves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two boating men had got their boats into the water, and\r\nthey came back and politely asked the ladies whether they would like a\r\nrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like one, Monsieur Dufour?\xe2\x80\x9d his wife exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease\r\ncome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe merely gave her a drunken nod, without understanding what she said.\r\nThen one of the rowers came up with two fishing rods in his hands, and\r\nthe hope of catching a gudgeon, that great vision of the Parisian\r\nshopkeeper, made Dufour's dull eyes gleam, and he politely allowed them\r\nto do whatever they liked, while he sat in the shade under the bridge,\r\nwith his feet dangling over the river, by the side of the young man with\r\nthe yellow hair, who was sleeping soundly.\r\n\r\nOne of the boating men made a martyr of himself and took the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to the little wood on the Ile aux Anglais!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out as\r\nhe rowed off. The other boat went more slowly, for the rower was looking\r\nat his companion so intently that he thought of nothing else, and his\r\nemotion seemed to paralyze his strength, while the girl, who was sitting\r\nin the bow, gave herself up to the enjoyment of being on the water. She\r\nfelt a disinclination to think, a lassitude in her limbs and a total\r\nenervation, as if she were intoxicated, and her face was flushed and her\r\nbreathing quickened. The effects of the wine, which were increased by\r\nthe extreme heat, made all the trees on the bank seem to bow as she\r\npassed. A vague wish for enjoyment and a fermentation of her blood\r\nseemed to pervade her whole body, which was excited by the heat of the\r\nday, and she was also disturbed at this tete-a-tete on the water, in a\r\nplace which seemed depopulated by the heat, with this young man who\r\nthought her pretty, whose ardent looks seemed to caress her skin and\r\nwere as penetrating and pervading as the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nTheir inability to speak increased their emotion, and they looked about\r\nthem. At last, however, he made an effort and asked her name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenriette,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my name is Henri,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. The sound of their voices had\r\ncalmed them, and they looked at the banks. The other boat had passed\r\nthem and seemed to be waiting for them, and the rower called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will meet you in the wood; we are going as far as Robinson's,\r\nbecause Madame Dufour is thirsty.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he bent over his oars again and\r\nrowed off so quickly that he was soon out of sight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a continual roar, which they had heard for some time, came\r\nnearer, and the river itself seemed to shiver, as if the dull noise were\r\nrising from its depths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that noise?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. It was the noise of the weir which cut\r\nthe river in two at the island, and he was explaining it to her, when,\r\nabove the noise of the waterfall, they heard the song of a bird, which\r\nseemed a long way off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe nightingales are singing during the day, so the\r\nfemale birds must be sitting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA nightingale! She had never heard one before, and the idea of listening\r\nto one roused visions of poetic tenderness in her heart. A nightingale!\r\nThat is to say, the invisible witness of her love trysts which Juliet\r\ninvoked on her balcony; that celestial music which it attuned to human\r\nkisses, that eternal inspirer of all those languorous romances which\r\nopen an ideal sky to all the poor little tender hearts of sensitive\r\ngirls!\r\n\r\nShe was going to hear a nightingale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must not make a noise,\xe2\x80\x9d her companion said, \xe2\x80\x9cand then we can go into\r\nthe wood, and sit down close beside it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat seemed to glide. They saw the trees on the island, the banks of\r\nwhich were so low that they could look into the depths of the thickets.\r\nThey stopped, he made the boat fast, Henriette took hold of Henri's arm,\r\nand they went beneath the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStoop,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, so she stooped down, and they went into an\r\ninextricable thicket of creepers, leaves and reed grass, which formed an\r\nundiscoverable retreat, and which the young man laughingly called \xe2\x80\x9chis\r\nprivate room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust above their heads, perched in one of the trees which hid them, the\r\nbird was still singing. He uttered trills and roulades, and then loud,\r\nvibrating notes that filled the air and seemed to lose themselves on the\r\nhorizon, across the level country, through that burning silence which\r\nweighed upon the whole landscape. They did not speak for fear of\r\nfrightening it away. They were sitting close together, and, slowly,\r\nHenri's arm stole round the girl's waist and squeezed it gently. She\r\ntook that daring hand without any anger, and kept removing it whenever\r\nhe put it round her; without, however, feeling at all embarrassed by\r\nthis caress, just as if it had been something quite natural, which she\r\nwas resisting just as naturally.\r\n\r\nShe was listening to the bird in ecstasy. She felt an infinite longing\r\nfor happiness, for some sudden demonstration of tenderness, for the\r\nrevelation of superhuman poetry, and she felt such a softening at her\r\nheart, and relaxation of her nerves, that she began to cry, without\r\nknowing why. The young man was now straining her close to him, yet she\r\ndid not remove his arm; she did not think of it. Suddenly the\r\nnightingale stopped, and a voice called out in the distance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenriette!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not reply,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low voice; \xe2\x80\x9cyou will drive the bird away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had no idea of doing so, and they remained in the same position\r\nfor some time. Madame Dufour had sat down somewhere or other, for from\r\ntime to time they heard the stout lady break out into little bursts of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nThe girl was still crying; she was filled with strange sensations.\r\nHenri's head was on her shoulder, and suddenly he kissed her on the\r\nlips. She was surprised and angry, and, to avoid him, she stood up.\r\n\r\nThey were both very pale when they left their grassy retreat. The blue\r\nsky appeared to them clouded and the ardent sun darkened; and they felt\r\nthe solitude and the silence. They walked rapidly, side by side, without\r\nspeaking or touching each other, for they seemed to have become\r\nirreconcilable enemies, as if disgust and hatred had arisen between\r\nthem, and from time to time Henriette called out: \xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy and by they heard a noise behind a bush, and the stout lady appeared,\r\nlooking rather confused, and her companion's face was wrinkled with\r\nsmiles which he could not check.\r\n\r\nMadame Dufour took his arm, and they returned to the boats, and Henri,\r\nwho was ahead, walked in silence beside the young girl. At last they got\r\nback to Bezons. Monsieur Dufour, who was now sober, was waiting for them\r\nvery impatiently, while the young man with the yellow hair was having a\r\nmouthful of something to eat before leaving the inn. The carriage was\r\nwaiting in the yard, and the grandmother, who had already got in, was\r\nvery frightened at the thought of being overtaken by night before they\r\nreached Paris, as the outskirts were not safe.\r\n\r\nThey all shook bands, and the Dufour family drove off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, until we meet again!\xe2\x80\x9d the oarsmen cried, and the answer they\r\ngot was a sigh and a tear.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, as Henri was going along the Rue des Martyrs, he saw\r\nDufour, Ironmonger, over a door, and so he went in, and saw the stout\r\nlady sitting at the counter. They recognized each other immediately, and\r\nafter an interchange of polite greetings, he asked after them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is Mademoiselle Henriette?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired specially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, thank you; she is married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d He felt a certain emotion, but said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhom did she marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat young man who accompanied us, you know; he has joined us in\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember him perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was going out, feeling very unhappy, though scarcely knowing why,\r\nwhen madame called him back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked rather shyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very well, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease give him our compliments, and beg him to come and call, when he\r\nis in the neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then added: \xe2\x80\x9cTell him it will give me great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be sure to do so. Adieu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not say that; come again very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next year, one very hot Sunday, all the details of that adventure,\r\nwhich Henri had never forgotten, suddenly came back to him so clearly\r\nthat he returned alone to their room in the wood, and was overwhelmed\r\nwith astonishment when he went in. She was sitting on the grass, looking\r\nvery sad, while by her side, still in his shirt sleeves, the young man\r\nwith the yellow hair was sleeping soundly, like some animal.\r\n\r\nShe grew so pale when she saw Henri that at first he thought she was\r\ngoing to faint; then, however, they began to talk quite naturally. But\r\nwhen he told her that he was very fond of that spot, and went there\r\nfrequently on Sundays to indulge in memories, she looked into his eyes\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI too, think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband said, with a yawn. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it is time for\r\nus to be going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE\r\n\r\nThe two young women appear to be buried under a blanket of flowers. They\r\nare alone in the immense landau, which is filled with flowers like a\r\ngiant basket. On the front seat are two small hampers of white satin\r\nfilled with violets, and on the bearskin by which their knees are\r\ncovered there is a mass of roses, mimosas, pinks, daisies, tuberoses and\r\norange blossoms, interwoven with silk ribbons; the two frail bodies seem\r\nburied under this beautiful perfumed bed, which hides everything but the\r\nshoulders and arms and a little of the dainty waists.\r\n\r\nThe coachman's whip is wound with a garland of anemones, the horses'\r\ntraces are dotted with carnations, the spokes of the wheels are clothed\r\nin mignonette, and where the lanterns ought to be are two enormous round\r\nbouquets which look as though they were the eyes of this strange,\r\nrolling, flower-bedecked creature.\r\n\r\nThe landau drives rapidly along the road, through the Rue d'Antibes,\r\npreceded, followed, accompanied, by a crowd of other carriages covered\r\nwith flowers, full of women almost hidden by a sea of violets. It is the\r\nflower carnival at Cannes.\r\n\r\nThe carriage reaches the Boulevard de la Fonciere, where the battle is\r\nwaged. All along the immense avenue a double row of flower-bedecked\r\nvehicles are going and coming like an endless ribbon. Flowers are thrown\r\nfrom one to the other. They pass through the air like balls, striking\r\nfresh faces, bouncing and falling into the dust, where an army of\r\nyoungsters pick them up.\r\n\r\nA thick crowd is standing on the sidewalks looking on and held in check\r\nby the mounted police, who pass brutally along pushing back the curious\r\npedestrians as though to prevent the common people from mingling with\r\nthe rich.\r\n\r\nIn the carriages, people call to each other, recognize each other and\r\nbombard each other with roses. A chariot full of pretty women, dressed\r\nin red, like devils, attracts the eyes of all. A gentleman, who looks\r\nlike the portraits of Henry IV., is throwing an immense bouquet which is\r\nheld back by an elastic. Fearing the shock, the women hide their eyes\r\nand the men lower their heads, but the graceful, rapid and obedient\r\nmissile describes a curve and returns to its master, who immediately\r\nthrows it at some new face.\r\n\r\nThe two young women begin to throw their stock of flowers by handfuls,\r\nand receive a perfect hail of bouquets; then, after an hour of warfare,\r\na little tired, they tell the coachman to drive along the road which\r\nfollows the seashore.\r\n\r\nThe sun disappears behind Esterel, outlining the dark, rugged mountain\r\nagainst the sunset sky. The clear blue sea, as calm as a mill-pond,\r\nstretches out as far as the horizon, where it blends with the sky; and\r\nthe fleet, anchored in the middle of the bay, looks like a herd of\r\nenormous beasts, motionless on the water, apocalyptic animals, armored\r\nand hump-backed, their frail masts looking like feathers, and with eyes\r\nwhich light up when evening approaches.\r\n\r\nThe two young women, leaning back under the heavy robes, look out lazily\r\nover the blue expanse of water. At last one of them says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delightful the evenings are! How good everything seems! Don't you\r\nthink so, Margot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is good. But there is always something lacking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is lacking? I feel perfectly happy. I don't need anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you do. You are not thinking of it. No matter how contented we may\r\nbe, physically, we always long for something more\xe2\x80\x94for the heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other asked with a smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stopped talking, their eyes fastened on the distant horizon, then\r\nthe one called Marguerite murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cLife without that seems to me\r\nunbearable. I need to be loved, if only by a dog. But we are all alike,\r\nno matter what you may say, Simone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my dear. I had rather not be loved at all than to be loved\r\nby the first comer. Do you think, for instance, that it would be\r\npleasant to be loved by\xe2\x80\x94by\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was thinking by whom she might possibly be loved, glancing across\r\nthe wide landscape. Her eyes, after traveling around the horizon, fell\r\non the two bright buttons which were shining on the back of the\r\ncoachman's livery, and she continued, laughing: \xe2\x80\x9cby my coachman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Margot barely smiled, and said in a low tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you that it is very amusing to be loved by a servant. It has\r\nhappened to me two or three times. They roll their eyes in such a funny\r\nmanner\xe2\x80\x94it's enough to make you die laughing! Naturally, the more in love\r\nthey are, the more severe one must be with them, and then, some day, for\r\nsome reason, you dismiss them, because, if anyone should notice it, you\r\nwould appear so ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Simone was listening, staring straight ahead of her, then she\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I'm afraid that my footman's heart would not satisfy me. Tell me\r\nhow you noticed that they loved you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed it the same way that I do with other men\xe2\x80\x94when they get\r\nstupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe others don't seem stupid to me, when they love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are idiots, my dear, unable to talk, to answer, to understand\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you feel when you were loved by a servant? Were\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94moved\xe2\x80\x94flattered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoved? no, flattered\xe2\x80\x94yes a little. One is always flattered to be loved\r\nby a man, no matter who he may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Margot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, my dear! For instance, I will tell you of a peculiar\r\nincident which happened to me. You will see how curious and complex our\r\nemotions are, in such cases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout four years ago I happened to be without a maid. I had tried five\r\nor six, one right after the other, and I was about ready to give up in\r\ndespair, when I saw an advertisement in a newspaper of a young girl\r\nknowing how to cook, embroider, dress hair, who was looking for a\r\nposition and who could furnish the best of references. Besides all these\r\naccomplishments, she could speak English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to the given address, and the next day the person in question\r\npresented herself. She was tall, slender, pale, shy-looking. She had\r\nbeautiful black eyes and a charming complexion; she pleased me\r\nimmediately. I asked for her certificates; she gave me one in English,\r\nfor she came, as she said, from Lady Rymwell's, where she had been for\r\nten years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe certificate showed that the young girl had left of her own free\r\nwill, in order to return to France, and the only thing which they had\r\nhad to find fault in her during her long period of service was a little\r\nFrench coquettishness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis prudish English phrase even made me smile, and I immediately\r\nengaged this maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came to me the same day. Her name was Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of a month I would have been helpless without her. She was a\r\ntreasure, a pearl, a phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe could dress my hair with infinite taste; she could trim a hat\r\nbetter than most milliners, and she could even make my dresses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was astonished at her accomplishments. I had never before been waited\r\non in such a manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe dressed me rapidly and with a surprisingly light touch. I never\r\nfelt her fingers on my skin, and nothing is so disagreeable to me as\r\ncontact with a servant's hand. I soon became excessively lazy; it was so\r\npleasant to be dressed from head to foot, and from lingerie to gloves,\r\nby this tall, timid girl, always blushing a little, and never saying a\r\nword. After my bath she would rub and massage me while I dozed a little\r\non my couch; I almost considered her more of a friend than a servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne morning the janitor asked, mysteriously, to speak to me. I was\r\nsurprised, and told him to come in. He was a good, faithful man, an old\r\nsoldier, one of my husband's former orderlies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed to be embarrassed by what he had to say to me. At last he\r\nmanaged to mumble:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Madame, the superintendent of police is downstairs.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked quickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What does he wish?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He wishes to search the house.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course the police are useful, but I hate them. I do not think that\r\nit is a noble profession. I answered, angered and hurt:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Why this search? For what reason? He shall not come in.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe janitor continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He says that there is a criminal hidden in the house.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time I was frightened and I told him to bring the inspector to me,\r\nso that I might get some explanation. He was a man with good manners and\r\ndecorated with the Legion of Honor. He begged my pardon for disturbing\r\nme, and then informed me that I had, among my domestics, a convict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was shocked; and I answered that I could guarantee every servant in\r\nthe house, and I began to enumerate them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The janitor, Pierre Courtin, an old soldier.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's not he.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A stable-boy, son of farmers whom I know, and a groom whom you have\r\njust seen.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'It's not he.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Then, monsieur, you see that you must be mistaken.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Excuse me, madame, but I am positive that I am not making a mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the conviction of a notable criminal is at stake, would you be so\r\nkind as to send for all your servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first I refused, but I finally gave in, and sent downstairs for\r\neverybody, men and women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe inspector glanced at them and then declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This isn't all.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Excuse me, monsieur, there is no one left but my maid, a young girl\r\nwhom you could not possibly mistake for a convict.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'May I also see her?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Certainly.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rang for Rose, who immediately appeared. She had hardly entered the\r\nroom, when the inspector made a motion, and two men whom I had not seen,\r\nhidden behind the door, sprang forward, seized her and tied her hands\r\nbehind her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cried out in anger and tried to rush forward to defend her. The\r\ninspector stopped me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This girl, madame, is a man whose name is Jean Nicolas Lecapet,\r\ncondemned to death in 1879 for assaulting a woman and injuring her so\r\nthat death resulted. His sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life.\r\nHe escaped four months ago. We have been looking for him ever since.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was terrified, bewildered. I did not believe him. The commissioner\r\ncontinued, laughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I can prove it to you. His right arm is tattooed.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The sleeve was rolled up. It was true. The inspector added, with bad\r\ntaste:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You can trust us for the other proofs.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they led my maid away!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, would you believe me, the thing that moved me most was not anger\r\nat having thus been played upon, deceived and made ridiculous, it was\r\nnot the shame of having thus been dressed and undressed, handled and\r\ntouched by this man\xe2\x80\x94but a deep humiliation\xe2\x80\x94a woman's humiliation. Do you\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I don't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think\xe2\x80\x94this man had been condemned for\xe2\x80\x94for assaulting a woman.\r\nWell! I thought of the one whom he had assaulted\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and I felt\r\nhumiliated\xe2\x80\x94There! Do you understand now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Margot did not answer. She was looking straight ahead, her eyes\r\nfastened on the two shining buttons of the livery, with that sphinx-like\r\nsmile which women sometimes have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSALIE PRUDENT\r\n\r\nThere was a real mystery in this affair which neither the jury, nor the\r\npresident, nor the public prosecutor himself could understand.\r\n\r\nThe girl Prudent (Rosalie), servant at the Varambots', of Nantes, having\r\nbecome enceinte without the knowledge of her masters, had, during the\r\nnight, killed and buried her child in the garden.\r\n\r\nIt was the usual story of the infanticides committed by servant girls.\r\nBut there was one inexplicable circumstance about this one. When the\r\npolice searched the girl Prudent's room they discovered a complete\r\ninfant's outfit, made by Rosalie herself, who had spent her nights for\r\nthe last three months in cutting and sewing it. The grocer from whom she\r\nhad bought her candles, out of her own wages, for this long piece of\r\nwork had come to testify. It came out, moreover, that the sage-femme of\r\nthe district, informed by Rosalie of her condition, had given her all\r\nnecessary instructions and counsel in case the event should happen at a\r\ntime when it might not be possible to get help. She had also procured a\r\nplace at Poissy for the girl Prudent, who foresaw that her present\r\nemployers would discharge her, for the Varambot couple did not trifle\r\nwith morality.\r\n\r\nThere were present at the trial both the man and the woman, a middle-\r\nclass pair from the provinces, living on their income. They were so\r\nexasperated against this girl, who had sullied their house, that they\r\nwould have liked to see her guillotined on the spot without a trial. The\r\nspiteful depositions they made against her became accusations in their\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\nThe defendant, a large, handsome girl of Lower Normandy, well educated\r\nfor her station in life, wept continuously and would not answer to\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThe court and the spectators were forced to the opinion that she had\r\ncommitted this barbarous act in a moment of despair and madness, since\r\nthere was every indication that she had expected to keep and bring up\r\nher child.\r\n\r\nThe president tried for the last time to make her speak, to get some\r\nconfession, and, having urged her with much gentleness, he finally made\r\nher understand that all these men gathered here to pass judgment upon\r\nher were not anxious for her death and might even have pity on her.\r\n\r\nThen she made up her mind to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, tell us, first, who is the father of this child?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nUntil then she had obstinately refused to give his name.\r\n\r\nBut she replied suddenly, looking at her masters who had so cruelly\r\ncalumniated her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Monsieur Joseph, Monsieur Varambot's nephew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe couple started in their seats and cried with one voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat's not\r\ntrue! She lies! This is infamous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president had them silenced and continued, \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, please, and tell\r\nus how it all happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she suddenly began to talk freely, relieving her pent-up heart,\r\nthat poor, solitary, crushed heart\xe2\x80\x94laying bare her sorrow, her whole\r\nsorrow, before those severe men whom she had until now taken for enemies\r\nand inflexible judges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was Monsieur Joseph Varambot, when he came on leave last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does Mr. Joseph Varambot do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a non-commissioned officer in the artillery, monsieur. Well, he\r\nstayed two months at the house, two months of the summer. I thought\r\nnothing about it when he began to look at me, and then flatter me, and\r\nmake love to me all day long. And I let myself be taken in, monsieur. He\r\nkept saying to me that I was a handsome girl, that I was good company,\r\nthat I just suited him\xe2\x80\x94and I, I liked him well enough. What could I do?\r\nOne listens to these things when one is alone\xe2\x80\x94all alone\xe2\x80\x94as I was. I am\r\nalone in the world, monsieur. I have no one to talk to\xe2\x80\x94no one to tell my\r\ntroubles to. I have no father, no mother, no brother, no sister, nobody.\r\nAnd when he began to talk to me it was as if I had a brother who had\r\ncome back. And then he asked me to go with him to the river one evening,\r\nso that we might talk without disturbing any one. I went\xe2\x80\x94I don't know\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon't know how it happened. He had his arm around me. Really I didn't\r\nwant to\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94I could not\xe2\x80\x94I felt like crying, the air was so soft \xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmoon was shining. No, I swear to you\xe2\x80\x94I could not\xe2\x80\x94he did what he wanted.\r\nThat went on three weeks, as long as he stayed. I could have followed\r\nhim to the ends of the world. He went away. I did not know that I was\r\nenceinte. I did not know it until the month after\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to cry so bitterly that they had to give her time to collect\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThen the president resumed with the tone of a priest at the\r\nconfessional: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to talk again: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I realized my condition I went to see\r\nMadame Boudin, who is there to tell you, and I asked her how it would\r\nbe, in case it should come if she were not there. Then I made the\r\noutfit, sewing night after night, every evening until one o'clock in the\r\nmorning; and then I looked for another place, for I knew very well that\r\nI should be sent away, but I wanted to stay in the house until the very\r\nlast, so as to save my pennies, for I have not got very much and I\r\nshould need my money for the little one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you did not intend to kill him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly not, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you kill him, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happened this way. It came sooner than I expected. It came upon me\r\nin the kitchen, while I was doing the dishes. Monsieur and Madame\r\nVarambot were already asleep, so I went up, not without difficulty,\r\ndragging myself up by the banister, and I lay down on the bare floor. It\r\nlasted perhaps one hour, or two, or three; I don't know, I had such\r\npain; and then I pushed him out with all my strength. I felt that he\r\ncame out and I picked him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but I was glad, I assure you! I did all that Madame Boudin told me\r\nto do. And then I laid him on my bed. And then such a pain griped me\r\nagain that I thought I should die. If you knew what it meant, you there,\r\nyou would not do so much of this. I fell on my knees, and then toppled\r\nover backward on the floor; and it griped me again, perhaps one hour,\r\nperhaps two. I lay there all alone\xe2\x80\x94and then another one comes\xe2\x80\x94another\r\nlittle one\xe2\x80\x94two, yes, two, like this. I took him up as I did the first\r\none, and then I put him on the bed, the two side by side. Is it\r\npossible, tell me, two children, and I who get only twenty francs a\r\nmonth? Say, is it possible? One, yes, that can be managed by going\r\nwithout things, but not two. That turned my head. What do I know about\r\nit? Had I any choice, tell me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could I do? I felt as if my last hour had come. I put the pillow\r\nover them, without knowing why. I could not keep them both; and then I\r\nthrew myself down, and I lay there, rolling over and over and crying\r\nuntil I saw the daylight come into the window. Both of them were quite\r\ndead under the pillow. Then I took them under my arms and went down the\r\nstairs out in the vegetable garden. I took the gardener's spade and I\r\nburied them under the earth, digging as deep a hole as I could, one here\r\nand the other one there, not together, so that they might not talk of\r\ntheir mother if these little dead bodies can talk. What do I know about\r\nit?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, back in my bed, I felt so sick that I could not get up. They\r\nsent for the doctor and he understood it all. I'm telling you the truth,\r\nYour Honor. Do what you like with me; I'm ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf of the jury were blowing their noses violently to keep from crying.\r\nThe women in the courtroom were sobbing.\r\n\r\nThe president asked her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you bury the other one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one that you have?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this one\xe2\x80\x94this one was in the artichokes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then the other one is among the strawberries, by the well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she began to sob so piteously that no one could hear her unmoved.\r\n\r\nThe girl Rosalie Prudent was acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGRET\r\n\r\nMonsieur Saval, who was called in Mantes \xe2\x80\x9cFather Saval,\xe2\x80\x9d had just risen\r\nfrom bed. He was weeping. It was a dull autumn day; the leaves were\r\nfalling. They fell slowly in the rain, like a heavier and slower rain.\r\nM. Saval was not in good spirits. He walked from the fireplace to the\r\nwindow, and from the window to the fireplace. Life has its sombre days.\r\nIt would no longer have any but sombre days for him, for he had reached\r\nthe age of sixty-two. He is alone, an old bachelor, with nobody about\r\nhim. How sad it is to die alone, all alone, without any one who is\r\ndevoted to you!\r\n\r\nHe pondered over his life, so barren, so empty. He recalled former days,\r\nthe days of his childhood, the home, the house of his parents; his\r\ncollege days, his follies; the time he studied law in Paris, his\r\nfather's illness, his death. He then returned to live with his mother.\r\nThey lived together very quietly, and desired nothing more. At last the\r\nmother died. How sad life is! He lived alone since then, and now, in his\r\nturn, he, too, will soon be dead. He will disappear, and that will be\r\nthe end. There will be no more of Paul Saval upon the earth. What a\r\nfrightful thing! Other people will love, will laugh. Yes, people will go\r\non amusing themselves, and he will no longer exist! Is it not strange\r\nthat people can laugh, amuse themselves, be joyful under that eternal\r\ncertainty of death? If this death were only probable, one could then\r\nhave hope; but no, it is inevitable, as inevitable as that night follows\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIf, however, his life had been full! If he had done something; if he had\r\nhad adventures, great pleasures, success, satisfaction of some kind or\r\nanother. But no, nothing. He had done nothing, nothing but rise from\r\nbed, eat, at the same hours, and go to bed again. And he had gone on\r\nlike that to the age of sixty-two years. He had not even taken unto\r\nhimself a wife, as other men do. Why? Yes, why was it that he had not\r\nmarried? He might have done so, for he possessed considerable means. Had\r\nhe lacked an opportunity? Perhaps! But one can create opportunities. He\r\nwas indifferent; that was all. Indifference had been his greatest\r\ndrawback, his defect, his vice. How many men wreck their lives through\r\nindifference! It is so difficult for some natures to get out of bed, to\r\nmove about, to take long walks, to speak, to study any question.\r\n\r\nHe had not even been loved. No woman had reposed on his bosom, in a\r\ncomplete abandon of love. He knew nothing of the delicious anguish of\r\nexpectation, the divine vibration of a hand in yours, of the ecstasy of\r\ntriumphant passion.\r\n\r\nWhat superhuman happiness must overflow your heart, when lips encounter\r\nlips for the first time, when the grasp of four arms makes one being of\r\nyou, a being unutterably happy, two beings infatuated with one another.\r\n\r\nM. Saval was sitting before the fire, his feet on the fender, in his\r\ndressing gown. Assuredly his life had been spoiled, completely spoiled.\r\nHe had, however, loved. He had loved secretly, sadly, and indifferently,\r\nin a manner characteristic of him in everything. Yes, he had loved his\r\nold friend, Madame Sandres, the wife of his old companion, Sandres. Ah!\r\nif he had known her as a young girl! But he had met her too late; she\r\nwas already married. Unquestionably, he would have asked her hand! How\r\nhe had loved her, nevertheless, without respite, since the first day he\r\nset eyes on her!\r\n\r\nHe recalled his emotion every time he saw her, his grief on leaving her,\r\nthe many nights that he could not sleep, because he was thinking of her.\r\n\r\nOn rising in the morning he was somewhat more rational than on the\r\nprevious evening.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nHow pretty she was formerly, so dainty, with fair curly hair, and always\r\nlaughing. Sandres was not the man she should have chosen. She was now\r\nfifty-two years of age. She seemed happy. Ah! if she had only loved him\r\nin days gone by; yes, if she had only loved him! And why should she not\r\nhave loved him, he, Saval, seeing that he loved her so much, yes, she,\r\nMadame Sandres!\r\n\r\nIf only she could have guessed. Had she not guessed anything, seen\r\nanything, comprehended anything? What would she have thought? If he had\r\nspoken, what would she have answered?\r\n\r\nAnd Saval asked himself a thousand other things. He reviewed his whole\r\nlife, seeking to recall a multitude of details.\r\n\r\nHe recalled all the long evenings spent at the house of Sandres, when\r\nthe latter's wife was young, and so charming.\r\n\r\nHe recalled many things that she had said to him, the intonations of her\r\nvoice, the little significant smiles that meant so much.\r\n\r\nHe recalled their walks, the three of them together, along the banks of\r\nthe Seine, their luncheon on the grass on Sundays, for Sandres was\r\nemployed at the sub-prefecture. And all at once the distinct\r\nrecollection came to him of an afternoon spent with her in a little wood\r\non the banks of the river.\r\n\r\nThey had set out in the morning, carrying their provisions in baskets.\r\nIt was a bright spring morning, one of those days which intoxicate one.\r\nEverything smells fresh, everything seems happy. The voices of the birds\r\nsound more joyous, and they fly more swiftly. They had luncheon on the\r\ngrass, under the willow trees, quite close to the water, which glittered\r\nin the sun's rays. The air was balmy, charged with the odors of fresh\r\nvegetation; they drank it in with delight. How pleasant everything was\r\non that day!\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, Sandres went to sleep on the broad of his back. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best\r\nnap he had in his life,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when he woke up.\r\n\r\nMadame Sandres had taken the arm of Saval, and they started to walk\r\nalong the river bank.\r\n\r\nShe leaned tenderly on his arm. She laughed and said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nintoxicated, my friend, I am quite intoxicated.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her, his\r\nheart going pit-a-pat. He felt himself grow pale, fearful that he might\r\nhave looked too boldly at her, and that the trembling of his hand had\r\nrevealed his passion.\r\n\r\nShe had made a wreath of wild flowers and water-lilies, and she asked\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x9cDo I look pretty like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he did not answer\xe2\x80\x94for he could find nothing to say, he would have\r\nliked to go down on his knees\xe2\x80\x94she burst out laughing, a sort of annoyed,\r\ndispleased laugh, as she said: \xe2\x80\x9cGreat goose, what ails you? You might at\r\nleast say something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt like crying, but could not even yet find a word to say.\r\n\r\nAll these things came back to him now, as vividly as on the day when\r\nthey took place. Why had she said this to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat goose, what ails\r\nyou? You might at least say something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he recalled how tenderly she had leaned on his arm. And in passing\r\nunder a shady tree he had felt her ear brushing his cheek, and he had\r\nmoved his head abruptly, lest she should suppose he was too familiar.\r\n\r\nWhen he had said to her: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not time to return?\xe2\x80\x9d she darted a\r\nsingular look at him. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d regarding him\r\nat the same time in a curious manner. He had not thought of it at the\r\ntime, but now the whole thing appeared to him quite plain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you like, my friend. If you are tired let us go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he had answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not fatigued; but Sandres may be awake now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she had said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are afraid of my husband's being awake, that\r\nis another thing. Let us return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn their way back she remained silent, and leaned no longer on his arm.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nAt that time it had never occurred to him, to ask himself \xe2\x80\x9cwhy.\xe2\x80\x9d Now he\r\nseemed to apprehend something that he had not then understood.\r\n\r\nCould it?\r\n\r\nM. Saval felt himself blush, and he got up at a bound, as if he were\r\nthirty years younger and had heard Madame Sandres say, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas it possible? That idea which had just entered his mind tortured him.\r\nWas it possible that he had not seen, had not guessed?\r\n\r\nOh! if that were true, if he had let this opportunity of happiness pass\r\nwithout taking advantage of it!\r\n\r\nHe said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI must know. I cannot remain in this state of\r\ndoubt. I must know!\xe2\x80\x9d He thought: \xe2\x80\x9cI am sixty-two years of age, she is\r\nfifty-eight; I may ask her that now without giving offense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started out.\r\n\r\nThe Sandres' house was situated on the other side of the street, almost\r\ndirectly opposite his own. He went across and knocked at the door, and a\r\nlittle servant opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou here at this hour, Saval! Has some accident happened to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut go and tell your mistress that I want to\r\nspeak to her at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is madame is preserving pears for the winter, and she is in\r\nthe preserving room. She is not dressed, you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but go and tell her that I wish to see her on a very important\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little servant went away, and Saval began to walk, with long,\r\nnervous strides, up and down the drawing-room. He did not feel in the\r\nleast embarrassed, however. Oh! he was merely going to ask her\r\nsomething, as he would have asked her about some cooking recipe. He was\r\nsixty-two years of age!\r\n\r\nThe door opened and madame appeared. She was now a large woman, fat and\r\nround, with full cheeks and a sonorous laugh. She walked with her arms\r\naway from her sides and her sleeves tucked up, her bare arms all covered\r\nwith fruit juice. She asked anxiously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you, my friend? You are not ill, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear friend; but I wish to ask you one thing, which to me is of\r\nthe first importance, something which is torturing my heart, and I want\r\nyou to promise that you will answer me frankly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cI am always frank. Say on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then. I have loved you from the first day I ever saw you. Can you\r\nhave any doubt of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe responded, laughing, with something of her former tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat goose! what ails you? I knew it from the very first day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaval began to tremble. He stammered out: \xe2\x80\x9cYou knew it? Then . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\nShe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen\xe2\x80\x94what did you think? What\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94what would you have answered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke into a peal of laughter. Some of the juice ran off the tips of\r\nher fingers on to the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Why, you did not ask me anything. It was not for me to declare\r\nmyself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then advanced a step toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me\xe2\x80\x94tell me . . . . You remember the day when Sandres went to sleep\r\non the grass after lunch . . . when we had walked together as far as the\r\nbend of the river, below . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited, expectantly. She had ceased to laugh, and looked at him,\r\nstraight in the eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly, I remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered, trembling all over:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94that day\xe2\x80\x94if I had been\xe2\x80\x94if I had been\xe2\x80\x94venturesome\xe2\x80\x94what would you\r\nhave done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh as only a happy woman can laugh, who has nothing to\r\nregret, and responded frankly, in a clear voice tinged with irony:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have yielded, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then turned on her heels and went back to her jam-making.\r\n\r\nSaval rushed into the street, cast down, as though he had met with some\r\ndisaster. He walked with giant strides through the rain, straight on,\r\nuntil he reached the river bank, without thinking where he was going. He\r\nthen turned to the right and followed the river. He walked a long time,\r\nas if urged on by some instinct. His clothes were running with water,\r\nhis hat was out of shape, as soft as a rag, and dripping like a roof. He\r\nwalked on, straight in front of him. At last, he came to the place where\r\nthey had lunched on that day so long ago, the recollection of which\r\ntortured his heart. He sat down under the leafless trees, and wept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SISTER'S CONFESSION\r\n\r\nMarguerite de Therelles was dying. Although she was only fifty-six years\r\nold she looked at least seventy-five. She gasped for breath, her face\r\nwhiter than the sheets, and had spasms of violent shivering, with her\r\nface convulsed and her eyes haggard as though she saw a frightful\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nHer elder sister, Suzanne, six years older than herself, was sobbing on\r\nher knees beside the bed. A small table close to the dying woman's couch\r\nbore, on a white cloth, two lighted candles, for the priest was expected\r\nat any moment to administer extreme unction and the last communion.\r\n\r\nThe apartment wore that melancholy aspect common to death chambers; a\r\nlook of despairing farewell. Medicine bottles littered the furniture;\r\nlinen lay in the corners into which it had been kicked or swept. The\r\nvery chairs looked, in their disarray, as if they were terrified and had\r\nrun in all directions. Death\xe2\x80\x94terrible Death\xe2\x80\x94was in the room, hidden,\r\nawaiting his prey.\r\n\r\nThis history of the two sisters was an affecting one. It was spoken of\r\nfar and wide; it had drawn tears from many eyes.\r\n\r\nSuzanne, the elder, had once been passionately loved by a young man,\r\nwhose affection she returned. They were engaged to be married, and the\r\nwedding day was at hand, when Henry de Sampierre suddenly died.\r\n\r\nThe young girl's despair was terrible, and she took an oath never to\r\nmarry. She faithfully kept her vow and adopted widow's weeds for the\r\nremainder of her life.\r\n\r\nBut one morning her sister, her little sister Marguerite, then only\r\ntwelve years old, threw herself into Suzanne's arms, sobbing: \xe2\x80\x9cSister, I\r\ndon't want you to be unhappy. I don't want you to mourn all your life.\r\nI'll never leave you\xe2\x80\x94never, never, never! I shall never marry, either.\r\nI'll stay with you always\xe2\x80\x94always!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuzanne kissed her, touched by the child's devotion, though not putting\r\nany faith in her promise.\r\n\r\nBut the little one kept her word, and, despite her parents'\r\nremonstrances, despite her elder sister's prayers, never married. She\r\nwas remarkably pretty and refused many offers. She never left her\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nThey spent their whole life together, without a single day's separation.\r\nThey went everywhere together and were inseparable. But Marguerite was\r\npensive, melancholy, sadder than her sister, as if her sublime sacrifice\r\nhad undermined her spirits. She grew older more quickly; her hair was\r\nwhite at thirty; and she was often ill, apparently stricken with some\r\nunknown, wasting malady.\r\n\r\nAnd now she would be the first to die.\r\n\r\nShe had not spoken for twenty-four hours, except to whisper at daybreak:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend at once for the priest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she had since remained lying on her back, convulsed with agony, her\r\nlips moving as if unable to utter the dreadful words that rose in her\r\nheart, her face expressive of a terror distressing to witness.\r\n\r\nSuzanne, distracted with grief, her brow pressed against the bed, wept\r\nbitterly, repeating over and over again the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMargot, my poor Margot, my little one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had always called her \xe2\x80\x9cmy little one,\xe2\x80\x9d while Marguerite's name for\r\nthe elder was invariably \xe2\x80\x9csister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA footstep sounded on the stairs. The door opened. An acolyte appeared,\r\nfollowed by the aged priest in his surplice. As soon as she saw him the\r\ndying woman sat up suddenly in bed, opened her lips, stammered a few\r\nwords and began to scratch the bed-clothes, as if she would have made\r\nhole in them.\r\n\r\nFather Simon approached, took her hand, kissed her on the forehead and\r\nsaid in a gentle voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God pardon your sins, my daughter. Be of good courage. Now is the\r\nmoment to confess them\xe2\x80\x94speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Marguerite, shuddering from head to foot, so that the very bed\r\nshook with her nervous movements, gasped:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, sister, and listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest stooped toward the prostrate Suzanne, raised her to her feet,\r\nplaced her in a chair, and, taking a hand of each of the sisters,\r\npronounced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord God! Send them strength! Shed Thy mercy upon them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Marguerite began to speak. The words issued from her lips one by\r\none\xe2\x80\x94hoarse, jerky, tremulous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, pardon, sister! pardon me! Oh, if only you knew how I have\r\ndreaded this moment all my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuzanne faltered through her tears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what have I to pardon, little one? You have given me everything,\r\nsacrificed all to me. You are an angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Marguerite interrupted her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe silent, be silent! Let me speak! Don't stop me! It is terrible. Let\r\nme tell all, to the very end, without interruption. Listen. You\r\nremember\xe2\x80\x94you remember\xe2\x80\x94Henry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuzanne trembled and looked at her sister. The younger one went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to understand you must hear everything. I was twelve years\r\nold\xe2\x80\x94only twelve\xe2\x80\x94you remember, don't you? And I was spoilt; I did just as\r\nI pleased. You remember how everybody spoilt me? Listen. The first time\r\nhe came he had on his riding boots; he dismounted, saying that he had a\r\nmessage for father. You remember, don't you? Don't speak. Listen. When I\r\nsaw him I was struck with admiration. I thought him so handsome, and I\r\nstayed in a corner of the drawing-room all the time he was talking.\r\nChildren are strange\xe2\x80\x94and terrible. Yes, indeed, I dreamt of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came again\xe2\x80\x94many times. I looked at him with all my eyes, all my\r\nheart. I was large for my age and much more precocious than\xe2\x80\x94any one\r\nsuspected. He came often. I thought only of him. I often whispered to\r\nmyself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Henry-Henry de Sampierre!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I was told that he was going to marry you. That was a blow! Oh,\r\nsister, a terrible blow\xe2\x80\x94terrible! I wept all through three sleepless\r\nnights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came every afternoon after lunch. You remember, don't you? Don't\r\nanswer. Listen. You used to make cakes that he was very fond of\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nflour, butter and milk. Oh, I know how to make them. I could make them\r\nstill, if necessary. He would swallow them at one mouthful and wash them\r\ndown with a glass of wine, saying: 'Delicious!' Do you remember the way\r\nhe said it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was jealous\xe2\x80\x94jealous! Your wedding day was drawing near. It was only a\r\nfortnight distant. I was distracted. I said to myself: 'He shall not\r\nmarry Suzanne\xe2\x80\x94no, he shall not! He shall marry me when I am old enough!\r\nI shall never love any one half so much.' But one evening, ten days\r\nbefore the wedding, you went for a stroll with him in the moonlight\r\nbefore the house\xe2\x80\x94and yonder\xe2\x80\x94under the pine tree, the big pine tree\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nkissed you\xe2\x80\x94kissed you\xe2\x80\x94and held you in his arms so long\xe2\x80\x94so long! You\r\nremember, don't you? It was probably the first time. You were so pale\r\nwhen you came back to the drawing-room!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you. I was there in the shrubbery. I was mad with rage! I would\r\nhave killed you both if I could!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to myself: 'He shall never marry Suzanne\xe2\x80\x94never! He shall marry\r\nno one! I could not bear it.' And all at once I began to hate him\r\nintensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do you know what I did? Listen. I had seen the gardener prepare\r\npellets for killing stray dogs. He would crush a bottle into small\r\npieces with a stone and put the ground glass into a ball of meat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stole a small medicine bottle from mother's room. I ground it fine\r\nwith a hammer and hid the glass in my pocket. It was a glistening\r\npowder. The next day, when you had made your little cakes; I opened them\r\nwith a knife and inserted the glass. He ate three. I ate one myself. I\r\nthrew the six others into the pond. The two swans died three days later.\r\nYou remember? Oh, don't speak! Listen, listen. I, I alone did not die.\r\nBut I have always been ill. Listen\xe2\x80\x94he died\xe2\x80\x94you know\xe2\x80\x94listen\xe2\x80\x94that was not\r\nthe worst. It was afterward, later\xe2\x80\x94always\xe2\x80\x94the most terrible\xe2\x80\x94listen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy life, all my life\xe2\x80\x94such torture! I said to myself: 'I will never\r\nleave my sister. And on my deathbed I will tell her all.' And now I have\r\ntold. And I have always thought of this moment\xe2\x80\x94the moment when all would\r\nbe told. Now it has come. It is terrible\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x94sister\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always thought, morning and evening, day and night: 'I shall\r\nhave to tell her some day!' I waited. The horror of it! It is done. Say\r\nnothing. Now I am afraid\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid! Oh! Supposing I should see him\r\nagain, by and by, when I am dead! See him again! Only to think of it! I\r\ndare not\xe2\x80\x94yet I must. I am going to die. I want you to forgive me. I\r\ninsist on it. I cannot meet him without your forgiveness. Oh, tell her\r\nto forgive me, Father! Tell her. I implore you! I cannot die without\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent and lay back, gasping for breath, still plucking at the\r\nsheets with her fingers.\r\n\r\nSuzanne had hidden her face in her hands and did not move. She was\r\nthinking of him whom she had loved so long. What a life of happiness\r\nthey might have had together! She saw him again in the dim and distant\r\npast-that past forever lost. Beloved dead! how the thought of them rends\r\nthe heart! Oh! that kiss, his only kiss! She had retained the memory of\r\nit in her soul. And, after that, nothing, nothing more throughout her\r\nwhole existence!\r\n\r\nThe priest rose suddenly and in a firm, compelling voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Suzanne, your sister is dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Suzanne, raising her tear-stained face, put her arms round her\r\nsister, and kissing her fervently, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you, I forgive you, little one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCO\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole countryside the Lucas farn, was known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nManor.\xe2\x80\x9d No one knew why. The peasants doubtless attached to this word,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManor,\xe2\x80\x9d a meaning of wealth and of splendor, for this farm was\r\nundoubtedly the largest, richest and the best managed in the whole\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe immense court, surrounded by five rows of magnificent trees, which\r\nsheltered the delicate apple trees from the harsh wind of the plain,\r\ninclosed in its confines long brick buildings used for storing fodder\r\nand grain, beautiful stables built of hard stone and made to accommodate\r\nthirty horses, and a red brick residence which looked like a little\r\nchateau.\r\n\r\nThanks for the good care taken, the manure heaps were as little\r\noffensive as such things can be; the watch-dogs lived in kennels, and\r\ncountless poultry paraded through the tall grass.\r\n\r\nEvery day, at noon, fifteen persons, masters, farmhands and the women\r\nfolks, seated themselves around the long kitchen table where the soup\r\nwas brought in steaming in a large, blue-flowered bowl.\r\n\r\nThe beasts-horses, cows, pigs and sheep-were fat, well fed and clean.\r\nMaitre Lucas, a tall man who was getting stout, would go round three\r\ntimes a day, overseeing everything and thinking of everything.\r\n\r\nA very old white horse, which the mistress wished to keep until its\r\nnatural death, because she had brought it up and had always used it, and\r\nalso because it recalled many happy memories, was housed, through sheer\r\nkindness of heart, at the end of the stable.\r\n\r\nA young scamp about fifteen years old, Isidore Duval by name, and\r\ncalled, for convenience, Zidore, took care of this pensioner, gave him\r\nhis measure of oats and fodder in winter, and in summer was supposed to\r\nchange his pasturing place four times a day, so that he might have\r\nplenty of fresh grass.\r\n\r\nThe animal, almost crippled, lifted with difficulty his legs, large at\r\nthe knees and swollen above the hoofs. His coat, which was no longer\r\ncurried, looked like white hair, and his long eyelashes gave to his eyes\r\na sad expression.\r\n\r\nWhen Zidore took the animal to pasture, he had to pull on the rope with\r\nall his might, because it walked so slowly; and the youth, bent over and\r\nout of breath, would swear at it, exasperated at having to care for this\r\nold nag.\r\n\r\nThe farmhands, noticing the young rascal's anger against Coco, were\r\namused and would continually talk of the horse to Zidore, in order to\r\nexasperate him. His comrades would make sport with him. In the village\r\nhe was called Coco-Zidore.\r\n\r\nThe boy would fume, feeling an unholy desire to revenge himself on the\r\nhorse. He was a thin, long-legged, dirty child, with thick, coarse,\r\nbristly red hair. He seemed only half-witted, and stuttered as though\r\nideas were unable to form in his thick, brute-like mind.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he had been unable to understand why Coco should be\r\nkept, indignant at seeing things wasted on this useless beast. Since the\r\nhorse could no longer work, it seemed to him unjust that he should be\r\nfed; he revolted at the idea of wasting oats, oats which were so\r\nexpensive, on this paralyzed old plug. And often, in spite of the orders\r\nof Maitre Lucas, he would economize on the nag's food, only giving him\r\nhalf measure. Hatred grew in his confused, childlike mind, the hatred of\r\na stingy, mean, fierce, brutal and cowardly peasant.\r\n\r\nWhen summer came he had to move the animal about in the pasture. It was\r\nsome distance away. The rascal, angrier every morning, would start, with\r\nhis dragging step, across the wheat fields. The men working in the\r\nfields would shout to him, jokingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Zidore, remember me to Coco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would not answer; but on the way he would break off a switch, and, as\r\nsoon as he had moved the old horse, he would let it begin grazing; then,\r\ntreacherously sneaking up behind it, he would slash its legs. The animal\r\nwould try to escape, to kick, to get away from the blows, and run around\r\nin a circle about its rope, as though it had been inclosed in a circus\r\nring. And the boy would slash away furiously, running along behind, his\r\nteeth clenched in anger.\r\n\r\nThen he would go away slowly, without turning round, while the horse\r\nwatched him disappear, his ribs sticking out, panting as a result of his\r\nunusual exertions. Not until the blue blouse of the young peasant was\r\nout of sight would he lower his thin white head to the grass.\r\n\r\nAs the nights were now warm, Coco was allowed to sleep out of doors, in\r\nthe field behind the little wood. Zidore alone went to see him. The boy\r\nthrew stones at him to amuse himself. He would sit down on an embankment\r\nabout ten feet away and would stay there about half an hour, from time\r\nto time throwing a sharp stone at the old horse, which remained standing\r\ntied before his enemy, watching him continually and not daring to eat\r\nbefore he was gone.\r\n\r\nThis one thought persisted in the mind of the young scamp: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy feed\r\nthis horse, which is no longer good for anything?\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to him that\r\nthis old nag was stealing the food of the others, the goods of man and\r\nGod, that he was even robbing him, Zidore, who was working.\r\n\r\nThen, little by little, each day, the boy began to shorten the length of\r\nrope which allowed the horse to graze.\r\n\r\nThe hungry animal was growing thinner, and starving. Too feeble to break\r\nhis bonds, he would stretch his head out toward the tall, green,\r\ntempting grass, so near that he could smell, and yet so far that he\r\ncould not touch it.\r\n\r\nBut one morning Zidore had an idea: it was, not to move Coco any more.\r\nHe was tired of walking so far for that old skeleton. He came, however,\r\nin order to enjoy his vengeance. The beast watched him anxiously. He did\r\nnot beat him that day. He walked around him with his hands in his\r\npockets. He even pretended to change his place, but he sank the stake in\r\nexactly the same hole, and went away overjoyed with his invention.\r\n\r\nThe horse, seeing him leave, neighed to call him back; but the rascal\r\nbegan to run, leaving him alone, entirely alone in his field, well tied\r\ndown and without a blade of grass within reach.\r\n\r\nStarving, he tried to reach the grass which he could touch with the end\r\nof his nose. He got on his knees, stretching out his neck and his long,\r\ndrooling lips. All in vain. The old animal spent the whole day in\r\nuseless, terrible efforts. The sight of all that green food, which\r\nstretched out on all sides of him, served to increase the gnawing pangs\r\nof hunger.\r\n\r\nThe scamp did not return that day. He wandered through the woods in\r\nsearch of nests.\r\n\r\nThe next day he appeared upon the scene again. Coco, exhausted, had lain\r\ndown. When he saw the boy, he got up, expecting at last to have his\r\nplace changed.\r\n\r\nBut the little peasant did not even touch the mallet, which was lying on\r\nthe ground. He came nearer, looked at the animal, threw at his head a\r\nclump of earth which flattened out against the white hair, and he\r\nstarted off again, whistling.\r\n\r\nThe horse remained standing as long as he could see him; then, knowing\r\nthat his attempts to reach the near-by grass would be hopeless, he once\r\nmore lay down on his side and closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe following day Zidore did not come.\r\n\r\nWhen he did come at last, he found Coco still stretched out; he saw that\r\nhe was dead.\r\n\r\nThen he remained standing, looking at him, pleased with what he had\r\ndone, surprised that it should already be all over. He touched him with\r\nhis foot, lifted one of his legs and then let it drop, sat on him and\r\nremained there, his eyes fixed on the grass, thinking of nothing. He\r\nreturned to the farm, but did not mention the accident, because he\r\nwished to wander about at the hours when he used to change the horse's\r\npasture. He went to see him the next day. At his approach some crows\r\nflew away. Countless flies were walking over the body and were buzzing\r\naround it. When he returned home, he announced the event. The animal was\r\nso old that nobody was surprised. The master said to two of the men:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your shovels and dig a hole right where he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men buried the horse at the place where he had died of hunger. And\r\nthe grass grew thick, green and vigorous, fed by the poor body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAD WOMAN'S SECRET\r\n\r\nThe woman had died without pain, quietly, as a woman should whose life\r\nhad been blameless. Now she was resting in her bed, lying on her back,\r\nher eyes closed, her features calm, her long white hair carefully\r\narranged as though she had done it up ten minutes before dying. The\r\nwhole pale countenance of the dead woman was so collected, so calm, so\r\nresigned that one could feel what a sweet soul had lived in that body,\r\nwhat a quiet existence this old soul had led, how easy and pure the\r\ndeath of this parent had been.\r\n\r\nKneeling beside the bed, her son, a magistrate with inflexible\r\nprinciples, and her daughter, Marguerite, known as Sister Eulalie, were\r\nweeping as though their hearts would break. She had, from childhood up,\r\narmed them with a strict moral code, teaching them religion, without\r\nweakness, and duty, without compromise. He, the man, had become a judge\r\nand handled the law as a weapon with which he smote the weak ones\r\nwithout pity. She, the girl, influenced by the virtue which had bathed\r\nher in this austere family, had become the bride of the Church through\r\nher loathing for man.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly known their father, knowing only that he had made their\r\nmother most unhappy, without being told any other details.\r\n\r\nThe nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman's hand, an ivory hand as white\r\nas the large crucifix lying across the bed. On the other side of the\r\nlong body the other hand seemed still to be holding the sheet in the\r\ndeath grasp; and the sheet had preserved the little creases as a memory\r\nof those last movements which precede eternal immobility.\r\n\r\nA few light taps on the door caused the two sobbing heads to look up,\r\nand the priest, who had just come from dinner, returned. He was red and\r\nout of breath from his interrupted digestion, for he had made himself a\r\nstrong mixture of coffee and brandy in order to combat the fatigue of\r\nthe last few nights and of the wake which was beginning.\r\n\r\nHe looked sad, with that assumed sadness of the priest for whom death is\r\na bread winner. He crossed himself and approaching with his professional\r\ngesture: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my poor children! I have come to help you pass these\r\nlast sad hours.\xe2\x80\x9d But Sister Eulalie suddenly arose. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, father,\r\nbut my brother and I prefer to remain alone with her. This is our last\r\nchance to see her, and we wish to be together, all three of us, as\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x94used to be when we were small and our poor mo\xe2\x80\x94mother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrief and tears stopped her; she could not continue.\r\n\r\nOnce more serene, the priest bowed, thinking of his bed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs you wish,\r\nmy children.\xe2\x80\x9d He kneeled, crossed himself, prayed, arose and went out\r\nquietly, murmuring: \xe2\x80\x9cShe was a saint!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey remained alone, the dead woman and her children. The ticking of the\r\nclock, hidden in the shadow, could be heard distinctly, and through the\r\nopen window drifted in the sweet smell of hay and of woods, together\r\nwith the soft moonlight. No other noise could be heard over the land\r\nexcept the occasional croaking of the frog or the chirping of some\r\nbelated insect. An infinite peace, a divine melancholy, a silent\r\nserenity surrounded this dead woman, seemed to be breathed out from her\r\nand to appease nature itself.\r\n\r\nThen the judge, still kneeling, his head buried in the bed clothes,\r\ncried in a voice altered by grief and deadened by the sheets and\r\nblankets: \xe2\x80\x9cMamma, mamma, mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d And his sister, frantically striking\r\nher forehead against the woodwork, convulsed, twitching and trembling as\r\nin an epileptic fit, moaned: \xe2\x80\x9cJesus, Jesus, mamma, Jesus!\xe2\x80\x9d And both of\r\nthem, shaken by a storm of grief, gasped and choked.\r\n\r\nThe crisis slowly calmed down and they began to weep quietly, just as on\r\nthe sea when a calm follows a squall.\r\n\r\nA rather long time passed and they arose and looked at their dead. And\r\nthe memories, those distant memories, yesterday so dear, to-day so\r\ntorturing, came to their minds with all the little forgotten details,\r\nthose little intimate familiar details which bring back to life the one\r\nwho has left. They recalled to each other circumstances, words, smiles,\r\nintonations of the mother who was no longer to speak to them. They saw\r\nher again happy and calm. They remembered things which she had said, and\r\na little motion of the hand, like beating time, which she often used\r\nwhen emphasizing something important.\r\n\r\nAnd they loved her as they never had loved her before. They measured the\r\ndepth of their grief, and thus they discovered how lonely they would\r\nfind themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was their prop, their guide, their whole youth, all the best part of\r\ntheir lives which was disappearing. It was their bond with life, their\r\nmother, their mamma, the connecting link with their forefathers which\r\nthey would thenceforth miss. They now became solitary, lonely beings;\r\nthey could no longer look back.\r\n\r\nThe nun said to her brother: \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember how mamma used always to read\r\nher old letters; they are all there in that drawer. Let us, in turn,\r\nread them; let us live her whole life through tonight beside her! It\r\nwould be like a road to the cross, like making the acquaintance of her\r\nmother, of our grandparents, whom we never knew, but whose letters are\r\nthere and of whom she so often spoke, do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper,\r\ntied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these\r\nrelics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word \xe2\x80\x9cFather\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nwritten. They opened and read it.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family\r\ndesk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first\r\none started: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d another one: \xe2\x80\x9cMy beautiful little girl,\xe2\x80\x9d others:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d or: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear (laughter).\xe2\x80\x9d And suddenly the nun began to\r\nread aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her\r\ntender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening\r\nwith his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.\r\n\r\nSister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a\r\nshroud and she ought to be buried in it.\xe2\x80\x9d She took another package, on\r\nwhich no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: \xe2\x80\x9cMy adored\r\none, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the\r\ntortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against\r\nmine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love\r\nyou! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild\r\ndesire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you,\r\nwants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He\r\nsnatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was\r\nnone, but only under the words, \xe2\x80\x9cThe man who adores you,\xe2\x80\x9d the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry.\xe2\x80\x9d Their father's name was Rene. Therefore this was not from him.\r\nThe son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one\r\nout and read: \xe2\x80\x9cI can no longer live without your caresses.\xe2\x80\x9d Standing\r\nerect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the\r\ndead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the\r\ncorners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed\r\nthe room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the\r\ndark night.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned around again Sister Eulalie, her eyes dry now, was still\r\nstanding near the bed, her head bent down.\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward, quickly picked up the letters and threw them pell-\r\nmell back into the drawer. Then he closed the curtains of the bed.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight made the candles on the table turn pale the son slowly\r\nleft his armchair, and without looking again at the mother upon whom he\r\nhad passed sentence, severing the tie that united her to son and\r\ndaughter, he said slowly: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us now retire, sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HUMBLE DRAMA\r\n\r\nMeetings that are unexpected constitute the charm of traveling. Who has\r\nnot experienced the joy of suddenly coming across a Parisian, a college\r\nfriend, or a neighbor, five hundred miles from home? Who has not passed\r\na night awake in one of those small, rattling country stage-coaches, in\r\nregions where steam is still a thing unknown, beside a strange young\r\nwoman, of whom one has caught only a glimpse in the dim light of the\r\nlantern, as she entered the carriage in front of a white house in some\r\nsmall country town?\r\n\r\nAnd the next morning, when one's head and ears feel numb with the\r\ncontinuous tinkling of the bells and the loud rattling of the windows,\r\nwhat a charming sensation it is to see your pretty neighbor open her\r\neyes, startled, glance around her, arrange her rebellious hair with her\r\nslender fingers, adjust her hat, feel with sure hand whether her corset\r\nis still in place, her waist straight, and her skirt not too wrinkled.\r\n\r\nShe glances at you coldly and curiously. Then she leans back and no\r\nlonger seems interested in anything but the country.\r\n\r\nIn spite of yourself, you watch her; and in spite of yourself you keep\r\non thinking of her. Who is she? Whence does she come? Where is she\r\ngoing? In spite of yourself you spin a little romance around her. She is\r\npretty; she seems charming! Happy he who . . . Life might be delightful\r\nwith her. Who knows? She is perhaps the woman of our dreams, the one\r\nsuited to our disposition, the one for whom our heart calls.\r\n\r\nAnd how delicious even the disappointment at seeing her get out at the\r\ngate of a country house! A man stands there, who is awaiting her, with\r\ntwo children and two maids. He takes her in his arms and kisses as he\r\nlifts her out. Then she stoops over the little ones, who hold up their\r\nhands to her; she kisses them tenderly; and then they all go away\r\ntogether, down a path, while the maids catch the packages which the\r\ndriver throws down to them from the coach.\r\n\r\nAdieu! It is all over. You never will see her again! Adieu to the young\r\nwoman who has passed the night by your side. You know her no more, you\r\nhave not spoken to her; all the same, you feel a little sad to see her\r\ngo. Adieu!\r\n\r\nI have had many of these souvenirs of travel, some joyous and some sad.\r\n\r\nOnce I was in Auvergne, tramping through those delightful French\r\nmountains, that are not too high, not too steep, but friendly and\r\nfamiliar. I had climbed the Sancy, and entered a little inn, near a\r\npilgrim's chapel called Notre-Dame de Vassiviere, when I saw a queer,\r\nridiculous-looking old woman breakfasting alone at the end table.\r\n\r\nShe was at least seventy years old, tall, skinny, and angular, and her\r\nwhite hair was puffed around her temples in the old-fashioned style. She\r\nwas dressed like a traveling Englishwoman, in awkward, queer clothing,\r\nlike a person who is indifferent to dress. She was eating an omelet and\r\ndrinking water.\r\n\r\nHer face was peculiar, with restless eyes and the expression of one with\r\nwhom fate has dealt unkindly. I watched her, in spite of myself,\r\nthinking: \xe2\x80\x9cWho is she? What is the life of this woman? Why is she\r\nwandering alone through these mountains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paid and rose to leave, drawing up over her shoulders an astonishing\r\nlittle shawl, the two ends of which hung over her arms. From a corner of\r\nthe room she took an alpenstock, which was covered with names traced\r\nwith a hot iron; then she went out, straight, erect, with the long steps\r\nof a letter-carrier who is setting out on his route.\r\n\r\nA guide was waiting for her at the door, and both went away. I watched\r\nthem go down the valley, along the road marked by a line of high wooden\r\ncrosses. She was taller than her companion, and seemed to walk faster\r\nthan he.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later I was climbing the edge of the deep funnel that incloses\r\nLake Pavin in a marvelous and enormous basin of verdure, full of trees,\r\nbushes, rocks, and flowers. This lake is so round that it seems as if\r\nthe outline had been drawn with a pair of compasses, so clear and blue\r\nthat one might deem it a flood of azure come down from the sky, so\r\ncharming that one would like to live in a hut on the wooded slope which\r\ndominates this crater, where the cold, still water is sleeping. The\r\nEnglishwoman was standing there like a statue, gazing upon the\r\ntransparent sheet down in the dead volcano. She was straining her eyes\r\nto penetrate below the surface down to the unknown depths, where\r\nmonstrous trout which have devoured all the other fish are said to live.\r\nAs I was passing close by her, it seemed to me that two big tears were\r\nbrimming her eyes. But she departed at a great pace, to rejoin her\r\nguide, who had stayed behind in an inn at the foot of the path leading\r\nto the lake.\r\n\r\nI did not see her again that day.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at nightfall, I came to the chateau of Murol. The old\r\nfortress, an enormous tower standing on a peak in the midst of a large\r\nvalley, where three valleys intersect, rears its brown, uneven, cracked\r\nsurface into the sky; it is round, from its large circular base to the\r\ncrumbling turrets on its pinnacles.\r\n\r\nIt astonishes the eye more than any other ruin by its simple mass, its\r\nmajesty, its grave and imposing air of antiquity. It stands there,\r\nalone, high as a mountain, a dead queen, but still the queen of the\r\nvalleys stretched out beneath it. You go up by a slope planted with\r\nfirs, then you enter a narrow gate, and stop at the foot of the walls,\r\nin the first inclosure, in full view of the entire country.\r\n\r\nInside there are ruined halls, crumbling stairways, unknown cavities,\r\ndungeons, walls cut through in the middle, vaulted roofs held up one\r\nknows not how, and a mass of stones and crevices, overgrown with grass,\r\nwhere animals glide in and out.\r\n\r\nI was exploring this ruin alone.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I perceived behind a bit of wall a being, a kind of phantom,\r\nlike the spirit of this ancient and crumbling habitation.\r\n\r\nI was taken aback with surprise, almost with fear, when I recognized the\r\nold lady whom I had seen twice.\r\n\r\nShe was weeping, with big tears in her eyes, and held her handkerchief\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\nI turned around to go away, when she spoke to me, apparently ashamed to\r\nhave been surprised in her grief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, I am crying. That does not happen often to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, madame, for having disturbed you,\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered, confused,\r\nnot knowing what to say. \xe2\x80\x9cSome misfortune has doubtless come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. No\xe2\x80\x94I am like a lost dog,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, and began to sob, with her\r\nhandkerchief over her eyes.\r\n\r\nMoved by these contagious tears, I took her hand, trying to calm her.\r\nThen brusquely she told me her history, as if no longer ably to bear her\r\ngrief alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh! Monsieur\xe2\x80\x94if you knew\xe2\x80\x94the sorrow in which I live\xe2\x80\x94in what sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce I was happy. I have a house down there\xe2\x80\x94a home. I cannot go back to\r\nit any more; I shall never go back to it again, it is too hard to bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a son. It is he! it is he! Children don't know. Oh, one has such\r\na short time to live! If I should see him now I should perhaps not\r\nrecognize him. How I loved him? How I loved him! Even before he was\r\nborn, when I felt him move. And after that! How I have kissed and\r\ncaressed and cherished him! If you knew how many nights I have passed in\r\nwatching him sleep, and how many in thinking of him. I was crazy about\r\nhim. When he was eight years old his father sent him to boarding-school.\r\nThat was the end. He no longer belonged to me. Oh, heavens! He came to\r\nsee me every Sunday. That was all!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went to college in Paris. Then he came only four times a year, and\r\nevery time I was astonished to see how he had changed, to find him\r\ntaller without having seen him grow. They stole his childhood from me,\r\nhis confidence, and his love which otherwise would not have gone away\r\nfrom me; they stole my joy in seeing him grow, in seeing him become a\r\nlittle man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him four times a year. Think of it! And at every one of his\r\nvisits his body, his eye, his movements, his voice his laugh, were no\r\nlonger the same, were no longer mine. All these things change so quickly\r\nin a child; and it is so sad if one is not there to see them change; one\r\nno longer recognizes him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne year he came with down on his cheek! He! my son! I was dumfounded\r\n\xe2\x80\x94would you believe it? I hardly dared to kiss him. Was it really he, my\r\nlittle, little curly head of old, my dear; dear child, whom I had held\r\nin his diapers or my knee, and who had nursed at my breast with his\r\nlittle greedy lips\xe2\x80\x94was it he, this tall, brown boy, who no longer knew\r\nhow to kiss me, who seemed to love me as a matter of duty, who called me\r\n'mother' for the sake of politeness, and who kissed me on the forehead,\r\nwhen I felt like crushing him in my arms?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband died. Then my parents, and then my two sisters. When Death\r\nenters a house it seems as if he were hurrying to do his utmost, so as\r\nnot to have to return for a long time after that. He spares only one or\r\ntwo to mourn the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remained alone. My tall son was then studying law. I was hoping to\r\nlive and die near him, and I went to him so that we could live together.\r\nBut he had fallen into the ways of young men, and he gave me to\r\nunderstand that I was in his way. So I left. I was wrong in doing so,\r\nbut I suffered too much in feeling myself in his way, I, his mother! And\r\nI came back home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly ever saw him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe married. What a joy! At last we should be together for good. I\r\nshould have grandchildren. His wife was an Englishwoman, who took a\r\ndislike to me. Why? Perhaps she thought that I loved him too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain I was obliged to go away. And I was alone. Yes, monsieur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he went to England, to live with them, with his wife's parents. Do\r\nyou understand? They have him\xe2\x80\x94they have my son for themselves. They have\r\nstolen him from me. He writes to me once a month. At first he came to\r\nsee me. But now he no longer comes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now four years since I saw him last. His face then was wrinkled\r\nand his hair white. Was that possible? This man, my son, almost an old\r\nman? My little rosy child of old? No doubt I shall never see him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I travel about all the year. I go east and west, as you see,\r\nwith no companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am like a lost dog. Adieu, monsieur! don't stay here with me for it\r\nhurts me to have told you all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went down the hill, and on turning round to glance back, I saw the old\r\nwoman standing on a broken wall, looking out upon the mountains, the\r\nlong valley and Lake Chambon in the distance.\r\n\r\nAnd her skirt and the queer little shawl which she wore around her thin\r\nshoulders were fluttering tike a flag in the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADEMOISELLE COCOTTE\r\n\r\nWe were just leaving the asylum when I saw a tall, thin man in a corner\r\nof the court who kept on calling an imaginary dog. He was crying in a\r\nsoft, tender voice: \xe2\x80\x9cCocotte! Come here, Cocotte, my beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nslapping his thigh as one does when calling an animal. I asked the\r\nphysician, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that man?\xe2\x80\x9d He answered: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! he is not at all\r\ninteresting. He is a coachman named Francois, who became insane after\r\ndrowning his dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI insisted: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me his story. The most simple and humble things are\r\nsometimes those which touch our hearts most deeply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere is this man's adventure, which was obtained from a friend of his, a\r\ngroom:\r\n\r\nThere was a family of rich bourgeois who lived in a suburb of Paris.\r\nThey had a villa in the middle of a park, at the edge of the Seine.\r\nTheir coachman was this Francois, a country fellow, somewhat dull, kind-\r\nhearted, simple and easy to deceive.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as he was returning home, a dog began to follow him. At\r\nfirst he paid no attention to it, but the creature's obstinacy at last\r\nmade him turn round. He looked to see if he knew this dog. No, he had\r\nnever seen it. It was a female dog and frightfully thin. She was\r\ntrotting behind him with a mournful and famished look, her tail between\r\nher legs, her ears flattened against her head and stopping and starting\r\nwhenever he did.\r\n\r\nHe tried to chase this skeleton away and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun along! Get out! Kss! kss!\xe2\x80\x9d She retreated a few steps, then sat down\r\nand waited. And when the coachman started to walk again she followed\r\nalong behind him.\r\n\r\nHe pretended to pick up some stones. The animal ran a little farther\r\naway, but came back again as soon as the man's back was turned.\r\n\r\nThen the coachman Francois took pity on the beast and called her. The\r\ndog approached timidly. The man patted her protruding ribs, moved by the\r\nbeast's misery, and he cried: \xe2\x80\x9cCome! come here!\xe2\x80\x9d Immediately she began\r\nto wag her tail, and, feeling herself taken in, adopted, she began to\r\nrun along ahead of her new master.\r\n\r\nHe made her a bed on the straw in the stable, then he ran to the kitchen\r\nfor some bread. When she had eaten all she could she curled up and went\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen his employers heard of this the next day they allowed the coachman\r\nto keep the animal. It was a good beast, caressing and faithful,\r\nintelligent and gentle.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Francois adored Cocotte, and he kept repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cThat beast\r\nis human. She only lacks speech.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a magnificent red leather collar made for her which bore these\r\nwords engraved on a copper plate: \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Cocotte, belonging to\r\nthe coachman Francois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was remarkably prolific and four times a year would give birth to a\r\nbatch of little animals belonging to every variety of the canine race.\r\nFrancois would pick out one which he would leave her and then he would\r\nunmercifully throw the others into the river. But soon the cook joined\r\nher complaints to those of the gardener. She would find dogs under the\r\nstove, in the ice box, in the coal bin, and they would steal everything\r\nthey came across.\r\n\r\nFinally the master, tired of complaints, impatiently ordered Francois to\r\nget rid of Cocotte. In despair the man tried to give her away. Nobody\r\nwanted her. Then he decided to lose her, and he gave her to a teamster,\r\nwho was to drop her on the other side of Paris, near Joinville-le-Pont.\r\n\r\nCocotte returned the same day. Some decision had to be taken. Five\r\nfrancs was given to a train conductor to take her to Havre. He was to\r\ndrop her there.\r\n\r\nThree days later she returned to the stable, thin, footsore and tired\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe master took pity on her and let her stay. But other dogs were\r\nattracted as before, and one evening, when a big dinner party was on, a\r\nstuffed turkey was carried away by one of them right under the cook's\r\nnose, and she did not dare to stop him.\r\n\r\nThis time the master completely lost his temper and said angrily to\r\nFrancois: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don't throw this beast into the water before\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow\r\nmorning, I'll put you out, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was dumbfounded, and he returned to his room to pack his trunk,\r\npreferring to leave the place. Then he bethought himself that he could\r\nfind no other situation as long as he dragged this animal about with\r\nhim. He thought of his good position, where he was well paid and well\r\nfed, and he decided that a dog was really not worth all that. At last he\r\ndecided to rid himself of Cocotte at daybreak.\r\n\r\nHe slept badly. He rose at dawn, and taking a strong rope, went to get\r\nthe dog. She stood up slowly, shook herself, stretched and came to\r\nwelcome her master.\r\n\r\nThen his courage forsook him, and he began to pet her affectionately,\r\nstroking her long ears, kissing her muzzle and calling her tender names.\r\n\r\nBut a neighboring clock struck six. He could no longer hesitate. He\r\nopened the door, calling: \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d The beast wagged her tail,\r\nunderstanding that she was to be taken out.\r\n\r\nThey reached the beach, and he chose a place where the water seemed\r\ndeep. Then he knotted the rope round the leather collar and tied a heavy\r\nstone to the other end. He seized Cocotte in his arms and kissed her\r\nmadly, as though he were taking leave of some human being. He held her\r\nto his breast, rocked her and called her \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear little Cocotte, my\r\nsweet little Cocotte,\xe2\x80\x9d and she grunted with pleasure.\r\n\r\nTen times he tried to throw her into the water and each time he lost\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he made up his mind and threw her as far from him as he\r\ncould. At first she tried to swim, as she did when he gave her a bath,\r\nbut her head, dragged down by the stone, kept going under, and she\r\nlooked at her master with wild, human glances as she struggled like a\r\ndrowning person. Then the front part of her body sank, while her hind\r\nlegs waved wildly out of the water. Finally those also disappeared.\r\n\r\nThen, for five minutes, bubbles rose to the surface as though the river\r\nwere boiling, and Francois, haggard, his heart beating, thought that he\r\nsaw Cocotte struggling in the mud, and, with the simplicity of a\r\npeasant, he kept saying to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does the poor beast think of\r\nme now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe almost lost his mind. He was ill for a month and every night he\r\ndreamed of his dog. He could feel her licking his hands and hear her\r\nbarking. It was necessary to call in a physician. At last he recovered,\r\nand toward the 2nd of June his employers took him to their estate at\r\nBiesard, near Rouen.\r\n\r\nThere again he was near the Seine. He began to take baths. Each morning\r\nhe would go down with the groom and they would swim across the river.\r\n\r\nOne day, as they were disporting themselves in the water, Francois\r\nsuddenly cried to his companion: \xe2\x80\x9cLook what's coming! I'm going to give\r\nyou a chop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an enormous, swollen corpse that was floating down with its feet\r\nsticking straight up in the air.\r\n\r\nFrancois swam up to it, still joking: \xe2\x80\x9cWhew! it's not fresh. What a\r\ncatch, old man! It isn't thin, either!\xe2\x80\x9d He kept swimming about at a\r\ndistance from the animal that was in a state of decomposition. Then,\r\nsuddenly, he was silent and looked at it: attentively. This time he came\r\nnear enough to touch, it. He looked fixedly at the collar, then he\r\nstretched out his arm, seized the neck, swung the corpse round and drew\r\nit up close to him and read on the copper which had turned green and\r\nwhich still stuck to the discolored leather: \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Cocotte,\r\nbelonging to the coachman Francois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dead dog had come more than a hundred miles to find its master.\r\n\r\nHe let out a frightful shriek and began to swim for the beach with all\r\nhis might, still howling; and as soon as he touched land he ran away\r\nwildly, stark naked, through the country. He was insane!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORSICAN BANDIT\r\n\r\nThe road ascended gently through the forest of Aitone. The large pines\r\nformed a solemn dome above our heads, and that mysterious sound made by\r\nthe wind in the trees sounded like the notes of an organ.\r\n\r\nAfter walking for three hours, there was a clearing, and then at\r\nintervals an enormous pine umbrella, and then we suddenly came to the\r\nedge of the forest, some hundred meters below, the pass leading to the\r\nwild valley of Niolo.\r\n\r\nOn the two projecting heights which commanded a view of this pass, some\r\nold trees, grotesquely twisted, seemed to have mounted with painful\r\nefforts, like scouts sent in advance of the multitude in the rear. When\r\nwe turned round, we saw the entire forest stretched beneath our feet,\r\nlike a gigantic basin of verdure, inclosed by bare rocks whose summits\r\nseemed to reach the sky.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our walk, and, ten minutes later, found ourselves in the\r\npass.\r\n\r\nThen I beheld a remarkable landscape. Beyond another forest stretched a\r\nvalley, but a valley such as I had never seen before; a solitude of\r\nstone, ten leagues long, hollowed out between two high mountains,\r\nwithout a field or a tree to be seen. This was the Niolo valley, the\r\nfatherland of Corsican liberty, the inaccessible citadel, from which the\r\ninvaders had never been able to drive out the mountaineers.\r\n\r\nMy companion said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is where all our bandits have taken\r\nrefuge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEre long we were at the further end of this gorge, so wild, so\r\ninconceivably beautiful.\r\n\r\nNot a blade of grass, not a plant-nothing but granite. As far as our\r\neyes could reach, we saw in front of us a desert of glittering stone,\r\nheated like an oven by a burning sun, which seemed to hang for that very\r\npurpose right above the gorge. When we raised our eyes towards the\r\ncrests, we stood dazzled and stupefied by what we saw. They looked like\r\na festoon of coral; all the summits are of porphyry; and the sky\r\noverhead was violet, purple, tinged with the coloring of these strange\r\nmountains. Lower down, the granite was of scintillating gray, and seemed\r\nground to powder beneath our feet. At our right, along a long and\r\nirregular course, roared a tumultuous torrent. And we staggered along\r\nunder this heat, in this light, in this burning, arid, desolate valley\r\ncut by this torrent of turbulent water which seemed to be ever hurrying\r\nonward, without fertilizing the rocks, lost in this furnace which\r\ngreedily drank it up without being saturated or refreshed by it.\r\n\r\nBut, suddenly, there was visible at our right a little wooden cross sunk\r\nin a little heap of stones. A man had been killed there; and I said to\r\nmy companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about your bandits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew the most celebrated of them, the terrible St. Lucia. I will tell\r\nyou his history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father was killed in a quarrel by a young man of the district, it\r\nis said; and St. Lucia was left alone with his sister. He was a weak,\r\ntimid youth, small, often ill, without any energy. He did not proclaim\r\nvengeance against the assassin of his father. All his relatives came to\r\nsee him, and implored of him to avenge his death; he remained deaf to\r\ntheir menaces and their supplications.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, following the old Corsican custom, his sister, in her indignation\r\ncarried away his black clothes, in order that he might not wear mourning\r\nfor a dead man who had not been avenged. He was insensible to even this\r\naffront, and rather than take down from the rack his father's gun, which\r\nwas still loaded, he shut himself up, not daring to brave the looks of\r\nthe young men of the district.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed to have even forgotten the crime, and lived with his sister\r\nin the seclusion of their dwelling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, one day, the man who was suspected of having committed the murder,\r\nwas about to get married. St. Lucia did not appear to be moved by this\r\nnews, but, out of sheer bravado, doubtless, the bridegroom, on his way\r\nto the church, passed before the house of the two orphans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe brother and the sister, at their window, were eating frijoles, when\r\nthe young man saw the bridal procession going by. Suddenly he began to\r\ntremble, rose to his feet without uttering a word, made the sign of the\r\ncross, took the gun which was hanging over the fireplace, and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he spoke of this later on, he said: 'I don't know what was the\r\nmatter with me; it was like fire in my blood; I felt that I must do it,\r\nthat, in spite of everything, I could not resist, and I concealed the\r\ngun in a cave on the road to Corte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour later, he came back, with nothing in his hand, and with his\r\nhabitual air of sad weariness. His sister believed that there was\r\nnothing further in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when night fell he disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis enemy had, the same evening, to repair to Corte on foot,\r\naccompanied by his two groomsmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was walking along, singing as he went, when St. Lucia stood before\r\nhim, and looking straight in the murderer's face, exclaimed: 'Now is the\r\ntime!' and shot him point-blank in the chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the men fled; the other stared at, the young man, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What have you done, St. Lucia?' and he was about to hasten to Corte\r\nfor help, when St. Lucia said in a stern tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'If you move another step, I'll shoot you in the leg.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other, aware of his timidity hitherto, replied: 'You would not dare\r\nto do it!' and was hurrying off when he fell instantaneously, his thigh\r\nshattered by a bullet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd St. Lucia, coming over to where he lay, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am going to look at your wound; if it is not serious, I'll leave you\r\nthere; if it is mortal I'll finish you off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe inspected the wound, considered it mortal, and slowly reloading his\r\ngun, told the wounded man to say a prayer, and shot him through the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext day he was in the mountains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know what this St. Lucia did after this?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll his family were arrested by the gendarmes. His uncle, the cure, who\r\nwas suspected of having incited him to this deed of vengeance, was\r\nhimself put in prison, and accused by the dead man's relatives. But he\r\nescaped, took a gun in his turn, and went to join his nephew in the\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext, St. Lucia killed, one after the other, his uncle's accusers, and\r\ntore out their eyes to teach the others never to state what they had\r\nseen with their eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe killed all the relatives, all the connections of his enemy's family.\r\nHe slew during his life fourteen gendarmes, burned down the houses of\r\nhis adversaries, and was, up to the day of his death, the most terrible\r\nof all the bandits whose memory we have preserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sun disappeared behind Monte Cinto and the tall shadow of the\r\ngranite mountain went to sleep on the granite of the valley. We\r\nquickened our pace in order to reach before night the little village of\r\nAlbertaccio, nothing but a pile of stones welded into the stone flanks\r\nof a wild gorge. And I said as I thought of the bandit:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a terrible custom your vendetta is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy companion answered with an air of resignation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have? A man must do his duty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVE\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth of July, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, at\r\nhalf-past two in the morning, the watchman in the cemetery of Besiers,\r\nwho lived in a small cottage on the edge of this field of the dead, was\r\nawakened by the barking of his dog, which was shut up in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nGoing down quickly, he saw the animal sniffing at the crack of the door\r\nand barking furiously, as if some tramp had been sneaking about the\r\nhouse. The keeper, Vincent, therefore took his gun and went out.\r\n\r\nHis dog, preceding him, at once ran in the direction of the Avenue\r\nGeneral Bonnet, stopping short at the monument of Madame Tomoiseau.\r\n\r\nThe keeper, advancing cautiously, soon saw a faint light on the side of\r\nthe Avenue Malenvers, and stealing in among the graves, he came upon a\r\nhorrible act of profanation.\r\n\r\nA man had dug up the coffin of a young woman who had been buried the\r\nevening before and was dragging the corpse out of it.\r\n\r\nA small dark lantern, standing on a pile of earth, lighted up this\r\nhideous scene.\r\n\r\nVincent sprang upon the wretch, threw him to the ground, bound his hands\r\nand took him to the police station.\r\n\r\nIt was a young, wealthy and respected lawyer in town, named\r\nCourbataille.\r\n\r\nHe was brought into court. The public prosecutor opened the case by\r\nreferring to the monstrous deeds of the Sergeant Bertrand.\r\n\r\nA wave of indignation swept over the courtroom. When the magistrate sat\r\ndown the crowd assembled cried: \xe2\x80\x9cDeath! death!\xe2\x80\x9d With difficulty the\r\npresiding judge established silence.\r\n\r\nThen he said gravely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefendant, what have you to say in your defense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCourbataille, who had refused counsel, rose. He was a handsome fellow,\r\ntall, brown, with a frank face, energetic manner and a fearless eye.\r\n\r\nPaying no attention to the whistlings in the room, he began to speak in\r\na voice that was low and veiled at first, but that grew more firm as he\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le President, gentlemen of the jury: I have very little to\r\nsay. The woman whose grave I violated was my sweetheart. I loved her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved her, not with a sensual love and not with mere tenderness of\r\nheart and soul, but with an absolute, complete love, with an\r\noverpowering passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I met her for the first time I felt a strange sensation. It was\r\nnot astonishment nor admiration, nor yet that which is called love at\r\nfirst sight, but a feeling of delicious well-being, as if I had been\r\nplunged into a warm bath. Her gestures seduced me, her voice enchanted\r\nme, and it was with infinite pleasure that I looked upon her person. It\r\nseemed to me as if I had seen her before and as if I had known her a\r\nlong time. She had within her something of my spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed to me like an answer to a cry uttered by my soul, to that\r\nvague and unceasing cry with which we call upon Hope during our whole\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I knew her a little better, the mere thought of seeing her again\r\nfilled me with exquisite and profound uneasiness; the touch of her hand\r\nin mine was more delightful to me than anything that I had imagined; her\r\nsmile filled me with a mad joy, with the desire to run, to dance, to\r\nfling myself upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we became lovers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, more than that: she was my very life. I looked for nothing further\r\non earth, and had no further desires. I longed for nothing further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening, when we had gone on a somewhat long walk by the river, we\r\nwere overtaken by the rain, and she caught cold. It developed into\r\npneumonia the next day, and a week later she was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the hours of her suffering astonishment and consternation\r\nprevented my understanding and reflecting upon it, but when she was dead\r\nI was so overwhelmed by blank despair that I had no thoughts left. I\r\nwept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring all the horrible details of the interment my keen and wild grief\r\nwas like a madness, a kind of sensual, physical grief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen when she was gone, when she was under the earth, my mind at once\r\nfound itself again, and I passed through a series of moral sufferings so\r\nterrible that even the love she had vouchsafed to me was dear at that\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the fixed idea came to me: I shall not see her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one dwells on this thought for a whole day one feels as if he were\r\ngoing mad. Just think of it! There is a woman whom you adore, a unique\r\nwoman, for in the whole universe there is not a second one like her.\r\nThis woman has given herself to you and has created with you the\r\nmysterious union that is called Love. Her eye seems to you more vast\r\nthan space, more charming than the world, that clear eye smiling with\r\nher tenderness. This woman loves you. When she speaks to you her voice\r\nfloods you with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd suddenly she disappears! Think of it! She disappears, not only for\r\nyou, but forever. She is dead. Do you understand what that means? Never,\r\nnever, never, not anywhere will she exist any more. Nevermore will that\r\neye look upon anything again; nevermore will that voice, nor any voice\r\nlike it, utter a word in the same way as she uttered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevermore will a face be born that is like hers. Never, never! The\r\nmolds of statues are kept; casts are kept by which one can make objects\r\nwith the same outlines and forms. But that one body and that one face\r\nwill never more be born again upon the earth. And yet millions and\r\nmillions of creatures will be born, and more than that, and this one\r\nwoman will not reappear among all the women of the future. Is it\r\npossible? It drives one mad to think of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lived for twenty years, not more, and she has disappeared forever,\r\nforever, forever! She thought, she smiled, she loved me. And now\r\nnothing! The flies that die in the autumn are as much as we are in this\r\nworld. And now nothing! And I thought that her body, her fresh body, so\r\nwarm, so sweet, so white, so lovely, would rot down there in that box\r\nunder the earth. And her soul, her thought, her love\xe2\x80\x94where is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to see her again! The idea of this decomposing body, that I might\r\nyet recognize, haunted me. I wanted to look at it once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went out with a spade, a lantern and a hammer; I jumped over the\r\ncemetery wall and I found the grave, which had not yet been closed\r\nentirely; I uncovered the coffin and took up a board. An abominable\r\nodor, the stench of putrefaction, greeted my nostrils. Oh, her bed\r\nperfumed with orris!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I opened the coffin, and, holding my lighted lantern down into it I\r\nsaw her. Her face was blue, swollen, frightful. A black liquid had oozed\r\nout of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe! That was she! Horror seized me. But I stretched out my arm to draw\r\nthis monstrous face toward me. And then I was caught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll night I have retained the foul odor of this putrid body, the odor\r\nof my well beloved, as one retains the perfume of a woman after a love\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo with me what you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA strange silence seemed to oppress the room. They seemed to be waiting\r\nfor something more. The jury retired to deliberate.\r\n\r\nWhen they came back a few minutes later the accused showed no fear and\r\ndid not even seem to think.\r\n\r\nThe president announced with the usual formalities that his judges\r\ndeclared him to be not guilty.\r\n\r\nHe did not move and the room applauded.\r\n\r\nThe Grave appeared in Gil Blas, July 29, 1883, under the signature of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaufrigneuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SHORT STORIES, Vol. 13.\r\n\r\nGUY DE MAUPASSANT ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES Translated by ALBERT M. C.\r\nMcMASTER, B.A. A. E. HENDERSON, B.A. MME. QUESADA and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD JUDAS\r\n\r\nThis entire stretch of country was amazing; it was characterized by a\r\ngrandeur that was almost religious, and yet it had an air of sinister\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nA great, wild lake, filled with stagnant, black water, in which\r\nthousands of reeds were waving to and fro, lay in the midst of a vast\r\ncircle of naked hills, where nothing grew but broom, or here and there\r\nan oak curiously twisted by the wind.\r\n\r\nJust one house stood on the banks of that dark lake, a small, low house\r\ninhabited by Uncle Joseph, an old boatman, who lived on what he could\r\nmake by his fishing. Once a week he carried the fish he caught into the\r\nsurrounding villages, returning with the few provisions that he needed\r\nfor his sustenance.\r\n\r\nI went to see this old hermit, who offered to take me with him to his\r\nnets, and I accepted.\r\n\r\nHis boat was old, worm-eaten and clumsy, and the skinny old man rowed\r\nwith a gentle and monotonous stroke that was soothing to the soul,\r\nalready oppressed by the sadness of the land round about.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me as if I were transported to olden times, in the midst of\r\nthat ancient country, in that primitive boat, which was propelled by a\r\nman of another age.\r\n\r\nHe took up his nets and threw the fish into the bottom of the boat, as\r\nthe fishermen of the Bible might have done. Then he took me down to the\r\nend of the lake, where I suddenly perceived a ruin on the other side of\r\nthe bank a dilapidated hut, with an enormous red cross on the wall that\r\nlooked as if it might have been traced with blood, as it gleamed in the\r\nlast rays of the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is where Judas died,\xe2\x80\x9d the man replied, crossing himself.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised, being almost prepared for this strange answer.\r\n\r\nStill I asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudas? What Judas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Wandering Jew, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nI asked him to tell me this legend.\r\n\r\nBut it was better than a legend, being a true story, and quite a recent\r\none, since Uncle Joseph had known the man.\r\n\r\nThis hut had formerly been occupied by a large woman, a kind of beggar,\r\nwho lived on public charity.\r\n\r\nUncle Joseph did not remember from whom she had this hut. One evening an\r\nold man with a white beard, who seemed to be at least two hundred years\r\nold, and who could hardly drag himself along, asked alms of this forlorn\r\nwoman, as he passed her dwelling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9ceverything here belongs to all the\r\nworld, since it comes from all the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a stone before the door. He shared the woman's bread, her\r\nbed of leaves, and her house.\r\n\r\nHe did not leave her again, for he had come to the end of his travels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Our Lady the Virgin who permitted this, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit being a woman who had opened her door to a Judas, for this old\r\nvagabond was the Wandering Jew. It was not known at first in the\r\ncountry, but the people suspected it very soon, because he was always\r\nwalking; it had become a sort of second nature to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd suspicion had been aroused by still another thing. This woman, who\r\nkept that stranger with her, was thought to be a Jewess, for no one had\r\never seen her at church. For ten miles around no one ever called her\r\nanything else but the Jewess.\r\n\r\nWhen the little country children saw her come to beg they cried out:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, mamma, here is the Jewess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man and she began to go out together into the neighboring\r\ndistricts, holding out their hands at all the doors, stammering\r\nsupplications into the ears of all the passers. They could be seen at\r\nall hours of the day, on by-paths, in the villages, or again eating\r\nbread, sitting in the noon heat under the shadow of some solitary tree.\r\nAnd the country people began to call the beggar Old Judas.\r\n\r\nOne day he brought home in his sack two little live pigs, which a farmer\r\nhad given him after he had cured the farmer of some sickness.\r\n\r\nSoon he stopped begging, and devoted himself entirely to his pigs. He\r\ntook them out to feed by the lake, or under isolated oaks, or in the\r\nnear-by valleys. The woman, however, went about all day begging, but she\r\nalways came back to him in the evening.\r\n\r\nHe also did not go to church, and no one ever had seen him cross himself\r\nbefore the wayside crucifixes. All this gave rise to much gossip:\r\n\r\nOne night his companion was attacked by a fever and began to tremble\r\nlike a leaf in the wind. He went to the nearest town to get some\r\nmedicine, and then he shut himself up with her, and was not seen for six\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe priest, having heard that the \xe2\x80\x9cJewess\xe2\x80\x9d was about to die, came to\r\noffer the consolation of his religion and administer the last sacrament.\r\nWas she a Jewess? He did not know. But in any case, he wished to try to\r\nsave her soul.\r\n\r\nHardly had he knocked at the door when old Judas appeared on the\r\nthreshold, breathing hard, his eyes aflame, his long beard agitated,\r\nlike rippling water, and he hurled blasphemies in an unknown language,\r\nextending his skinny arms in order to prevent the priest from entering.\r\n\r\nThe priest attempted to speak, offered his purse and his aid, but the\r\nold man kept on abusing him, making gestures with his hands as if\r\nthrowing; stones at him.\r\n\r\nThen the priest retired, followed by the curses of the beggar.\r\n\r\nThe companion of old Judas died the following day. He buried her\r\nhimself, in front of her door. They were people of so little account\r\nthat no one took any interest in them.\r\n\r\nThen they saw the man take his pigs out again to the lake and up the\r\nhillsides. And he also began begging again to get food. But the people\r\ngave him hardly anything, as there was so much gossip about him. Every\r\none knew, moreover, how he had treated the priest.\r\n\r\nThen he disappeared. That was during Holy Week, but no one paid any\r\nattention to him.\r\n\r\nBut on Easter Sunday the boys and girls who had gone walking out to the\r\nlake heard a great noise in the hut. The door was locked; but the boys\r\nbroke it in, and the two pigs ran out, jumping like gnats. No one ever\r\nsaw them again.\r\n\r\nThe whole crowd went in; they saw some old rags on the floor, the\r\nbeggar's hat, some bones, clots of dried blood and bits of flesh in the\r\nhollows of the skull.\r\n\r\nHis pigs had devoured him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis happened on Good Friday, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph concluded his story,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthree hours after noon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt about that,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nI did not attempt to make him understand that it could easily happen\r\nthat the famished animals had eaten their master, after he had died\r\nsuddenly in his hut.\r\n\r\nAs for the cross on the wall, it had appeared one morning, and no one\r\nknew what hand traced it in that strange color.\r\n\r\nSince then no one doubted any longer that the Wandering Jew had died on\r\nthis spot.\r\n\r\nI myself believed it for one hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE CASK\r\n\r\nHe was a tall man of forty or thereabout, this Jules Chicot, the\r\ninnkeeper of Spreville, with a red face and a round stomach, and said by\r\nthose who knew him to be a smart business man. He stopped his buggy in\r\nfront of Mother Magloire's farmhouse, and, hitching the horse to the\r\ngatepost, went in at the gate.\r\n\r\nChicot owned some land adjoining that of the old woman, which he had\r\nbeen coveting for a long while, and had tried in vain to buy a score of\r\ntimes, but she had always obstinately refused to part with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was born here, and here I mean to die,\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said.\r\n\r\nHe found her peeling potatoes outside the farmhouse door. She was a\r\nwoman of about seventy-two, very thin, shriveled and wrinkled, almost\r\ndried up in fact and much bent but as active and untiring as a girl.\r\nChicot patted her on the back in a friendly fashion and then sat down by\r\nher on a stool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell mother, you are always pretty well and hearty, I am glad to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to complain of, considering, thank you. And how are you,\r\nMonsieur Chicot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pretty well, thank you, except a few rheumatic pains occasionally;\r\notherwise I have nothing to complain of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she said no more, while Chicot watched her going on with her work.\r\nHer crooked, knotted fingers, hard as a lobster's claws, seized the\r\ntubers, which were lying in a pail, as if they had been a pair of\r\npincers, and she peeled them rapidly, cutting off long strips of skin\r\nwith an old knife which she held in the other hand, throwing the\r\npotatoes into the water as they were done. Three daring fowls jumped one\r\nafter the other into her lap, seized a bit of peel and then ran away as\r\nfast as their legs would carry them with it in their beak.\r\n\r\nChicot seemed embarrassed, anxious, with something on the tip of his\r\ntongue which he could not say. At last he said hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Mother Magloire\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite sure that you do not want to sell your land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not; you may make up your mind to that. What I have said I\r\nhave said, so don't refer to it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; only I think I know of an arrangement that might suit us\r\nboth very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust this. You shall sell it to me and keep it all the same. You don't\r\nunderstand? Very well, then follow me in what I am going to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman left off peeling potatoes and looked at the innkeeper\r\nattentively from under her heavy eyebrows, and he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me explain myself. Every month I will give you a hundred and fifty\r\nfrancs. You understand me! suppose! Every month I will come and bring\r\nyou thirty crowns, and it will not make the slightest difference in your\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94not the very slightest. You will have your own home just as you\r\nhave now, need not trouble yourself about me, and will owe me nothing;\r\nall you will have to do will be to take my money. Will that arrangement\r\nsuit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her good-humoredly, one might almost have said\r\nbenevolently, and the old woman returned his looks distrustfully, as if\r\nshe suspected a trap, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems all right as far as I am concerned, but it will not give you\r\nthe farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may remain here as long as it\r\npleases God Almighty to let you live; it will be your home. Only you\r\nwill sign a deed before a lawyer making it over to me; after your death.\r\nYou have no children, only nephews and nieces for whom you don't care a\r\nstraw. Will that suit you? You will keep everything during your life,\r\nand I will give you the thirty crowns a month. It is pure gain as far as\r\nyou are concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman was surprised, rather uneasy, but, nevertheless, very much\r\ntempted to agree, and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't say that I will not agree to it, but I must think about it.\r\nCome back in a week, and we will talk it over again, and I will then\r\ngive you my definite answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Chicot went off as happy as a king who had conquered an empire.\r\n\r\nMother Magloire was thoughtful, and did not sleep at all that night; in\r\nfact, for four days she was in a fever of hesitation. She suspected that\r\nthere was something underneath the offer which was not to her advantage;\r\nbut then the thought of thirty crowns a month, of all those coins\r\nclinking in her apron, falling to her, as it were, from the skies,\r\nwithout her doing anything for it, aroused her covetousness.\r\n\r\nShe went to the notary and told him about it. He advised her to accept\r\nChicot's offer, but said she ought to ask for an annuity of fifty\r\ninstead of thirty, as her farm was worth sixty thousand francs at the\r\nlowest calculation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you live for fifteen years longer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ceven then he will only\r\nhave paid forty-five thousand francs for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman trembled with joy at this prospect of getting fifty crowns\r\na month, but she was still suspicious, fearing some trick, and she\r\nremained a long time with the lawyer asking questions without being able\r\nto make up her mind to go. At last she gave him instructions to draw up\r\nthe deed and returned home with her head in a whirl, just as if she had\r\ndrunk four jugs of new cider.\r\n\r\nWhen Chicot came again to receive her answer she declared, after a lot\r\nof persuading, that she could not make up her mind to agree to his\r\nproposal, though she was all the time trembling lest he should not\r\nconsent to give the fifty crowns, but at last, when he grew urgent, she\r\ntold him what she expected for her farm.\r\n\r\nHe looked surprised and disappointed and refused.\r\n\r\nThen, in order to convince him, she began to talk about the probable\r\nduration of her life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certainly not likely to live more than five or six years longer. I\r\nam nearly seventy-three, and far from strong, even considering my age.\r\nThe other evening I thought I was going to die, and could hardly manage\r\nto crawl into bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Chicot was not going to be taken in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, old lady, you are as strong as the church tower, and will\r\nlive till you are a hundred at least; you will no doubt see me put under\r\nground first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole day was spent in discussing the money, and as the old woman\r\nwould not give in, the innkeeper consented to give the fifty crowns, and\r\nshe insisted upon having ten crowns over and above to strike the\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nThree years passed and the old dame did not seem to have grown a day\r\nolder. Chicot was in despair, and it seemed to him as if he had been\r\npaying that annuity for fifty years, that he had been taken in, done,\r\nruined. From time to time he went to see the old lady, just as one goes\r\nin July to see when the harvest is likely to begin. She always met him\r\nwith a cunning look, and one might have supposed that she was\r\ncongratulating herself on the trick she had played him. Seeing how well\r\nand hearty she seemed he very soon got into his buggy again, growling to\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you never die, you old hag?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to do, and he felt inclined to strangle her when he\r\nsaw her. He hated her with a ferocious, cunning hatred, the hatred of a\r\npeasant who has been robbed, and began to cast about for some means of\r\ngetting rid of her.\r\n\r\nOne day he came to see her again, rubbing his hands as he did the first\r\ntime he proposed the bargain, and, after having chatted for a few\r\nminutes, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you never come and have a bit of dinner at my place when you are\r\nin Spreville? The people are talking about it, and saying we are not on\r\nfriendly terms, and that pains me. You know it will cost you nothing if\r\nyou come, for I don't look at the price of a dinner. Come whenever you\r\nfeel inclined; I shall be very glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Mother Magloire did not need to be asked twice, and the next day but\r\none, as she had to go to the town in any case, it being market day, she\r\nlet her man drive her to Chicot's place, where the buggy was put in the\r\nbarn while she went into the house to get her dinner.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper was delighted and treated her like a lady, giving her\r\nroast fowl, black pudding, leg of mutton and bacon and cabbage. But she\r\nate next to nothing. She had always been a small eater, and had\r\ngenerally lived on a little soup and a crust of bread and butter.\r\n\r\nChicot was disappointed and pressed her to eat more, but she refused,\r\nand she would drink little, and declined coffee, so he asked her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you will take a little drop of brandy or liqueur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as to that, I don't know that I will refuse.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereupon he\r\nshouted out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosalie, bring the superfine brandy\xe2\x80\x94the special\xe2\x80\x94you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant appeared, carrying a long bottle ornamented with a paper\r\nvine-leaf, and he filled two liqueur glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust try that; you will find it first rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good woman drank it slowly in sips, so as to make the pleasure last\r\nall the longer, and when she had finished her glass, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is first rate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost before she had said it Chicot had poured her out another\r\nglassful. She wished to refuse, but it was too late, and she drank it\r\nvery slowly, as she had done the first, and he asked her to have a\r\nthird. She objected, but he persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as mild as milk, you know; I can drink ten or a dozen glasses\r\nwithout any ill effects; it goes down like sugar and does not go to the\r\nhead; one would think that it evaporated on the tongue: It is the most\r\nwholesome thing you can drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it, for she really enjoyed it, but she left half the glass.\r\n\r\nThen Chicot, in an excess of generosity, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, as it is so much to your taste, I will give you a small keg\r\nof it, just to show that you and I are still excellent friends.\xe2\x80\x9d So she\r\ntook one away with her, feeling slightly overcome by the effects of what\r\nshe had drunk.\r\n\r\nThe next day the innkeeper drove into her yard and took a little iron-\r\nhooped keg out of his gig. He insisted on her tasting the contents, to\r\nmake sure it was the same delicious article, and, when they had each of\r\nthem drunk three more glasses, he said as he was going away:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know when it is all gone there is more left; don't be modest,\r\nfor I shall not mind. The sooner it is finished the better pleased I\r\nshall be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFour days later he came again. The old woman was outside her door\r\ncutting up the bread for her soup.\r\n\r\nHe went up to her and put his face close to hers, so that he might smell\r\nher breath; and when he smelt the alcohol he felt pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you will give me a glass of the Special?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And they\r\nhad three glasses each.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, it began to be whispered abroad that Mother Magloire was\r\nin the habit of getting drunk all by herself. She was picked up in her\r\nkitchen, then in her yard, then in the roads in the neighborhood, and\r\nshe was often brought home like a log.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper did not go near her any more, and, when people spoke to\r\nhim about her, he used to say, putting on a distressed look:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great pity that she should have taken to drink at her age, but\r\nwhen people get old there is no remedy. It will be the death of her in\r\nthe long run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it certainly was the death of her. She died the next winter. About\r\nChristmas time she fell down, unconscious, in the snow, and was found\r\ndead the next morning.\r\n\r\nAnd when Chicot came in for the farm, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very stupid of her; if she had not taken to drink she would\r\nprobably have lived ten years longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOITELLE\r\n\r\nFather Boitelle (Antoine) made a specialty of undertaking dirty jobs all\r\nthrough the countryside. Whenever there was a ditch or a cesspool to be\r\ncleaned out, a dunghill removed, a sewer cleansed, or any dirt hole\r\nwhatever, he way always employed to do it.\r\n\r\nHe would come with the instruments of his trade, his sabots covered with\r\ndirt, and set to work, complaining incessantly about his occupation.\r\nWhen people asked him then why he did this loathsome work, he would\r\nreply resignedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, 'tis for my children, whom I must support. This brings me in\r\nmore than anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had, indeed, fourteen children. If any one asked him what had become\r\nof them, he would say with an air of indifference:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are only eight of them left in the house. One is out at service\r\nand five are married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the questioner wanted to know whether they were well married, he\r\nreplied vivaciously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not oppose them. I opposed them in nothing. They married just as\r\nthey pleased. We shouldn't go against people's likings, it turns out\r\nbadly. I am a night scavenger because my parents went against my\r\nlikings. But for that I would have become a workman like the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere is the way his parents had thwarted him in his likings:\r\n\r\nHe was at the time a soldier stationed at Havre, not more stupid than\r\nanother, or sharper either, a rather simple fellow, however. When he was\r\nnot on duty, his greatest pleasure was to walk along the quay, where the\r\nbird dealers congregate. Sometimes alone, sometimes with a soldier from\r\nhis own part of the country, he would slowly saunter along by cages\r\ncontaining parrots with green backs and yellow heads from the banks of\r\nthe Amazon, or parrots with gray backs and red heads from Senegal, or\r\nenormous macaws, which look like birds reared in hot-houses, with their\r\nflower-like feathers, their plumes and their tufts. Parrots of every\r\nsize, who seem painted with minute care by the miniaturist, God\r\nAlmighty, and the little birds, all the smaller birds hopped about,\r\nyellow, blue and variegated, mingling their cries with the noise of the\r\nquay; and adding to the din caused by unloading the vessels, as well as\r\nby passengers and vehicles, a violent clamor, loud, shrill and\r\ndeafening, as if from some distant forest of monsters.\r\n\r\nBoitelle would pause, with wondering eyes, wide-open mouth, laughing and\r\nenraptured, showing his teeth to the captive cockatoos, who kept nodding\r\ntheir white or yellow topknots toward the glaring red of his breeches\r\nand the copper buckle of his belt. When he found a bird that could talk\r\nhe put questions to it, and if it happened at the time to be disposed to\r\nreply and to hold a conversation with him he would carry away enough\r\namusement to last him till evening. He also found heaps of amusement in\r\nlooking at the monkeys, and could conceive no greater luxury for a rich\r\nman than to own these animals as one owns cats and dogs. This kind of\r\ntaste for the exotic he had in his blood, as people have a taste for the\r\nchase, or for medicine, or for the priesthood. He could not help\r\nreturning to the quay every time the gates of the barracks opened, drawn\r\ntoward it by an irresistible longing.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, having stopped almost in ecstasy before an enormous\r\nmacaw, which was swelling out its plumes, bending forward and bridling\r\nup again as if making the court curtseys of parrot-land, he saw the door\r\nof a little cafe adjoining the bird dealer's shop open, and a young\r\nnegress appeared, wearing on her head a red silk handkerchief. She was\r\nsweeping into the street the corks and sand of the establishment.\r\n\r\nBoitelle's attention was soon divided between the bird and the woman,\r\nand he really could not tell which of these two beings he contemplated\r\nwith the greater astonishment and delight.\r\n\r\nThe negress, having swept the rubbish into the street, raised her eyes,\r\nand, in her turn, was dazzled by the soldier's uniform. There she stood\r\nfacing him with her broom in her hands as if she were bringing him a\r\nrifle, while the macaw continued bowing. But at the end of a few seconds\r\nthe soldier began to feel embarrassed at this attention, and he walked\r\naway quietly so as not to look as if he were beating a retreat.\r\n\r\nBut he came back. Almost every day he passed before the Cafe des\r\nColonies, and often he could distinguish through the window the figure\r\nof the little black-skinned maid serving \xe2\x80\x9cbocks\xe2\x80\x9d or glasses of brandy to\r\nthe sailors of the port. Frequently, too, she would come out to the door\r\non seeing him; soon, without even having exchanged a word, they smiled\r\nat one another like acquaintances; and Boitelle felt his heart touched\r\nwhen he suddenly saw, glittering between the dark lips of the girl, a\r\nshining row of white teeth. At length, one day he ventured to enter, and\r\nwas quite surprised to find that she could speak French like every one\r\nelse. The bottle of lemonade, of which she was good enough to accept a\r\nglassful, remained in the soldier's recollection memorably delicious,\r\nand it became a custom with him to come and absorb in this little tavern\r\non the quay all the agreeable drinks which he could afford.\r\n\r\nFor him it was a treat, a happiness, on which his thoughts dwelt\r\nconstantly, to watch the black hand of the little maid pouring something\r\ninto his glass while her teeth laughed more than her eyes. At the end of\r\ntwo months they became fast friends, and Boitelle, after his first\r\nastonishment at discovering that this negress had as good principles as\r\nhonest French girls, that she exhibited a regard for economy, industry,\r\nreligion and good conduct, loved her more on that account, and was so\r\ncharmed with her that he wanted to marry her.\r\n\r\nHe told her his intentions, which made her dance with joy. She had also\r\na little money, left her by a female oyster dealer, who had picked her\r\nup when she had been left on the quay at Havre by an American captain.\r\nThis captain had found her, when she was only about six years old, lying\r\non bales of cotton in the hold of his ship, some hours after his\r\ndeparture from New York. On his arrival in Havre he abandoned to the\r\ncare of this compassionate oyster dealer the little black creature, who\r\nhad been hidden on board his vessel, he knew not why or by whom.\r\n\r\nThe oyster woman having died, the young negress became a servant at the\r\nColonial Tavern.\r\n\r\nAntoine Boitelle added: \xe2\x80\x9cThis will be all right if my parents don't\r\noppose it. I will never go against them, you understand, never! I'm\r\ngoing to say a word or two to them the first time I go back to the\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the following week, in fact, having obtained twenty-four hours'\r\nleave, he went to see his family, who cultivated a little farm at\r\nTourteville, near Yvetot.\r\n\r\nHe waited till the meal was finished, the hour when the coffee baptized\r\nwith brandy makes people more open-hearted, before informing his parents\r\nthat he had found a girl who satisfied his tastes, all his tastes, so\r\ncompletely that there could not exist any other in all the world so\r\nperfectly suited to him.\r\n\r\nThe old people, on hearing this, immediately assumed a cautious manner\r\nand wanted explanations. He had concealed nothing from them except the\r\ncolor of her skin.\r\n\r\nShe was a servant, without much means, but strong, thrifty, clean, well-\r\nconducted and sensible. All these things were better than money would be\r\nin the hands of a bad housewife. Moreover, she had a few sous, left her\r\nby a woman who had reared her, a good number of sous, almost a little\r\ndowry, fifteen hundred francs in the savings bank. The old people,\r\npersuaded by his talk, and relying also on their own judgment, were\r\ngradually weakening, when he came to the delicate point. Laughing in\r\nrather a constrained fashion, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's only one thing you may not like. She is not a white slip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not understand, and he had to explain at some length and very\r\ncautiously, to avoid shocking them, that she belonged to the dusky race\r\nof which they had only seen samples in pictures at Epinal. Then they\r\nbecame restless, perplexed, alarmed, as if he had proposed a union with\r\nthe devil.\r\n\r\nThe mother said: \xe2\x80\x9cBlack? How much of her is black? Is the whole of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Everywhere, just as you are white everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father interposed: \xe2\x80\x9cBlack? Is it as black as the pot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe son answered: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps a little less than that. She is black, but\r\nnot disgustingly black. The cure's cassock is black, but it is not\r\nuglier than a surplice which is white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father said: \xe2\x80\x9cAre there more black people besides her in her\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the son, with an air of conviction, exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the old man shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be unpleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the son:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't more disagreeable than anything else when you get accustomed\r\nto it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mother asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn't soil the underwear more than other skins, this black skin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more than your own, as it is her proper color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, after many other questions, it was agreed that the parents should\r\nsee this girl before coming; to any decision, and that the young fellow,\r\nwhose, term of military service would be over in a month, should bring\r\nher to the house in order that they might examine her and decide by\r\ntalking the matter over whether or not she was too dark to enter the\r\nBoitelle family.\r\n\r\nAntoine accordingly announced that on Sunday, the 22d of May, the day of\r\nhis discharge, he would start for Tourteville with his sweetheart.\r\n\r\nShe had put on, for this journey to the house of her lover's parents,\r\nher most beautiful and most gaudy clothes, in which yellow, red and blue\r\nwere the prevailing colors, so that she looked as if she were adorned\r\nfor a national festival.\r\n\r\nAt the terminus, as they were leaving Havre, people stared at her, and\r\nBoitelle was proud of giving his arm to a person who commanded so much\r\nattention. Then, in the third-class carriage, in which she took a seat\r\nby his side, she aroused so much astonishment among the country folks\r\nthat the people in the adjoining compartments stood up on their benches\r\nto look at her over the wooden partition which divides the compartments.\r\nA child, at sight of her, began to cry with terror, another concealed\r\nhis face in his mother's apron. Everything went off well, however, up to\r\ntheir arrival at their destination. But when the train slackened its\r\nrate of motion as they drew near Yvetot, Antoine felt ill at ease, as he\r\nwould have done at a review when; he did not know his drill practice.\r\nThen, as he; leaned his head out, he recognized in the distance: his\r\nfather, holding the bridle of the horse harnessed to a carryall, and his\r\nmother, who had come forward to the grating, behind which stood those\r\nwho were expecting friends.\r\n\r\nHe alighted first, gave his hand to his sweetheart, and holding himself\r\nerect, as if he were escorting a general, he went to meet his family.\r\n\r\nThe mother, on seeing this black lady in variegated costume in her son's\r\ncompany, remained so stupefied that she could not open her mouth; and\r\nthe father found it hard to hold the horse, which the engine or the\r\nnegress caused to rear continuously. But Antoine, suddenly filled with\r\nunmixed joy at seeing once more the old people, rushed forward with open\r\narms, embraced his mother, embraced his father, in spite of the nag's\r\nfright, and then turning toward his companion, at whom the passengers on\r\nthe platform stopped to stare with amazement, he proceeded to explain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere she is! I told you that, at first sight, she is not attractive;\r\nbut as soon as you know her, I can assure you there's not a better sort\r\nin the whole world. Say good-morning to her so that she may not feel\r\nbadly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon Mere Boitelle, almost frightened out of her wits, made a sort\r\nof curtsy, while the father took off his cap, murmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you good luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, without further delay, they climbed into the carryall, the two\r\nwomen at the back, on seats which made them jump up and down as the\r\nvehicle went jolting along the road, and the two men in front on the\r\nfront seat.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke. Antoine, ill at ease, whistled a barrack-room air; his\r\nfather whipped the nag; and his mother, from where she sat in the\r\ncorner, kept casting sly glances at the negress, whose forehead and\r\ncheekbones shone in the sunlight like well-polished shoes.\r\n\r\nWishing to break the ice, Antoine turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don't seem inclined to talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old woman.\r\n\r\nHe went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Tell us the little story about that hen of yours that laid eight\r\neggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a funny anecdote of long standing in the family. But, as his\r\nmother still remained silent, paralyzed by her emotion, he undertook\r\nhimself to tell the story, laughing as he did so at the memorable\r\nincident. The father, who knew it by heart brightened at the opening\r\nwords of the narrative; his wife soon followed his example; and the\r\nnegress herself, when he reached the drollest part of it, suddenly gave\r\nvent to a laugh, such a loud, rolling torrent of laughter that the\r\nhorse, becoming excited, broke into a gallop for a while.\r\n\r\nThis served to cement their acquaintance. They all began to chat.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely reached the house and had all alighted, when Antoine\r\nconducted his sweetheart to a room, so that she might take off her\r\ndress, to avoid staining it, as she was going to prepare a nice dish,\r\nintended to win the old people's affections through their stomachs. He\r\ndrew his parents outside the house, and, with beating heart, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you say now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father said nothing. The mother, less timid, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is too black. No, indeed, this is too much for me. It turns my\r\nblood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will get used to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Antoine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so, but not at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went into the house, where the good woman was somewhat affected at\r\nthe spectacle of the negress engaged in cooking. She at once proceeded\r\nto assist her, with petticoats tucked up, active in spite of her age.\r\n\r\nThe meal was an excellent one, very long, very enjoyable. When they were\r\ntaking a turn after dinner, Antoine took his father aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dad, what do you say about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant took care never to compromise himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no opinion about it. Ask your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Antoine went back to his mother, and, detaining her behind the rest,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mother, what do you think of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor lad, she is really too black. If she were only a little less\r\nblack, I would not go against you, but this is too much. One would think\r\nit was Satan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not press her, knowing how obstinate the old woman had always\r\nbeen, but he felt a tempest of disappointment sweeping over his heart.\r\nHe was turning over in his mind what he ought to do, what plan he could\r\ndevise, surprised, moreover, that she had not conquered them already as\r\nshe had captivated himself. And they, all four, walked along through the\r\nwheat fields, having gradually relapsed into silence. Whenever they\r\npassed a fence they saw a countryman sitting on the stile, and a group\r\nof brats climbed up to stare at them, and every one rushed out into the\r\nroad to see the \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d whore young Boitelle had brought home with him.\r\nAt a distance they noticed people scampering across the fields just as\r\nwhen the drum beats to draw public attention to some living phenomenon.\r\nPere and Mere Boitelle, alarmed at this curiosity, which was exhibited\r\neverywhere through the country at their approach, quickened their pace,\r\nwalking side by side, and leaving their son far behind. His dark\r\ncompanion asked what his parents thought of her.\r\n\r\nHe hesitatingly replied that they had not yet made up their minds.\r\n\r\nBut on the village green people rushed out of all the houses in a\r\nflutter of excitement; and, at the sight of the gathering crowd, old\r\nBoitelle took to his heels, and regained his abode, while Antoine;\r\nswelling with rage, his sweetheart on his arm, advanced majestically\r\nunder the staring eyes, which opened wide in amazement.\r\n\r\nHe understood that it was at an end, and there was no hope for him, that\r\nhe could not marry his negress. She also understood it; and as they drew\r\nnear the farmhouse they both began to weep. As soon as they had got back\r\nto the house, she once more took off her dress to aid the mother in the\r\nhousehold duties, and followed her everywhere, to the dairy, to the\r\nstable, to the hen house, taking on herself the hardest part of the\r\nwork, repeating always: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me do it, Madame Boitelle,\xe2\x80\x9d so that, when\r\nnight came on, the old woman, touched but inexorable, said to her son:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a good girl, all the same. It's a pity she is so black; but\r\nindeed she is too black. I could not get used to it. She must go back\r\nagain. She is too, too black!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd young Boitelle said to his sweetheart:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not consent. She thinks you are too black. You must go back\r\nagain. I will go with you to the train. No matter\xe2\x80\x94don't fret. I am going\r\nto talk to them after you have started.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then took her to the railway station, still cheering her with hope,\r\nand, when he had kissed her, he put her into the train, which he watched\r\nas it passed out of sight, his eyes swollen with tears.\r\n\r\nIn vain did he appeal to the old people. They would never give their\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had told this story, which was known all over the country,\r\nAntoine Boitelle would always add:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom that time forward I have had no heart for anything\xe2\x80\x94for anything at\r\nall. No trade suited me any longer, and so I became what I am\xe2\x80\x94a night\r\nscavenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeople would say to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you got married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I can't say that my wife didn't please me, seeing that I have\r\nfourteen children; but she is not the other one, oh, no\xe2\x80\x94certainly not!\r\nThe other one, mark you, my negress, she had only to give me one glance,\r\nand I felt as if I were in Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WIDOW\r\n\r\nThis story was told during the hunting season at the Chateau Baneville.\r\nThe autumn had been rainy and sad. The red leaves, instead of rustling\r\nunder the feet, were rotting under the heavy downfalls.\r\n\r\nThe forest was as damp as it could be. From it came an odor of must, of\r\nrain, of soaked grass and wet earth; and the sportsmen, their backs\r\nhunched under the downpour, mournful dogs, with tails between their legs\r\nand hairs sticking to their sides, and the young women, with their\r\nclothes drenched, returned every evening, tired in body and in mind.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, in the large drawing-room, everybody played lotto, without\r\nenjoyment, while the wind whistled madly around the house. Then they\r\ntried telling stories like those they read in books, but no one was able\r\nto invent anything amusing. The hunters told tales of wonderful shots\r\nand of the butchery of rabbits; and the women racked their brains for\r\nideas without revealing the imagination of Scheherezade. They were about\r\nto give up this diversion when a young woman, who was idly caressing the\r\nhand of an old maiden aunt, noticed a little ring made of blond hair,\r\nwhich she had often seen, without paying any attention to it.\r\n\r\nShe fingered it gently and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAuntie, what is this ring? It looks\r\nas if it were made from the hair of a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady blushed, grew pale, then answered in a trembling voice: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis sad, so sad that I never wish to speak of it. All the unhappiness of\r\nmy life comes from that. I was very young then, and the memory has\r\nremained so painful that I weep every time I think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately everybody wished to know the story, but the old lady refused\r\nto tell it. Finally, after they had coaxed her for a long time, she\r\nyielded. Here is the story:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have often heard me speak of the Santeze family, now extinct. I\r\nknew the last three male members of this family. They all died in the\r\nsame manner; this hair belongs to the last one. He was thirteen when he\r\nkilled himself for me. That seems strange to you, doesn't it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it was a strange family\xe2\x80\x94mad, if you will, but a charming madness,\r\nthe madness of love. From father to son, all had violent passions which\r\nfilled their whole being, which impelled them to do wild things, drove\r\nthem to frantic enthusiasm, even to crime. This was born in them, just\r\nas burning devotion is in certain souls. Trappers have not the same\r\nnature as minions of the drawing-room. There was a saying: 'As\r\npassionate as a Santeze.' This could be noticed by looking at them. They\r\nall had wavy hair, falling over their brows, curly beards and large eyes\r\nwhose glance pierced and moved one, though one could not say why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe grandfather of the owner of this hair, of whom it is the last\r\nsouvenir, after many adventures, duels and elopements, at about sixty-\r\nfive fell madly in love with his farmer's daughter. I knew them both.\r\nShe was blond, pale, distinguished-looking, with a slow manner of\r\ntalking, a quiet voice and a look so gentle that one might have taken\r\nher for a Madonna. The old nobleman took her to his home and was soon so\r\ncaptivated with her that he could not live without her for a minute. His\r\ndaughter and daughter-in-law, who lived in the chateau, found this\r\nperfectly natural, love was such a tradition in the family. Nothing in\r\nregard to a passion surprised them, and if one spoke before them of\r\nparted lovers, even of vengeance after treachery, both said in the same\r\nsad tone: 'Oh, how he must have suffered to come to that point!' That\r\nwas all. They grew sad over tragedies of love, but never indignant, even\r\nwhen they were criminal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, one day a young man named Monsieur de Gradelle, who had been\r\ninvited for the shooting, eloped with the young girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Santeze remained calm as if nothing had happened, but one\r\nmorning he was found hanging in the kennels, among his dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis son died in the same manner in a hotel in Paris during a journey\r\nwhich he made there in 1841, after being deceived by a singer from the\r\nopera.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe left a twelve-year-old child and a widow, my mother's sister. She\r\ncame to my father's house with the boy, while we were living at\r\nBertillon. I was then seventeen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea how wonderful and precocious this Santeze child was.\r\nOne might have thought that all the tenderness and exaltation of the\r\nwhole race had been stored up in this last one. He was always dreaming\r\nand walking about alone in a great alley of elms leading from the\r\nchateau to the forest. I watched from my window this sentimental boy,\r\nwho walked with thoughtful steps, his hands behind his back, his head\r\nbent, and at times stopping to raise his eyes as if he could see and\r\nunderstand things that were not comprehensible at his age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften, after dinner on clear evenings, he would say to me: 'Let us go\r\noutside and dream, cousin.' And we would go outside together in the\r\npark. He would stop quickly before a clearing where the white vapor of\r\nthe moon lights the woods, and he would press my hand, saying: 'Look!\r\nlook! but you don't understand me; I feel it. If you understood me, we\r\nshould be happy. One must love to know! I would laugh and then kiss this\r\nchild, who loved me madly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften, after dinner, he would sit on my mother's knees. 'Come, auntie,'\r\nhe would say, 'tell me some love-stories.' And my mother, as a joke,\r\nwould tell him all the old legends of the family, all the passionate\r\nadventures of his forefathers, for thousands of them were current, some\r\ntrue and some false. It was their reputation for love and gallantry\r\nwhich was the ruin of every one of these men; they gloried in it and\r\nthen thought that they had to live up to the renown of their house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little fellow became exalted by these tender or terrible stories,\r\nand at times he would clap his hands, crying: 'I, too, I, too, know how\r\nto love, better than all of them!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, he began to court me in a timid and tender manner, at which every\r\none laughed, it was, so amusing. Every morning I had some flowers picked\r\nby him, and every evening before going to his room he would kiss my hand\r\nand murmur: 'I love you!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was guilty, very guilty, and I grieved continually about it, and I\r\nhave been doing penance all my life; I have remained an old maid\xe2\x80\x94or,\r\nrather, I have lived as a widowed fiancee, his widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was amused at this childish tenderness, and I even encouraged him. I\r\nwas coquettish, as charming as with a man, alternately caressing and\r\nsevere. I maddened this child. It was a game for me and a joyous\r\ndiversion for his mother and mine. He was twelve! think of it! Who would\r\nhave taken this atom's passion seriously? I kissed him as often as he\r\nwished; I even wrote him little notes, which were read by our respective\r\nmothers; and he answered me by passionate letters, which I have kept.\r\nJudging himself as a man, he thought that our loving intimacy was\r\nsecret. We had forgotten that he was a Santeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis lasted for about a year. One evening in the park he fell at my\r\nfeet and, as he madly kissed the hem of my dress, he kept repeating: 'I\r\nlove you! I love you! I love you! If ever you deceive me, if ever you\r\nleave me for another, I'll do as my father did.' And he added in a\r\nhoarse voice, which gave me a shiver: 'You know what he did!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stood there astonished. He arose, and standing on the tips of his\r\ntoes in order to reach my ear, for I was taller than he, he pronounced\r\nmy first name: 'Genevieve!' in such a gentle, sweet, tender tone that I\r\ntrembled all over. I stammered: 'Let us return! let us return!' He said\r\nno more and followed me; but as we were going up the steps of the porch,\r\nhe stopped me, saying: 'You know, if ever you leave me, I'll kill\r\nmyself.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time I understood that I had gone too far, and I became quite\r\nreserved. One day, as he was reproaching me for this, I answered: 'You\r\nare now too old for jesting and too young for serious love. I'll wait.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that this would end the matter. In the autumn he was sent to\r\na boarding-school. When he returned the following summer I was engaged\r\nto be married. He understood immediately, and for a week he became so\r\npensive that I was quite anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the morning of the ninth day I saw a little paper under my door as I\r\ngot up. I seized it, opened it and read: 'You have deserted me and you\r\nknow what I said. It is death to which you have condemned me. As I do\r\nnot wish to be found by another than you, come to the park just where I\r\ntold you last year that I loved you and look in the air.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that I should go mad. I dressed as quickly as I could and ran\r\nwildly to the place that he had mentioned. His little cap was on the\r\nground in the mud. It had been raining all night. I raised my eyes and\r\nsaw something swinging among the leaves, for the wind was blowing a\r\ngale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know what I did after that. I must have screamed at first, then\r\nfainted and fallen, and finally have run to the chateau. The next thing\r\nthat I remember I was in bed, with my mother sitting beside me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that I had dreamed all this in a frightful nightmare. I\r\nstammered: 'And what of him, what of him, Gontran?' There was no answer.\r\nIt was true!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not dare see him again, but I asked for a lock of his blond hair.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x94here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the old maid stretched out her trembling hand in a despairing\r\ngesture. Then she blew her nose several times, wiped her eyes and\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI broke off my marriage\xe2\x80\x94without saying why. And I\xe2\x80\x94I always have\r\nremained the\xe2\x80\x94the widow of this thirteen-year-old boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Then her head\r\nfell on her breast and she wept for a long time.\r\n\r\nAs the guests were retiring for the night a large man, whose quiet she\r\nhad disturbed, whispered in his neighbor's ear: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn't it unfortunate\r\nto, be so sentimental?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISHMAN OF ETRETAT\r\n\r\nA great English poet has just crossed over to France in order to greet\r\nVictor Hugo. All the newspapers are full of his name and he is the great\r\ntopic of conversation in all drawing-rooms. Fifteen years ago I had\r\noccasion several times to meet Algernon Charles Swinburne. I will\r\nattempt to show him just as I saw him and to give an idea of the strange\r\nimpression he made on me, which will remain with me throughout time.\r\n\r\nI believe it was in 1867 or in 1868 that an unknown young Englishman\r\ncame to Etretat and bought a little hut hidden under great trees. It was\r\nsaid that he lived there, always alone, in a strange manner; and he\r\naroused the inimical surprise of the natives, for the inhabitants were\r\nsullen and foolishly malicious, as they always are in little towns.\r\n\r\nThey declared that this whimsical Englishman ate nothing but boiled,\r\nroasted or stewed monkey; that he would see no one; that he talked to\r\nhimself hours at a time and many other surprising things that made\r\npeople think that he was different from other men. They were surprised\r\nthat he should live alone with a monkey. Had it been a cat or a dog they\r\nwould have said nothing. But a monkey! Was that not frightful? What\r\nsavage tastes the man must have!\r\n\r\nI knew this young man only from seeing him in the streets. He was short,\r\nplump, without being fat, mild-looking, and he wore a little blond\r\nmustache, which was almost invisible.\r\n\r\nChance brought us together. This savage had amiable and pleasing\r\nmanners, but he was one of those strange Englishmen that one meets here\r\nand there throughout the world.\r\n\r\nEndowed with remarkable intelligence, he seemed to live in a fantastic\r\ndream, as Edgar Poe must have lived. He had translated into English a\r\nvolume of strange Icelandic legends, which I ardently desired to see\r\ntranslated into French. He loved the supernatural, the dismal and\r\ngrewsome, but he spoke of the most marvellous things with a calmness\r\nthat was typically English, to which his gentle and quiet voice gave a\r\nsemblance of reality that was maddening.\r\n\r\nFull of a haughty disdain for the world, with its conventions,\r\nprejudices and code of morality, he had nailed to his house a name that\r\nwas boldly impudent. The keeper of a lonely inn who should write on his\r\ndoor: \xe2\x80\x9cTravellers murdered here!\xe2\x80\x9d could not make a more sinister jest. I\r\nnever had entered his dwelling, when one day I received an invitation to\r\nluncheon, following an accident that had occurred to one of his friends,\r\nwho had been almost drowned and whom I had attempted to rescue.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was unable to reach the man until he had already been\r\nrescued, I received the hearty thanks of the two Englishmen, and the\r\nfollowing day I called upon them.\r\n\r\nThe friend was a man about thirty years old. He bore an enormous head on\r\na child's body\xe2\x80\x94a body without chest or shoulders. An immense forehead,\r\nwhich seemed to have engulfed the rest of the man, expanded like a dome\r\nabove a thin face which ended in a little pointed beard. Two sharp eyes\r\nand a peculiar mouth gave one the impression of the head of a reptile,\r\nwhile the magnificent brow suggested a genius.\r\n\r\nA nervous twitching shook this peculiar being, who walked, moved, acted\r\nby jerks like a broken spring.\r\n\r\nThis was Algernon Charles Swinburne, son of an English admiral and\r\ngrandson, on the maternal side, of the Earl of Ashburnham.\r\n\r\nHe strange countenance was transfigured when he spoke. I have seldom\r\nseen a man more impressive, more eloquent, incisive or charming in\r\nconversation. His rapid, clear, piercing and fantastic imagination\r\nseemed to creep into his voice and to lend life to his words. His\r\nbrusque gestures enlivened his speech, which penetrated one like a\r\ndagger, and he had bursts of thought, just as lighthouses throw out\r\nflashes of fire, great, genial lights that seemed to illuminate a whole\r\nworld of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe home of the two friends was pretty and by no means commonplace.\r\nEverywhere were paintings, some superb, some strange, representing\r\ndifferent conceptions of insanity. Unless I am mistaken, there was a\r\nwater-color which represented the head of a dead man floating in a rose-\r\ncolored shell on a boundless ocean, under a moon with a human face.\r\n\r\nHere and there I came across bones. I clearly remember a flayed hand on\r\nwhich was hanging some dried skin and black muscles, and on the snow-\r\nwhite bones could be seen the traces of dried blood.\r\n\r\nThe food was a riddle which I could not solve. Was it good? Was it bad?\r\nI could not say. Some roast monkey took away all desire to make a steady\r\ndiet of this animal, and the great monkey who roamed about among us at\r\nlarge and playfully pushed his head into my glass when I wished to drink\r\ncured me of any desire I might have to take one of his brothers as a\r\ncompanion for the rest of my days.\r\n\r\nAs for the two men, they gave me the impression of two strange,\r\noriginal, remarkable minds, belonging to that peculiar race of talented\r\nmadmen from among whom have arisen Poe, Hoffmann and many others.\r\n\r\nIf genius is, as is commonly believed, a sort of aberration of great\r\nminds, then Algernon Charles Swinburne is undoubtedly a genius.\r\n\r\nGreat minds that are healthy are never considered geniuses, while this\r\nsublime qualification is lavished on brains that are often inferior but\r\nare slightly touched by madness.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this poet remains one of the first of his time, through his\r\noriginality and polished form. He is an exalted lyrical singer who\r\nseldom bothers about the good and humble truth, which French poets are\r\nnow seeking so persistently and patiently. He strives to set down\r\ndreams, subtle thoughts, sometimes great, sometimes visibly forced, but\r\nsometimes magnificent.\r\n\r\nTwo years later I found the house closed and its tenants gone. The\r\nfurniture was being sold. In memory of them I bought the hideous flayed\r\nhand. On the grass an enormous square block of granite bore this simple\r\nword: \xe2\x80\x9cNip.\xe2\x80\x9d Above this a hollow stone offered water to the birds. It\r\nwas the grave of the monkey, who had been hanged by a young, vindictive\r\nnegro servant. It was said that this violent domestic had been forced to\r\nflee at the point of his exasperated master's revolver. After wandering\r\nabout without home or food for several days, he returned and began to\r\npeddle barley-sugar in the streets. He was expelled from the country\r\nafter he had almost strangled a displeased customer.\r\n\r\nThe world would be gayer if one could often meet homes like that.\r\n\r\nThis story appeared in the \xe2\x80\x9cGaulois,\xe2\x80\x9d November 29, 1882. It was the\r\noriginal sketch for the introductory study of Swinburne, written by\r\nMaupassant for the French translation by Gabriel Mourey of \xe2\x80\x9cPoems and\r\nBallads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM\r\n\r\nIt was a men's dinner party, and they were sitting over their cigars and\r\nbrandy and discussing magnetism. Donato's tricks and Charcot's\r\nexperiments. Presently, the sceptical, easy-going men, who cared nothing\r\nfor religion of any sort, began telling stories of strange occurrences,\r\nincredible things which, nevertheless, had really occurred, so they\r\nsaid, falling back into superstitious beliefs, clinging to these last\r\nremnants of the marvellous, becoming devotees of this mystery of\r\nmagnetism, defending it in the name of science. There was only one\r\nperson who smiled, a vigorous young fellow, a great ladies' man who was\r\nso incredulous that he would not even enter upon a discussion of such\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nHe repeated with a sneer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumbug! humbug! humbug! We need not discuss Donato, who is merely a\r\nvery smart juggler. As for M. Charcot, who is said to be a remarkable\r\nman of science, he produces on me the effect of those story-tellers of\r\nthe school of Edgar Poe, who end by going mad through constantly\r\nreflecting on queer cases of insanity. He has authenticated some cases\r\nof unexplained and inexplicable nervous phenomena; he makes his way into\r\nthat unknown region which men are exploring every day, and unable always\r\nto understand what he sees, he recalls, perhaps, the ecclesiastical\r\ninterpretation of these mysteries. I should like to hear what he says\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words of the unbeliever were listened to with a kind of pity, as if\r\nhe had blasphemed in an assembly of monks.\r\n\r\nOne of these gentlemen exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet miracles were performed in olden times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy cannot they be performed now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, each mentioned some fact, some fantastic presentiment some\r\ninstance of souls communicating with each other across space, or some\r\ncase of the secret influence of one being over another. They asserted\r\nand maintained that these things had actually occurred, while the\r\nsceptic angrily repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumbug! humbug! humbug!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last he rose, threw away his cigar, and with his hands in his\r\npockets, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I also have two stories to tell you, which I will\r\nafterwards explain. Here they are:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the little village of Etretat, the men, who are all seafaring folk,\r\ngo every year to Newfoundland to fish for cod. One night the little son\r\nof one of these fishermen woke up with a start, crying out that his\r\nfather was dead. The child was quieted, and again he woke up exclaiming\r\nthat his father was drowned. A month later the news came that his father\r\nhad, in fact, been swept off the deck of his smack by a billow. The\r\nwidow then remembered how her son had woke up and spoken of his father's\r\ndeath. Everyone said it was a miracle, and the affair caused a great\r\nsensation. The dates were compared, and it was found that the accident\r\nand the dream were almost coincident, whence they concluded that they\r\nhad happened on the same night and at the same hour. And there is a\r\nmystery of magnetism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe story-teller stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\nThereupon, one of those who had heard him, much affected by the\r\nnarrative, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can you explain this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, monsieur. I have discovered the secret. The circumstance\r\nsurprised me and even perplexed me very much; but you see, I do not\r\nbelieve on principle. Just as others begin by believing, I begin by\r\ndoubting; and when I cannot understand, I continue to deny that there\r\ncan be any telepathic communication between souls; certain that my own\r\nintelligence will be able to explain it. Well, I kept on inquiring into\r\nthe matter, and by dint of questioning all the wives of the absent\r\nseamen, I was convinced that not a week passed without one of them, or\r\none of their children dreaming and declaring when they woke up that the\r\nfather was drowned. The horrible and continual fear of this accident\r\nmakes them always talk about it. Now, if one of these frequent\r\npredictions coincides, by a very simple chance, with the death of the\r\nperson referred to, people at once declare it to be a miracle; for they\r\nsuddenly lose sight of all the other predictions of misfortune that have\r\nremained unfulfilled. I have myself known fifty cases where the persons\r\nwho made the prediction forgot all about it a week afterwards. But, if,\r\nthen one happens to die, then the recollection of the thing is\r\nimmediately revived, and people are ready to believe in the intervention\r\nof God, according to some, and magnetism, according to others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the smokers remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say is right enough; but what about your second story?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my second story is a very delicate matter to relate. It happened to\r\nmyself, and so I don't place any great value on my own view of the\r\nmatter. An interested party can never give an impartial opinion.\r\nHowever, here it is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong my acquaintances was a young woman on whom I had never bestowed a\r\nthought, whom I had never even looked at attentively, never taken any\r\nnotice of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI classed her among the women of no importance, though she was not bad-\r\nlooking; she appeared, in fact, to possess eyes, a nose, a mouth, some\r\nsort of hair\xe2\x80\x94just a colorless type of countenance. She was one of those\r\nbeings who awaken only a chance, passing thought, but no special\r\ninterest, no desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one night, as I was writing some letters by my fireside before\r\ngoing to bed, I was conscious, in the midst of that train of sensuous\r\nvisions that sometimes pass through one's brain in moments of idle\r\nreverie, of a kind of slight influence, passing over me, a little\r\nflutter of the heart, and immediately, without any cause, without any\r\nlogical connection of thought, I saw distinctly, as if I were touching\r\nher, saw from head to foot, and disrobed, this young woman to whom I had\r\nnever given more than three seconds' thought at a time. I suddenly\r\ndiscovered in her a number of qualities which I had never before\r\nobserved, a sweet charm, a languorous fascination; she awakened in me\r\nthat sort of restless emotion that causes one to pursue a woman. But I\r\ndid not think of her long. I went to bed and was soon asleep. And I\r\ndreamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have all had these strange dreams which make you overcome the\r\nimpossible, which open to you double-locked doors, unexpected joys,\r\ntightly folded arms?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of us in these troubled, excising, breathless slumbers, has not\r\nheld, clasped, embraced with rapture, the woman who occupied his\r\nthoughts? And have you ever noticed what superhuman delight these happy\r\ndreams give us? Into what mad intoxication they cast you! with what\r\npassionate spasms they shake you! and with what infinite, caressing,\r\npenetrating tenderness they fill your heart for her whom you hold\r\nclasped in your arms in that adorable illusion that is so like reality!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this I felt with unforgettable violence. This woman was mine, so\r\nmuch mine that the pleasant warmth of her skin remained in my fingers,\r\nthe odor of her skin, in my brain, the taste of her kisses, on my lips,\r\nthe sound of her voice lingered in my ears, the touch of her clasp still\r\nclung to me, and the burning charm of her tenderness still gratified my\r\nsenses long after the delight but disillusion of my awakening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd three times that night I had the same dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the day dawned she haunted me, possessed me, filled my senses to\r\nsuch an extent that I was not one second without thinking of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last, not knowing what to do, I dressed myself and went to call on\r\nher. As I went upstairs to her apartment, I was so overcome by emotion\r\nthat I trembled, and my heart beat rapidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entered the apartment. She rose the moment she heard my name\r\nmentioned; and suddenly our eyes met in a peculiar fixed gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat down. I stammered out some commonplaces which she seemed not to\r\nhear. I did not know what to say or do. Then, abruptly, clasping my arms\r\nround her, my dream was realized so suddenly that I began to doubt\r\nwhether I was really awake. We were friends after this for two years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat conclusion do you draw from it?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice.\r\n\r\nThe story-teller seemed to hesitate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe conclusion I draw from it\xe2\x80\x94well, by Jove, the conclusion is that it\r\nwas just a coincidence! And then\xe2\x80\x94who can tell? Perhaps it was some\r\nglance of hers which I had not noticed and which came back that night to\r\nme through one of those mysterious and unconscious \xe2\x80\x94recollections that\r\noften bring before us things ignored by our own consciousness,\r\nunperceived by our minds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall it whatever you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of his table companions, when the\r\nstory was finished; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you don't believe in magnetism after that,\r\nmy dear boy, you are an ungrateful fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FATHER'S CONFESSION\r\n\r\nAll Veziers-le-Rethel had followed the funeral procession of M. Badon-\r\nLeremince to the grave, and the last words of the funeral oration\r\npronounced by the delegate of the district remained in the minds of all:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was an honest man, at least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn honest man he had been in all the known acts of his life, in his\r\nwords, in his examples, his attitude, his behavior, his enterprises, in\r\nthe cut of his beard and the shape of his hats. He never had said a word\r\nthat did not set an example, never had given an alms without adding a\r\nword of advice, never had extended his hand without appearing to bestow\r\na benediction.\r\n\r\nHe left two children, a boy and a girl. His son was counselor general,\r\nand his daughter, having married a lawyer, M. Poirel de la Voulte, moved\r\nin the best society of Veziers.\r\n\r\nThey were inconsolable at the death of their father, for they loved him\r\nsincerely.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ceremony was over, the son, daughter and son-in-law\r\nreturned to the house of mourning, and, shutting themselves in the\r\nlibrary, they opened the will, the seals of which were to be broken by\r\nthem alone and only after the coffin had been placed in the ground. This\r\nwish was expressed by a notice on the envelope.\r\n\r\nM. Poirel de la Voulte tore open the envelope, in his character of a\r\nlawyer used to such operations, and having adjusted his spectacles, he\r\nread in a monotonous voice, made for reading the details of contracts:\r\n\r\nMy children, my dear children, I could not sleep the eternal sleep in\r\npeace if I did not make to you from the tomb a confession, the\r\nconfession of a crime, remorse for which has ruined my life. Yes, I\r\ncommitted a crime, a frightful, abominable crime.\r\n\r\nI was twenty-six years old, and I had just been called to the bar in\r\nParis, and was living the life off young men from the provinces who are\r\nstranded in this town without acquaintances, relatives, or friends.\r\n\r\nI took a sweetheart. There are beings who cannot live alone. I was one\r\nof those. Solitude fills me with horrible anguish, the solitude of my\r\nroom beside my fire in the evening. I feel then as if I were alone on\r\nearth, alone, but surrounded by vague dangers, unknown and terrible\r\nthings; and the partition that separates me from my neighbor, my\r\nneighbor whom I do not know, keeps me at as great a distance from him as\r\nthe stars that I see through my window. A sort of fever pervades me, a\r\nfever of impatience and of fear, and the silence of the walls terrifies\r\nme. The silence of a room where one lives alone is so intense and so\r\nmelancholy. It is not only a silence of the mind; when a piece of\r\nfurniture cracks a shudder goes through you for you expect no noise in\r\nthis melancholy abode.\r\n\r\nHow many times, nervous and timid from this motionless silence, I have\r\nbegun to talk, to repeat words without rhyme or reason, only to make\r\nsome sound. My voice at those times sounds so strange that I am afraid\r\nof that, too. Is there anything more dreadful than talking to one's self\r\nin an empty house? One's voice sounds like that of another, an unknown\r\nvoice talking aimlessly, to no one, into the empty air, with no ear to\r\nlisten to it, for one knows before they escape into the solitude of the\r\nroom exactly what words will be uttered. And when they resound\r\nlugubriously in the silence, they seem no more than an echo, the\r\npeculiar echo of words whispered by ones thought.\r\n\r\nMy sweetheart was a young girl like other young girls who live in Paris\r\non wages that are insufficient to keep them. She was gentle, good,\r\nsimple. Her parents lived at Poissy. She went to spend several days with\r\nthem from time to time.\r\n\r\nFor a year I lived quietly with her, fully decided to leave her when I\r\nshould find some one whom I liked well enough to marry. I would make a\r\nlittle provision for this one, for it is an understood thing in our\r\nsocial set that a woman's love should be paid for, in money if she is\r\npoor, in presents if she is rich.\r\n\r\nBut one day she told me she was enceinte. I was thunderstruck, and saw\r\nin a second that my life would be ruined. I saw the fetter that I should\r\nwear until my death, everywhere, in my future family life, in my old\r\nage, forever; the fetter of a woman bound to my life through a child;\r\nthe fetter of the child whom I must bring up, watch over, protect, while\r\nkeeping myself unknown to him, and keeping him hidden from the world.\r\n\r\nI was greatly disturbed at this news, and a confused longing, a criminal\r\ndesire, surged through my mind; I did not formulate it, but I felt it in\r\nmy heart, ready to come to the surface, as if some one hidden behind a\r\nportiere should await the signal to come out. If some accident might\r\nonly happen! So many of these little beings die before they are born!\r\n\r\nOh! I did not wish my sweetheart to die! The poor girl, I loved her very\r\nmuch! But I wished, possibly, that the child might die before I saw it.\r\n\r\nHe was born. I set up housekeeping in my little bachelor apartment, an\r\nimitation home, with a horrible child. He looked like all children; I\r\ndid not care for him. Fathers, you see, do not show affection until\r\nlater. They have not the instinctive and passionate tenderness of\r\nmothers; their affection has to be awakened gradually, their mind must\r\nbecome attached by bonds formed each day between beings that live in\r\neach other's society.\r\n\r\nA year passed. I now avoided my home, which was too small, where soiled\r\nlinen, baby-clothes and stockings the size of gloves were lying round,\r\nwhere a thousand articles of all descriptions lay on the furniture, on\r\nthe arm of an easy-chair, everywhere. I went out chiefly that I might\r\nnot hear the child cry, for he cried on the slightest pretext, when he\r\nwas bathed, when he was touched, when he was put to bed, when he was\r\ntaken up in the morning, incessantly.\r\n\r\nI had made a few acquaintances, and I met at a reception the woman who\r\nwas to be your mother. I fell in love with her and became desirous to\r\nmarry her. I courted her; I asked her parents' consent to our marriage\r\nand it was granted.\r\n\r\nI found myself in this dilemma: I must either marry this young girl whom\r\nI adored, having a child already, or else tell the truth and renounce\r\nher, and happiness, my future, everything; for her parents, who were\r\npeople of rigid principles, would not give her to me if they knew.\r\n\r\nI passed a month of horrible anguish, of mortal torture, a month haunted\r\nby a thousand frightful thoughts; and I felt developing in me a hatred\r\ntoward my son, toward that little morsel of living, screaming flesh, who\r\nblocked my path, interrupted my life, condemned me to an existence\r\nwithout hope, without all those vague expectations that make the charm\r\nof youth.\r\n\r\nBut just then my companion's mother became ill, and I was left alone\r\nwith the child.\r\n\r\nIt was in December, and the weather was terribly cold. What a night!\r\n\r\nMy companion had just left. I had dined alone in my little dining-room\r\nand I went gently into the room where the little one was asleep.\r\n\r\nI sat down in an armchair before the fire. The wind was blowing, making\r\nthe windows rattle, a dry, frosty wind; and I saw trough the window the\r\nstars shining with that piercing brightness that they have on frosty\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nThen the idea that had obsessed me for a month rose again to the\r\nsurface. As soon as I was quiet it came to me and harassed me. It ate\r\ninto my mind like a fixed idea, just as cancers must eat into the flesh.\r\nIt was there, in my head, in my heart, in my whole body, it seemed to\r\nme; and it swallowed me up as a wild beast might have. I endeavored to\r\ndrive it away, to repulse it, to open my mind to other thoughts, as one\r\nopens a window to the fresh morning breeze to drive out the vitiated\r\nair; but I could not drive it from my brain, not even for a second. I do\r\nnot know how to express this torture. It gnawed at my soul, and I felt a\r\nfrightful pain, a real physical and moral pain.\r\n\r\nMy life was ruined! How could I escape from this situation? How could I\r\ndraw back, and how could I confess?\r\n\r\nAnd I loved the one who was to become your mother with a mad passion,\r\nwhich this insurmountable obstacle only aggravated.\r\n\r\nA terrible rage was taking possession of me, choking me, a rage that\r\nverged on madness! Surely I was crazy that evening!\r\n\r\nThe child was sleeping. I got up and looked at it as it slept. It was\r\nhe, this abortion, this spawn, this nothing, that condemned me to\r\nirremediable unhappiness!\r\n\r\nHe was asleep, his mouth open, wrapped in his bed-clothes in a crib\r\nbeside my bed, where I could not sleep.\r\n\r\nHow did I ever do what I did? How do I know? What force urged me on?\r\nWhat malevolent power took possession of me? Oh! the temptation to crime\r\ncame to me without any forewarning. All I recall is that my heart beat\r\ntumultuously. It beat so hard that I could hear it, as one hears the\r\nstrokes of a hammer behind a partition. That is all I can recall\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nbeating of my heart! In my head there was a strange confusion, a tumult,\r\na senseless disorder, a lack of presence of mind. It was one of those\r\nhours of bewilderment and hallucination when a man is neither conscious\r\nof his actions nor able to guide his will.\r\n\r\nI gently raised the coverings from the body of the child; I turned them\r\ndown to the foot of the crib, and he lay there uncovered and naked.\r\n\r\nHe did not wake. Then I went toward the window, softly, quite softly,\r\nand I opened it.\r\n\r\nA breath of icy air glided in like an assassin; it was so cold that I\r\ndrew aside, and the two candles flickered. I remained standing near the\r\nwindow, not daring to turn round, as if for fear of seeing what was\r\ndoing on behind me, and feeling the icy air continually across my\r\nforehead, my cheeks, my hands, the deadly air which kept streaming in. I\r\nstood there a long time.\r\n\r\nI was not thinking, I was not reflecting. All at once a little cough\r\ncaused me to shudder frightfully from head to foot, a shudder that I\r\nfeel still to the roots of my hair. And with a frantic movement I\r\nabruptly closed both sides of the window and, turning round, ran over to\r\nthe crib.\r\n\r\nHe was still asleep, his mouth open, quite naked. I touched his legs;\r\nthey were icy cold and I covered them up.\r\n\r\nMy heart was suddenly touched, grieved, filled with pity, tenderness,\r\nlove for this poor innocent being that I had wished to kill. I kissed\r\nhis fine, soft hair long and tenderly; then I went and sat down before\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nI reflected with amazement with horror on what I had done, asking myself\r\nwhence come those tempests of the soul in which a man loses all\r\nperspective of things, all command over himself and acts as in a\r\ncondition of mad intoxication, not knowing whither he is going\xe2\x80\x94like a\r\nvessel in a hurricane.\r\n\r\nThe child coughed again, and it gave my heart a wrench. Suppose it\r\nshould die! O God! O God! What would become of me?\r\n\r\nI rose from my chair to go and look at him, and with a candle in my hand\r\nI leaned over him. Seeing him breathing quietly I felt reassured, when\r\nhe coughed a third time. It gave me such a shock tat I started backward,\r\njust as one does at sight of something horrible, and let my candle fall.\r\n\r\nAs I stood erect after picking it up, I noticed that my temples were\r\nbathed in perspiration, that cold sweat which is the result of anguish\r\nof soul. And I remained until daylight bending over my son, becoming\r\ncalm when he remained quiet for some time, and filled with atrocious\r\npain when a weak cough came from his mouth.\r\n\r\nHe awoke with his eyes red, his throat choked, and with an air of\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman came in to arrange my room I sent her at once for a\r\ndoctor. He came at the end of an hour, and said, after examining the\r\nchild:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he not catch cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to tremble like a person with palsy, and I faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? Is it serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI will come again this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came that evening. My son had remained almost all day in a condition\r\nof drowsiness, coughing from time to time. During the night inflammation\r\nof the lungs set in.\r\n\r\nThat lasted ten days. I cannot express what I suffered in those\r\ninterminable hours that divide morning from night, right from morning.\r\n\r\nHe died.\r\n\r\nAnd since\xe2\x80\x94since that moment, I have not passed one hour, not a single\r\nhour, without the frightful burning recollection, a gnawing\r\nrecollection, a memory that seems to wring my heart, awaking in me like\r\na savage beast imprisoned in the depth of my soul.\r\n\r\nOh! if I could have gone mad!\r\n\r\nM. Poirel de la Voulte raised his spectacles with a motion that was\r\npeculiar to him whenever he finished reading a contract; and the three\r\nheirs of the defunct looked at one another without speaking, pale and\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a minute the lawyer resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be destroyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other two bent their heads in sign of assent. He lighted a candle,\r\ncarefully separated the pages containing the damaging confession from\r\nthose relating to the disposition of money, then he held them over the\r\ncandle and threw them into the fireplace.\r\n\r\nAnd they watched the white sheets as they burned, till they were\r\npresently reduced to little crumbling black heaps. And as some words\r\nwere still visible in white tracing, the daughter, with little strokes\r\nof the toe of her shoe, crushed the burning paper, mixing it with the\r\nold ashes in the fireplace.\r\n\r\nThen all three stood there watching it for some time, as if they feared\r\nthat the destroyed secret might escape from the fireplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOTHER OF MONSTERS\r\n\r\nI recalled this horrible story, the events of which occurred long ago,\r\nand this horrible woman, the other day at a fashionable seaside resort,\r\nwhere I saw on the beach a well-known young, elegant and charming\r\nParisienne, adored and respected by everyone.\r\n\r\nI had been invited by a friend to pay him a visit in a little provincial\r\ntown. He took me about in all directions to do the honors of the place,\r\nshowed me noted scenes, chateaux, industries, ruins. He pointed out\r\nmonuments, churches, old carved doorways, enormous or distorted trees,\r\nthe oak of St. Andrew, and the yew tree of Roqueboise.\r\n\r\nWhen I had exhausted my admiration and enthusiasm over all the sights,\r\nmy friend said with a distressed expression on his face, that there was\r\nnothing left to look at. I breathed freely. I would now be able to rest\r\nunder the shade of the trees. But, all at once, he uttered an\r\nexclamation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! We have the 'Mother of Monsters'; I must take you to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that, the 'Mother of Monsters'?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is an abominable woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9ca regular demon, a being who\r\nvoluntarily brings into the world deformed, hideous, frightful children,\r\nmonstrosities, in fact, and then sells them to showmen who exhibit such\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese exploiters of freaks come from time to time to find out if she\r\nhas any fresh monstrosity, and if it meets with their approval they\r\ncarry it away with them, paying the mother a compensation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has eleven of this description. She is rich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I am joking, romancing, exaggerating. No, my friend; I am\r\ntelling you the truth, the exact truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and see this woman. Then I will tell you her history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took me into one of the suburbs. The woman lived in a pretty little\r\nhouse by the side of the road. It was attractive and well kept. The\r\ngarden was filled with fragrant flowers. One might have supposed it to\r\nbe the residence of a retired lawyer.\r\n\r\nA maid ushered us into a sort of little country parlor, and the wretch\r\nappeared. She was about forty. She was a tall, big woman with hard\r\nfeatures, but well formed, vigorous and healthy, the true type of a\r\nrobust peasant woman, half animal, and half woman.\r\n\r\nShe was aware of her reputation and received everyone with a humility\r\nthat smacked of hatred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do the gentlemen wish?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey tell me that your last child is just like an ordinary child, that\r\nhe does not resemble his brothers at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted\r\nto be sure of that. Is it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe cast on us a malicious and furious look as she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, oh, no, my poor sir! He is perhaps even uglier than the rest. I\r\nhave no luck, no luck!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all like that, it is heartbreaking! How can the good God be so\r\nhard on a poor woman who is all alone in the world, how can He?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nspoke hurriedly, her eyes cast down, with a deprecating air as of a wild\r\nbeast who is afraid. Her harsh voice became soft, and it seemed strange\r\nto hear those tearful falsetto tones issuing from that big, bony frame,\r\nof unusual strength and with coarse outlines, which seemed fitted for\r\nviolent action, and made to utter howls like a wolf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should like to see your little one,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend.\r\n\r\nI fancied she colored up. I may have been deceived. After a few moments\r\nof silence, she said in a louder tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good will that do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not wish to show it to us?\xe2\x80\x9d replied my friend. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\nmany people to whom you will show it; you know whom I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a start, and resuming her natural voice, and giving free play\r\nto her anger, she screamed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that why you came here? To insult me? Because my children are like\r\nanimals, tell me? You shall not see him, no, no, you shall not see him!\r\nGo away, go away! I do not know why you all try to torment me like\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked over toward us, her hands on her hips. At the brutal tone of\r\nher voice, a sort of moaning, or rather a mewing, the lamentable cry of\r\nan idiot, came from the adjoining room. I shivered to the marrow of my\r\nbones. We retreated before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Devil\xe2\x80\x9d (they called her the Devil); said my friend, \xe2\x80\x9ctake\r\ncare; some day you will get yourself into trouble through this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to tremble, beside herself with fury, shaking her fist and\r\nroaring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe off with you! What will get me into trouble? Be off with you,\r\nmiscreants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was about to attack us, but we fled, saddened at what we had seen.\r\nWhen we got outside, my friend said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have seen her, what do you think of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the story of this brute,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what he told me as we walked along the white high road, with\r\nripe crops on either side of it which rippled like the sea in the light\r\nbreeze that passed over them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman was once a servant on a farm. She was an honest girl, steady\r\nand economical. She was never known to have an admirer, and never\r\nsuspected of any frailty. But she went astray, as so many do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe soon found herself in trouble, and was tortured with fear and\r\nshame. Wishing to conceal her misfortune, she bound her body tightly\r\nwith a corset of her own invention, made of boards and cord. The more\r\nshe developed, the more she bound herself with this instrument of\r\ntorture, suffering martyrdom, but brave in her sorrow, not allowing\r\nanyone to see, or suspect, anything. She maimed the little unborn being,\r\ncramping it with that frightful corset, and made a monster of it. Its\r\nhead was squeezed and elongated to a point, and its large eyes seemed\r\npopping out of its head. Its limbs, exaggeratedly long, and twisted like\r\nthe stalk of a vine, terminated in fingers like the claws of a spider.\r\nIts trunk was tiny, and round as a nut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child was born in an open field, and when the weeders saw it, they\r\nfled away, screaming, and the report spread that she had given birth to\r\na demon. From that time on, she was called 'the Devil.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was driven from the farm, and lived on charity, under a cloud. She\r\nbrought up the monster, whom she hated with a savage hatred, and would\r\nhave strangled, perhaps, if the priest had not threatened her with\r\narrest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day some travelling showmen heard about the frightful creature, and\r\nasked to see it, so that if it pleased them they might take it away.\r\nThey were pleased, and counted out five hundred francs to the mother. At\r\nfirst, she had refused to let them see the little animal, as she was\r\nashamed; but when she discovered it had a money value, and that these\r\npeople were anxious to get it, she began to haggle with them, raising\r\nher price with all a peasant's persistence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe made them draw up a paper, in which they promised to pay her four\r\nhundred francs a year besides, as though they had taken this deformity\r\ninto their employ.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIncited by the greed of gain, she continued to produce these phenomena,\r\nso as to have an assured income like a bourgeoise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them were long, some short, some like crabs-all bodies-others\r\nlike lizards. Several died, and she was heartbroken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law tried to interfere, but as they had no proof they let her\r\ncontinue to produce her freaks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has at this moment eleven alive, and they bring in, on an average,\r\ncounting good and bad years, from five to six thousand francs a year.\r\nOne, alone, is not placed, the one she was unwilling to show us. But she\r\nwill not keep it long, for she is known to all the showmen in the world,\r\nwho come from time to time to see if she has anything new.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe even gets bids from them when the monster is valuable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friend was silent. A profound disgust stirred my heart, and a feeling\r\nof rage, of regret, to think that I had not strangled this brute when I\r\nhad the opportunity.\r\n\r\nI had forgotten this story, when I saw on the beach of a fashionable\r\nresort the other day, an elegant, charming, dainty woman, surrounded by\r\nmen who paid her respect as well as admiration.\r\n\r\nI was walking along the beach, arm in arm with a friend, the resident\r\nphysician. Ten minutes later, I saw a nursemaid with three children, who\r\nwere rolling in the sand. A pair of little crutches lay on the ground,\r\nand touched my sympathy. I then noticed that these three children were\r\nall deformed, humpbacked, or crooked; and hideous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are the offspring of that charming woman you saw just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe doctor.\r\n\r\nI was filled with pity for her, as well as for them, and exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nthe poor mother! How can she ever laugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not pity her, my friend. Pity the poor children,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\ndoctor. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the consequence of preserving a slender figure up to\r\nthe last. These little deformities were made by the corset. She knows\r\nvery well that she is risking her life at this game. But what does she\r\ncare, as long as he can be beautiful and have admirers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then I recalled that other woman, the peasant, the \xe2\x80\x9cDevil,\xe2\x80\x9d who sold\r\nher children, her monsters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNCOMFORTABLE BED\r\n\r\nOne autumn I went to spend the hunting season with some friends in a\r\nchateau in Picardy.\r\n\r\nMy friends were fond of practical jokes. I do not care to know people\r\nwho are not.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived, they gave me a princely reception, which at once\r\nawakened suspicion in my mind. They fired off rifles, embraced me, made\r\nmuch of me, as if they expected to have great fun at my expense.\r\n\r\nI said to myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out, old ferret! They have something in store for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the dinner the mirth was excessive, exaggerated, in fact. I\r\nthought: \xe2\x80\x9cHere are people who have more than their share of amusement,\r\nand apparently without reason. They must have planned some good joke.\r\nAssuredly I am to be the victim of the joke. Attention!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the entire evening every one laughed in an exaggerated fashion. I\r\nscented a practical joke in the air, as a dog scents game. But what was\r\nit? I was watchful, restless. I did not let a word, or a meaning, or a\r\ngesture escape me. Every one seemed to me an object of suspicion, and I\r\neven looked distrustfully at the faces of the servants.\r\n\r\nThe hour struck for retiring; and the whole household came to escort me\r\nto my room. Why?\r\n\r\nThey called to me: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d I entered the apartment, shut the door,\r\nand remained standing, without moving a single step, holding the wax\r\ncandle in my hand.\r\n\r\nI heard laughter and whispering in the corridor. Without doubt they were\r\nspying on me. I cast a glance round the walls, the furniture, the\r\nceiling, the hangings, the floor. I saw nothing to justify suspicion. I\r\nheard persons moving about outside my door. I had no doubt they were\r\nlooking through the keyhole.\r\n\r\nAn idea came into my head: \xe2\x80\x9cMy candle may suddenly go out and leave me\r\nin darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I went across to the mantelpiece and lighted all the wax candles\r\nthat were on it. After that I cast another glance around me without\r\ndiscovering anything. I advanced with short steps, carefully examining\r\nthe apartment. Nothing. I inspected every article, one after the other.\r\nStill nothing. I went over to the window. The shutters, large wooden\r\nshutters, were open. I shut them with great care, and then drew the\r\ncurtains, enormous velvet curtains, and placed a chair in front of them,\r\nso as to have nothing to fear from outside.\r\n\r\nThen I cautiously sat down. The armchair was solid. I did not venture to\r\nget into the bed. However, the night was advancing; and I ended by\r\ncoming to the conclusion that I was foolish. If they were spying on me,\r\nas I supposed, they must, while waiting for the success of the joke they\r\nhad been preparing for me, have been laughing immoderately at my terror.\r\nSo I made up my mind to go to bed. But the bed was particularly\r\nsuspicious-looking. I pulled at the curtains. They seemed to be secure.\r\n\r\nAll the same, there was danger. I was going perhaps to receive a cold\r\nshower both from overhead, or perhaps, the moment I stretched myself\r\nout, to find myself sinking to the floor with my mattress. I searched in\r\nmy memory for all the practical jokes of which I ever had experience.\r\nAnd I did not want to be caught. Ah! certainly not! certainly not! Then\r\nI suddenly bethought myself of a precaution which I considered insured\r\nsafety. I caught hold of the side of the mattress gingerly, and very\r\nslowly drew it toward me. It came away, followed by the sheet and the\r\nrest of the bedclothes. I dragged all these objects into the very middle\r\nof the room, facing the entrance door. I made my bed over again as best\r\nI could at some distance from the suspected bedstead and the corner\r\nwhich had filled me with such anxiety. Then I extinguished all the\r\ncandles, and, groping my way, I slipped under the bed clothes.\r\n\r\nFor at least another hour I remained awake, starting at the slightest\r\nsound. Everything seemed quiet in the chateau. I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nI must have been in a deep sleep for a long time, but all of a sudden I\r\nwas awakened with a start by the fall of a heavy body tumbling right on\r\ntop of my own, and, at the same time, I received on my face, on my neck,\r\nand on my chest a burning liquid which made me utter a howl of pain. And\r\na dreadful noise, as if a sideboard laden with plates and dishes had\r\nfallen down, almost deafened me.\r\n\r\nI was smothering beneath the weight that was crushing me and preventing\r\nme from moving. I stretched out my hand to find out what was the nature\r\nof this object. I felt a face, a nose, and whiskers. Then, with all my\r\nstrength, I launched out a blow at this face. But I immediately received\r\na hail of cuffings which made me jump straight out of the soaked sheets,\r\nand rush in my nightshirt into the corridor, the door of which I found\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nOh, heavens! it was broad daylight. The noise brought my friends\r\nhurrying into my apartment, and we found, sprawling over my improvised\r\nbed, the dismayed valet, who, while bringing me my morning cup of tea,\r\nhad tripped over this obstacle in the middle of the floor and fallen on\r\nhis stomach, spilling my breakfast over my face in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nThe precautions I had taken in closing the shutters and going to sleep\r\nin the middle of the room had only brought about the practical joke I\r\nhad been trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nOh, how they all laughed that day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PORTRAIT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello! there's Milial!\xe2\x80\x9d said somebody near me. I looked at the man who\r\nhad been pointed out as I had been wishing for a long time to meet this\r\nDon Juan.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer young. His gray hair looked a little like those fur\r\nbonnets worn by certain Northern peoples, and his long beard, which fell\r\ndown over his chest, had also somewhat the appearance of fur. He was\r\ntalking to a lady, leaning toward her, speaking in a low voice and\r\nlooking at her with an expression full of respect and tenderness.\r\n\r\nI knew his life, or at least as much as was known of it. He had loved\r\nmadly several times, and there had been certain tragedies with which his\r\nname had been connected. When I spoke to women who were the loudest in\r\nhis praise, and asked them whence came this power, they always answered,\r\nafter thinking for a while: \xe2\x80\x9cI don't know\xe2\x80\x94he has a certain charm about\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was certainly not handsome. He had none of the elegance that we\r\nascribe to conquerors of feminine hearts. I wondered what might be his\r\nhidden charm. Was it mental? I never had heard of a clever saying of\r\nhis. In his glance? Perhaps. Or in his voice? The voices of some beings\r\nhave a certain irresistible attraction, almost suggesting the flavor of\r\nthings good to eat. One is hungry for them, and the sound of their words\r\npenetrates us like a dainty morsel. A friend was passing. I asked him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Monsieur Milial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntroduce us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA minute later we were shaking hands and talking in the doorway. What he\r\nsaid was correct, agreeable to hear; it contained no irritable thought.\r\nThe voice was sweet, soft, caressing, musical; but I had heard others\r\nmuch more attractive, much more moving. One listened to him with\r\npleasure, just as one would look at a pretty little brook. No tension of\r\nthe mind was necessary in order to follow him, no hidden meaning aroused\r\ncuriosity, no expectation awoke interest. His conversation was rather\r\nrestful, but it did not awaken in one either a desire to answer, to\r\ncontradict or to approve, and it was as easy to answer him as it was to\r\nlisten to him. The response came to the lips of its own accord, as soon\r\nas he had finished talking, and phrases turned toward him as if he had\r\nnaturally aroused them.\r\n\r\nOne thought soon struck me. I had known him for a quarter of an hour,\r\nand it seemed as if he were already one of my old friends, that I had\r\nknown all about him for a long time; his face, his gestures, his voice,\r\nhis ideas. Suddenly, after a few minutes of conversation, he seemed\r\nalready to be installed in my intimacy. All constraint disappeared\r\nbetween us, and, had he so desired, I might have confided in him as one\r\nconfides only in old friends.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was some mystery about him. Those barriers that are\r\nclosed between most people and that are lowered with time when sympathy,\r\nsimilar tastes, equal intellectual culture and constant intercourse\r\nremove constraint\xe2\x80\x94those barriers seemed not to exist between him and me,\r\nand no doubt this was the case between him and all people, both men and\r\nwomen, whom fate threw in his path.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour we parted, promising to see each other often, and he\r\ngave me his address after inviting me to take luncheon with him in two\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nI forgot what hour he had stated, and I arrived too soon; he was not yet\r\nhome. A correct and silent domestic showed me into a beautiful, quiet,\r\nsoftly lighted parlor. I felt comfortable there, at home. How often I\r\nhave noticed the influence of apartments on the character and on the\r\nmind! There are some which make one feel foolish; in others, on the\r\ncontrary, one always feels lively. Some make us sad, although well\r\nlighted and decorated in light-colored furniture; others cheer us up,\r\nalthough hung with sombre material. Our eye, like our heart, has its\r\nlikes and dislikes, of which it does not inform us, and which it\r\nsecretly imposes on our temperament. The harmony of furniture, walls,\r\nthe style of an ensemble, act immediately on our mental state, just as\r\nthe air from the woods, the sea or the mountains modifies our physical\r\nnatures.\r\n\r\nI sat down on a cushion-covered divan and felt myself suddenly carried\r\nand supported by these little silk bags of feathers, as if the outline\r\nof my body had been marked out beforehand on this couch.\r\n\r\nThen I looked about. There was nothing striking about the room; every-\r\nwhere were beautiful and modest things, simple and rare furniture,\r\nOriental curtains which did not seem to come from a department store but\r\nfrom the interior of a harem; and exactly opposite me hung the portrait\r\nof a woman. It was a portrait of medium size, showing the head and the\r\nupper part of the body, and the hands, which were holding a book. She\r\nwas young, bareheaded; ribbons were woven in her hair; she was smiling\r\nsadly. Was it because she was bareheaded, was it merely her natural\r\nexpression? I never have seen a portrait of a lady which seemed so much\r\nin its place as that one in that dwelling. Of all those I knew I have\r\nseen nothing like that one. All those that I know are on exhibition,\r\nwhether the lady be dressed in her gaudiest gown, with an attractive\r\nheaddress and a look which shows that she is posing first of all before\r\nthe artist and then before those who will look at her or whether they\r\nhave taken a comfortable attitude in an ordinary gown. Some are standing\r\nmajestically in all their beauty, which is not at all natural to them in\r\nlife. All of them have something, a flower or, a jewel, a crease in the\r\ndress or a curve of the lip, which one feels to have been placed there\r\nfor effect by the artist. Whether they wear a hat or merely their hair\r\none can immediately notice that they are not entirely natural. Why? One\r\ncannot say without knowing them, but the effect is there. They seem to\r\nbe calling somewhere, on people whom they wish to please and to whom\r\nthey wish to appear at their best advantage; and they have studied their\r\nattitudes, sometimes modest, Sometimes haughty.\r\n\r\nWhat could one say about this one? She was at home and alone. Yes, she\r\nwas alone, for she was smiling as one smiles when thinking in solitude\r\nof something sad or sweet, and not as one smiles when one is being\r\nwatched. She seemed so much alone and so much at home that she made the\r\nwhole large apartment seem absolutely empty. She alone lived in it,\r\nfilled it, gave it life. Many people might come in and converse, laugh,\r\neven sing; she would still be alone with a solitary smile, and she alone\r\nwould give it life with her pictured gaze.\r\n\r\nThat look also was unique. It fell directly on me, fixed and caressing,\r\nwithout seeing me. All portraits know that they are being watched, and\r\nthey answer with their eyes, which see, think, follow us without leaving\r\nus, from the very moment we enter the apartment they inhabit. This one\r\ndid not see me; it saw nothing, although its look was fixed directly on\r\nme. I remembered the surprising verse of Baudelaire:\r\n\r\nAnd your eyes, attractive as those of a portrait.\r\n\r\nThey did indeed attract me in an irresistible manner; those painted eyes\r\nwhich had lived, or which were perhaps still living, threw over me a\r\nstrange, powerful spell. Oh, what an infinite and tender charm, like a\r\npassing breeze, like a dying sunset of lilac rose and blue, a little sad\r\nlike the approaching night, which comes behind the sombre frame and out\r\nof those impenetrable eyes! Those eyes, created by a few strokes from a\r\nbrush, hide behind them the mystery of that which seems to be and which\r\ndoes not exist, which can appear in the eyes of a woman, which can make\r\nlove blossom within us.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and M. Milial entered. He excused himself for being\r\nlate. I excused myself for being ahead of time. Then I said: \xe2\x80\x9cMight I\r\nask you who is this lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is my mother. She died very young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I understood whence came the inexplicable attraction of this man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRUNKARD\r\n\r\nThe north wind was blowing a hurricane, driving through the sky big,\r\nblack, heavy clouds from which the rain poured down on the earth with\r\nterrific violence.\r\n\r\nA high sea was raging and dashing its huge, slow, foamy waves along the\r\ncoast with the rumbling sound of thunder. The waves followed each other\r\nclose, rolling in as high as mountains, scattering the foam as they\r\nbroke.\r\n\r\nThe storm engulfed itself in the little valley of Yport, whistling and\r\nmoaning, tearing the shingles from the roofs, smashing the shutters,\r\nknocking down the chimneys, rushing through the narrow streets in such\r\ngusts that one could walk only by holding on to the walls, and children\r\nwould have been lifted up like leaves and carried over the houses into\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nThe fishing smacks had been hauled high up on land, because at high tide\r\nthe sea would sweep the beach. Several sailors, sheltered behind the\r\ncurved bottoms of their boats, were watching this battle of the sky and\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThen, one by one, they went away, for night was falling on the storm,\r\nwrapping in shadows the raging ocean and all the battling elements.\r\n\r\nJust two men remained, their hands plunged deep into their pockets,\r\nbending their backs beneath the squall, their woolen caps pulled down\r\nover their ears; two big Normandy fishermen, bearded, their skin tanned\r\nthrough exposure, with the piercing black eyes of the sailor who looks\r\nover the horizon like a bird of prey.\r\n\r\nOne of them was saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Jeremie, let's go play dominoes. It's my treat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other hesitated a while, tempted on one hand by the game and the\r\nthought of brandy, knowing well that, if he went to Paumelle's, he would\r\nreturn home drunk; held back, on the other hand, by the idea of his wife\r\nremaining alone in the house.\r\n\r\nHe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny one might think that you had made a bet to get me drunk every\r\nnight. Say, what good is it doing you, since it's always you that's\r\ntreating?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless he was smiling at the idea of all this brandy drunk at the\r\nexpense of another. He was smiling the contented smirk of an avaricious\r\nNorman.\r\n\r\nMathurin, his friend, kept pulling him by the sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Jeremie. This isn't the kind of a night to go home without\r\nanything to warm you up. What are you afraid of? Isn't your wife going\r\nto warm your bed for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeremie answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other night I couldn't find the door\xe2\x80\x94I had to be fished out of the\r\nditch in front of the house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still laughing at this drunkard's recollection, and he was\r\nunconsciously going toward Paumelle's Cafe, where a light was shining in\r\nthe window; he was going, pulled by Mathurin and pushed by the wind,\r\nunable to resist these combined forces.\r\n\r\nThe low room was full of sailors, smoke and noise. All these men, clad\r\nin woolens, their elbows on the tables, were shouting to make themselves\r\nheard. The more people came in, the more one had to shout in order to\r\novercome the noise of voices and the rattling of dominoes on the marble\r\ntables.\r\n\r\nJeremie and Mathurin sat down in a corner and began a game, and the\r\nglasses were emptied in rapid succession into their thirsty throats.\r\n\r\nThen they played more games and drank more glasses. Mathurin kept\r\npouring and winking to the saloon keeper, a big, red-faced man, who\r\nchuckled as though at the thought of some fine joke; and Jeremie kept\r\nabsorbing alcohol and wagging his head, giving vent to a roar of\r\nlaughter and looking at his comrade with a stupid and contented\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nAll the customers were going away. Every time that one of them would\r\nopen the door to leave a gust of wind would blow into the cafe, making\r\nthe tobacco smoke swirl around, swinging the lamps at the end of their\r\nchains and making their flames flicker, and suddenly one could hear the\r\ndeep booming of a breaking wave and the moaning of the wind.\r\n\r\nJeremie, his collar unbuttoned, was taking drunkard's poses, one leg\r\noutstretched, one arm hanging down and in the other hand holding a\r\ndomino.\r\n\r\nThey were alone now with the owner, who had come up to them, interested.\r\n\r\nHe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Jeremie, how goes it inside? Feel less thirsty after wetting your\r\nthroat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeremie muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more I wet it, the drier it gets inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper cast a sly glance at Mathurin. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your brother, Mathurin, where's he now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sailor laughed silently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't worry; he's warm, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd both of them looked toward Jeremie, who was triumphantly putting\r\ndown the double six and announcing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the owner declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, boys, I'm goin' to bed. I will leave you the lamp and the bottle;\r\nthere's twenty cents' worth in it. Lock the door when you go, Mathurin,\r\nand slip the key under the mat the way you did the other night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMathurin answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't worry; it'll be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaumelle shook hands with his two customers and slowly went up the\r\nwooden stairs. For several minutes his heavy step echoed through the\r\nlittle house. Then a loud creaking announced that he had got into bed.\r\n\r\nThe two men continued to play. From time to time a more violent gust of\r\nwind would shake the whole house, and the two drinkers would look up, as\r\nthough some one were about to enter. Then Mathurin would take the bottle\r\nand fill Jeremie's glass. But suddenly the clock over the bar struck\r\ntwelve. Its hoarse clang sounded like the rattling of saucepans. Then\r\nMathurin got up like a sailor whose watch is over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Jeremie, we've got to get out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other man rose to his feet with difficulty, got his balance by\r\nleaning on the table, reached the door and opened it while his companion\r\nwas putting out the light.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were in the street Mathurin locked the door and then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so long. See you to-morrow night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he disappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\nJeremie took a few steps, staggered, stretched out his hands, met a wall\r\nwhich supported him and began to stumble along. From time to time a gust\r\nof wind would sweep through the street, pushing him forward, making him\r\nrun for a few steps; then, when the wind would die down, he would stop\r\nshort, having lost his impetus, and once more he would begin to stagger\r\non his unsteady drunkard's legs.\r\n\r\nHe went instinctively toward his home, just as birds go to their nests.\r\nFinally he recognized his door, and began to feel about for the keyhole\r\nand tried to put the key in it. Not finding the hole, he began to swear.\r\nThen he began to beat on the door with his fists, calling for his wife\r\nto come and help him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelina! Oh, Melina!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he leaned against the door for support, it gave way and opened, and\r\nJeremie, losing his prop, fell inside, rolling on his face into the\r\nmiddle of his room, and he felt something heavy pass over him and escape\r\nin the night.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer moving, dazed by fright, bewildered, fearing the devil,\r\nghosts, all the mysterious beings of darkness, and he waited a long time\r\nwithout daring to move. But when he found out that nothing else was\r\nmoving, a little reason returned to him, the reason of a drunkard.\r\n\r\nGently he sat up. Again he waited a long time, and at last, growing\r\nbolder, he called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelina!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife did not answer.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, a suspicion crossed his darkened mind, an indistinct,\r\nvague suspicion. He was not moving; he was sitting there in the dark,\r\ntrying to gather together his scattered wits, his mind stumbling over\r\nincomplete ideas, just as his feet stumbled along.\r\n\r\nOnce more he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it, Melina? Tell me who it was. I won't hurt you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited, no voice was raised in the darkness. He was now reasoning\r\nwith himself out loud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm drunk, all right! I'm drunk! And he filled me up, the dog; he did\r\nit, to stop my goin' home. I'm drunk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he would continue:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me who it was, Melina, or somethin'll happen to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter having waited again, he went on with the slow and obstinate logic\r\nof a drunkard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's been keeping me at that loafer Paumelle's place every night, so as\r\nto stop my going home. It's some trick. Oh, you damned carrion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly he got on his knees. A blind fury was gaining possession of him,\r\nmingling with the fumes of alcohol.\r\n\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me who it was, Melina, or you'll get a licking\xe2\x80\x94I warn you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was now standing, trembling with a wild fury, as though the alcohol\r\nhad set his blood on fire. He took a step, knocked against a chair,\r\nseized it, went on, reached the bed, ran his hands over it and felt the\r\nwarm body of his wife.\r\n\r\nThen, maddened, he roared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! You were there, you piece of dirt, and you wouldn't answer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, lifting the chair, which he was holding in his strong sailor's\r\ngrip, he swung it down before him with an exasperated fury. A cry burst\r\nfrom the bed, an agonizing, piercing cry. Then he began to thrash around\r\nlike a thresher in a barn. And soon nothing more moved. The chair was\r\nbroken to pieces, but he still held one leg and beat away with it,\r\npanting.\r\n\r\nAt last he stopped to ask:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you ready to tell me who it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelina did not answer.\r\n\r\nThen tired out, stupefied from his exertion, he stretched himself out on\r\nthe ground and slept.\r\n\r\nWhen day came a neighbor, seeing the door open, entered. He saw Jeremie\r\nsnoring on the floor, amid the broken pieces of a chair, and on the bed\r\na pulp of flesh and blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WARDROBE\r\n\r\nAs we sat chatting after dinner, a party of men, the conversation turned\r\non women, for lack of something else.\r\n\r\nOne of us said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere's a funny thing that happened to me on, that very subject.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\ntold us the following story:\r\n\r\nOne evening last winter I suddenly felt overcome by that overpowering\r\nsense of misery and languor that takes possession of one from time to\r\ntime. I was in my own apartment, all alone, and I was convinced that if\r\nI gave in to my feelings I should have a terrible attack of melancholia,\r\none of those attacks that lead to suicide when they recur too often.\r\n\r\nI put on my overcoat and went out without the slightest idea of what I\r\nwas going to do. Having gone as far as the boulevards, I began to wander\r\nalong by the almost empty cafes. It was raining, a fine rain that\r\naffects your mind as it does your clothing, not one of those good\r\ndownpours which come down in torrents, driving breathless passers-by\r\ninto doorways, but a rain without drops that deposits on your clothing\r\nan imperceptible spray and soon covers you with a sort of iced foam that\r\nchills you through.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do? I walked in one direction and then came back, looking\r\nfor some place where I could spend two hours, and discovering for the\r\nfirst time that there is no place of amusement in Paris in the evening.\r\nAt last I decided to go to the Folies-Bergere, that entertaining resort\r\nfor gay women.\r\n\r\nThere were very few people in the main hall. In the long horseshoe curve\r\nthere were only a few ordinary looking people, whose plebeian origin was\r\napparent in their manners, their clothes, the cut of their hair and\r\nbeard, their hats, their complexion. It was rarely that one saw from\r\ntime to time a man whom you suspected of having washed himself\r\nthoroughly, and his whole make-up seemed to match. As for the women,\r\nthey were always the same, those frightful women you all know, ugly,\r\ntired looking, drooping, and walking along in their lackadaisical\r\nmanner, with that air of foolish superciliousness which they assume, I\r\ndo not know why.\r\n\r\nI thought to myself that, in truth, not one of those languid creatures,\r\ngreasy rather than fat, puffed out here and thin there, with the contour\r\nof a monk and the lower extremities of a bow-legged snipe, was worth the\r\nlouis that they would get with great difficulty after asking five.\r\n\r\nBut all at once I saw a little creature whom I thought attractive, not\r\nin her first youth, but fresh, comical and tantalizing. I stopped her,\r\nand stupidly, without thinking, I made an appointment with her for that\r\nnight. I did not want to go back to my own home alone, all alone; I\r\npreferred the company and the caresses of this hussy.\r\n\r\nAnd I followed her. She lived in a great big house in the Rue des\r\nMartyrs. The gas was already extinguished on the stairway. I ascended\r\nthe steps slowly, lighting a candle match every few seconds, stubbing my\r\nfoot against the steps, stumbling and angry as I followed the rustle of\r\nthe skirt ahead of me.\r\n\r\nShe stopped on the fourth floor, and having closed the outer door she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will stay till to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes. You know that that was the agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, my dear, I just wanted to know. Wait for me here a minute, I\r\nwill be right back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she left me in the darkness. I heard her shutting two doors and then\r\nI thought I heard her talking. I was surprised and uneasy. The thought\r\nthat she had a protector staggered me. But I have good fists and a solid\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself.\r\n\r\nI listened attentively with ear and mind. Some one was stirring about,\r\nwalking quietly and very carefully. Then another door was opened and I\r\nthought I again heard some one talking, but in a very low tone.\r\n\r\nShe came back carrying a lighted candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may come in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe said \xe2\x80\x9cthou\xe2\x80\x9d in speaking to me, which was an indication of\r\npossession. I went in and after passing through a dining room in which\r\nit was very evident that no one ever ate, I entered a typical room of\r\nall these women, a furnished room with red curtains and a soiled\r\neiderdown bed covering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake yourself at home, 'mon chat',\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nI gave a suspicious glance at the room, but there seemed no reason for\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nAs she took off her wraps she began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what ails you? Are you changed into a pillar of salt? Come, hurry\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as she suggested.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later I longed to put on my things and get away. But this\r\nterrible languor that had overcome me at home took possession of me\r\nagain, and deprived me of energy enough to move and I stayed in spite of\r\nthe disgust that I felt for this association. The unusual attractiveness\r\nthat I supposed I had discovered in this creature over there under the\r\nchandeliers of the theater had altogether vanished on closer\r\nacquaintance, and she was nothing more to me now than a common woman,\r\nlike all the others, whose indifferent and complaisant kiss smacked of\r\ngarlic.\r\n\r\nI thought I would say something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you lived here long?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver six months on the fifteenth of January.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were you before that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Rue Clauzel. But the janitor made me very uncomfortable and I\r\nleft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she began to tell me an interminable story of a janitor who had\r\ntalked scandal about her.\r\n\r\nBut, suddenly, I heard something moving quite close to us. First there\r\nwas a sigh, then a slight, but distinct, sound as if some one had turned\r\nround on a chair.\r\n\r\nI sat up abruptly and asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered quietly and confidently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be uneasy, my dear boy, it is my neighbor. The partition is so\r\nthin that one can hear everything as if it were in the room. These are\r\nwretched rooms, just like pasteboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt so lazy that I paid no further attention to it. We resumed our\r\nconversation. Driven by the stupid curiosity that prompts all men to\r\nquestion these creatures about their first experiences, to attempt to\r\nlift the veil of their first folly, as though to find in them a trace of\r\npristine innocence, to love them, possibly, in a fleeting memory of\r\ntheir candor and modesty of former days, evoked by a word, I insistently\r\nasked her about her earlier lovers.\r\n\r\nI knew she was telling me lies. What did it matter? Among all these lies\r\nI might, perhaps, discover something sincere and pathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me who he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a boating man, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Tell me about it. Where were you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at Argenteuil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was waitress in a restaurant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat restaurant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The Freshwater Sailor.' Do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say so, kept by Bonanfan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that's it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did he make love to you, this boating man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I was doing his room. He took advantage of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I suddenly recalled the theory of a friend of mine, an observant and\r\nphilosophical physician whom constant attendance in hospitals has\r\nbrought into daily contact with girl-mothers and prostitutes, with all\r\nthe shame and all the misery of women, of those poor women who have\r\nbecome the frightful prey of the wandering male with money in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis always debauched by a man of her own class and\r\nposition. I have volumes of statistics on that subject. We accuse the\r\nrich of plucking the flower of innocence among the girls of the people.\r\nThis is not correct. The rich pay for what they want. They may gather\r\nsome, but never for the first time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, turning to my companion, I began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I am aware of your history. The boating man was not the\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my dear, I swear it:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are lying, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are lying; come, tell me all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed to hesitate in astonishment. I continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a sorcerer, my dear girl, I am a clairvoyant. If you do not tell\r\nme the truth, I will go into a trance sleep and then I can find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was afraid, being as stupid as all her kind. She faltered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you guess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, go on telling me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the first time didn't amount to anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a festival in the country. They had sent for a special chef,\r\nM. Alexandre. As soon as he came he did just as he pleased in the house.\r\nHe bossed every one, even the proprietor and his wife, as if he had been\r\na king. He was a big handsome man, who did not seem fitted to stand\r\nbeside a kitchen range. He was always calling out, 'Come, some butter\r\n\xe2\x80\x94some eggs\xe2\x80\x94some Madeira!' And it had to be brought to him at once in a\r\nhurry, or he would get cross and say things that would make us blush all\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the day was over he would smoke a pipe outside the door. And as I\r\nwas passing by him with a pile of plates he said to me, like that:\r\n'Come, girlie, come down to the water with me and show me the country.'\r\nI went with him like a fool, and we had hardly got down to the bank of\r\nthe river when he took advantage of me so suddenly that I did not even\r\nknow what he was doing. And then he went away on the nine o'clock train.\r\nI never saw him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think Florentin belongs to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Florentin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Well, then, you made the boating man believe that he was the\r\nfather, did you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he have any money, this boating man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he left me an income of three hundred francs, settled on\r\nFlorentin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was beginning to be amused and resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, my girl, all right. You are all of you less stupid than one\r\nwould imagine, all the same. And how old is he now, Florentin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is now twelve. He will make his first communion in the spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is splendid. And since then you have carried on your business\r\nconscientiously?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed in a resigned manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do what I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a loud noise just then coming from the room itself made me start up\r\nwith a bound. It sounded like some one falling and picking themselves up\r\nagain by feeling along the wall with their hands.\r\n\r\nI had seized the candle and was looking about me, terrified and furious.\r\nShe had risen also and was trying to hold me back to stop me, murmuring:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's nothing, my dear, I assure you it's nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I had discovered what direction the strange noise came from. I\r\nwalked straight towards a door hidden at the head of the bed and I\r\nopened it abruptly and saw before me, trembling, his bright, terrified\r\neyes opened wide at sight of me, a little pale, thin boy seated beside a\r\nlarge wicker chair off which he had fallen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw me he began to cry. Stretching out his arms to his\r\nmother, he cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not my fault, mamma, it was not my fault. I was asleep, and I\r\nfell off. Do not scold me, it was not my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned to the woman and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed confused and worried, and said in a broken voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want me to do? I do not earn enough to put him to school! I\r\nhave to keep him with me, and I cannot afford to pay for another room,\r\nby heavens! He sleeps with me when I am alone. If any one comes for one\r\nhour or two he can stay in the wardrobe; he keeps quiet, he understands\r\nit. But when people stay all night, as you have done, it tires the poor\r\nchild to sleep on a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not his fault. I should like to see you sleep all night on a\r\nchair\xe2\x80\x94you would have something to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was getting angry and excited and was talking loud.\r\n\r\nThe child was still crying. A poor delicate timid little fellow, a\r\nveritable child of the wardrobe, of the cold, dark closet, a child who\r\nfrom time to time was allowed to get a little warmth in the bed if it\r\nchanced to be unoccupied.\r\n\r\nI also felt inclined to cry.\r\n\r\nAnd I went home to my own bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNTAIN POOL\r\n\r\nSaint Agnes, May 6. MY DEAR FRIEND: You asked me to write to you often\r\nand to tell you in particular about the things I might see. You also\r\nbegged me to rummage among my recollections of travels for some of those\r\nlittle anecdotes gathered from a chance peasant, from an innkeeper, from\r\nsome strange traveling acquaintance, which remain as landmarks in the\r\nmemory. With a landscape depicted in a few lines, and a little story\r\ntold in a few sentences you think one can give the true characteristics\r\nof a country, make it living, visible, dramatic. I will try to do as you\r\nwish. I will, therefore, send you from time to time letters in which I\r\nwill mention neither you nor myself, but only the landscape and the\r\npeople who move about in it. And now I will begin.\r\n\r\nSpring is a season in which one ought, it seems to me, to drink and eat\r\nthe landscape. It is the season of chills, just as autumn is the season\r\nof reflection. In spring the country rouses the physical senses, in\r\nautumn it enters into the soul.\r\n\r\nI desired this year to breathe the odor of orange blossoms and I set out\r\nfor the South of France just at the time that every one else was\r\nreturning home. I visited Monaco, the shrine of pilgrims, rival of Mecca\r\nand Jerusalem, without leaving any gold in any one else's pockets, and I\r\nclimbed the high mountain beneath a covering of lemon, orange and olive\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nHave you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?\r\nThe air that one inhales with delight is a quintessence of perfumes. The\r\nstrong yet sweet odor, delicious as some dainty, seems to blend with our\r\nbeing, to saturate us, to intoxicate us, to enervate us, to plunge us\r\ninto a sleepy, dreamy torpor. As though it were an opium prepared by the\r\nhands of fairies and not by those of druggists.\r\n\r\nThis is a country of ravines. The surface of the mountains is cleft,\r\nhollowed out in all directions, and in these sinuous crevices grow\r\nveritable forests of lemon trees. Here and there where the steep gorge\r\nis interrupted by a sort of step, a kind of reservoir has been built\r\nwhich holds the water of the rain storms.\r\n\r\nThey are large holes with slippery walls with nothing for any one to\r\ngrasp hold of should they fall in.\r\n\r\nI was walking slowly in one of these ascending valleys or gorges,\r\nglancing through the foliage at the vivid-hued fruit that remained on\r\nthe branches. The narrow gorge made the heavy odor of the flowers still\r\nmore penetrating; the air seemed to be dense with it. A feeling of\r\nlassitude came over me and I looked for a place to sit down. A few drops\r\nof water glistened in the grass. I thought that there was a spring near\r\nby and I climbed a little further to look for it. But I only reached the\r\nedge of one of these large, deep reservoirs.\r\n\r\nI sat down tailor fashion, with my legs crossed under me, and remained\r\nthere in a reverie before this hole, which looked as if it were filled\r\nwith ink, so black and stagnant was the liquid it contained. Down\r\nyonder, through the branches, I saw, like patches, bits of the\r\nMediterranean gleaming so that they fairly dazzled my eyes. But my\r\nglance always returned to the immense somber well that appeared to be\r\ninhabited by no aquatic animals, so motionless was its surface. Suddenly\r\na voice made me tremble. An old gentleman who was picking flowers\xe2\x80\x94this\r\ncountry is the richest in Europe for herbalists\xe2\x80\x94asked me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a relation of those poor children, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat children, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed embarrassed and answered with a bow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. On seeing you sitting thus absorbed in front of this\r\nreservoir I thought you were recalling the frightful tragedy that\r\noccurred here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow I wanted to know about it, and I begged him to tell me the story.\r\n\r\nIt is very dismal and very heart-rending, my dear friend, and very\r\ntrivial at the same time. It is a simple news item. I do not know\r\nwhether to attribute my emotion to the dramatic manner in which the\r\nstory was told to me, to the setting of the mountains, to the contrast\r\nbetween the joy of the sunlight and the flowers and this black,\r\nmurderous hole, but my heart was wrung, all my nerves unstrung by this\r\ntale which, perhaps, may not appear so terribly harrowing to you as you\r\nread it in your room without having the scene of the tragedy before your\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nIt was one spring in recent years. Two little boys frequently came to\r\nplay on the edge of this cistern while their tutor lay under a tree\r\nreading a book. One warm afternoon a piercing cry awoke the tutor who\r\nwas dozing and the sound of splashing caused by something falling into\r\nthe water made him jump to his feet abruptly. The younger of the\r\nchildren, eight years of age, was shouting, as he stood beside the\r\nreservoir, the surface of which was stirred and eddying at the spot\r\nwhere the older boy had fallen in as he ran along the stone coping.\r\n\r\nDistracted, without waiting or stopping to think what was best to do,\r\nthe tutor jumped into the black water and did not rise again, having\r\nstruck his head at the bottom of the cistern.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the young boy who had risen to the surface was waving\r\nhis stretched-out arms toward his brother. The little fellow on land lay\r\ndown full length, while the other tried to swim, to approach the wall,\r\nand presently the four little hands clasped each other, tightened in\r\neach other's grasp, contracted as though they were fastened together.\r\nThey both felt the intense joy of an escape from death, a shudder at the\r\ndanger past.\r\n\r\nThe older boy tried to climb up to the edge, but could not manage it, as\r\nthe wall was perpendicular, and his brother, who was too weak, was\r\nsliding slowly towards the hole.\r\n\r\nThen they remained motionless, filled anew with terror. And they waited.\r\n\r\nThe little fellow squeezed his brother's hands with all his might and\r\nwept from nervousness as he repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot drag you out, I cannot\r\ndrag you out.\xe2\x80\x9d And all at once he began to shout, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp! Help!\xe2\x80\x9d But his\r\nlight voice scarcely penetrated beyond the dome of foliage above their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nThey remained thus a long time, hours and hours, facing each other,\r\nthese two children, with one thought, one anguish of heart and the\r\nhorrible dread that one of them, exhausted, might let go the hands of\r\nthe other. And they kept on calling, but all in vain.\r\n\r\nAt length the older boy, who was shivering with cold, said to the little\r\none: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot hold out any longer. I am going to fall. Good-by, little\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d And the other, gasping, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, not yet, wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvening came on, the still evening with its stars mirrored in the water.\r\nThe older lad, his endurance giving out, said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet go my hand, I am\r\ngoing to give you my watch.\xe2\x80\x9d He had received it as a present a few days\r\nbefore, and ever since it had been his chief amusement. He was able to\r\nget hold of it, and held it out to the little fellow who was sobbing and\r\nwho laid it down on the grass beside him.\r\n\r\nIt was night now. The two unhappy beings, exhausted, had almost loosened\r\ntheir grasp. The elder, at last, feeling that he was lost, murmured once\r\nmore: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, little brother, kiss mamma and papa.\xe2\x80\x9d And his numbed\r\nfingers relaxed their hold. He sank and did not rise again . . . . The\r\nlittle fellow, left alone, began to shout wildly: \xe2\x80\x9cPaul! Paul!\xe2\x80\x9d But the\r\nother did not come to the surface.\r\n\r\nThen he darted across the mountain, falling among the stones, overcome\r\nby the most frightful anguish that can wring a child's heart, and with a\r\nface like death reached the sitting-room, where his parents were\r\nwaiting. He became bewildered again as he led them to the gloomy\r\nreservoir. He could not find his way. At last he reached the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis there; yes, it is there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the cistern had to be emptied, and the proprietor would not permit\r\nit as he needed the water for his lemon trees.\r\n\r\nThe two bodies were found, however, but not until the next day.\r\n\r\nYou see, my dear friend, that this is a simple news item. But if you had\r\nseen the hole itself your heart would have been wrung, as mine was, at\r\nthe thought of the agony of that child hanging to his brother's hands,\r\nof the long suspense of those little chaps who were accustomed only to\r\nlaugh and to play, and at the simple incident of the giving of the\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\nI said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cMay Fate preserve me from ever receiving a similar\r\nrelic!\xe2\x80\x9d I know of nothing more terrible than such a recollection\r\nconnected with a familiar object that one cannot dispose of. Only think\r\nof it; each time that he handles this sacred watch the survivor will\r\npicture once more the horrible scene; the pool, the wall, the still\r\nwater, and the distracted face of his brother-alive, and yet as lost as\r\nthough he were already dead. And all through his life, at any moment,\r\nthe vision will be there, awakened the instant even the tip of his\r\nfinger touches his watch pocket.\r\n\r\nAnd I was sad until evening. I left the spot and kept on climbing,\r\nleaving the region of orange trees for the region of olive trees, and\r\nthe region of olive trees for the region of pines; then I came to a\r\nvalley of stones, and finally reached the ruins of an ancient castle,\r\nbuilt, they say, in the tenth century by a Saracen chief, a good man,\r\nwho was baptized a Christian through love for a young girl. Everywhere\r\naround me were mountains, and before me the sea, the sea with an almost\r\nimperceptible patch on it: Corsica, or, rather, the shadow of Corsica.\r\nBut on the mountain summits, blood-red in the glow of the sunset, in the\r\nboundless sky and on the sea, in all this superb landscape that I had\r\ncome here to admire I saw only two poor children, one lying prone on the\r\nedge of a hole filled with black water, the other submerged to his neck,\r\ntheir hands intertwined, weeping opposite each other, in despair. And it\r\nseemed as though I continually heard a weak, exhausted voice saying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, little brother, I am going to give you my watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis letter may seem rather melancholy, dear friend. I will try to be\r\nmore cheerful some other day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CREMATION\r\n\r\nLast Monday an Indian prince died at Etretat, Bapu Sahib Khanderao\r\nGhatay, a relation of His Highness, the Maharajah Gaikwar, prince of\r\nBaroda, in the province of Guzerat, Presidency of Bombay.\r\n\r\nFor about three weeks there had been seen walking in the streets about\r\nten young East Indians, small, lithe, with dark skins, dressed all in\r\ngray and wearing on their heads caps such as English grooms wear. They\r\nwere men of high rank who had come to Europe to study the military\r\ninstitutions of the principal Western nations. The little band consisted\r\nof three princes, a nobleman, an interpreter and three servants.\r\n\r\nThe head of the commission had just died, an old man of forty-two and\r\nfather-in-law of Sampatro Kashivao Gaikwar, brother of His Highness, the\r\nGaikwar of Baroda.\r\n\r\nThe son-in-law accompanied his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe other East Indians were called Ganpatrao Shravanrao Gaikwar, cousin\r\nof His Highness Khasherao Gadhav; Vasudev Madhav Samarth, interpreter\r\nand secretary; the slaves: Ramchandra Bajaji, Ganu bin Pukiram Kokate,\r\nRhambhaji bin Fabji.\r\n\r\nOn leaving his native land the one who died recently was overcome with\r\nterrible grief, and feeling convinced that he would never return he\r\nwished to give up the journey, but he had to obey the wishes of his\r\nnoble relative, the Prince of Baroda, and he set out.\r\n\r\nThey came to spend the latter part of the summer at Etretat, and people\r\nwould go out of curiosity every morning to see them taking their bath at\r\nthe Etablissment des Roches-Blanches.\r\n\r\nFive or six days ago Bapu Sahib Khanderao Ghatay was taken with pains in\r\nhis gums; then the inflammation spread to the throat and became\r\nulceration. Gangrene set in and, on Monday, the doctors told his young\r\nfriends that their relative was dying. The final struggle was already\r\nbeginning, and the breath had almost left the unfortunate man's body\r\nwhen his friends seized him, snatched him from his bed and laid him on\r\nthe stone floor of the room, so that, stretched out on the earth, our\r\nmother, he should yield up his soul, according to the command of Brahma.\r\n\r\nThey then sent to ask the mayor, M. Boissaye, for a permit to burn the\r\nbody that very day so as to fulfill the prescribed ceremonial of the\r\nHindoo religion. The mayor hesitated, telegraphed to the prefecture to\r\ndemand instructions, at the same time sending word that a failure to\r\nreply would be considered by him tantamount to a consent. As he had\r\nreceived no reply at 9 o'clock that evening, he decided, in view of the\r\ninfectious character of the disease of which the East Indian had died,\r\nthat the cremation of the body should take place that very night,\r\nbeneath the cliff, on the beach, at ebb tide.\r\n\r\nThe mayor is being criticized now for this decision, though he acted as\r\nan intelligent, liberal and determined man, and was upheld and advised\r\nby the three physicians who had watched the case and reported the death.\r\n\r\nThey were dancing at the Casino that evening. It was an early autumn\r\nevening, rather chilly. A pretty strong wind was blowing from the ocean,\r\nalthough as yet there was no sea on, and swift, light, ragged clouds\r\nwere driving across the sky. They came from the edge of the horizon,\r\nlooking dark against the background of the sky, but as they approached\r\nthe moon they grew whiter and passed hurriedly across her face, veiling\r\nit for a few seconds without completely hiding it.\r\n\r\nThe tall straight cliffs that inclose the rounded beach of Etretat and\r\nterminate in two celebrated arches, called \xe2\x80\x9cthe Gates,\xe2\x80\x9d lay in shadow,\r\nand made two great black patches in the softly lighted landscape.\r\n\r\nIt had rained all day.\r\n\r\nThe Casino orchestra was playing waltzes, polkas and quadrilles. A rumor\r\nwas presently circulated among the groups of dancers. It was said that\r\nan East Indian prince had just died at the Hotel des Bains and that the\r\nministry had been approached for permission to burn the body. No one\r\nbelieved it, or at least no one supposed that such a thing could occur\r\nso foreign was the custom as yet to our customs, and as the night was\r\nfar advanced every one went home.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, the lamplighter, running from street to street,\r\nextinguished, one after another, the yellow jets of flame that lighted\r\nup the sleeping houses, the mud and the puddles of water. We waited,\r\nwatching for the hour when the little town should be quiet and deserted.\r\n\r\nEver since noon a carpenter had been cutting up wood and asking himself\r\nwith amazement what was going to be done with all these planks sawn up\r\ninto little bits, and why one should destroy so much good merchandise.\r\nThis wood was piled up in a cart which went along through side streets\r\nas far as the beach, without arousing the suspicion of belated persons\r\nwho might meet it. It went along on the shingle at the foot of the\r\ncliff, and having dumped its contents on the beach the three Indian\r\nservants began to build a funeral pile, a little longer than it was\r\nwide. They worked alone, for no profane hand must aid in this solemn\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nIt was one o'clock in the morning when the relations of the deceased\r\nwere informed that they might accomplish their part of the work.\r\n\r\nThe door of the little house they occupied was open, and we perceived,\r\nlying on a stretcher in the small, dimly lighted vestibule the corpse\r\ncovered with white silk. We could see him plainly as he lay stretched\r\nout on his back, his outline clearly defined beneath this white veil.\r\n\r\nThe East Indians, standing at his feet, remained motionless, while one\r\nof them performed the prescribed rites, murmuring unfamiliar words in a\r\nlow, monotonous tone. He walked round and round the corpse; touching it\r\noccasionally, then, taking an urn suspended from three slender chains,\r\nhe sprinkled it for some time with the sacred water of the Ganges, that\r\nEast Indians must always carry with them wherever they go.\r\n\r\nThen the stretcher was lifted by four of them who started off at a slow\r\nmarch. The moon had gone down, leaving the muddy, deserted streets in\r\ndarkness, but the body on the stretcher appeared to be luminous, so\r\ndazzlingly white was the silk, and it was a weird sight to see, passing\r\nalong through the night, the semi-luminous form of this corpse, borne by\r\nthose men, the dusky skin of whose faces and hands could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished from their clothing in the darkness.\r\n\r\nBehind the corpse came three Indians, and then, a full head taller than\r\nthemselves and wrapped in an ample traveling coat of a soft gray color,\r\nappeared the outline of an Englishman, a kind and superior man, a friend\r\nof theirs, who was their guide and counselor in their European travels.\r\n\r\nBeneath the cold, misty sky of this little northern beach I felt as if I\r\nwere taking part in a sort of symbolical drama. It seemed to me that\r\nthey were carrying there, before me, the conquered genius of India,\r\nfollowed, as in a funeral procession, by the victorious genius of\r\nEngland robed in a gray ulster.\r\n\r\nOn the shingly beach the four bearers halted a few moments to take\r\nbreath, and then proceeded on their way. They now walked quickly,\r\nbending beneath the weight of their burden. At length they reached the\r\nfuneral pile. It was erected in an indentation, at the very foot of the\r\ncliff, which rose above it perpendicularly a hundred meters high,\r\nperfectly white but looking gray in the night.\r\n\r\nThe funeral pile was about three and a half feet high. The corpse was\r\nplaced on it and then one of the Indians asked to have the pole star\r\npointed out to him. This was done, and the dead Rajah was laid with his\r\nfeet turned towards his native country. Then twelve bottles of kerosene\r\nwere poured over him and he was covered completely with thin slabs of\r\npine wood. For almost another hour the relations and servants kept\r\npiling up the funeral pyre which looked like one of those piles of wood\r\nthat carpenters keep in their yards. Then on top of this was poured the\r\ncontents of twenty bottles of oil, and on top of all they emptied a bag\r\nof fine shavings. A few steps further on, a flame was glimmering in a\r\nlittle bronze brazier, which had remained lighted since the arrival of\r\nthe corpse.\r\n\r\nThe moment had arrived. The relations went to fetch the fire. As it was\r\nbarely alight, some oil was poured on it, and suddenly a flame arose\r\nlighting up the great wall of rock from summit to base. An Indian who\r\nwas leaning over the brazier rose upright, his two hands in the air, his\r\nelbows bent, and all at once we saw arising, all black on the immense\r\nwhite cliff, a colossal shadow, the shadow of Buddha in his hieratic\r\nposture. And the little pointed toque that the man wore on his head even\r\nlooked like the head-dress of the god.\r\n\r\nThe effect was so striking and unexpected that I felt my heart beat as\r\nthough some supernatural apparition had risen up before me.\r\n\r\nThat was just what it was\xe2\x80\x94the ancient and sacred image, come from the\r\nheart of the East to the ends of Europe, and watching over its son whom\r\nthey were going to cremate there.\r\n\r\nIt vanished. They brought fire. The shavings on top of the pyre were\r\nlighted and then the wood caught fire and a brilliant light illumined\r\nthe cliff, the shingle and the foam of the waves as they broke on the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nIt grew brighter from second to second, lighting up on the sea in the\r\ndistance the dancing crest of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe breeze from the ocean blew in gusts, increasing the heat of the\r\nflame which flattened down, twisted, then shot up again, throwing out\r\nmillions of sparks. They mounted with wild rapidity along the cliff and\r\nwere lost in the sky, mingling with the stars, increasing their number.\r\nSome sea birds who had awakened uttered their plaintive cry, and,\r\ndescribing long curves, flew, with their white wings extended, through\r\nthe gleam from the funeral pyre and then disappeared in the night.\r\n\r\nBefore long the pile of wood was nothing but a mass of flame, not red\r\nbut yellow, a blinding yellow, a furnace lashed by the wind. And,\r\nsuddenly, beneath a stronger gust, it tottered, partially crumbling as\r\nit leaned towards the sea, and the corpse came to view, full length,\r\nblackened on his couch of flame and burning with long blue flames:\r\n\r\nThe pile of wood having crumbled further on the right the corpse turned\r\nover as a man does in bed. They immediately covered him with fresh wood\r\nand the fire started up again more furiously than ever.\r\n\r\nThe East Indians, seated in a semi-circle on the shingle, looked out\r\nwith sad, serious faces. And the rest of us, as it was very cold, had\r\ndrawn nearer to the fire until the smoke and sparks came in our faces.\r\nThere was no odor save that of burning pine and petroleum.\r\n\r\nHours passed; day began to break. Toward five o'clock in the morning\r\nnothing remained but a heap of ashes. The relations gathered them up,\r\ncast some of them to the winds, some in the sea, and kept some in a\r\nbrass vase that they had brought from India. They then retired to their\r\nhome to give utterance to lamentations.\r\n\r\nThese young princes and their servants, by the employment of the most\r\ninadequate appliances succeeded in carrying out the cremation of their\r\nrelation in the most perfect manner, with singular skill and remarkable\r\ndignity. Everything was done according to ritual, according to the rigid\r\nordinances of their religion. Their dead one rests in peace.\r\n\r\nThe following morning at daybreak there was an indescribable commotion\r\nin Etretat. Some insisted that they had burned a man alive, others that\r\nthey were trying to hide a crime, some that the mayor would be put in\r\njail, others that the Indian prince had succumbed to an attack of\r\ncholera.\r\n\r\nThe men were amazed, the women indignant. A crowd of people spent the\r\nday on the site of the funeral pile, looking for fragments of bone in\r\nthe shingle that was still warm. They found enough bones to reconstruct\r\nten skeletons, for the farmers on shore frequently throw their dead\r\nsheep into the sea. The finders carefully placed these various fragments\r\nin their pocketbooks. But not one of them possesses a true particle of\r\nthe Indian prince.\r\n\r\nThat very night a deputy sent by the government came to hold an inquest.\r\nHe, however, formed an estimate of this singular case like a man of\r\nintelligence and good sense. But what should he say in his report?\r\n\r\nThe East Indians declared that if they had been prevented in France from\r\ncremating their dead they would have taken him to a freer country where\r\nthey could have carried out their customs.\r\n\r\nThus, I have seen a man cremated on a funeral pile, and it has given me\r\na wish to disappear in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIn this way everything ends at once. Man expedites the slow work of\r\nnature, instead of delaying it by the hideous coffin in which one\r\ndecomposes for months. The flesh is dead, the spirit has fled. Fire\r\nwhich purifies disperses in a few hours all that was a human being; it\r\ncasts it to the winds, converting it into air and ashes, and not into\r\nignominious corruption.\r\n\r\nThis is clean and hygienic. Putrefaction beneath the ground in a closed\r\nbox where the body becomes like pap, a blackened, stinking pap, has\r\nabout it something repugnant and disgusting. The sight of the coffin as\r\nit descends into this muddy hole wrings one's heart with anguish. But\r\nthe funeral pyre which flames up beneath the sky has about it something\r\ngrand, beautiful and solemn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTI\r\n\r\nI was very much interested at that time in a droll little woman. She was\r\nmarried, of course, as I have a horror of unmarried flirts. What\r\nenjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and\r\nyet belongs to any one? And, besides, morality aside, I do not\r\nunderstand love as a trade. That disgusts me somewhat.\r\n\r\nThe especial attraction in a married woman to a bachelor is that she\r\ngives him a home, a sweet, pleasant home where every one takes care of\r\nyou and spoils you, from the husband to the servants. One finds\r\neverything combined there, love, friendship, even fatherly interest, bed\r\nand board, all, in fact, that constitutes the happiness of life, with\r\nthis incalculable advantage, that one can change one's family from time\r\nto time, take up one's abode in all kinds of society in turn: in summer,\r\nin the country with the workman who rents you a room in his house; in\r\nwinter with the townsfolk, or even with the nobility, if one is\r\nambitious.\r\n\r\nI have another weakness; it is that I become attached to the husband as\r\nwell as the wife. I acknowledge even that some husbands, ordinary or\r\ncoarse as they may be, give me a feeling of disgust for their wives,\r\nhowever charming they may be. But when the husband is intellectual or\r\ncharming I invariably become very much attached to him. I am careful if\r\nI quarrel with the wife not to quarrel with the husband. In this way I\r\nhave made some of my best friends, and have also proved in many cases\r\nthe incontestable superiority of the male over the female in the human\r\nspecies. The latter makes all sorts of trouble-scenes, reproaches, etc.;\r\nwhile the former, who has just as good a right to complain, treats you,\r\non the contrary, as though you were the special Providence of his\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nWell, my friend was a quaint little woman, a brunette, fanciful,\r\ncapricious, pious, superstitious, credulous as a monk, but charming. She\r\nhad a way of kissing one that I never saw in any one else\xe2\x80\x94but that was\r\nnot the attraction\xe2\x80\x94and such a soft skin! It gave me intense delight\r\nmerely to hold her hands. And an eye\xe2\x80\x94her glance was like a slow caress,\r\ndelicious and unending. Sometimes I would lean my head on her knee and\r\nwe would remain motionless, she leaning over me with that subtle,\r\nenigmatic, disturbing smile that women have, while my eyes would be\r\nraised to hers, drinking sweetly and deliciously into my heart, like a\r\nform of intoxication, the glance of her limpid blue eyes, limpid as\r\nthough they were full of thoughts of love, and blue as though they were\r\na heaven of delights.\r\n\r\nHer husband, inspector of some large public works, was frequently away\r\nfrom home and left us our evenings free. Sometimes I spent them with her\r\nlounging on the divan with my forehead on one of her knees; while on the\r\nother lay an enormous black cat called \xe2\x80\x9cMisti,\xe2\x80\x9d whom she adored. Our\r\nfingers would meet on the cat's back and would intertwine in her soft\r\nsilky fur. I felt its warm body against my cheek, trembling with its\r\neternal purring, and occasionally a paw would reach out and place on my\r\nmouth, or my eyelid, five unsheathed claws which would prick my eyelids,\r\nand then be immediately withdrawn.\r\n\r\nSometimes we would go out on what we called our escapades. They were\r\nvery innocent, however. They consisted in taking supper at some inn in\r\nthe suburbs, or else, after dining at her house or at mine, in making\r\nthe round of the cheap cafes, like students out for a lark.\r\n\r\nWe would go into the common drinking places and take our seats at the\r\nend of the smoky den on two rickety chairs, at an old wooden table. A\r\ncloud of pungent smoke, with which blended an odor of fried fish from\r\ndinner, filled the room. Men in smocks were talking in loud tones as\r\nthey drank their petits verres, and the astonished waiter placed before\r\nus two cherry brandies.\r\n\r\nShe, trembling, charmingly afraid, would raise her double black veil as\r\nfar as her nose, and then take up her glass with the enjoyment that one\r\nfeels at doing something delightfully naughty. Each cherry she swallowed\r\nmade her feel as if she had done something wrong, each swallow of the\r\nburning liquor had on her the affect of a delicate and forbidden\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nThen she would say to me in a low tone: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go.\xe2\x80\x9d And we would leave,\r\nshe walking quickly with lowered head between the drinkers who watched\r\nher going by with a look of displeasure. And as soon as we got into the\r\nstreet she would give a great sigh of relief, as if we had escaped some\r\nterrible danger.\r\n\r\nSometimes she would ask me with a shudder:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose they, should say something rude to me in those places, what\r\nwould you do?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I would defend you, parbleu!\xe2\x80\x9d I would reply in a\r\nresolute manner. And she would squeeze my arm for happiness, perhaps\r\nwith a vague wish that she might be insulted and protected, that she\r\nmight see men fight on her account, even those men, with me!\r\n\r\nOne evening as we sat at a table in a tavern at Montmartre, we saw an\r\nold woman in tattered garments come in, holding in her hand a pack of\r\ndirty cards. Perceiving a lady, the old woman at once approached us and\r\noffered to tell my friend's fortune. Emma, who in her heart believed in\r\neverything, was trembling with longing and anxiety, and she made a place\r\nbeside her for the old woman.\r\n\r\nThe latter, old, wrinkled, her eyes with red inflamed rings round them,\r\nand her mouth without a single tooth in it, began to deal her dirty\r\ncards on the table. She dealt them in piles, then gathered them up, and\r\nthen dealt them out again, murmuring indistinguishable words. Emma,\r\nturning pale, listened with bated breath, gasping with anxiety and\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nThe fortune-teller broke silence. She predicted vague happenings:\r\nhappiness and children, a fair young man, a voyage, money, a lawsuit, a\r\ndark man, the return of some one, success, a death. The mention of this\r\ndeath attracted the younger woman's attention. \xe2\x80\x9cWhose death? When? In\r\nwhat manner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that, these cards are not certain\r\nenough. You must come to my place to-morrow; I will tell you about it\r\nwith coffee grounds which never make a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma turned anxiously to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, let us go there to-morrow. Oh, please say yes. If not, you cannot\r\nimagine how worried I shall be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go if you wish it, dearie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman gave us her address. She lived on the sixth floor, in a\r\nwretched house behind the Buttes-Chaumont. We went there the following\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHer room, an attic containing two chairs and a bed, was filled with\r\nstrange objects, bunches of herbs hanging from nails, skins of animals,\r\nflasks and phials containing liquids of various colors. On the table a\r\nstuffed black cat looked out of eyes of glass. He seemed like the demon\r\nof this sinister dwelling.\r\n\r\nEmma, almost fainting with emotion, sat down on a chair and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, look at that cat; how like it is to Misti.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she explained to the old woman that she had a cat \xe2\x80\x9cexactly like\r\nthat, exactly like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman replied gravely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are in love with a man, you must not keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma, suddenly filled with fear, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman sat down familiarly beside her and took her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the undoing of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nMy friend wanted to hear about it. She leaned against the old woman,\r\nquestioned her, begged her to tell. At length the woman agreed to do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved that cat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cas one would love a brother. I was young\r\nthen and all alone, a seamstress. I had only him, Mouton. One of the\r\ntenants had given it to me. He was as intelligent as a child, and gentle\r\nas well, and he worshiped me, my dear lady, he worshiped me more than\r\none does a fetish. All day long he would sit on my lap purring, and all\r\nnight long on my pillow; I could feel his heart beating, in fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I happened to make an acquaintance, a fine young man who was\r\nworking in a white-goods house. That went on for about three months on a\r\nfooting of mere friendship. But you know one is liable to weaken, it may\r\nhappen to any one, and, besides, I had really begun to love him. He was\r\nso nice, so nice, and so good. He wanted us to live together, for\r\neconomy's sake. I finally allowed him to come and see me one evening. I\r\nhad not made up my mind to anything definite; oh, no! But I was pleased\r\nat the idea that we should spend an hour together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first he behaved very well, said nice things to me that made my\r\nheart go pit-a-pat. And then he kissed me, madame, kissed me as one does\r\nwhen they love. I remained motionless, my eyes closed, in a paroxysm of\r\nhappiness. But, suddenly, I felt him start violently and he gave a\r\nscream, a scream that I shall never forget. I opened my eyes and saw\r\nthat Mouton had sprung at his face and was tearing the skin with his\r\nclaws as if it had been a linen rag. And the blood was streaming down\r\nlike rain, madame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to take the cat away, but he held on tight, scratching all the\r\ntime; and he bit me, he was so crazy. I finally got him and threw him\r\nout of the window, which was open, for it was summer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I began to bathe my poor friend's face, I noticed that his eyes\r\nwere destroyed, both his eyes!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had to go to the hospital. He died of grief at the end of a year. I\r\nwanted to keep him with me and provide for him, but he would not agree\r\nto it. One would have supposed that he hated me after the occurrence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for Mouton, his back was broken by the fall, The janitor picked up\r\nhis body. I had him stuffed, for in spite of all I was fond of him. If\r\nhe acted as he did it was because he loved me, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman was silent and began to stroke the lifeless animal whose\r\nbody trembled on its iron framework.\r\n\r\nEmma, with sorrowful heart, had forgotten about the predicted death\xe2\x80\x94or,\r\nat least, she did not allude to it again, and she left, giving the woman\r\nfive francs.\r\n\r\nAs her husband was to return the following day, I did not go to the\r\nhouse for several days. When I did go I was surprised at not seeing\r\nMisti. I asked where he was.\r\n\r\nShe blushed and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave him away. I was uneasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUneasy? Uneasy? What about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave me a long kiss and said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was uneasy about your eyes, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMisti appeared in. Gil Blas of January 22, 1884, over the signature of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMAUFRIGNEUSE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME HERMET\r\n\r\nCrazy people attract me. They live in a mysterious land of weird dreams,\r\nin that impenetrable cloud of dementia where all that they have\r\nwitnessed in their previous life, all they have loved, is reproduced for\r\nthem in an imaginary existence, outside of all laws that govern the\r\nthings of this life and control human thought.\r\n\r\nFor them there is no such thing as the impossible, nothing is\r\nimprobable; fairyland is a constant quantity and the supernatural quite\r\nfamiliar. The old rampart, logic; the old wall, reason; the old main\r\nstay of thought, good sense, break down, fall and crumble before their\r\nimagination, set free and escaped into the limitless realm of fancy, and\r\nadvancing with fabulous bounds, and nothing can check it. For them\r\neverything happens, and anything may happen. They make no effort to\r\nconquer events, to overcome resistance, to overturn obstacles. By a\r\nsudden caprice of their flighty imagination they become princes,\r\nemperors, or gods, are possessed of all the wealth of the world, all the\r\ndelightful things of life, enjoy all pleasures, are always strong,\r\nalways beautiful, always young, always beloved! They, alone, can be\r\nhappy in this world; for, as far as they are concerned, reality does not\r\nexist. I love to look into their wandering intelligence as one leans\r\nover an abyss at the bottom of which seethes a foaming torrent whose\r\nsource and destination are both unknown.\r\n\r\nBut it is in vain that we lean over these abysses, for we shall never\r\ndiscover the source nor the destination of this water. After all, it is\r\nonly water, just like what is flowing in the sunlight, and we shall\r\nlearn nothing by looking at it.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise of no use to ponder over the intelligence of crazy\r\npeople, for their most weird notions are, in fact, only ideas that are\r\nalready known, which appear strange simply because they are no longer\r\nunder the restraint of reason. Their whimsical source surprises us\r\nbecause we do not see it bubbling up. Doubtless the dropping of a little\r\nstone into the current was sufficient to cause these ebullitions.\r\nNevertheless crazy people attract me and I always return to them, drawn\r\nin spite of myself by this trivial mystery of dementia.\r\n\r\nOne day as I was visiting one of the asylums the physician who was my\r\nguide said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I will show you an interesting case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he opened the door of a cell where a woman of about forty, still\r\nhandsome, was seated in a large armchair, looking persistently at her\r\nface in a little hand mirror.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw us she rose to her feet, ran to the other end of the\r\nroom, picked up a veil that lay on a chair, wrapped it carefully round\r\nher face, then came back, nodding her head in reply to our greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9chow are you this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ill, monsieur, very ill. The marks are increasing every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied in a tone of conviction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; oh, no; I assure you that you are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew near to him and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I am certain of it. I counted ten pittings more this morning, three\r\non the right cheek, four on the left cheek, and three on the forehead.\r\nIt is frightful, frightful! I shall never dare to let any one see me,\r\nnot even my son; no, not even him! I am lost, I am disfigured forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fell back in her armchair and began to sob.\r\n\r\nThe doctor took a chair, sat down beside her, and said soothingly in a\r\ngentle tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let me see; I assure you it is nothing. With a slight\r\ncauterization I will make it all disappear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head in denial, without speaking. He tried to touch her\r\nveil, but she seized it with both hands so violently that her fingers\r\nwent through it.\r\n\r\nHe continued to reason with her and reassure her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, you know very well that I remove those horrid pits every time and\r\nthat there is no trace of them after I have treated them. If you do not\r\nlet me see them I cannot cure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not mind your seeing them,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not know that\r\ngentleman who is with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a doctor also, who can give you better care than I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then allowed her face to be uncovered, but her dread, her emotion,\r\nher shame at being seen brought a rosy flush to her face and her neck,\r\ndown to the collar of her dress. She cast down her eyes, turned her face\r\naside, first to the right; then to the left, to avoid our gaze and\r\nstammered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is torture to me to let myself be seen like this! It is\r\nhorrible, is it not? Is it not horrible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at her in much surprise, for there was nothing on her face, not\r\na mark, not a spot, not a sign of one, nor a scar.\r\n\r\nShe turned towards me, her eyes still lowered, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was while taking care of my son that I caught this fearful disease,\r\nmonsieur. I saved him, but I am disfigured. I sacrificed my beauty to\r\nhim, to my poor child. However, I did my duty, my conscience is at rest.\r\nIf I suffer it is known only to God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor had drawn from his coat pocket a fine water-color paint\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me attend to it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will put it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her right cheek, and he began by touching it lightly with\r\nthe brush here and there, as though he were putting little points of\r\npaint on it. He did the same with the left cheek, then with the chin,\r\nand the forehead, and then exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, there is nothing there now, nothing at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up the mirror, gazed at her reflection with profound, eager\r\nattention, with a strong mental effort to discover something, then she\r\nsighed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It hardly shows at all. I am infinitely obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor had risen. He bowed to her, ushered me out and followed me,\r\nand, as soon as he had locked the door, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the history of this unhappy woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer name is Mme. Hermet. She was once very beautiful, a great coquette,\r\nvery much beloved and very much in-love with life.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those women who have nothing but their beauty and their\r\nlove of admiration to sustain, guide or comfort them in this life. The\r\nconstant anxiety to retain her freshness, the care of her complexion, of\r\nher hands, her teeth, of every portion of body that was visible,\r\noccupied all her time and all her attention.\r\n\r\nShe became a widow, with one son. The boy was brought up as are all\r\nchildren of society beauties. She was, however, very fond of him.\r\n\r\nHe grew up, and she grew older. Whether she saw the fatal crisis\r\napproaching, I cannot say. Did she, like so many others, gaze for hours\r\nand hours at her skin, once so fine, so transparent and free from\r\nblemish, now beginning to shrivel slightly, to be crossed with a\r\nthousand little lines, as yet imperceptible, that will grow deeper day\r\nby day, month by month? Did she also see slowly, but surely, increasing\r\ntraces of those long wrinkles on the forehead, those slender serpents\r\nthat nothing can check? Did she suffer the torture, the abominable\r\ntorture of the mirror, the little mirror with the silver handle which\r\none cannot make up one's mind to lay down on the table, but then throws\r\ndown in disgust only to take it up again in order to look more closely,\r\nand still more closely at the hateful and insidious approaches of old\r\nage? Did she shut herself up ten times, twenty times a day, leaving her\r\nfriends chatting in the drawing-room, and go up to her room where, under\r\nthe protection of bolts and bars, she would again contemplate the work\r\nof time on her ripe beauty, now beginning to wither, and recognize with\r\ndespair the gradual progress of the process which no one else had as yet\r\nseemed to perceive, but of which she, herself, was well aware. She knows\r\nwhere to seek the most serious, the gravest traces of age. And the\r\nmirror, the little round hand-glass in its carved silver frame, tells\r\nher horrible things; for it speaks, it seems to laugh, it jeers and\r\ntells her all that is going to occur, all the physical discomforts and\r\nthe atrocious mental anguish she will suffer until the day of her death,\r\nwhich will be the day of her deliverance.\r\n\r\nDid she weep, distractedly, on her knees, her forehead to the ground,\r\nand pray, pray, pray to Him who thus slays his creatures and gives them\r\nyouth only that he may render old age more unendurable, and lends them\r\nbeauty only that he may withdraw it almost immediately? Did she pray to\r\nHim, imploring Him to do for her what He has never yet done for any one,\r\nto let her retain until her last day her charm, her freshness and her\r\ngracefulness? Then, finding that she was imploring in vain an inflexible\r\nUnknown who drives on the years, one after another, did she roll on the\r\ncarpet in her room, knocking her head against the furniture and stifling\r\nin her throat shrieks of despair?\r\n\r\nDoubtless she suffered these tortures, for this is what occurred:\r\n\r\nOne day (she was then thirty-five) her son aged fifteen, fell ill.\r\n\r\nHe took to his bed without any one being able to determine the cause or\r\nnature of his illness.\r\n\r\nHis tutor, a priest, watched beside him and hardly ever left him, while\r\nMme. Hermet came morning and evening to inquire how he was.\r\n\r\nShe would come into the room in the morning in her night wrapper,\r\nsmiling, all powdered and perfumed, and would ask as she entered the\r\ndoor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, George, are you better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe big boy, his face red, swollen and showing the ravages of fever,\r\nwould reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, little mother, a little better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would stay in the room a few seconds, look at the bottles of\r\nmedicine, and purse her lips as if she were saying \xe2\x80\x9cphew,\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nwould suddenly exclaim: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I forgot something very important,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwould run out of the room leaving behind her a fragrance of choice\r\ntoilet perfumes.\r\n\r\nIn the evening she would appear in a decollete dress, in a still greater\r\nhurry, for she was always late, and she had just time to inquire:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what does the doctor say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest would reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not yet given an opinion, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut one evening the abbe replied: \xe2\x80\x9cMadame, your son has got the small-\r\npox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uttered a scream of terror and fled from the room.\r\n\r\nWhen her maid came to her room the following morning she noticed at once\r\na strong odor of burnt sugar, and she found her mistress, with wide-open\r\neyes, her face pale from lack of sleep, and shivering with terror in her\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the shutters were opened Mme. Herrnet asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not at all well to-day, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not rise until noon, when she ate two eggs with a cup of tea, as\r\nif she herself had been ill, and then she went out to a druggist's to\r\ninquire about prophylactic measures against the contagion of small-pox.\r\n\r\nShe did not come home until dinner time, laden with medicine bottles,\r\nand shut herself up at once in her room, where she saturated herself\r\nwith disinfectants.\r\n\r\nThe priest was waiting for her in the dining-room. As soon as she saw\r\nhim she exclaimed in a voice full of emotion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo improvement. The doctor is very anxious:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to cry and could eat nothing, she was so worried.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as soon as it was light, she sent to inquire for her son,\r\nbut there was no improvement and she spent the whole day in her room,\r\nwhere little braziers were giving out pungent odors. Her maid said also\r\nthat you could hear her sighing all the evening.\r\n\r\nShe spent a whole week in this manner, only going out for an hour or two\r\nduring the afternoon to breathe the air.\r\n\r\nShe now sent to make inquiries every hour, and would sob when the\r\nreports were unfavorable.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the eleventh day the priest, having been announced,\r\nentered her room, his face grave and pale, and said, without taking the\r\nchair she offered him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, your son is very ill and wishes to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fell on her knees, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! Oh, my God! I would never dare! My God! My God! Help me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor holds out little hope, madame, and George is expecting you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he left the room.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later as the young lad, feeling himself dying, again asked for\r\nhis mother, the abbe went to her again and found her still on her knees,\r\nstill weeping and repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not . . . . I will not. . . . I am too much afraid . . . . I\r\nwill not. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to persuade her, to strengthen her, to lead her. He only\r\nsucceeded in bringing on an attack of \xe2\x80\x9cnerves\xe2\x80\x9d that lasted some time and\r\ncaused her to shriek.\r\n\r\nThe doctor when he came in the evening was told of this cowardice and\r\ndeclared that he would bring her in himself, of her own volition, or by\r\nforce. But after trying all manner of argument and just as he seized her\r\nround the waist to carry her into her son's room, she caught hold of the\r\ndoor and clung to it so firmly that they could not drag her away. Then\r\nwhen they let go of her she fell at the feet of the doctor, begging his\r\nforgiveness and acknowledging that she was a wretched creature. And then\r\nshe exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is not going to die; tell me that he is not going\r\nto die, I beg of you; tell him that I love him, that I worship him. . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lad was dying. Feeling that he had only a few moments more to\r\nlive, he entreated that his mother be persuaded to come and bid him a\r\nlast farewell. With that sort of presentiment that the dying sometimes\r\nhave, he had understood, had guessed all, and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf she is afraid\r\nto come into the room, beg her just to come on the balcony as far as my\r\nwindow so that I may see her, at least, so that I may take a farewell\r\nlook at her, as I cannot kiss her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the abbe, once more, went together to this woman and\r\nassured her: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will run no risk, for there will be a pane of glass\r\nbetween you and him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe consented, covered up her head, and took with her a bottle of\r\nsmelling salts. She took three steps on the balcony; then, all at once,\r\nhiding her face in her hands, she moaned: \xe2\x80\x9cNo . . . no . . . I would\r\nnever dare to look at him . . . never. . . . I am too much ashamed . . .\r\ntoo much afraid . . . . No . . . I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey endeavored to drag her along, but she held on with both hands to\r\nthe railings and uttered such plaints that the passers-by in the street\r\nraised their heads. And the dying boy waited, his eyes turned towards\r\nthat window, waited to die until he could see for the last time the\r\nsweet, beloved face, the worshiped face of his mother.\r\n\r\nHe waited long, and night came on. Then he turned over with his face to\r\nthe wall and was silent.\r\n\r\nWhen day broke he was dead. The day following she was crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC COUCH\r\n\r\nThe Seine flowed past my house, without a ripple on its surface, and\r\ngleaming in the bright morning sunlight. It was a beautiful, broad,\r\nindolent silver stream, with crimson lights here and there; and on the\r\nopposite side of the river were rows of tall trees that covered all the\r\nbank with an immense wall of verdure.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of life which is renewed each day, of fresh, happy, loving\r\nlife trembled in the leaves, palpitated in the air, was mirrored in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe postman had just brought my papers, which were handed to me, and I\r\nwalked slowly to the river bank in order to read them.\r\n\r\nIn the first paper I opened I noticed this headline, \xe2\x80\x9cStatistics of\r\nSuicides,\xe2\x80\x9d and I read that more than 8,500 persons had killed themselves\r\nin that year.\r\n\r\nIn a moment I seemed to see them! I saw this voluntary and hideous\r\nmassacre of the despairing who were weary of life. I saw men bleeding,\r\ntheir jaws fractured, their skulls cloven, their breasts pierced by a\r\nbullet, slowly dying, alone in a little room in a hotel, giving no\r\nthought to their wound, but thinking only of their misfortunes.\r\n\r\nI saw others seated before a tumbler in which some matches were soaking,\r\nor before a little bottle with a red label.\r\n\r\nThey would look at it fixedly without moving; then they would drink and\r\nawait the result; then a spasm would convulse their cheeks and draw\r\ntheir lips together; their eyes would grow wild with terror, for they\r\ndid not know that the end would be preceded by so much suffering.\r\n\r\nThey rose to their feet, paused, fell over and with their hands pressed\r\nto their stomachs they felt their internal organs on fire, their\r\nentrails devoured by the fiery liquid, before their minds began to grow\r\ndim.\r\n\r\nI saw others hanging from a nail in the wall, from the fastening of the\r\nwindow, from a hook in the ceiling, from a beam in the garret, from a\r\nbranch of a tree amid the evening rain. And I surmised all that had\r\nhappened before they hung there motionless, their tongues hanging out of\r\ntheir mouths. I imagined the anguish of their heart, their final\r\nhesitation, their attempts to fasten the rope, to determine that it was\r\nsecure, then to pass the noose round their neck and to let themselves\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nI saw others lying on wretched beds, mothers with their little children,\r\nold men dying of hunger, young girls dying for love, all rigid,\r\nsuffocated, asphyxiated, while in the center of the room the brasier\r\nstill gave forth the fumes of charcoal.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw others walking at night along the deserted bridges. These were\r\nthe most sinister. The water flowed under the arches with a low sound.\r\nThey did not see it . . . they guessed at it from its cool breath! They\r\nlonged for it and they feared it. They dared not do it! And yet, they\r\nmust. A distant clock sounded the hour and, suddenly, in the vast\r\nsilence of the night, there was heard the splash of a body falling into\r\nthe river, a scream or two, the sound of hands beating the water, and\r\nall was still. Sometimes, even, there was only the sound of the falling\r\nbody when they had tied their arms down or fastened a stone to their\r\nfeet. Oh, the poor things, the poor things, the poor things, how I felt\r\ntheir anguish, how I died in their death! I went through all their\r\nwretchedness; I endured in one hour all their tortures. I knew all the\r\nsorrows that had led them to this, for I know the deceitful infamy of\r\nlife, and no one has felt it more than I have.\r\n\r\nHow I understood them, these who weak, harassed by misfortune, having\r\nlost those they loved, awakened from the dream of a tardy compensation,\r\nfrom the illusion of another existence where God will finally be just,\r\nafter having been ferocious, and their minds disabused of the mirages of\r\nhappiness, have given up the fight and desire to put an end to this\r\nceaseless tragedy, or this shameful comedy.\r\n\r\nSuicide! Why, it is the strength of those whose strength is exhausted,\r\nthe hope of those who no longer believe, the sublime courage of the\r\nconquered! Yes, there is at least one door to this life we can always\r\nopen and pass through to the other side. Nature had an impulse of pity;\r\nshe did not shut us up in prison. Mercy for the despairing!\r\n\r\nAs for those who are simply disillusioned, let them march ahead with\r\nfree soul and quiet heart. They have nothing to fear since they may take\r\ntheir leave; for behind them there is always this door that the gods of\r\nour illusions cannot even lock.\r\n\r\nI thought of this crowd of suicides: more than eight thousand five\r\nhundred in one year. And it seemed to me that they had combined to send\r\nto the world a prayer, to utter a cry of appeal, to demand something\r\nthat should come into effect later when we understood things better. It\r\nseemed to me that all these victims, their throats cut, poisoned, hung,\r\nasphyxiated, or drowned, all came together, a frightful horde, like\r\ncitizens to the polls, to say to society:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrant us, at least, a gentle death! Help us to die, you who will not\r\nhelp us to live! See, we are numerous, we have the right to speak in\r\nthese days of freedom, of philosophic independence and of popular\r\nsuffrage. Give to those who renounce life the charity of a death that\r\nwill not be repugnant nor terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to dream, allowing my fancy to roam at will in weird and\r\nmysterious fashion on this subject.\r\n\r\nI seemed to be all at once in a beautiful city. It was Paris; but at\r\nwhat period? I walked about the streets, looking at the houses, the\r\ntheaters, the public buildings, and presently found myself in a square\r\nwhere I remarked a large building; very handsome, dainty and attractive.\r\nI was surprised on reading on the facade this inscription in letters of\r\ngold, \xe2\x80\x9cSuicide Bureau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, the weirdness of waking dreams where the spirit soars into a world\r\nof unrealities and possibilities! Nothing astonishes one, nothing shocks\r\none; and the unbridled fancy makes no distinction between the comic and\r\nthe tragic.\r\n\r\nI approached the building where footmen in knee-breeches were seated in\r\nthe vestibule in front of a cloak-room as they do at the entrance of a\r\nclub.\r\n\r\nI entered out of curiosity. One of the men rose and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does monsieur wish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know what building this is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen would monsieur like me to take him to the Secretary of the\r\nBureau?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will not that disturb him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, monsieur, he is here to receive those who desire information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, lead the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took me through corridors where old gentlemen were chatting, and\r\nfinally led me into a beautiful office, somewhat somber, furnished\r\nthroughout in black wood. A stout young man with a corporation was\r\nwriting a letter as he smoked a cigar, the fragrance of which gave\r\nevidence of its quality.\r\n\r\nHe rose. We bowed to each other, and as soon as the footman had retired\r\nhe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cpardon my curiosity. I had never seen this\r\nestablishment. The few words inscribed on the facade filled me with\r\nastonishment, and I wanted to know what was going on here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled before replying, then said in a low tone with a complacent\r\nair:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, monsieur, we put to death in a cleanly and gentle\xe2\x80\x94I do not\r\nventure to say agreeable manner those persons who desire to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not feel very shocked, for it really seemed to me natural and\r\nright. What particularly surprised me was that on this planet, with its\r\nlow, utilitarian, humanitarian ideals, selfish and coercive of all true\r\nfreedom, any one should venture on a similar enterprise, worthy of an\r\nemancipated humanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of suicides increased so enormously\r\nduring the five years succeeding the world exposition of 1889 that some\r\nmeasures were urgently needed. People killed themselves in the streets,\r\nat fetes, in restaurants, at the theater, in railway carriages, at the\r\nreceptions held by the President of the Republic, everywhere. It was not\r\nonly a horrid sight for those who love life, as I do, but also a bad\r\nexample for children. Hence it became necessary to centralize suicides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat caused this suicidal epidemic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. The fact is, I believe, the world is growing old. People\r\nbegin to see things clearly and they are getting disgruntled. It is the\r\nsame to-day with destiny as with the government, we have found out what\r\nit is; people find that they are swindled in every direction, and they\r\njust get out of it all. When one discovers that Providence lies, cheats,\r\nrobs, deceives human beings just as a plain Deputy deceives his\r\nconstituents, one gets angry, and as one cannot nominate a fresh\r\nProvidence every three months as we do with our privileged\r\nrepresentatives, one just gets out of the whole thing, which is\r\ndecidedly bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as for me, I am not complaining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you inform me how you carry on this establishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure. You may become a member when you please. It is a club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA club!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, founded by the most eminent men in the country, by men\r\nof the highest intellect and brightest intelligence. And,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nlaughing heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you that every one gets a great deal of\r\nenjoyment out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, they enjoy themselves because they have not that fear of\r\ndeath which is the great killjoy in all our earthly pleasures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should they be members of this club if they do not kill\r\nthemselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne may be a member of the club without being obliged for that reason\r\nto commit suicide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will explain. In view of the enormous increase in suicides, and of\r\nthe hideous spectacle they presented, a purely benevolent society was\r\nformed for the protection of those in despair, which placed at their\r\ndisposal the facilities for a peaceful, painless, if not unforeseen\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can have authorized such an institution?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Boulanger during his brief tenure of power. He could never\r\nrefuse anything. However, that was the only good thing he did. Hence, a\r\nsociety was formed of clear-sighted, disillusioned skeptics who desired\r\nto erect in the heart of Paris a kind of temple dedicated to the\r\ncontempt for death. This place was formerly a dreaded spot that no one\r\nventured to approach. Then its founders, who met together here, gave a\r\ngrand inaugural entertainment with Mmes. Sarah Bernhardt, Judic, Theo,\r\nGranier, and twenty others, and Mme. de Reske, Coquelin, Mounet-Sully,\r\nPaulus, etc., present, followed by concerts, the comedies of Dumas, of\r\nMeilhac, Halevy and Sardon. We had only one thing to mar it, one drama\r\nby Becque which seemed sad, but which subsequently had a great success\r\nat the Comedie-Francaise. In fact all Paris came. The enterprise was\r\nlaunched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the midst of the festivities! What a funereal joke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. Death need not be sad, it should be a matter of\r\nindifference. We made death cheerful, crowned it with flowers, covered\r\nit with perfume, made it easy. One learns to aid others through example;\r\none can see that it is nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can well understand that they should come to the entertainments; but\r\ndid they come to . . . Death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at first; they were afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd later?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn crowds. We have had more than forty in a day. One finds hardly any\r\nmore drowned bodies in the Seine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA club member.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a sacrifice to the cause?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't think so. A man who was sick of everything, a 'down and out'\r\nwho had lost heavily at baccarat for three months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second was an Englishman, an eccentric. We then advertised in the\r\npapers, we gave an account of our methods, we invented some attractive\r\ninstances. But the great impetus was given by poor people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you go to work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to see? I can explain at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took his hat, opened the door, allowed me to precede him, and we\r\nentered a card room, where men sat playing as they, play in all gambling\r\nplaces. They were chatting cheerfully, eagerly. I have seldom seen such\r\na jolly, lively, mirthful club.\r\n\r\nAs I seemed surprised, the secretary said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the establishment has an unheard of prestige. All the smart people\r\nall over the world belong to it so as to appear as though they held\r\ndeath in scorn. Then, once they get here, they feel obliged to be\r\ncheerful that they may not appear to be afraid. So they joke and laugh\r\nand talk flippantly, they are witty and they become so. At present it is\r\ncertainly the most frequented and the most entertaining place in Paris.\r\nThe women are even thinking of building an annex for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, in spite of all this, you have many suicides in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I said, about forty or fifty a day. Society people are rare, but\r\npoor devils abound. The middle class has also a large contingent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how . . . do they do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are asphyxiated . . . very slowly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what manner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gas of our own invention. We have the patent. On the other side of\r\nthe building are the public entrances\xe2\x80\x94three little doors opening on\r\nsmall streets. When a man or a woman present themselves they are\r\ninterrogated. Then they are offered assistance, aid, protection. If a\r\nclient accepts, inquiries are made; and sometimes we have saved their\r\nlives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you get your money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a great deal. There are a large number of shareholders. Besides\r\nit is fashionable to contribute to the establishment. The names of the\r\ndonors are published in Figaro. Then the suicide of every rich man costs\r\na thousand francs. And they look as if they were lying in state. It\r\ncosts the poor nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you tell who is poor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, monsieur, we can guess! And, besides, they must bring a\r\ncertificate of indigency from the commissary of police of their\r\ndistrict. If you knew how distressing it is to see them come in! I\r\nvisited their part of our building once only, and I will never go again.\r\nThe place itself is almost as good as this part, almost as luxurious and\r\ncomfortable; but they themselves . . . they themselves!!! If you could\r\nsee them arriving, the old men in rags coming to die; persons who have\r\nbeen dying of misery for months, picking up their food at the edges of\r\nthe curbstone like dogs in the street; women in rags, emaciated, sick,\r\nparalyzed, incapable of making a living, who say to us after they have\r\ntold us their story: 'You see that things cannot go on like that, as I\r\ncannot work any longer or earn anything.' I saw one woman of eighty-\r\nseven who had lost all her children and grandchildren, and who for the\r\nlast six weeks had been sleeping out of doors. It made me ill to hear of\r\nit. Then we have so many different cases, without counting those who say\r\nnothing, but simply ask: 'Where is it?' These are admitted at once and\r\nit is all over in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a pang at my heart I repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd . . . where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d and he opened a door, adding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in; this is the part specially reserved for club members, and the\r\none least used. We have so far had only eleven annihilations here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You call that an . . . annihilation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur. Go in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated. At length I went in. It was a wide corridor, a sort of\r\ngreenhouse in which panes of glass of pale blue, tender pink and\r\ndelicate green gave the poetic charm of landscapes to the inclosing\r\nwalls. In this pretty salon there were divans, magnificent palms,\r\nflowers, especially roses of balmy fragrance, books on the tables, the\r\nRevue des Deuxmondes, cigars in government boxes, and, what surprised\r\nme, Vichy pastilles in a bonbonniere.\r\n\r\nAs I expressed my surprise, my guide said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they often come here to chat.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe public corridors\r\nare similar, but more simply furnished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn reply to a question of mine, he pointed to a couch covered with\r\ncreamy crepe de Chine with white embroidery, beneath a large shrub of\r\nunknown variety at the foot of which was a circular bed of mignonette.\r\n\r\nThe secretary added in a lower tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe change the flower and the perfume at will, for our gas, which is\r\nquite imperceptible, gives death the fragrance of the suicide's favorite\r\nflower.

How goes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy dream was over. I saw the Seine distinctly in the sunlight, and,\r\ncoming along a path, the garde champetre of the district, who with his\r\nright hand touched his kepi braided in silver. I replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Marinel. Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to look at a drowned man whom they fished up near the\r\nMorillons. Another who has thrown himself into the soup. He even took\r\noff his trousers in order to tie his legs together with them.\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\ntrousers in order to tie his legs together with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Maupassant Original Short Stories\r\n(180), Complete, by Guy de Maupassant\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SHORT STORIES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3090-0.txt or 3090-0.zip ***** This and\r\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/9/3090/3090-h\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\r\nrenamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\r\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\r\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\r\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\r\nfreely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\r\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\r\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\r\nFoundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Newby Chief Executive\r\nand Director gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the\r\nnumber of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\r\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of\r\nequipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to\r\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\r\nthe IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where\r\nwe have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\r\nthe United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\r\nincluding including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\r\na copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\r\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\r\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\r\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
