Allez vous-en! Sapristi!_ That\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody\r\nunderstood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other side\r\nof the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with\r\nmaddening persistence.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of\r\ncomfort, arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.\r\n\r\nHe walked down the gallery and across the narrow \xe2\x80\x9cbridges\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nconnected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated\r\nbefore the door of the main house. The parrot and the mocking-bird were\r\nthe property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the\r\nnoise they wished. Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their\r\nsociety when they ceased to be entertaining.\r\n\r\nHe stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one\r\nfrom the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a\r\nwicker rocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task\r\nof reading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old.\r\nThe Sunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already\r\nacquainted with the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the\r\neditorials and bits of news which he had not had time to read before\r\nquitting New Orleans the day before.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium\r\nheight and rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was\r\nbrown and straight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and\r\nclosely trimmed.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked\r\nabout him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main\r\nbuilding was called \xe2\x80\x9cthe house,\xe2\x80\x9d to distinguish it from the cottages.\r\nThe chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls,\r\nthe Farival twins, were playing a duet from \xe2\x80\x9cZampa\xe2\x80\x9d upon the piano.\r\nMadame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a\r\nyard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an\r\nequally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside.\r\nShe was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves.\r\nHer starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before\r\none of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down,\r\ntelling her beads. A good many persons of the _pension_ had gone over\r\nto the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada_ in Beaudelet\xe2\x80\x99s lugger to hear mass. Some\r\nyoung people were out under the water-oaks playing croquet. Mr.\r\nPontellier\xe2\x80\x99s two children were there\xe2\x80\x94sturdy little fellows of four and\r\nfive. A quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative\r\nair.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the\r\npaper drag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade\r\nthat was advancing at snail\xe2\x80\x99s pace from the beach. He could see it\r\nplainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the\r\nstretch of yellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily\r\ninto the blue of the horizon. The sunshade continued to approach\r\nslowly. Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier,\r\nand young Robert Lebrun. When they reached the cottage, the two seated\r\nthemselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the\r\nporch, facing each other, each leaning against a supporting post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr.\r\nPontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the\r\nmorning seemed long to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are burnt beyond recognition,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking at his wife as\r\none looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered\r\nsome damage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed\r\nthem critically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking\r\nat them reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband\r\nbefore leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he,\r\nunderstanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them\r\ninto her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping\r\nher knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings\r\nsparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to\r\nthe other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the\r\nwater, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half\r\nso amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He\r\nyawned and stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind\r\nto go over to Klein\xe2\x80\x99s hotel and play a game of billiards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome go along, Lebrun,\xe2\x80\x9d he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted\r\nquite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs.\r\nPontellier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,\xe2\x80\x9d instructed\r\nher husband as he prepared to leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, take the umbrella,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He\r\naccepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps\r\nand walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing back to dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d his wife called after him. He halted a moment\r\nand shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a\r\nten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the\r\nearly dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company\r\nwhich he found over at Klein\xe2\x80\x99s and the size of \xe2\x80\x9cthe game.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not\r\nsay this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.\r\n\r\nBoth children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting\r\nout. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and\r\npeanuts.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish\r\nbrown, about the color of her hair. She had a way of turning them\r\nswiftly upon an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward\r\nmaze of contemplation or thought.\r\n\r\nHer eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and\r\nalmost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather\r\nhandsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a\r\ncertain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of\r\nfeatures. Her manner was engaging.\r\n\r\nRobert rolled a cigarette. He smoked cigarettes because he could not\r\nafford cigars, he said. He had a cigar in his pocket which Mr.\r\nPontellier had presented him with, and he was saving it for his\r\nafter-dinner smoke.\r\n\r\nThis seemed quite proper and natural on his part. In coloring he was\r\nnot unlike his companion. A clean-shaved face made the resemblance more\r\npronounced than it would otherwise have been. There rested no shadow of\r\ncare upon his open countenance. His eyes gathered in and reflected the\r\nlight and languor of the summer day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch\r\nand began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light\r\npuffs from his cigarette. They chatted incessantly: about the things\r\naround them; their amusing adventure out in the water\xe2\x80\x94it had again\r\nassumed its entertaining aspect; about the wind, the trees, the people\r\nwho had gone to the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re;_ about the children playing croquet\r\nunder the oaks, and the Farival twins, who were now performing the\r\noverture to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Poet and the Peasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobert talked a good deal about himself. He was very young, and did not\r\nknow any better. Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the\r\nsame reason. Each was interested in what the other said. Robert spoke\r\nof his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited\r\nhim. He was always intending to go to Mexico, but some way never got\r\nthere. Meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile\r\nhouse in New Orleans, where an equal familiarity with English, French\r\nand Spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent.\r\n\r\nHe was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother\r\nat Grand Isle. In former times, before Robert could remember, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x9d had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns. Now, flanked by its\r\ndozen or more cottages, which were always filled with exclusive\r\nvisitors from the \xe2\x80\x9c_Quartier Fran\xc3\xa7ais_,\xe2\x80\x9d it enabled Madame Lebrun to\r\nmaintain the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her\r\nbirthright.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier talked about her father\xe2\x80\x99s Mississippi plantation and\r\nher girlhood home in the old Kentucky blue-grass country. She was an\r\nAmerican woman, with a small infusion of French which seemed to have\r\nbeen lost in dilution. She read a letter from her sister, who was away\r\nin the East, and who had engaged herself to be married. Robert was\r\ninterested, and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were,\r\nwhat the father was like, and how long the mother had been dead.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for\r\nthe early dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see L\xc3\xa9once isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a glance in the\r\ndirection whence her husband had disappeared. Robert supposed he was\r\nnot, as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room, the young man\r\ndescended the steps and strolled over toward the croquet players,\r\nwhere, during the half-hour before dinner, he amused himself with the\r\nlittle Pontellier children, who were very fond of him.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from\r\nKlein\xe2\x80\x99s hotel. He was in an excellent humor, in high spirits, and very\r\ntalkative. His entrance awoke his wife, who was in bed and fast asleep\r\nwhen he came in. He talked to her while he undressed, telling her\r\nanecdotes and bits of news and gossip that he had gathered during the\r\nday. From his trousers pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes\r\nand a good deal of silver coin, which he piled on the bureau\r\nindiscriminately with keys, knife, handkerchief, and whatever else\r\nhappened to be in his pockets. She was overcome with sleep, and\r\nanswered him with little half utterances.\r\n\r\nHe thought it very discouraging that his wife, who was the sole object\r\nof his existence, evinced so little interest in things which concerned\r\nhim, and valued so little his conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier had forgotten the bonbons and peanuts for the boys.\r\nNotwithstanding he loved them very much, and went into the adjoining\r\nroom where they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they\r\nwere resting comfortably. The result of his investigation was far from\r\nsatisfactory. He turned and shifted the youngsters about in bed. One of\r\nthem began to kick and talk about a basket full of crabs.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier returned to his wife with the information that Raoul had\r\na high fever and needed looking after. Then he lit a cigar and went and\r\nsat near the open door to smoke it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier was quite sure Raoul had no fever. He had gone to bed\r\nperfectly well, she said, and nothing had ailed him all day. Mr.\r\nPontellier was too well acquainted with fever symptoms to be mistaken.\r\nHe assured her the child was consuming at that moment in the next room.\r\n\r\nHe reproached his wife with her inattention, her habitual neglect of\r\nthe children. If it was not a mother\xe2\x80\x99s place to look after children,\r\nwhose on earth was it? He himself had his hands full with his brokerage\r\nbusiness. He could not be in two places at once; making a living for\r\nhis family on the street, and staying at home to see that no harm\r\nbefell them. He talked in a monotonous, insistent way.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier sprang out of bed and went into the next room. She soon\r\ncame back and sat on the edge of the bed, leaning her head down on the\r\npillow. She said nothing, and refused to answer her husband when he\r\nquestioned her. When his cigar was smoked out he went to bed, and in\r\nhalf a minute he was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake. She began to cry a\r\nlittle, and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her _peignoir_. Blowing out\r\nthe candle, which her husband had left burning, she slipped her bare\r\nfeet into a pair of satin _mules_ at the foot of the bed and went out\r\non the porch, where she sat down in the wicker chair and began to rock\r\ngently to and fro.\r\n\r\nIt was then past midnight. The cottages were all dark. A single faint\r\nlight gleamed out from the hallway of the house. There was no sound\r\nabroad except the hooting of an old owl in the top of a water-oak, and\r\nthe everlasting voice of the sea, that was not uplifted at that soft\r\nhour. It broke like a mournful lullaby upon the night.\r\n\r\nThe tears came so fast to Mrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s eyes that the damp sleeve\r\nof her _peignoir_ no longer served to dry them. She was holding the\r\nback of her chair with one hand; her loose sleeve had slipped almost to\r\nthe shoulder of her uplifted arm. Turning, she thrust her face,\r\nsteaming and wet, into the bend of her arm, and she went on crying\r\nthere, not caring any longer to dry her face, her eyes, her arms. She\r\ncould not have told why she was crying. Such experiences as the\r\nforegoing were not uncommon in her married life. They seemed never\r\nbefore to have weighed much against the abundance of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkindness and a uniform devotion which had come to be tacit and\r\nself-understood.\r\n\r\nAn indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some\r\nunfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a\r\nvague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x99s summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She\r\ndid not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate,\r\nwhich had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She\r\nwas just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry\r\nover her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps.\r\n\r\nThe little stinging, buzzing imps succeeded in dispelling a mood which\r\nmight have held her there in the darkness half a night longer.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Mr. Pontellier was up in good time to take the\r\nrockaway which was to convey him to the steamer at the wharf. He was\r\nreturning to the city to his business, and they would not see him again\r\nat the Island till the coming Saturday. He had regained his composure,\r\nwhich seemed to have been somewhat impaired the night before. He was\r\neager to be gone, as he looked forward to a lively week in Carondelet\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier gave his wife half of the money which he had brought\r\naway from Klein\xe2\x80\x99s hotel the evening before. She liked money as well as\r\nmost women, and accepted it with no little satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will buy a handsome wedding present for Sister Janet!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed, smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! we\xe2\x80\x99ll treat Sister Janet better than that, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed,\r\nas he prepared to kiss her good-by.\r\n\r\nThe boys were tumbling about, clinging to his legs, imploring that\r\nnumerous things be brought back to them. Mr. Pontellier was a great\r\nfavorite, and ladies, men, children, even nurses, were always on hand\r\nto say good-by to him. His wife stood smiling and waving, the boys\r\nshouting, as he disappeared in the old rockaway down the sandy road.\r\n\r\nA few days later a box arrived for Mrs. Pontellier from New Orleans. It\r\nwas from her husband. It was filled with _friandises_, with luscious\r\nand toothsome bits\xe2\x80\x94the finest of fruits, _pat\xc3\xa9s_, a rare bottle or two,\r\ndelicious syrups, and bonbons in abundance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier was always very generous with the contents of such a\r\nbox; she was quite used to receiving them when away from home. The\r\n_pat\xc3\xa9s_ and fruit were brought to the dining-room; the bonbons were\r\npassed around. And the ladies, selecting with dainty and discriminating\r\nfingers and a little greedily, all declared that Mr. Pontellier was the\r\nbest husband in the world. Mrs. Pontellier was forced to admit that she\r\nknew of none better.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt would have been a difficult matter for Mr. Pontellier to define to\r\nhis own satisfaction or any one else\xe2\x80\x99s wherein his wife failed in her\r\nduty toward their children. It was something which he felt rather than\r\nperceived, and he never voiced the feeling without subsequent regret\r\nand ample atonement.\r\n\r\nIf one of the little Pontellier boys took a tumble whilst at play, he\r\nwas not apt to rush crying to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms for comfort; he would\r\nmore likely pick himself up, wipe the water out of his eyes and the\r\nsand out of his mouth, and go on playing. Tots as they were, they\r\npulled together and stood their ground in childish battles with doubled\r\nfists and uplifted voices, which usually prevailed against the other\r\nmother-tots. The quadroon nurse was looked upon as a huge encumbrance,\r\nonly good to button up waists and panties and to brush and part hair;\r\nsince it seemed to be a law of society that hair must be parted and\r\nbrushed.\r\n\r\nIn short, Mrs. Pontellier was not a mother-woman. The mother-women\r\nseemed to prevail that summer at Grand Isle. It was easy to know them,\r\nfluttering about with extended, protecting wings when any harm, real or\r\nimaginary, threatened their precious brood. They were women who\r\nidolized their children, worshiped their husbands, and esteemed it a\r\nholy privilege to efface themselves as individuals and grow wings as\r\nministering angels.\r\n\r\nMany of them were delicious in the role; one of them was the embodiment\r\nof every womanly grace and charm. If her husband did not adore her, he\r\nwas a brute, deserving of death by slow torture. Her name was Ad\xc3\xa8le\r\nRatignolle. There are no words to describe her save the old ones that\r\nhave served so often to picture the bygone heroine of romance and the\r\nfair lady of our dreams. There was nothing subtle or hidden about her\r\ncharms; her beauty was all there, flaming and apparent: the spun-gold\r\nhair that comb nor confining pin could restrain; the blue eyes that\r\nwere like nothing but sapphires; two lips that pouted, that were so red\r\none could only think of cherries or some other delicious crimson fruit\r\nin looking at them. She was growing a little stout, but it did not seem\r\nto detract an iota from the grace of every step, pose, gesture. One\r\nwould not have wanted her white neck a mite less full or her beautiful\r\narms more slender. Never were hands more exquisite than hers, and it\r\nwas a joy to look at them when she threaded her needle or adjusted her\r\ngold thimble to her taper middle finger as she sewed away on the little\r\nnight-drawers or fashioned a bodice or a bib.\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle was very fond of Mrs. Pontellier, and often she took\r\nher sewing and went over to sit with her in the afternoons. She was\r\nsitting there the afternoon of the day the box arrived from New\r\nOrleans. She had possession of the rocker, and she was busily engaged\r\nin sewing upon a diminutive pair of night-drawers.\r\n\r\nShe had brought the pattern of the drawers for Mrs. Pontellier to cut\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94a marvel of construction, fashioned to enclose a baby\xe2\x80\x99s body so\r\neffectually that only two small eyes might look out from the garment,\r\nlike an Eskimo\xe2\x80\x99s. They were designed for winter wear, when treacherous\r\ndrafts came down chimneys and insidious currents of deadly cold found\r\ntheir way through key-holes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s mind was quite at rest concerning the present\r\nmaterial needs of her children, and she could not see the use of\r\nanticipating and making winter night garments the subject of her summer\r\nmeditations. But she did not want to appear unamiable and uninterested,\r\nso she had brought forth newspapers, which she spread upon the floor of\r\nthe gallery, and under Madame Ratignolle\xe2\x80\x99s directions she had cut a\r\npattern of the impervious garment.\r\n\r\nRobert was there, seated as he had been the Sunday before, and Mrs.\r\nPontellier also occupied her former position on the upper step, leaning\r\nlistlessly against the post. Beside her was a box of bonbons, which she\r\nheld out at intervals to Madame Ratignolle.\r\n\r\nThat lady seemed at a loss to make a selection, but finally settled\r\nupon a stick of nougat, wondering if it were not too rich; whether it\r\ncould possibly hurt her. Madame Ratignolle had been married seven\r\nyears. About every two years she had a baby. At that time she had three\r\nbabies, and was beginning to think of a fourth one. She was always\r\ntalking about her \xe2\x80\x9ccondition.\xe2\x80\x9d Her \xe2\x80\x9ccondition\xe2\x80\x9d was in no way apparent,\r\nand no one would have known a thing about it but for her persistence in\r\nmaking it the subject of conversation.\r\n\r\nRobert started to reassure her, asserting that he had known a lady who\r\nhad subsisted upon nougat during the entire\xe2\x80\x94but seeing the color mount\r\ninto Mrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s face he checked himself and changed the subject.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier, though she had married a Creole, was not thoroughly at\r\nhome in the society of Creoles; never before had she been thrown so\r\nintimately among them. There were only Creoles that summer at Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThey all knew each other, and felt like one large family, among whom\r\nexisted the most amicable relations. A characteristic which\r\ndistinguished them and which impressed Mrs. Pontellier most forcibly\r\nwas their entire absence of prudery. Their freedom of expression was at\r\nfirst incomprehensible to her, though she had no difficulty in\r\nreconciling it with a lofty chastity which in the Creole woman seems to\r\nbe inborn and unmistakable.\r\n\r\nNever would Edna Pontellier forget the shock with which she heard\r\nMadame Ratignolle relating to old Monsieur Farival the harrowing story\r\nof one of her _accouchements_, withholding no intimate detail. She was\r\ngrowing accustomed to like shocks, but she could not keep the mounting\r\ncolor back from her cheeks. Oftener than once her coming had\r\ninterrupted the droll story with which Robert was entertaining some\r\namused group of married women.\r\n\r\nA book had gone the rounds of the _pension_. When it came her turn to\r\nread it, she did so with profound astonishment. She felt moved to read\r\nthe book in secret and solitude, though none of the others had done\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x94to hide it from view at the sound of approaching footsteps. It was\r\nopenly criticised and freely discussed at table. Mrs. Pontellier gave\r\nover being astonished, and concluded that wonders would never cease.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThey formed a congenial group sitting there that summer\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x94Madame Ratignolle sewing away, often stopping to relate a\r\nstory or incident with much expressive gesture of her perfect hands;\r\nRobert and Mrs. Pontellier sitting idle, exchanging occasional words,\r\nglances or smiles which indicated a certain advanced stage of intimacy\r\nand _camaraderie_.\r\n\r\nHe had lived in her shadow during the past month. No one thought\r\nanything of it. Many had predicted that Robert would devote himself to\r\nMrs. Pontellier when he arrived. Since the age of fifteen, which was\r\neleven years before, Robert each summer at Grand Isle had constituted\r\nhimself the devoted attendant of some fair dame or damsel. Sometimes it\r\nwas a young girl, again a widow; but as often as not it was some\r\ninteresting married woman.\r\n\r\nFor two consecutive seasons he lived in the sunlight of Mademoiselle\r\nDuvigne\xe2\x80\x99s presence. But she died between summers; then Robert posed as\r\nan inconsolable, prostrating himself at the feet of Madame Ratignolle\r\nfor whatever crumbs of sympathy and comfort she might be pleased to\r\nvouchsafe.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier liked to sit and gaze at her fair companion as she\r\nmight look upon a faultless Madonna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould any one fathom the cruelty beneath that fair exterior?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nRobert. \xe2\x80\x9cShe knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore her. It\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x98Robert, come; go; stand up; sit down; do this; do that; see if the\r\nbaby sleeps; my thimble, please, that I left God knows where. Come and\r\nread Daudet to me while I sew.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Par exemple!_ I never had to ask. You were always there under my\r\nfeet, like a troublesome cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean like an adoring dog. And just as soon as Ratignolle appeared\r\non the scene, then it _was_ like a dog. \xe2\x80\x98_Passez! Adieu! Allez\r\nvous-en!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I feared to make Alphonse jealous,\xe2\x80\x9d she interjoined, with\r\nexcessive na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9. That made them all laugh. The right hand jealous of\r\nthe left! The heart jealous of the soul! But for that matter, the\r\nCreole husband is never jealous; with him the gangrene passion is one\r\nwhich has become dwarfed by disuse.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Robert, addressing Mrs Pontellier, continued to tell of his\r\none time hopeless passion for Madame Ratignolle; of sleepless nights,\r\nof consuming flames till the very sea sizzled when he took his daily\r\nplunge. While the lady at the needle kept up a little running,\r\ncontemptuous comment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Blagueur\xe2\x80\x94farceur\xe2\x80\x94gros b\xc3\xaate, va!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with Mrs. Pontellier.\r\nShe never knew precisely what to make of it; at that moment it was\r\nimpossible for her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion\r\nwas earnest. It was understood that he had often spoken words of love\r\nto Madame Ratignolle, without any thought of being taken seriously.\r\nMrs. Pontellier was glad he had not assumed a similar role toward\r\nherself. It would have been unacceptable and annoying.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier had brought her sketching materials, which she\r\nsometimes dabbled with in an unprofessional way. She liked the\r\ndabbling. She felt in it satisfaction of a kind which no other\r\nemployment afforded her.\r\n\r\nShe had long wished to try herself on Madame Ratignolle. Never had that\r\nlady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment, seated there\r\nlike some sensuous Madonna, with the gleam of the fading day enriching\r\nher splendid color.\r\n\r\nRobert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below Mrs.\r\nPontellier, that he might watch her work. She handled her brushes with\r\na certain ease and freedom which came, not from long and close\r\nacquaintance with them, but from a natural aptitude. Robert followed\r\nher work with close attention, giving forth little ejaculatory\r\nexpressions of appreciation in French, which he addressed to Madame\r\nRatignolle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mais ce n\xe2\x80\x99est pas mal! Elle s\xe2\x80\x99y connait, elle a de la force, oui._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring his oblivious attention he once quietly rested his head against\r\nMrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s arm. As gently she repulsed him. Once again he\r\nrepeated the offense. She could not but believe it to be\r\nthoughtlessness on his part; yet that was no reason she should submit\r\nto it. She did not remonstrate, except again to repulse him quietly but\r\nfirmly. He offered no apology. The picture completed bore no\r\nresemblance to Madame Ratignolle. She was greatly disappointed to find\r\nthat it did not look like her. But it was a fair enough piece of work,\r\nand in many respects satisfying.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier evidently did not think so. After surveying the sketch\r\ncritically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface, and\r\ncrumpled the paper between her hands.\r\n\r\nThe youngsters came tumbling up the steps, the quadroon following at\r\nthe respectful distance which they required her to observe. Mrs.\r\nPontellier made them carry her paints and things into the house. She\r\nsought to detain them for a little talk and some pleasantry. But they\r\nwere greatly in earnest. They had only come to investigate the contents\r\nof the bonbon box. They accepted without murmuring what she chose to\r\ngive them, each holding out two chubby hands scoop-like, in the vain\r\nhope that they might be filled; and then away they went.\r\n\r\nThe sun was low in the west, and the breeze soft and languorous that\r\ncame up from the south, charged with the seductive odor of the sea.\r\nChildren freshly befurbelowed, were gathering for their games under the\r\noaks. Their voices were high and penetrating.\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle folded her sewing, placing thimble, scissors, and\r\nthread all neatly together in the roll, which she pinned securely. She\r\ncomplained of faintness. Mrs. Pontellier flew for the cologne water and\r\na fan. She bathed Madame Ratignolle\xe2\x80\x99s face with cologne, while Robert\r\nplied the fan with unnecessary vigor.\r\n\r\nThe spell was soon over, and Mrs. Pontellier could not help wondering\r\nif there were not a little imagination responsible for its origin, for\r\nthe rose tint had never faded from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nShe stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries\r\nwith the grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to\r\npossess. Her little ones ran to meet her. Two of them clung about her\r\nwhite skirts, the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand\r\nendearments bore it along in her own fond, encircling arms. Though, as\r\neverybody well knew, the doctor had forbidden her to lift so much as a\r\npin!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going bathing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Robert of Mrs. Pontellier. It was not so\r\nmuch a question as a reminder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with a tone of indecision. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tired; I think\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x9d Her glance wandered from his face away toward the Gulf, whose\r\nsonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come!\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t miss your bath. Come on. The\r\nwater must be delicious; it will not hurt you. Come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reached up for her big, rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside\r\nthe door, and put it on her head. They descended the steps, and walked\r\naway together toward the beach. The sun was low in the west and the\r\nbreeze was soft and warm.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nEdna Pontellier could not have told why, wishing to go to the beach\r\nwith Robert, she should in the first place have declined, and in the\r\nsecond place have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory\r\nimpulses which impelled her.\r\n\r\nA certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her,\xe2\x80\x94the light\r\nwhich, showing the way, forbids it.\r\n\r\nAt that early period it served but to bewilder her. It moved her to\r\ndreams, to thoughtfulness, to the shadowy anguish which had overcome\r\nher the midnight when she had abandoned herself to tears.\r\n\r\nIn short, Mrs. Pontellier was beginning to realize her position in the\r\nuniverse as a human being, and to recognize her relations as an\r\nindividual to the world within and about her. This may seem like a\r\nponderous weight of wisdom to descend upon the soul of a young woman of\r\ntwenty-eight\xe2\x80\x94perhaps more wisdom than the Holy Ghost is usually pleased\r\nto vouchsafe to any woman.\r\n\r\nBut the beginning of things, of a world especially, is necessarily\r\nvague, tangled, chaotic, and exceedingly disturbing. How few of us ever\r\nemerge from such beginning! How many souls perish in its tumult!\r\n\r\nThe voice of the sea is seductive; never ceasing, whispering,\r\nclamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in\r\nabysses of solitude; to lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the sea speaks to the soul. The touch of the sea is\r\nsensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier was not a woman given to confidences, a characteristic\r\nhitherto contrary to her nature. Even as a child she had lived her own\r\nsmall life all within herself. At a very early period she had\r\napprehended instinctively the dual life\xe2\x80\x94that outward existence which\r\nconforms, the inward life which questions.\r\n\r\nThat summer at Grand Isle she began to loosen a little the mantle of\r\nreserve that had always enveloped her. There may have been\xe2\x80\x94there must\r\nhave been\xe2\x80\x94influences, both subtle and apparent, working in their\r\nseveral ways to induce her to do this; but the most obvious was the\r\ninfluence of Ad\xc3\xa8le Ratignolle. The excessive physical charm of the\r\nCreole had first attracted her, for Edna had a sensuous susceptibility\r\nto beauty. Then the candor of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s whole existence, which every\r\none might read, and which formed so striking a contrast to her own\r\nhabitual reserve\xe2\x80\x94this might have furnished a link. Who can tell what\r\nmetals the gods use in forging the subtle bond which we call sympathy,\r\nwhich we might as well call love.\r\n\r\nThe two women went away one morning to the beach together, arm in arm,\r\nunder the huge white sunshade. Edna had prevailed upon Madame\r\nRatignolle to leave the children behind, though she could not induce\r\nher to relinquish a diminutive roll of needlework, which Ad\xc3\xa8le begged\r\nto be allowed to slip into the depths of her pocket. In some\r\nunaccountable way they had escaped from Robert.\r\n\r\nThe walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did\r\nof a long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that\r\nbordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads. There\r\nwere acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand. Further away\r\nstill, vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of\r\norange or lemon trees intervening. The dark green clusters glistened\r\nfrom afar in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe women were both of goodly height, Madame Ratignolle possessing the\r\nmore feminine and matronly figure. The charm of Edna Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphysique stole insensibly upon you. The lines of her body were long,\r\nclean and symmetrical; it was a body which occasionally fell into\r\nsplendid poses; there was no suggestion of the trim, stereotyped\r\nfashion-plate about it. A casual and indiscriminating observer, in\r\npassing, might not cast a second glance upon the figure. But with more\r\nfeeling and discernment he would have recognized the noble beauty of\r\nits modeling, and the graceful severity of poise and movement, which\r\nmade Edna Pontellier different from the crowd.\r\n\r\nShe wore a cool muslin that morning\xe2\x80\x94white, with a waving vertical line\r\nof brown running through it; also a white linen collar and the big\r\nstraw hat which she had taken from the peg outside the door. The hat\r\nrested any way on her yellow-brown hair, that waved a little, was\r\nheavy, and clung close to her head.\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle, more careful of her complexion, had twined a gauze\r\nveil about her head. She wore dogskin gloves, with gauntlets that\r\nprotected her wrists. She was dressed in pure white, with a fluffiness\r\nof ruffles that became her. The draperies and fluttering things which\r\nshe wore suited her rich, luxuriant beauty as a greater severity of\r\nline could not have done.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of bath-houses along the beach, of rough but solid\r\nconstruction, built with small, protecting galleries facing the water.\r\nEach house consisted of two compartments, and each family at Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossessed a compartment for itself, fitted out with all the essential\r\nparaphernalia of the bath and whatever other conveniences the owners\r\nmight desire. The two women had no intention of bathing; they had just\r\nstrolled down to the beach for a walk and to be alone and near the\r\nwater. The Pontellier and Ratignolle compartments adjoined one another\r\nunder the same roof.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier had brought down her key through force of habit.\r\nUnlocking the door of her bath-room she went inside, and soon emerged,\r\nbringing a rug, which she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and two\r\nhuge hair pillows covered with crash, which she placed against the\r\nfront of the building.\r\n\r\nThe two seated themselves there in the shade of the porch, side by\r\nside, with their backs against the pillows and their feet extended.\r\nMadame Ratignolle removed her veil, wiped her face with a rather\r\ndelicate handkerchief, and fanned herself with the fan which she always\r\ncarried suspended somewhere about her person by a long, narrow ribbon.\r\nEdna removed her collar and opened her dress at the throat. She took\r\nthe fan from Madame Ratignolle and began to fan both herself and her\r\ncompanion. It was very warm, and for a while they did nothing but\r\nexchange remarks about the heat, the sun, the glare. But there was a\r\nbreeze blowing, a choppy, stiff wind that whipped the water into froth.\r\nIt fluttered the skirts of the two women and kept them for a while\r\nengaged in adjusting, readjusting, tucking in, securing hair-pins and\r\nhat-pins. A few persons were sporting some distance away in the water.\r\nThe beach was very still of human sound at that hour. The lady in black\r\nwas reading her morning devotions on the porch of a neighboring\r\nbath-house. Two young lovers were exchanging their hearts\xe2\x80\x99 yearnings\r\nbeneath the children\xe2\x80\x99s tent, which they had found unoccupied.\r\n\r\nEdna Pontellier, casting her eyes about, had finally kept them at rest\r\nupon the sea. The day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the\r\nblue sky went; there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the\r\nhorizon. A lateen sail was visible in the direction of Cat Island, and\r\nothers to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf whom\xe2\x80\x94of what are you thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ad\xc3\xa8le of her companion, whose\r\ncountenance she had been watching with a little amused attention,\r\narrested by the absorbed expression which seemed to have seized and\r\nfixed every feature into a statuesque repose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Pontellier, with a start, adding at once: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nstupid! But it seems to me it is the reply we make instinctively to\r\nsuch a question. Let me see,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, throwing back her head and\r\nnarrowing her fine eyes till they shone like two vivid points of light.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see. I was really not conscious of thinking of anything; but\r\nperhaps I can retrace my thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! never mind!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Madame Ratignolle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not quite so\r\nexacting. I will let you off this time. It is really too hot to think,\r\nespecially to think about thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for the fun of it,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Edna. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, the sight of\r\nthe water stretching so far away, those motionless sails against the\r\nblue sky, made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look\r\nat. The hot wind beating in my face made me think\xe2\x80\x94without any\r\nconnection that I can trace of a summer day in Kentucky, of a meadow\r\nthat seemed as big as the ocean to the very little girl walking through\r\nthe grass, which was higher than her waist. She threw out her arms as\r\nif swimming when she walked, beating the tall grass as one strikes out\r\nin the water. Oh, I see the connection now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were you going that day in Kentucky, walking through the grass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember now. I was just walking diagonally across a big\r\nfield. My sun-bonnet obstructed the view. I could see only the stretch\r\nof green before me, and I felt as if I must walk on forever, without\r\ncoming to the end of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember whether I was frightened or\r\npleased. I must have been entertained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikely as not it was Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed; \xe2\x80\x9cand I was running away\r\nfrom prayers, from the Presbyterian service, read in a spirit of gloom\r\nby my father that chills me yet to think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you been running away from prayers ever since, _ma ch\xc3\xa8re?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Madame Ratignolle, amused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! oh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d Edna hastened to say. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a little unthinking child in\r\nthose days, just following a misleading impulse without question. On\r\nthe contrary, during one period of my life religion took a firm hold\r\nupon me; after I was twelve and until\xe2\x80\x94until\xe2\x80\x94why, I suppose until now,\r\nthough I never thought much about it\xe2\x80\x94just driven along by habit. But do\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off, turning her quick eyes upon Madame Ratignolle\r\nand leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to\r\nthat of her companion, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes I feel this summer as if I were\r\nwalking through the green meadow again; idly, aimlessly, unthinking and\r\nunguided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle laid her hand over that of Mrs. Pontellier, which was\r\nnear her. Seeing that the hand was not withdrawn, she clasped it firmly\r\nand warmly. She even stroked it a little, fondly, with the other hand,\r\nmurmuring in an undertone, \xe2\x80\x9c_Pauvre ch\xc3\xa9rie_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe action was at first a little confusing to Edna, but she soon lent\r\nherself readily to the Creole\xe2\x80\x99s gentle caress. She was not accustomed\r\nto an outward and spoken expression of affection, either in herself or\r\nin others. She and her younger sister, Janet, had quarreled a good deal\r\nthrough force of unfortunate habit. Her older sister, Margaret, was\r\nmatronly and dignified, probably from having assumed matronly and\r\nhousewifely responsibilities too early in life, their mother having\r\ndied when they were quite young. Margaret was not effusive; she was\r\npractical. Edna had had an occasional girl friend, but whether\r\naccidentally or not, they seemed to have been all of one type\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nself-contained. She never realized that the reserve of her own\r\ncharacter had much, perhaps everything, to do with this. Her most\r\nintimate friend at school had been one of rather exceptional\r\nintellectual gifts, who wrote fine-sounding essays, which Edna admired\r\nand strove to imitate; and with her she talked and glowed over the\r\nEnglish classics, and sometimes held religious and political\r\ncontroversies.\r\n\r\nEdna often wondered at one propensity which sometimes had inwardly\r\ndisturbed her without causing any outward show or manifestation on her\r\npart. At a very early age\xe2\x80\x94perhaps it was when she traversed the ocean\r\nof waving grass\xe2\x80\x94she remembered that she had been passionately enamored\r\nof a dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer who visited her father in\r\nKentucky. She could not leave his presence when he was there, nor\r\nremove her eyes from his face, which was something like Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwith a lock of black hair failing across the forehead. But the cavalry\r\nofficer melted imperceptibly out of her existence.\r\n\r\nAt another time her affections were deeply engaged by a young gentleman\r\nwho visited a lady on a neighboring plantation. It was after they went\r\nto Mississippi to live. The young man was engaged to be married to the\r\nyoung lady, and they sometimes called upon Margaret, driving over of\r\nafternoons in a buggy. Edna was a little miss, just merging into her\r\nteens; and the realization that she herself was nothing, nothing,\r\nnothing to the engaged young man was a bitter affliction to her. But\r\nhe, too, went the way of dreams.\r\n\r\nShe was a grown young woman when she was overtaken by what she supposed\r\nto be the climax of her fate. It was when the face and figure of a\r\ngreat tragedian began to haunt her imagination and stir her senses. The\r\npersistence of the infatuation lent it an aspect of genuineness. The\r\nhopelessness of it colored it with the lofty tones of a great passion.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the tragedian stood enframed upon her desk. Any one may\r\npossess the portrait of a tragedian without exciting suspicion or\r\ncomment. (This was a sinister reflection which she cherished.) In the\r\npresence of others she expressed admiration for his exalted gifts, as\r\nshe handed the photograph around and dwelt upon the fidelity of the\r\nlikeness. When alone she sometimes picked it up and kissed the cold\r\nglass passionately.\r\n\r\nHer marriage to L\xc3\xa9once Pontellier was purely an accident, in this\r\nrespect resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees\r\nof Fate. It was in the midst of her secret great passion that she met\r\nhim. He fell in love, as men are in the habit of doing, and pressed his\r\nsuit with an earnestness and an ardor which left nothing to be desired.\r\nHe pleased her; his absolute devotion flattered her. She fancied there\r\nwas a sympathy of thought and taste between them, in which fancy she\r\nwas mistaken. Add to this the violent opposition of her father and her\r\nsister Margaret to her marriage with a Catholic, and we need seek no\r\nfurther for the motives which led her to accept Monsieur Pontellier for\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nThe acme of bliss, which would have been a marriage with the tragedian,\r\nwas not for her in this world. As the devoted wife of a man who\r\nworshiped her, she felt she would take her place with a certain dignity\r\nin the world of reality, closing the portals forever behind her upon\r\nthe realm of romance and dreams.\r\n\r\nBut it was not long before the tragedian had gone to join the cavalry\r\nofficer and the engaged young man and a few others; and Edna found\r\nherself face to face with the realities. She grew fond of her husband,\r\nrealizing with some unaccountable satisfaction that no trace of passion\r\nor excessive and fictitious warmth colored her affection, thereby\r\nthreatening its dissolution.\r\n\r\nShe was fond of her children in an uneven, impulsive way. She would\r\nsometimes gather them passionately to her heart; she would sometimes\r\nforget them. The year before they had spent part of the summer with\r\ntheir grandmother Pontellier in Iberville. Feeling secure regarding\r\ntheir happiness and welfare, she did not miss them except with an\r\noccasional intense longing. Their absence was a sort of relief, though\r\nshe did not admit this, even to herself. It seemed to free her of a\r\nresponsibility which she had blindly assumed and for which Fate had not\r\nfitted her.\r\n\r\nEdna did not reveal so much as all this to Madame Ratignolle that\r\nsummer day when they sat with faces turned to the sea. But a good part\r\nof it escaped her. She had put her head down on Madame Ratignolle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder. She was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her\r\nown voice and the unaccustomed taste of candor. It muddled her like\r\nwine, or like a first breath of freedom.\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of approaching voices. It was Robert, surrounded by\r\na troop of children, searching for them. The two little Pontelliers\r\nwere with him, and he carried Madame Ratignolle\xe2\x80\x99s little girl in his\r\narms. There were other children beside, and two nurse-maids followed,\r\nlooking disagreeable and resigned.\r\n\r\nThe women at once rose and began to shake out their draperies and relax\r\ntheir muscles. Mrs. Pontellier threw the cushions and rug into the\r\nbath-house. The children all scampered off to the awning, and they\r\nstood there in a line, gazing upon the intruding lovers, still\r\nexchanging their vows and sighs. The lovers got up, with only a silent\r\nprotest, and walked slowly away somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThe children possessed themselves of the tent, and Mrs. Pontellier went\r\nover to join them.\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle begged Robert to accompany her to the house; she\r\ncomplained of cramp in her limbs and stiffness of the joints. She\r\nleaned draggingly upon his arm as they walked.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo me a favor, Robert,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke the pretty woman at his side, almost as\r\nsoon as she and Robert had started their slow, homeward way. She looked\r\nup in his face, leaning on his arm beneath the encircling shadow of the\r\numbrella which he had lifted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted; as many as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, glancing down into her\r\neyes that were full of thoughtfulness and some speculation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only ask for one; let Mrs. Pontellier alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tiens!_\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a sudden, boyish laugh. \xe2\x80\x9c_Voil\xc3\xa0 que\r\nMadame Ratignolle est jalouse!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! I\xe2\x80\x99m in earnest; I mean what I say. Let Mrs. Pontellier\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked; himself growing serious at his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsolicitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not one of us; she is not like us. She might make the\r\nunfortunate blunder of taking you seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face flushed with annoyance, and taking off his soft hat he began\r\nto beat it impatiently against his leg as he walked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\ntake me seriously?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I a comedian, a clown, a\r\njack-in-the-box? Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she? You Creoles! I have no patience\r\nwith you! Am I always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing\r\nprogramme? I hope Mrs. Pontellier does take me seriously. I hope she\r\nhas discernment enough to find in me something besides the _blagueur_.\r\nIf I thought there was any doubt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, enough, Robert!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke into his heated outburst. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not\r\nthinking of what you are saying. You speak with about as little\r\nreflection as we might expect from one of those children down there\r\nplaying in the sand. If your attentions to any married women here were\r\never offered with any intention of being convincing, you would not be\r\nthe gentleman we all know you to be, and you would be unfit to\r\nassociate with the wives and daughters of the people who trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the\r\ngospel. The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! well! That isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\xe2\x80\x9d slamming his hat down vehemently upon his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to\r\na fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments?\r\n_Ma foi!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t pleasant to have a woman tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, unheedingly,\r\nbut breaking off suddenly: \xe2\x80\x9cNow if I were like Arobin\xe2\x80\x94you remember\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e Arobin and that story of the consul\xe2\x80\x99s wife at Biloxi?\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nrelated the story of Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin and the consul\xe2\x80\x99s wife; and another\r\nabout the tenor of the French Opera, who received letters which should\r\nnever have been written; and still other stories, grave and gay, till\r\nMrs. Pontellier and her possible propensity for taking young men\r\nseriously was apparently forgotten.\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle, when they had regained her cottage, went in to take\r\nthe hour\xe2\x80\x99s rest which she considered helpful. Before leaving her,\r\nRobert begged her pardon for the impatience\xe2\x80\x94he called it rudeness\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nwhich he had received her well-meant caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou made one mistake, Ad\xc3\xa8le,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a light smile; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is\r\nno earthly possibility of Mrs. Pontellier ever taking me seriously. You\r\nshould have warned me against taking myself seriously. Your advice\r\nmight then have carried some weight and given me subject for some\r\nreflection. _Au revoir_. But you look tired,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, solicitously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like a cup of bouillon? Shall I stir you a toddy? Let me mix\r\nyou a toddy with a drop of Angostura.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe acceded to the suggestion of bouillon, which was grateful and\r\nacceptable. He went himself to the kitchen, which was a building apart\r\nfrom the cottages and lying to the rear of the house. And he himself\r\nbrought her the golden-brown bouillon, in a dainty S\xc3\xa8vres cup, with a\r\nflaky cracker or two on the saucer.\r\n\r\nShe thrust a bare, white arm from the curtain which shielded her open\r\ndoor, and received the cup from his hands. She told him he was a _bon\r\ngar\xc3\xa7on_, and she meant it. Robert thanked her and turned away toward\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lovers were just entering the grounds of the _pension_. They were\r\nleaning toward each other as the water-oaks bent from the sea. There\r\nwas not a particle of earth beneath their feet. Their heads might have\r\nbeen turned upside-down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether.\r\nThe lady in black, creeping behind them, looked a trifle paler and more\r\njaded than usual. There was no sign of Mrs. Pontellier and the\r\nchildren. Robert scanned the distance for any such apparition. They\r\nwould doubtless remain away till the dinner hour. The young man\r\nascended to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s room. It was situated at the top of the house,\r\nmade up of odd angles and a queer, sloping ceiling. Two broad dormer\r\nwindows looked out toward the Gulf, and as far across it as a man\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\nmight reach. The furnishings of the room were light, cool, and\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nMadame Lebrun was busily engaged at the sewing-machine. A little black\r\ngirl sat on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the\r\nmachine. The Creole woman does not take any chances which may be\r\navoided of imperiling her health.\r\n\r\nRobert went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the\r\ndormer windows. He took a book from his pocket and began energetically\r\nto read it, judging by the precision and frequency with which he turned\r\nthe leaves. The sewing-machine made a resounding clatter in the room;\r\nit was of a ponderous, by-gone make. In the lulls, Robert and his\r\nmother exchanged bits of desultory conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mrs. Pontellier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown at the beach with the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised to lend her the Goncourt. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to take it down when\r\nyou go; it\xe2\x80\x99s there on the bookshelf over the small table.\xe2\x80\x9d Clatter,\r\nclatter, clatter, bang! for the next five or eight minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Victor going with the rockaway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rockaway? Victor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; down there in front. He seems to be getting ready to drive away\r\nsomewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall him.\xe2\x80\x9d Clatter, clatter!\r\n\r\nRobert uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard\r\nback at the wharf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t look up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lebrun flew to the window. She called \xe2\x80\x9cVictor!\xe2\x80\x9d She waved a\r\nhandkerchief and called again. The young fellow below got into the\r\nvehicle and started the horse off at a gallop.\r\n\r\nMadame Lebrun went back to the machine, crimson with annoyance. Victor\r\nwas the younger son and brother\xe2\x80\x94a _t\xc3\xaate mont\xc3\xa9e_, with a temper which\r\ninvited violence and a will which no ax could break.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you say the word I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to thrash any amount of reason\r\ninto him that he\xe2\x80\x99s able to hold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your father had only lived!\xe2\x80\x9d Clatter, clatter, clatter, clatter,\r\nbang! It was a fixed belief with Madame Lebrun that the conduct of the\r\nuniverse and all things pertaining thereto would have been manifestly\r\nof a more intelligent and higher order had not Monsieur Lebrun been\r\nremoved to other spheres during the early years of their married life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you hear from Montel?\xe2\x80\x9d Montel was a middle-aged gentleman\r\nwhose vain ambition and desire for the past twenty years had been to\r\nfill the void which Monsieur Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s taking off had left in the Lebrun\r\nhousehold. Clatter, clatter, bang, clatter!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a letter somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d looking in the machine drawer and finding\r\nthe letter in the bottom of the workbasket. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says to tell you he\r\nwill be in Vera Cruz the beginning of next month,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94clatter,\r\nclatter!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand if you still have the intention of joining him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94bang!\r\nclatter, clatter, bang!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me so before, mother? You know I wanted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Clatter,\r\nclatter, clatter!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see Mrs. Pontellier starting back with the children? She will\r\nbe in late to luncheon again. She never starts to get ready for\r\nluncheon till the last minute.\xe2\x80\x9d Clatter, clatter! \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you\r\ngoing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you say the Goncourt was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nEvery light in the hall was ablaze; every lamp turned as high as it\r\ncould be without smoking the chimney or threatening explosion. The\r\nlamps were fixed at intervals against the wall, encircling the whole\r\nroom. Some one had gathered orange and lemon branches, and with these\r\nfashioned graceful festoons between. The dark green of the branches\r\nstood out and glistened against the white muslin curtains which draped\r\nthe windows, and which puffed, floated, and flapped at the capricious\r\nwill of a stiff breeze that swept up from the Gulf.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held\r\nbetween Robert and Madame Ratignolle on their way from the beach. An\r\nunusual number of husbands, fathers, and friends had come down to stay\r\nover Sunday; and they were being suitably entertained by their\r\nfamilies, with the material help of Madame Lebrun. The dining tables\r\nhad all been removed to one end of the hall, and the chairs ranged\r\nabout in rows and in clusters. Each little family group had had its say\r\nand exchanged its domestic gossip earlier in the evening. There was now\r\nan apparent disposition to relax; to widen the circle of confidences\r\nand give a more general tone to the conversation.\r\n\r\nMany of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual\r\nbedtime. A small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor\r\nlooking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which Mr. Pontellier\r\nhad brought down. The little Pontellier boys were permitting them to do\r\nso, and making their authority felt.\r\n\r\nMusic, dancing, and a recitation or two were the entertainments\r\nfurnished, or rather, offered. But there was nothing systematic about\r\nthe programme, no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour in the evening the Farival twins were prevailed upon\r\nto play the piano. They were girls of fourteen, always clad in the\r\nVirgin\xe2\x80\x99s colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed\r\nVirgin at their baptism. They played a duet from \xe2\x80\x9cZampa,\xe2\x80\x9d and at the\r\nearnest solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cThe Poet and the Peasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Allez vous-en! Sapristi!_\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the parrot outside the door. He\r\nwas the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit\r\nthat he was not listening to these gracious performances for the first\r\ntime that summer. Old Monsieur Farival, grandfather of the twins, grew\r\nindignant over the interruption, and insisted upon having the bird\r\nremoved and consigned to regions of darkness. Victor Lebrun objected;\r\nand his decrees were as immutable as those of Fate. The parrot\r\nfortunately offered no further interruption to the entertainment, the\r\nwhole venom of his nature apparently having been cherished up and\r\nhurled against the twins in that one impetuous outburst.\r\n\r\nLater a young brother and sister gave recitations, which every one\r\npresent had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nA little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor. The\r\nmother played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her\r\ndaughter with greedy admiration and nervous apprehension. She need have\r\nhad no apprehension. The child was mistress of the situation. She had\r\nbeen properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk\r\ntights. Her little neck and arms were bare, and her hair, artificially\r\ncrimped, stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head. Her poses\r\nwere full of grace, and her little black-shod toes twinkled as they\r\nshot out and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were\r\nbewildering.\r\n\r\nBut there was no reason why every one should not dance. Madame\r\nRatignolle could not, so it was she who gaily consented to play for the\r\nothers. She played very well, keeping excellent waltz time and infusing\r\nan expression into the strains which was indeed inspiring. She was\r\nkeeping up her music on account of the children, she said; because she\r\nand her husband both considered it a means of brightening the home and\r\nmaking it attractive.\r\n\r\nAlmost every one danced but the twins, who could not be induced to\r\nseparate during the brief period when one or the other should be\r\nwhirling around the room in the arms of a man. They might have danced\r\ntogether, but they did not think of it.\r\n\r\nThe children were sent to bed. Some went submissively; others with\r\nshrieks and protests as they were dragged away. They had been permitted\r\nto sit up till after the ice-cream, which naturally marked the limit of\r\nhuman indulgence.\r\n\r\nThe ice-cream was passed around with cake\xe2\x80\x94gold and silver cake arranged\r\non platters in alternate slices; it had been made and frozen during the\r\nafternoon back of the kitchen by two black women, under the supervision\r\nof Victor. It was pronounced a great success\xe2\x80\x94excellent if it had only\r\ncontained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar, if it had been\r\nfrozen a degree harder, and if the salt might have been kept out of\r\nportions of it. Victor was proud of his achievement, and went about\r\nrecommending it and urging every one to partake of it to excess.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Pontellier had danced twice with her husband, once with\r\nRobert, and once with Monsieur Ratignolle, who was thin and tall and\r\nswayed like a reed in the wind when he danced, she went out on the\r\ngallery and seated herself on the low window-sill, where she commanded\r\na view of all that went on in the hall and could look out toward the\r\nGulf. There was a soft effulgence in the east. The moon was coming up,\r\nand its mystic shimmer was casting a million lights across the distant,\r\nrestless water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to hear Mademoiselle Reisz play?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Robert, coming\r\nout on the porch where she was. Of course Edna would like to hear\r\nMademoiselle Reisz play; but she feared it would be useless to entreat\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her that you want to hear her. She\r\nlikes you. She will come.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned and hurried away to one of the far\r\ncottages, where Mademoiselle Reisz was shuffling away. She was dragging\r\na chair in and out of her room, and at intervals objecting to the\r\ncrying of a baby, which a nurse in the adjoining cottage was\r\nendeavoring to put to sleep. She was a disagreeable little woman, no\r\nlonger young, who had quarreled with almost every one, owing to a\r\ntemper which was self-assertive and a disposition to trample upon the\r\nrights of others. Robert prevailed upon her without any too great\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nShe entered the hall with him during a lull in the dance. She made an\r\nawkward, imperious little bow as she went in. She was a homely woman,\r\nwith a small weazened face and body and eyes that glowed. She had\r\nabsolutely no taste in dress, and wore a batch of rusty black lace with\r\na bunch of artificial violets pinned to the side of her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Mrs. Pontellier what she would like to hear me play,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrequested of Robert. She sat perfectly still before the piano, not\r\ntouching the keys, while Robert carried her message to Edna at the\r\nwindow. A general air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon\r\nevery one as they saw the pianist enter. There was a settling down, and\r\na prevailing air of expectancy everywhere. Edna was a trifle\r\nembarrassed at being thus signaled out for the imperious little woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavor. She would not dare to choose, and begged that Mademoiselle Reisz\r\nwould please herself in her selections.\r\n\r\nEdna was what she herself called very fond of music. Musical strains,\r\nwell rendered, had a way of evoking pictures in her mind. She sometimes\r\nliked to sit in the room of mornings when Madame Ratignolle played or\r\npracticed. One piece which that lady played Edna had entitled\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSolitude.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a short, plaintive, minor strain. The name of the\r\npiece was something else, but she called it \xe2\x80\x9cSolitude.\xe2\x80\x9d When she heard\r\nit there came before her imagination the figure of a man standing\r\nbeside a desolate rock on the seashore. He was naked. His attitude was\r\none of hopeless resignation as he looked toward a distant bird winging\r\nits flight away from him.\r\n\r\nAnother piece called to her mind a dainty young woman clad in an Empire\r\ngown, taking mincing dancing steps as she came down a long avenue\r\nbetween tall hedges. Again, another reminded her of children at play,\r\nand still another of nothing on earth but a demure lady stroking a cat.\r\n\r\nThe very first chords which Mademoiselle Reisz struck upon the piano\r\nsent a keen tremor down Mrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s spinal column. It was not the\r\nfirst time she had heard an artist at the piano. Perhaps it was the\r\nfirst time she was ready, perhaps the first time her being was tempered\r\nto take an impress of the abiding truth.\r\n\r\nShe waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and\r\nblaze before her imagination. She waited in vain. She saw no pictures\r\nof solitude, of hope, of longing, or of despair. But the very passions\r\nthemselves were aroused within her soul, swaying it, lashing it, as the\r\nwaves daily beat upon her splendid body. She trembled, she was choking,\r\nand the tears blinded her.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle had finished. She arose, and bowing her stiff, lofty bow,\r\nshe went away, stopping for neither thanks nor applause. As she passed\r\nalong the gallery she patted Edna upon the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how did you like my music?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. The young woman was\r\nunable to answer; she pressed the hand of the pianist convulsively.\r\nMademoiselle Reisz perceived her agitation and even her tears. She\r\npatted her again upon the shoulder as she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the only one worth playing for. Those others? Bah!\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\nwent shuffling and sidling on down the gallery toward her room.\r\n\r\nBut she was mistaken about \xe2\x80\x9cthose others.\xe2\x80\x9d Her playing had aroused a\r\nfever of enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat passion!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an artist!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI have always\r\nsaid no one could play Chopin like Mademoiselle Reisz!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat last\r\nprelude! Bon Dieu! It shakes a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was growing late, and there was a general disposition to disband.\r\nBut some one, perhaps it was Robert, thought of a bath at that mystic\r\nhour and under that mystic moon.\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nAt all events Robert proposed it, and there was not a dissenting voice.\r\nThere was not one but was ready to follow when he led the way. He did\r\nnot lead the way, however, he directed the way; and he himself loitered\r\nbehind with the lovers, who had betrayed a disposition to linger and\r\nhold themselves apart. He walked between them, whether with malicious\r\nor mischievous intent was not wholly clear, even to himself.\r\n\r\nThe Pontelliers and Ratignolles walked ahead; the women leaning upon\r\nthe arms of their husbands. Edna could hear Robert\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind them,\r\nand could sometimes hear what he said. She wondered why he did not join\r\nthem. It was unlike him not to. Of late he had sometimes held away from\r\nher for an entire day, redoubling his devotion upon the next and the\r\nnext, as though to make up for hours that had been lost. She missed him\r\nthe days when some pretext served to take him away from her, just as\r\none misses the sun on a cloudy day without having thought much about\r\nthe sun when it was shining.\r\n\r\nThe people walked in little groups toward the beach. They talked and\r\nlaughed; some of them sang. There was a band playing down at Klein\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhotel, and the strains reached them faintly, tempered by the distance.\r\nThere were strange, rare odors abroad\xe2\x80\x94a tangle of the sea smell and of\r\nweeds and damp, new-plowed earth, mingled with the heavy perfume of a\r\nfield of white blossoms somewhere near. But the night sat lightly upon\r\nthe sea and the land. There was no weight of darkness; there were no\r\nshadows. The white light of the moon had fallen upon the world like the\r\nmystery and the softness of sleep.\r\n\r\nMost of them walked into the water as though into a native element. The\r\nsea was quiet now, and swelled lazily in broad billows that melted into\r\none another and did not break except upon the beach in little foamy\r\ncrests that coiled back like slow, white serpents.\r\n\r\nEdna had attempted all summer to learn to swim. She had received\r\ninstructions from both the men and women; in some instances from the\r\nchildren. Robert had pursued a system of lessons almost daily; and he\r\nwas nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of\r\nhis efforts. A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the\r\nwater, unless there was a hand near by that might reach out and\r\nreassure her.\r\n\r\nBut that night she was like the little tottering, stumbling, clutching\r\nchild, who of a sudden realizes its powers, and walks for the first\r\ntime alone, boldly and with over-confidence. She could have shouted for\r\njoy. She did shout for joy, as with a sweeping stroke or two she lifted\r\nher body to the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nA feeling of exultation overtook her, as if some power of significant\r\nimport had been given her to control the working of her body and her\r\nsoul. She grew daring and reckless, overestimating her strength. She\r\nwanted to swim far out, where no woman had swum before.\r\n\r\nHer unlooked-for achievement was the subject of wonder, applause, and\r\nadmiration. Each one congratulated himself that his special teachings\r\nhad accomplished this desired end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow easy it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said aloud; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\ndid I not discover before that it was nothing. Think of the time I have\r\nlost splashing about like a baby!\xe2\x80\x9d She would not join the groups in\r\ntheir sports and bouts, but intoxicated with her newly conquered power,\r\nshe swam out alone.\r\n\r\nShe turned her face seaward to gather in an impression of space and\r\nsolitude, which the vast expanse of water, meeting and melting with the\r\nmoonlit sky, conveyed to her excited fancy. As she swam she seemed to\r\nbe reaching out for the unlimited in which to lose herself.\r\n\r\nOnce she turned and looked toward the shore, toward the people she had\r\nleft there. She had not gone any great distance\xe2\x80\x94that is, what would\r\nhave been a great distance for an experienced swimmer. But to her\r\nunaccustomed vision the stretch of water behind her assumed the aspect\r\nof a barrier which her unaided strength would never be able to\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nA quick vision of death smote her soul, and for a second of time\r\nappalled and enfeebled her senses. But by an effort she rallied her\r\nstaggering faculties and managed to regain the land.\r\n\r\nShe made no mention of her encounter with death and her flash of\r\nterror, except to say to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I should have perished\r\nout there alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not so very far, my dear; I was watching you,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her.\r\n\r\nEdna went at once to the bath-house, and she had put on her dry clothes\r\nand was ready to return home before the others had left the water. She\r\nstarted to walk away alone. They all called to her and shouted to her.\r\nShe waved a dissenting hand, and went on, paying no further heed to\r\ntheir renewed cries which sought to detain her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I am tempted to think that Mrs. Pontellier is capricious,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Madame Lebrun, who was amusing herself immensely and feared that\r\nEdna\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt departure might put an end to the pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know she is,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Mr. Pontellier; \xe2\x80\x9csometimes, not often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdna had not traversed a quarter of the distance on her way home before\r\nshe was overtaken by Robert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you think I was afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked him, without a shade of\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I knew you weren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you come? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you stay out there with the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThought of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf anything. What difference does it make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very tired,\xe2\x80\x9d she uttered, complainingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it. Why should you know? I never was so\r\nexhausted in my life. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t unpleasant. A thousand emotions have\r\nswept through me to-night. I don\xe2\x80\x99t comprehend half of them. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m saying; I am just thinking aloud. I wonder if I shall ever be\r\nstirred again as Mademoiselle Reisz\xe2\x80\x99s playing moved me to-night. I\r\nwonder if any night on earth will ever again be like this one. It is\r\nlike a night in a dream. The people about me are like some uncanny,\r\nhalf-human beings. There must be spirits abroad to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Robert, \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you know this was the\r\ntwenty-eighth of August?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe twenty-eighth of August?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. On the twenty-eighth of August, at the hour of midnight, and if\r\nthe moon is shining\xe2\x80\x94the moon must be shining\xe2\x80\x94a spirit that has haunted\r\nthese shores for ages rises up from the Gulf. With its own penetrating\r\nvision the spirit seeks some one mortal worthy to hold him company,\r\nworthy of being exalted for a few hours into realms of the\r\nsemi-celestials. His search has always hitherto been fruitless, and he\r\nhas sunk back, disheartened, into the sea. But to-night he found Mrs.\r\nPontellier. Perhaps he will never wholly release her from the spell.\r\nPerhaps she will never again suffer a poor, unworthy earthling to walk\r\nin the shadow of her divine presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t banter me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, wounded at what appeared to be his\r\nflippancy. He did not mind the entreaty, but the tone with its delicate\r\nnote of pathos was like a reproach. He could not explain; he could not\r\ntell her that he had penetrated her mood and understood. He said\r\nnothing except to offer her his arm, for, by her own admission, she was\r\nexhausted. She had been walking alone with her arms hanging limp,\r\nletting her white skirts trail along the dewy path. She took his arm,\r\nbut she did not lean upon it. She let her hand lie listlessly, as\r\nthough her thoughts were elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94somewhere in advance of her body,\r\nand she was striving to overtake them.\r\n\r\nRobert assisted her into the hammock which swung from the post before\r\nher door out to the trunk of a tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you stay out here and wait for Mr. Pontellier?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay out here. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I get you a pillow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, feeling about, for they were in the\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be soiled; the children have been tumbling it about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter.\xe2\x80\x9d And having discovered the pillow, she adjusted it beneath\r\nher head. She extended herself in the hammock with a deep breath of\r\nrelief. She was not a supercilious or an over-dainty woman. She was not\r\nmuch given to reclining in the hammock, and when she did so it was with\r\nno cat-like suggestion of voluptuous ease, but with a beneficent repose\r\nwhich seemed to invade her whole body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I stay with you till Mr. Pontellier comes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Robert,\r\nseating himself on the outer edge of one of the steps and taking hold\r\nof the hammock rope which was fastened to the post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish. Don\xe2\x80\x99t swing the hammock. Will you get my white shawl\r\nwhich I left on the window-sill over at the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you chilly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I shall be presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresently?\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what time it is? How long are you\r\ngoing to stay out here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Will you get the shawl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rising. He went over to the house, walking\r\nalong the grass. She watched his figure pass in and out of the strips\r\nof moonlight. It was past midnight. It was very quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned with the shawl she took it and kept it in her hand.\r\nShe did not put it around her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you say I should stay till Mr. Pontellier came back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said you might if you wished to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seated himself again and rolled a cigarette, which he smoked in\r\nsilence. Neither did Mrs. Pontellier speak. No multitude of words could\r\nhave been more significant than those moments of silence, or more\r\npregnant with the first-felt throbbings of desire.\r\n\r\nWhen the voices of the bathers were heard approaching, Robert said\r\ngood-night. She did not answer him. He thought she was asleep. Again\r\nshe watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of moonlight as he\r\nwalked away.\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing out here, Edna? I thought I should find you in\r\nbed,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, when he discovered her lying there. He had\r\nwalked up with Madame Lebrun and left her at the house. His wife did\r\nnot reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, bending down close to look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes gleamed bright and intense, with no sleepy shadows, as\r\nthey looked into his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know it is past one o\xe2\x80\x99clock? Come on,\xe2\x80\x9d and he mounted the steps\r\nand went into their room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdna!\xe2\x80\x9d called Mr. Pontellier from within, after a few moments had gone\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wait for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. He thrust his head through the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will take cold out there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat folly is\r\nthis? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t cold; I have my shawl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mosquitoes will devour you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no mosquitoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe heard him moving about the room; every sound indicating impatience\r\nand irritation. Another time she would have gone in at his request. She\r\nwould, through habit, have yielded to his desire; not with any sense of\r\nsubmission or obedience to his compelling wishes, but unthinkingly, as\r\nwe walk, move, sit, stand, go through the daily treadmill of the life\r\nwhich has been portioned out to us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdna, dear, are you not coming in soon?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked again, this time\r\nfondly, with a note of entreaty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I am going to stay out here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is more than folly,\xe2\x80\x9d he blurted out. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t permit you to stay\r\nout there all night. You must come in the house instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a writhing motion she settled herself more securely in the\r\nhammock. She perceived that her will had blazed up, stubborn and\r\nresistant. She could not at that moment have done other than denied and\r\nresisted. She wondered if her husband had ever spoken to her like that\r\nbefore, and if she had submitted to his command. Of course she had; she\r\nremembered that she had. But she could not realize why or how she\r\nshould have yielded, feeling as she then did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cL\xc3\xa9once, go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to stay out here. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nto go in, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to. Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me like that again; I\r\nshall not answer you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier had prepared for bed, but he slipped on an extra\r\ngarment. He opened a bottle of wine, of which he kept a small and\r\nselect supply in a buffet of his own. He drank a glass of the wine and\r\nwent out on the gallery and offered a glass to his wife. She did not\r\nwish any. He drew up the rocker, hoisted his slippered feet on the\r\nrail, and proceeded to smoke a cigar. He smoked two cigars; then he\r\nwent inside and drank another glass of wine. Mrs. Pontellier again\r\ndeclined to accept a glass when it was offered to her. Mr. Pontellier\r\nonce more seated himself with elevated feet, and after a reasonable\r\ninterval of time smoked some more cigars.\r\n\r\nEdna began to feel like one who awakens gradually out of a dream, a\r\ndelicious, grotesque, impossible dream, to feel again the realities\r\npressing into her soul. The physical need for sleep began to overtake\r\nher; the exuberance which had sustained and exalted her spirit left her\r\nhelpless and yielding to the conditions which crowded her in.\r\n\r\nThe stillest hour of the night had come, the hour before dawn, when the\r\nworld seems to hold its breath. The moon hung low, and had turned from\r\nsilver to copper in the sleeping sky. The old owl no longer hooted, and\r\nthe water-oaks had ceased to moan as they bent their heads.\r\n\r\nEdna arose, cramped from lying so long and still in the hammock. She\r\ntottered up the steps, clutching feebly at the post before passing into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you coming in, L\xc3\xa9once?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning her face toward her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a glance following a misty puff of\r\nsmoke. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as soon as I have finished my cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nShe slept but a few hours. They were troubled and feverish hours,\r\ndisturbed with dreams that were intangible, that eluded her, leaving\r\nonly an impression upon her half-awakened senses of something\r\nunattainable. She was up and dressed in the cool of the early morning.\r\nThe air was invigorating and steadied somewhat her faculties. However,\r\nshe was not seeking refreshment or help from any source, either\r\nexternal or from within. She was blindly following whatever impulse\r\nmoved her, as if she had placed herself in alien hands for direction,\r\nand freed her soul of responsibility.\r\n\r\nMost of the people at that early hour were still in bed and asleep. A\r\nfew, who intended to go over to the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re_ for mass, were moving\r\nabout. The lovers, who had laid their plans the night before, were\r\nalready strolling toward the wharf. The lady in black, with her Sunday\r\nprayer-book, velvet and gold-clasped, and her Sunday silver beads, was\r\nfollowing them at no great distance. Old Monsieur Farival was up, and\r\nwas more than half inclined to do anything that suggested itself. He\r\nput on his big straw hat, and taking his umbrella from the stand in the\r\nhall, followed the lady in black, never overtaking her.\r\n\r\nThe little negro girl who worked Madame Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s sewing-machine was\r\nsweeping the galleries with long, absent-minded strokes of the broom.\r\nEdna sent her up into the house to awaken Robert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I am going to the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re_. The boat is ready; tell him to\r\nhurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had soon joined her. She had never sent for him before. She had\r\nnever asked for him. She had never seemed to want him before. She did\r\nnot appear conscious that she had done anything unusual in commanding\r\nhis presence. He was apparently equally unconscious of anything\r\nextraordinary in the situation. But his face was suffused with a quiet\r\nglow when he met her.\r\n\r\nThey went together back to the kitchen to drink coffee. There was no\r\ntime to wait for any nicety of service. They stood outside the window\r\nand the cook passed them their coffee and a roll, which they drank and\r\nate from the window-sill. Edna said it tasted good.\r\n\r\nShe had not thought of coffee nor of anything. He told her he had often\r\nnoticed that she lacked forethought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it enough to think of going to the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re_ and waking you\r\nup?\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I have to think of everything?\xe2\x80\x94as L\xc3\xa9once says\r\nwhen he\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad humor. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame him; he\xe2\x80\x99d never be in a bad\r\nhumor if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey took a short cut across the sands. At a distance they could see\r\nthe curious procession moving toward the wharf\xe2\x80\x94the lovers, shoulder to\r\nshoulder, creeping; the lady in black, gaining steadily upon them; old\r\nMonsieur Farival, losing ground inch by inch, and a young barefooted\r\nSpanish girl, with a red kerchief on her head and a basket on her arm,\r\nbringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nRobert knew the girl, and he talked to her a little in the boat. No one\r\npresent understood what they said. Her name was Mariequita. She had a\r\nround, sly, piquant face and pretty black eyes. Her hands were small,\r\nand she kept them folded over the handle of her basket. Her feet were\r\nbroad and coarse. She did not strive to hide them. Edna looked at her\r\nfeet, and noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes.\r\n\r\nBeaudelet grumbled because Mariequita was there, taking up so much\r\nroom. In reality he was annoyed at having old Monsieur Farival, who\r\nconsidered himself the better sailor of the two. But he would not\r\nquarrel with so old a man as Monsieur Farival, so he quarreled with\r\nMariequita. The girl was deprecatory at one moment, appealing to\r\nRobert. She was saucy the next, moving her head up and down, making\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceyes\xe2\x80\x9d at Robert and making \xe2\x80\x9cmouths\xe2\x80\x9d at Beaudelet.\r\n\r\nThe lovers were all alone. They saw nothing, they heard nothing. The\r\nlady in black was counting her beads for the third time. Old Monsieur\r\nFarival talked incessantly of what he knew about handling a boat, and\r\nof what Beaudelet did not know on the same subject.\r\n\r\nEdna liked it all. She looked Mariequita up and down, from her ugly\r\nbrown toes to her pretty black eyes, and back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does she look at me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the girl of Robert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe she thinks you are pretty. Shall I ask her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Is she your sweetheart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a married lady, and has two children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! well! Francisco ran away with Sylvano\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who had four\r\nchildren. They took all his money and one of the children and stole his\r\nboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre those two married over there\xe2\x80\x94leaning on each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Robert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mariequita, with a serious, confirmatory bob of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nThe sun was high up and beginning to bite. The swift breeze seemed to\r\nEdna to bury the sting of it into the pores of her face and hands.\r\nRobert held his umbrella over her. As they went cutting sidewise\r\nthrough the water, the sails bellied taut, with the wind filling and\r\noverflowing them. Old Monsieur Farival laughed sardonically at\r\nsomething as he looked at the sails, and Beaudelet swore at the old man\r\nunder his breath.\r\n\r\nSailing across the bay to the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada_, Edna felt as if she\r\nwere being borne away from some anchorage which had held her fast,\r\nwhose chains had been loosening\xe2\x80\x94had snapped the night before when the\r\nmystic spirit was abroad, leaving her free to drift whithersoever she\r\nchose to set her sails. Robert spoke to her incessantly; he no longer\r\nnoticed Mariequita. The girl had shrimps in her bamboo basket. They\r\nwere covered with Spanish moss. She beat the moss down impatiently, and\r\nmuttered to herself sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to Grande Terre to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClimb up the hill to the old fort and look at the little wriggling\r\ngold snakes, and watch the lizards sun themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gazed away toward Grande Terre and thought she would like to be\r\nalone there with Robert, in the sun, listening to the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s roar and\r\nwatching the slimy lizards writhe in and out among the ruins of the old\r\nfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next day or the next we can sail to the Bayou Brulow,\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything\xe2\x80\x94cast bait for fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; we\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to Grande Terre. Let the fish alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go wherever you like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have Tonie come over and\r\nhelp me patch and trim my boat. We shall not need Beaudelet nor any\r\none. Are you afraid of the pirogue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you some night in the pirogue when the moon shines.\r\nMaybe your Gulf spirit will whisper to you in which of these islands\r\nthe treasures are hidden\xe2\x80\x94direct you to the very spot, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in a day we should be rich!\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give it all to you,\r\nthe pirate gold and every bit of treasure we could dig up. I think you\r\nwould know how to spend it. Pirate gold isn\xe2\x80\x99t a thing to be hoarded or\r\nutilized. It is something to squander and throw to the four winds, for\r\nthe fun of seeing the golden specks fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d share it, and scatter it together,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. His face flushed.\r\n\r\nThey all went together up to the quaint little Gothic church of Our\r\nLady of Lourdes, gleaming all brown and yellow with paint in the sun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglare.\r\n\r\nOnly Beaudelet remained behind, tinkering at his boat, and Mariequita\r\nwalked away with her basket of shrimps, casting a look of childish ill\r\nhumor and reproach at Robert from the corner of her eye.\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nA feeling of oppression and drowsiness overcame Edna during the\r\nservice. Her head began to ache, and the lights on the altar swayed\r\nbefore her eyes. Another time she might have made an effort to regain\r\nher composure; but her one thought was to quit the stifling atmosphere\r\nof the church and reach the open air. She arose, climbing over Robert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet with a muttered apology. Old Monsieur Farival, flurried, curious,\r\nstood up, but upon seeing that Robert had followed Mrs. Pontellier, he\r\nsank back into his seat. He whispered an anxious inquiry of the lady in\r\nblack, who did not notice him or reply, but kept her eyes fastened upon\r\nthe pages of her velvet prayer-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt giddy and almost overcome,\xe2\x80\x9d Edna said, lifting her hands\r\ninstinctively to her head and pushing her straw hat up from her\r\nforehead. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stayed through the service.\xe2\x80\x9d They were\r\noutside in the shadow of the church. Robert was full of solicitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was folly to have thought of going in the first place, let alone\r\nstaying. Come over to Madame Antoine\xe2\x80\x99s; you can rest there.\xe2\x80\x9d He took\r\nher arm and led her away, looking anxiously and continuously down into\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nHow still it was, with only the voice of the sea whispering through the\r\nreeds that grew in the salt-water pools! The long line of little gray,\r\nweather-beaten houses nestled peacefully among the orange trees. It\r\nmust always have been God\xe2\x80\x99s day on that low, drowsy island, Edna\r\nthought. They stopped, leaning over a jagged fence made of sea-drift,\r\nto ask for water. A youth, a mild-faced Acadian, was drawing water from\r\nthe cistern, which was nothing more than a rusty buoy, with an opening\r\non one side, sunk in the ground. The water which the youth handed to\r\nthem in a tin pail was not cold to taste, but it was cool to her heated\r\nface, and it greatly revived and refreshed her.\r\n\r\nMadame Antoine\xe2\x80\x99s cot was at the far end of the village. She welcomed\r\nthem with all the native hospitality, as she would have opened her door\r\nto let the sunlight in. She was fat, and walked heavily and clumsily\r\nacross the floor. She could speak no English, but when Robert made her\r\nunderstand that the lady who accompanied him was ill and desired to\r\nrest, she was all eagerness to make Edna feel at home and to dispose of\r\nher comfortably.\r\n\r\nThe whole place was immaculately clean, and the big, four-posted bed,\r\nsnow-white, invited one to repose. It stood in a small side room which\r\nlooked out across a narrow grass plot toward the shed, where there was\r\na disabled boat lying keel upward.\r\n\r\nMadame Antoine had not gone to mass. Her son Tonie had, but she\r\nsupposed he would soon be back, and she invited Robert to be seated and\r\nwait for him. But he went and sat outside the door and smoked. Madame\r\nAntoine busied herself in the large front room preparing dinner. She\r\nwas boiling mullets over a few red coals in the huge fireplace.\r\n\r\nEdna, left alone in the little side room, loosened her clothes,\r\nremoving the greater part of them. She bathed her face, her neck and\r\narms in the basin that stood between the windows. She took off her\r\nshoes and stockings and stretched herself in the very center of the\r\nhigh, white bed. How luxurious it felt to rest thus in a strange,\r\nquaint bed, with its sweet country odor of laurel lingering about the\r\nsheets and mattress! She stretched her strong limbs that ached a\r\nlittle. She ran her fingers through her loosened hair for a while. She\r\nlooked at her round arms as she held them straight up and rubbed them\r\none after the other, observing closely, as if it were something she saw\r\nfor the first time, the fine, firm quality and texture of her flesh.\r\nShe clasped her hands easily above her head, and it was thus she fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nShe slept lightly at first, half awake and drowsily attentive to the\r\nthings about her. She could hear Madame Antoine\xe2\x80\x99s heavy, scraping tread\r\nas she walked back and forth on the sanded floor. Some chickens were\r\nclucking outside the windows, scratching for bits of gravel in the\r\ngrass. Later she half heard the voices of Robert and Tonie talking\r\nunder the shed. She did not stir. Even her eyelids rested numb and\r\nheavily over her sleepy eyes. The voices went on\xe2\x80\x94Tonie\xe2\x80\x99s slow, Acadian\r\ndrawl, Robert\xe2\x80\x99s quick, soft, smooth French. She understood French\r\nimperfectly unless directly addressed, and the voices were only part of\r\nthe other drowsy, muffled sounds lulling her senses.\r\n\r\nWhen Edna awoke it was with the conviction that she had slept long and\r\nsoundly. The voices were hushed under the shed. Madame Antoine\xe2\x80\x99s step\r\nwas no longer to be heard in the adjoining room. Even the chickens had\r\ngone elsewhere to scratch and cluck. The mosquito bar was drawn over\r\nher; the old woman had come in while she slept and let down the bar.\r\nEdna arose quietly from the bed, and looking between the curtains of\r\nthe window, she saw by the slanting rays of the sun that the afternoon\r\nwas far advanced. Robert was out there under the shed, reclining in the\r\nshade against the sloping keel of the overturned boat. He was reading\r\nfrom a book. Tonie was no longer with him. She wondered what had become\r\nof the rest of the party. She peeped out at him two or three times as\r\nshe stood washing herself in the little basin between the windows.\r\n\r\nMadame Antoine had laid some coarse, clean towels upon a chair, and had\r\nplaced a box of _poudre de riz_ within easy reach. Edna dabbed the\r\npowder upon her nose and cheeks as she looked at herself closely in the\r\nlittle distorted mirror which hung on the wall above the basin. Her\r\neyes were bright and wide awake and her face glowed.\r\n\r\nWhen she had completed her toilet she walked into the adjoining room.\r\nShe was very hungry. No one was there. But there was a cloth spread\r\nupon the table that stood against the wall, and a cover was laid for\r\none, with a crusty brown loaf and a bottle of wine beside the plate.\r\nEdna bit a piece from the brown loaf, tearing it with her strong, white\r\nteeth. She poured some of the wine into the glass and drank it down.\r\nThen she went softly out of doors, and plucking an orange from the\r\nlow-hanging bough of a tree, threw it at Robert, who did not know she\r\nwas awake and up.\r\n\r\nAn illumination broke over his whole face when he saw her and joined\r\nher under the orange tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many years have I slept?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole island seems\r\nchanged. A new race of beings must have sprung up, leaving only you and\r\nme as past relics. How many ages ago did Madame Antoine and Tonie die?\r\nand when did our people from Grand Isle disappear from the earth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe familiarly adjusted a ruffle upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have slept precisely one hundred years. I was left here to guard\r\nyour slumbers; and for one hundred years I have been out under the shed\r\nreading a book. The only evil I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent was to keep a broiled\r\nfowl from drying up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it has turned to stone, still will I eat it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, moving\r\nwith him into the house. \xe2\x80\x9cBut really, what has become of Monsieur\r\nFarival and the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone hours ago. When they found that you were sleeping they thought it\r\nbest not to awake you. Any way, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let them. What was I\r\nhere for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if L\xc3\xa9once will be uneasy!\xe2\x80\x9d she speculated, as she seated\r\nherself at table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not; he knows you are with me,\xe2\x80\x9d Robert replied, as he busied\r\nhimself among sundry pans and covered dishes which had been left\r\nstanding on the hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are Madame Antoine and her son?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone to Vespers, and to visit some friends, I believe. I am to take\r\nyou back in Tonie\xe2\x80\x99s boat whenever you are ready to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stirred the smoldering ashes till the broiled fowl began to sizzle\r\nafresh. He served her with no mean repast, dripping the coffee anew and\r\nsharing it with her. Madame Antoine had cooked little else than the\r\nmullets, but while Edna slept Robert had foraged the island. He was\r\nchildishly gratified to discover her appetite, and to see the relish\r\nwith which she ate the food which he had procured for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go right away?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, after draining her glass and\r\nbrushing together the crumbs of the crusty loaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun isn\xe2\x80\x99t as low as it will be in two hours,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun will be gone in two hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let it go; who cares!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey waited a good while under the orange trees, till Madame Antoine\r\ncame back, panting, waddling, with a thousand apologies to explain her\r\nabsence. Tonie did not dare to return. He was shy, and would not\r\nwillingly face any woman except his mother.\r\n\r\nIt was very pleasant to stay there under the orange trees, while the\r\nsun dipped lower and lower, turning the western sky to flaming copper\r\nand gold. The shadows lengthened and crept out like stealthy, grotesque\r\nmonsters across the grass.\r\n\r\nEdna and Robert both sat upon the ground\xe2\x80\x94that is, he lay upon the\r\nground beside her, occasionally picking at the hem of her muslin gown.\r\n\r\nMadame Antoine seated her fat body, broad and squat, upon a bench\r\nbeside the door. She had been talking all the afternoon, and had wound\r\nherself up to the storytelling pitch.\r\n\r\nAnd what stories she told them! But twice in her life she had left the\r\n_Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada_, and then for the briefest span. All her years she\r\nhad squatted and waddled there upon the island, gathering legends of\r\nthe Baratarians and the sea. The night came on, with the moon to\r\nlighten it. Edna could hear the whispering voices of dead men and the\r\nclick of muffled gold.\r\n\r\nWhen she and Robert stepped into Tonie\xe2\x80\x99s boat, with the red lateen\r\nsail, misty spirit forms were prowling in the shadows and among the\r\nreeds, and upon the water were phantom ships, speeding to cover.\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nThe youngest boy, Etienne, had been very naughty, Madame Ratignolle\r\nsaid, as she delivered him into the hands of his mother. He had been\r\nunwilling to go to bed and had made a scene; whereupon she had taken\r\ncharge of him and pacified him as well as she could. Raoul had been in\r\nbed and asleep for two hours.\r\n\r\nThe youngster was in his long white nightgown, that kept tripping him\r\nup as Madame Ratignolle led him along by the hand. With the other\r\nchubby fist he rubbed his eyes, which were heavy with sleep and ill\r\nhumor. Edna took him in her arms, and seating herself in the rocker,\r\nbegan to coddle and caress him, calling him all manner of tender names,\r\nsoothing him to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was not more than nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. No one had yet gone to bed but the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nL\xc3\xa9once had been very uneasy at first, Madame Ratignolle said, and had\r\nwanted to start at once for the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re_. But Monsieur Farival had\r\nassured him that his wife was only overcome with sleep and fatigue,\r\nthat Tonie would bring her safely back later in the day; and he had\r\nthus been dissuaded from crossing the bay. He had gone over to Klein\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nlooking up some cotton broker whom he wished to see in regard to\r\nsecurities, exchanges, stocks, bonds, or something of the sort, Madame\r\nRatignolle did not remember what. He said he would not remain away\r\nlate. She herself was suffering from heat and oppression, she said. She\r\ncarried a bottle of salts and a large fan. She would not consent to\r\nremain with Edna, for Monsieur Ratignolle was alone, and he detested\r\nabove all things to be left alone.\r\n\r\nWhen Etienne had fallen asleep Edna bore him into the back room, and\r\nRobert went and lifted the mosquito bar that she might lay the child\r\ncomfortably in his bed. The quadroon had vanished. When they emerged\r\nfrom the cottage Robert bade Edna good-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know we have been together the whole livelong day, Robert\xe2\x80\x94since\r\nearly this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll but the hundred years when you were sleeping. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand and went away in the direction of the beach. He did\r\nnot join any of the others, but walked alone toward the Gulf.\r\n\r\nEdna stayed outside, awaiting her husband\xe2\x80\x99s return. She had no desire\r\nto sleep or to retire; nor did she feel like going over to sit with the\r\nRatignolles, or to join Madame Lebrun and a group whose animated voices\r\nreached her as they sat in conversation before the house. She let her\r\nmind wander back over her stay at Grand Isle; and she tried to discover\r\nwherein this summer had been different from any and every other summer\r\nof her life. She could only realize that she herself\xe2\x80\x94her present\r\nself\xe2\x80\x94was in some way different from the other self. That she was seeing\r\nwith different eyes and making the acquaintance of new conditions in\r\nherself that colored and changed her environment, she did not yet\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\nShe wondered why Robert had gone away and left her. It did not occur to\r\nher to think he might have grown tired of being with her the livelong\r\nday. She was not tired, and she felt that he was not. She regretted\r\nthat he had gone. It was so much more natural to have him stay when he\r\nwas not absolutely required to leave her.\r\n\r\nAs Edna waited for her husband she sang low a little song that Robert\r\nhad sung as they crossed the bay. It began with \xe2\x80\x9cAh! _si tu savais_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand every verse ended with \xe2\x80\x9c_si tu savais_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobert\xe2\x80\x99s voice was not pretentious. It was musical and true. The voice,\r\nthe notes, the whole refrain haunted her memory.\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nWhen Edna entered the dining-room one evening a little late, as was her\r\nhabit, an unusually animated conversation seemed to be going on.\r\nSeveral persons were talking at once, and Victor\xe2\x80\x99s voice was\r\npredominating, even over that of his mother. Edna had returned late\r\nfrom her bath, had dressed in some haste, and her face was flushed. Her\r\nhead, set off by her dainty white gown, suggested a rich, rare blossom.\r\nShe took her seat at table between old Monsieur Farival and Madame\r\nRatignolle.\r\n\r\nAs she seated herself and was about to begin to eat her soup, which had\r\nbeen served when she entered the room, several persons informed her\r\nsimultaneously that Robert was going to Mexico. She laid her spoon down\r\nand looked about her bewildered. He had been with her, reading to her\r\nall the morning, and had never even mentioned such a place as Mexico.\r\nShe had not seen him during the afternoon; she had heard some one say\r\nhe was at the house, upstairs with his mother. This she had thought\r\nnothing of, though she was surprised when he did not join her later in\r\nthe afternoon, when she went down to the beach.\r\n\r\nShe looked across at him, where he sat beside Madame Lebrun, who\r\npresided. Edna\xe2\x80\x99s face was a blank picture of bewilderment, which she\r\nnever thought of disguising. He lifted his eyebrows with the pretext of\r\na smile as he returned her glance. He looked embarrassed and uneasy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is he going?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of everybody in general, as if Robert\r\nwere not there to answer for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis very evening!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat possesses him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwere some of the replies she gathered, uttered simultaneously in French\r\nand English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can a person start off from Grand\r\nIsle to Mexico at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, as if he were going over to\r\nKlein\xe2\x80\x99s or to the wharf or down to the beach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said all along I was going to Mexico; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying so for\r\nyears!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Robert, in an excited and irritable tone, with the air of\r\na man defending himself against a swarm of stinging insects.\r\n\r\nMadame Lebrun knocked on the table with her knife handle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease let Robert explain why he is going, and why he is going\r\nto-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she called out. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, this table is getting to be more\r\nand more like Bedlam every day, with everybody talking at once.\r\nSometimes\xe2\x80\x94I hope God will forgive me\xe2\x80\x94but positively, sometimes I wish\r\nVictor would lose the power of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor laughed sardonically as he thanked his mother for her holy wish,\r\nof which he failed to see the benefit to anybody, except that it might\r\nafford her a more ample opportunity and license to talk herself.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Farival thought that Victor should have been taken out in\r\nmid-ocean in his earliest youth and drowned. Victor thought there would\r\nbe more logic in thus disposing of old people with an established claim\r\nfor making themselves universally obnoxious. Madame Lebrun grew a\r\ntrifle hysterical; Robert called his brother some sharp, hard names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing much to explain, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; though he\r\nexplained, nevertheless\xe2\x80\x94looking chiefly at Edna\xe2\x80\x94that he could only meet\r\nthe gentleman whom he intended to join at Vera Cruz by taking such and\r\nsuch a steamer, which left New Orleans on such a day; that Beaudelet\r\nwas going out with his lugger-load of vegetables that night, which gave\r\nhim an opportunity of reaching the city and making his vessel in time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when did you make up your mind to all this?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Monsieur\r\nFarival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Robert, with a shade of annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the old gentleman, with\r\nnagging determination, as if he were cross-questioning a criminal in a\r\ncourt of justice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock this afternoon, Monsieur Farival,\xe2\x80\x9d Robert replied, in\r\na high voice and with a lofty air, which reminded Edna of some\r\ngentleman on the stage.\r\n\r\nShe had forced herself to eat most of her soup, and now she was picking\r\nthe flaky bits of a _court bouillon_ with her fork.\r\n\r\nThe lovers were profiting by the general conversation on Mexico to\r\nspeak in whispers of matters which they rightly considered were\r\ninteresting to no one but themselves. The lady in black had once\r\nreceived a pair of prayer-beads of curious workmanship from Mexico,\r\nwith very special indulgence attached to them, but she had never been\r\nable to ascertain whether the indulgence extended outside the Mexican\r\nborder. Father Fochel of the Cathedral had attempted to explain it; but\r\nhe had not done so to her satisfaction. And she begged that Robert\r\nwould interest himself, and discover, if possible, whether she was\r\nentitled to the indulgence accompanying the remarkably curious Mexican\r\nprayer-beads.\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle hoped that Robert would exercise extreme caution in\r\ndealing with the Mexicans, who, she considered, were a treacherous\r\npeople, unscrupulous and revengeful. She trusted she did them no\r\ninjustice in thus condemning them as a race. She had known personally\r\nbut one Mexican, who made and sold excellent tamales, and whom she\r\nwould have trusted implicitly, so soft-spoken was he. One day he was\r\narrested for stabbing his wife. She never knew whether he had been\r\nhanged or not.\r\n\r\nVictor had grown hilarious, and was attempting to tell an anecdote\r\nabout a Mexican girl who served chocolate one winter in a restaurant in\r\nDauphine Street. No one would listen to him but old Monsieur Farival,\r\nwho went into convulsions over the droll story.\r\n\r\nEdna wondered if they had all gone mad, to be talking and clamoring at\r\nthat rate. She herself could think of nothing to say about Mexico or\r\nthe Mexicans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time do you leave?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked Robert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt ten,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her. \xe2\x80\x9cBeaudelet wants to wait for the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all ready to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite ready. I shall only take a hand-bag, and shall pack my trunk in\r\nthe city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to answer some question put to him by his mother, and Edna,\r\nhaving finished her black coffee, left the table.\r\n\r\nShe went directly to her room. The little cottage was close and stuffy\r\nafter leaving the outer air. But she did not mind; there appeared to be\r\na hundred different things demanding her attention indoors. She began\r\nto set the toilet-stand to rights, grumbling at the negligence of the\r\nquadroon, who was in the adjoining room putting the children to bed.\r\nShe gathered together stray garments that were hanging on the backs of\r\nchairs, and put each where it belonged in closet or bureau drawer. She\r\nchanged her gown for a more comfortable and commodious wrapper. She\r\nrearranged her hair, combing and brushing it with unusual energy. Then\r\nshe went in and assisted the quadroon in getting the boys to bed.\r\n\r\nThey were very playful and inclined to talk\xe2\x80\x94to do anything but lie\r\nquiet and go to sleep. Edna sent the quadroon away to her supper and\r\ntold her she need not return. Then she sat and told the children a\r\nstory. Instead of soothing it excited them, and added to their\r\nwakefulness. She left them in heated argument, speculating about the\r\nconclusion of the tale which their mother promised to finish the\r\nfollowing night.\r\n\r\nThe little black girl came in to say that Madame Lebrun would like to\r\nhave Mrs. Pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till Mr.\r\nRobert went away. Edna returned answer that she had already undressed,\r\nthat she did not feel quite well, but perhaps she would go over to the\r\nhouse later. She started to dress again, and got as far advanced as to\r\nremove her _peignoir_. But changing her mind once more she resumed the\r\n_peignoir_, and went outside and sat down before her door. She was\r\noverheated and irritable, and fanned herself energetically for a while.\r\nMadame Ratignolle came down to discover what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that noise and confusion at the table must have upset me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nEdna, \xe2\x80\x9cand moreover, I hate shocks and surprises. The idea of Robert\r\nstarting off in such a ridiculously sudden and dramatic way! As if it\r\nwere a matter of life and death! Never saying a word about it all\r\nmorning when he was with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Madame Ratignolle. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it was showing us all\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nespecially\xe2\x80\x94very little consideration. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have surprised me in\r\nany of the others; those Lebruns are all given to heroics. But I must\r\nsay I should never have expected such a thing from Robert. Are you not\r\ncoming down? Come on, dear; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look friendly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, a little sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go to the trouble of\r\ndressing again; I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t dress; you look all right; fasten a belt around your\r\nwaist. Just look at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Edna; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you go on. Madame Lebrun might be offended\r\nif we both stayed away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle kissed Edna good-night, and went away, being in truth\r\nrather desirous of joining in the general and animated conversation\r\nwhich was still in progress concerning Mexico and the Mexicans.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later Robert came up, carrying his hand-bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you feeling well?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well enough. Are you going right away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lit a match and looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIn twenty minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\nThe sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a\r\nwhile. He sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the\r\nporch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet a chair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will do,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. He put on his soft hat and nervously took\r\nit off again, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, complained of\r\nthe heat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the fan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, offering it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! Thank you. It does no good; you have to stop fanning some\r\ntime, and feel all the more uncomfortable afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of the ridiculous things which men always say. I have never\r\nknown one to speak otherwise of fanning. How long will you be gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForever, perhaps. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It depends upon a good many things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in case it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forever, how long will it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis seems to me perfectly preposterous and uncalled for. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nit. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your motive for silence and mystery, never\r\nsaying a word to me about it this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d He remained silent, not\r\noffering to defend himself. He only said, after a moment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t part from me in any ill humor. I never knew you to be out of\r\npatience with me before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to part in any ill humor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut can\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nunderstand? I\xe2\x80\x99ve grown used to seeing you, to having you with me all\r\nthe time, and your action seems unfriendly, even unkind. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\noffer an excuse for it. Why, I was planning to be together, thinking of\r\nhow pleasant it would be to see you in the city next winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo was I,\xe2\x80\x9d he blurted. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stood up suddenly and\r\nheld out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my dear Mrs. Pontellier; good-by. You\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t completely forget me.\xe2\x80\x9d She clung to his hand,\r\nstriving to detain him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite to me when you get there, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Robert?\xe2\x80\x9d she entreated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, thank you. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow unlike Robert! The merest acquaintance would have said something\r\nmore emphatic than \xe2\x80\x9cI will, thank you; good-by,\xe2\x80\x9d to such a request.\r\n\r\nHe had evidently already taken leave of the people over at the house,\r\nfor he descended the steps and went to join Beaudelet, who was out\r\nthere with an oar across his shoulder waiting for Robert. They walked\r\naway in the darkness. She could only hear Beaudelet\xe2\x80\x99s voice; Robert had\r\napparently not even spoken a word of greeting to his companion.\r\n\r\nEdna bit her handkerchief convulsively, striving to hold back and to\r\nhide, even from herself as she would have hidden from another, the\r\nemotion which was troubling\xe2\x80\x94tearing\xe2\x80\x94her. Her eyes were brimming with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nFor the first time she recognized the symptoms of infatuation which she\r\nhad felt incipiently as a child, as a girl in her earliest teens, and\r\nlater as a young woman. The recognition did not lessen the reality, the\r\npoignancy of the revelation by any suggestion or promise of\r\ninstability. The past was nothing to her; offered no lesson which she\r\nwas willing to heed. The future was a mystery which she never attempted\r\nto penetrate. The present alone was significant; was hers, to torture\r\nher as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost\r\nthat which she had held, that she had been denied that which her\r\nimpassioned, newly awakened being demanded.\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you miss your friend greatly?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mademoiselle Reisz one morning\r\nas she came creeping up behind Edna, who had just left her cottage on\r\nher way to the beach. She spent much of her time in the water since she\r\nhad acquired finally the art of swimming. As their stay at Grand Isle\r\ndrew near its close, she felt that she could not give too much time to\r\na diversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that\r\nshe knew. When Mademoiselle Reisz came and touched her upon the\r\nshoulder and spoke to her, the woman seemed to echo the thought which\r\nwas ever in Edna\xe2\x80\x99s mind; or, better, the feeling which constantly\r\npossessed her.\r\n\r\nRobert\xe2\x80\x99s going had some way taken the brightness, the color, the\r\nmeaning out of everything. The conditions of her life were in no way\r\nchanged, but her whole existence was dulled, like a faded garment which\r\nseems to be no longer worth wearing. She sought him everywhere\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nothers whom she induced to talk about him. She went up in the mornings\r\nto Madame Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s room, braving the clatter of the old sewing-machine.\r\nShe sat there and chatted at intervals as Robert had done. She gazed\r\naround the room at the pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall,\r\nand discovered in some corner an old family album, which she examined\r\nwith the keenest interest, appealing to Madame Lebrun for enlightenment\r\nconcerning the many figures and faces which she discovered between its\r\npages.\r\n\r\nThere was a picture of Madame Lebrun with Robert as a baby, seated in\r\nher lap, a round-faced infant with a fist in his mouth. The eyes alone\r\nin the baby suggested the man. And that was he also in kilts, at the\r\nage of five, wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand. It made\r\nEdna laugh, and she laughed, too, at the portrait in his first long\r\ntrousers; while another interested her, taken when he left for college,\r\nlooking thin, long-faced, with eyes full of fire, ambition and great\r\nintentions. But there was no recent picture, none which suggested the\r\nRobert who had gone away five days ago, leaving a void and wilderness\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Robert stopped having his pictures taken when he had to pay for\r\nthem himself! He found wiser use for his money, he says,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\r\nMadame Lebrun. She had a letter from him, written before he left New\r\nOrleans. Edna wished to see the letter, and Madame Lebrun told her to\r\nlook for it either on the table or the dresser, or perhaps it was on\r\nthe mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nThe letter was on the bookshelf. It possessed the greatest interest and\r\nattraction for Edna; the envelope, its size and shape, the post-mark,\r\nthe handwriting. She examined every detail of the outside before\r\nopening it. There were only a few lines, setting forth that he would\r\nleave the city that afternoon, that he had packed his trunk in good\r\nshape, that he was well, and sent her his love and begged to be\r\naffectionately remembered to all. There was no special message to Edna\r\nexcept a postscript saying that if Mrs. Pontellier desired to finish\r\nthe book which he had been reading to her, his mother would find it in\r\nhis room, among other books there on the table. Edna experienced a pang\r\nof jealousy because he had written to his mother rather than to her.\r\n\r\nEvery one seemed to take for granted that she missed him. Even her\r\nhusband, when he came down the Saturday following Robert\xe2\x80\x99s departure,\r\nexpressed regret that he had gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you get on without him, Edna?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very dull without him,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted. Mr. Pontellier had seen\r\nRobert in the city, and Edna asked him a dozen questions or more. Where\r\nhad they met? On Carondelet Street, in the morning. They had gone \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand had a drink and a cigar together. What had they talked about?\r\nChiefly about his prospects in Mexico, which Mr. Pontellier thought\r\nwere promising. How did he look? How did he seem\xe2\x80\x94grave, or gay, or how?\r\nQuite cheerful, and wholly taken up with the idea of his trip, which\r\nMr. Pontellier found altogether natural in a young fellow about to seek\r\nfortune and adventure in a strange, queer country.\r\n\r\nEdna tapped her foot impatiently, and wondered why the children\r\npersisted in playing in the sun when they might be under the trees. She\r\nwent down and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not\r\nbeing more attentive.\r\n\r\nIt did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be\r\nmaking of Robert the object of conversation and leading her husband to\r\nspeak of him. The sentiment which she entertained for Robert in no way\r\nresembled that which she felt for her husband, or had ever felt, or\r\never expected to feel. She had all her life long been accustomed to\r\nharbor thoughts and emotions which never voiced themselves. They had\r\nnever taken the form of struggles. They belonged to her and were her\r\nown, and she entertained the conviction that she had a right to them\r\nand that they concerned no one but herself. Edna had once told Madame\r\nRatignolle that she would never sacrifice herself for her children, or\r\nfor any one. Then had followed a rather heated argument; the two women\r\ndid not appear to understand each other or to be talking the same\r\nlanguage. Edna tried to appease her friend, to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would give up the unessential; I would give my money, I would give\r\nmy life for my children; but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give myself. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it\r\nmore clear; it\xe2\x80\x99s only something which I am beginning to comprehend,\r\nwhich is revealing itself to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you would call the essential, or what you mean by\r\nthe unessential,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Ratignolle, cheerfully; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a woman who\r\nwould give her life for her children could do no more than that\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nBible tells you so. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes you could!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Edna.\r\n\r\nShe was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz\xe2\x80\x99s question the morning that\r\nlady, following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked\r\nif she did not greatly miss her young friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good morning, Mademoiselle; is it you? Why, of course I miss\r\nRobert. Are you going down to bathe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t been in the surf all summer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman, disagreeably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she\r\nshould have remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz\xe2\x80\x99s avoidance of the water\r\nhad furnished a theme for much pleasantry. Some among them thought it\r\nwas on account of her false hair, or the dread of getting the violets\r\nwet, while others attributed it to the natural aversion for water\r\nsometimes believed to accompany the artistic temperament. Mademoiselle\r\noffered Edna some chocolates in a paper bag, which she took from her\r\npocket, by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling. She habitually\r\nate chocolates for their sustaining quality; they contained much\r\nnutriment in small compass, she said. They saved her from starvation,\r\nas Madame Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s table was utterly impossible; and no one save so\r\nimpertinent a woman as Madame Lebrun could think of offering such food\r\nto people and requiring them to pay for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must feel very lonely without her son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, desiring to\r\nchange the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cHer favorite son, too. It must have been quite\r\nhard to let him go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle laughed maliciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer favorite son! Oh, dear! Who could have been imposing such a tale\r\nupon you? Aline Lebrun lives for Victor, and for Victor alone. She has\r\nspoiled him into the worthless creature he is. She worships him and the\r\nground he walks on. Robert is very well in a way, to give up all the\r\nmoney he can earn to the family, and keep the barest pittance for\r\nhimself. Favorite son, indeed! I miss the poor fellow myself, my dear.\r\nI liked to see him and to hear him about the place\xe2\x80\x94the only Lebrun who\r\nis worth a pinch of salt. He comes to see me often in the city. I like\r\nto play to him. That Victor! hanging would be too good for him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwonder Robert hasn\xe2\x80\x99t beaten him to death long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he had great patience with his brother,\xe2\x80\x9d offered Edna, glad\r\nto be talking about Robert, no matter what was said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! he thrashed him well enough a year or two ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was about a Spanish girl, whom Victor considered that he had some\r\nsort of claim upon. He met Robert one day talking to the girl, or\r\nwalking with her, or bathing with her, or carrying her basket\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember what;\xe2\x80\x94and he became so insulting and abusive that Robert gave\r\nhim a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order\r\nfor a good while. It\xe2\x80\x99s about time he was getting another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas her name Mariequita?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMariequita\xe2\x80\x94yes, that was it; Mariequita. I had forgotten. Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsly one, and a bad one, that Mariequita!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdna looked down at Mademoiselle Reisz and wondered how she could have\r\nlistened to her venom so long. For some reason she felt depressed,\r\nalmost unhappy. She had not intended to go into the water; but she\r\ndonned her bathing suit, and left Mademoiselle alone, seated under the\r\nshade of the children\xe2\x80\x99s tent. The water was growing cooler as the\r\nseason advanced. Edna plunged and swam about with an abandon that\r\nthrilled and invigorated her. She remained a long time in the water,\r\nhalf hoping that Mademoiselle Reisz would not wait for her.\r\n\r\nBut Mademoiselle waited. She was very amiable during the walk back, and\r\nraved much over Edna\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in her bathing suit. She talked about\r\nmusic. She hoped that Edna would go to see her in the city, and wrote\r\nher address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she\r\nfound in her pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you leave?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext Monday; and you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe following week,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Edna, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a pleasant\r\nsummer, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Mademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Mademoiselle Reisz, with a shrug, \xe2\x80\x9crather pleasant, if\r\nit hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the mosquitoes and the Farival twins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nThe Pontelliers possessed a very charming home on Esplanade Street in\r\nNew Orleans. It was a large, double cottage, with a broad front\r\nveranda, whose round, fluted columns supported the sloping roof. The\r\nhouse was painted a dazzling white; the outside shutters, or jalousies,\r\nwere green. In the yard, which was kept scrupulously neat, were flowers\r\nand plants of every description which flourishes in South Louisiana.\r\nWithin doors the appointments were perfect after the conventional type.\r\nThe softest carpets and rugs covered the floors; rich and tasteful\r\ndraperies hung at doors and windows. There were paintings, selected\r\nwith judgment and discrimination, upon the walls. The cut glass, the\r\nsilver, the heavy damask which daily appeared upon the table were the\r\nenvy of many women whose husbands were less generous than Mr.\r\nPontellier.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier was very fond of walking about his house examining its\r\nvarious appointments and details, to see that nothing was amiss. He\r\ngreatly valued his possessions, chiefly because they were his, and\r\nderived genuine pleasure from contemplating a painting, a statuette, a\r\nrare lace curtain\xe2\x80\x94no matter what\xe2\x80\x94after he had bought it and placed it\r\namong his household gods.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday afternoons\xe2\x80\x94Tuesday being Mrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s reception\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94there was a constant stream of callers\xe2\x80\x94women who came in carriages\r\nor in the street cars, or walked when the air was soft and distance\r\npermitted. A light-colored mulatto boy, in dress coat and bearing a\r\ndiminutive silver tray for the reception of cards, admitted them. A\r\nmaid, in white fluted cap, offered the callers liqueur, coffee, or\r\nchocolate, as they might desire. Mrs. Pontellier, attired in a handsome\r\nreception gown, remained in the drawing-room the entire afternoon\r\nreceiving her visitors. Men sometimes called in the evening with their\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nThis had been the programme which Mrs. Pontellier had religiously\r\nfollowed since her marriage, six years before. Certain evenings during\r\nthe week she and her husband attended the opera or sometimes the play.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier left his home in the mornings between nine and ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and rarely returned before half-past six or seven in the\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x94dinner being served at half-past seven.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife seated themselves at table one Tuesday evening, a few\r\nweeks after their return from Grand Isle. They were alone together. The\r\nboys were being put to bed; the patter of their bare, escaping feet\r\ncould be heard occasionally, as well as the pursuing voice of the\r\nquadroon, lifted in mild protest and entreaty. Mrs. Pontellier did not\r\nwear her usual Tuesday reception gown; she was in ordinary house dress.\r\nMr. Pontellier, who was observant about such things, noticed it, as he\r\nserved the soup and handed it to the boy in waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTired out, Edna? Whom did you have? Many callers?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. He tasted\r\nhis soup and began to season it with pepper, salt, vinegar,\r\nmustard\xe2\x80\x94everything within reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were a good many,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Edna, who was eating her soup with\r\nevident satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cI found their cards when I got home; I was out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her husband, with something like genuine consternation\r\nin his voice as he laid down the vinegar cruet and looked at her\r\nthrough his glasses. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what could have taken you out on Tuesday?\r\nWhat did you have to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I simply felt like going out, and I went out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope you left some suitable excuse,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband,\r\nsomewhat appeased, as he added a dash of cayenne pepper to the soup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I left no excuse. I told Joe to say I was out, that was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear, I should think you\xe2\x80\x99d understand by this time that people\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t do such things; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to observe _les convenances_ if we ever\r\nexpect to get on and keep up with the procession. If you felt that you\r\nhad to leave home this afternoon, you should have left some suitable\r\nexplanation for your absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis soup is really impossible; it\xe2\x80\x99s strange that woman hasn\xe2\x80\x99t learned\r\nyet to make a decent soup. Any free-lunch stand in town serves a better\r\none. Was Mrs. Belthrop here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring the tray with the cards, Joe. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember who was here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy retired and returned after a moment, bringing the tiny silver\r\ntray, which was covered with ladies\xe2\x80\x99 visiting cards. He handed it to\r\nMrs. Pontellier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to Mr. Pontellier,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nJoe offered the tray to Mr. Pontellier, and removed the soup.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier scanned the names of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s callers, reading some of\r\nthem aloud, with comments as he read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Misses Delasidas.\xe2\x80\x99 I worked a big deal in futures for their\r\nfather this morning; nice girls; it\xe2\x80\x99s time they were getting married.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Belthrop.\xe2\x80\x99 I tell you what it is, Edna; you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to snub\r\nMrs. Belthrop. Why, Belthrop could buy and sell us ten times over. His\r\nbusiness is worth a good, round sum to me. You\xe2\x80\x99d better write her a\r\nnote. \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. James Highcamp.\xe2\x80\x99 Hugh! the less you have to do with Mrs.\r\nHighcamp, the better. \xe2\x80\x98Madame Laforc\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x99 Came all the way from\r\nCarrolton, too, poor old soul. \xe2\x80\x98Miss Wiggs,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Eleanor Boltons.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe pushed the cards aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Edna, who had been fuming. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you taking the\r\nthing so seriously and making such a fuss over it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not making any fuss over it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s just such seeming trifles\r\nthat we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take seriously; such things count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fish was scorched. Mr. Pontellier would not touch it. Edna said she\r\ndid not mind a little scorched taste. The roast was in some way not to\r\nhis fancy, and he did not like the manner in which the vegetables were\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe spend money enough in this house to\r\nprocure at least one meal a day which a man could eat and retain his\r\nself-respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used to think the cook was a treasure,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Edna,\r\nindifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she was when she first came; but cooks are only human. They\r\nneed looking after, like any other class of persons that you employ.\r\nSuppose I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look after the clerks in my office, just let them run\r\nthings their own way; they\xe2\x80\x99d soon make a nice mess of me and my\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna, seeing that her husband arose from\r\ntable without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the\r\nhighly-seasoned soup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get my dinner at the club. Good night.\xe2\x80\x9d He went into the\r\nhall, took his hat and stick from the stand, and left the house.\r\n\r\nShe was somewhat familiar with such scenes. They had often made her\r\nvery unhappy. On a few previous occasions she had been completely\r\ndeprived of any desire to finish her dinner. Sometimes she had gone\r\ninto the kitchen to administer a tardy rebuke to the cook. Once she\r\nwent to her room and studied the cookbook during an entire evening,\r\nfinally writing out a menu for the week, which left her harassed with a\r\nfeeling that, after all, she had accomplished no good that was worth\r\nthe name.\r\n\r\nBut that evening Edna finished her dinner alone, with forced\r\ndeliberation. Her face was flushed and her eyes flamed with some inward\r\nfire that lighted them. After finishing her dinner she went to her\r\nroom, having instructed the boy to tell any other callers that she was\r\nindisposed.\r\n\r\nIt was a large, beautiful room, rich and picturesque in the soft, dim\r\nlight which the maid had turned low. She went and stood at an open\r\nwindow and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below. All the\r\nmystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid\r\nthe perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and\r\nfoliage. She was seeking herself and finding herself in just such\r\nsweet, half-darkness which met her moods. But the voices were not\r\nsoothing that came to her from the darkness and the sky above and the\r\nstars. They jeered and sounded mournful notes without promise, devoid\r\neven of hope. She turned back into the room and began to walk to and\r\nfro down its whole length without stopping, without resting. She\r\ncarried in her hands a thin handkerchief, which she tore into ribbons,\r\nrolled into a ball, and flung from her. Once she stopped, and taking\r\noff her wedding ring, flung it upon the carpet. When she saw it lying\r\nthere, she stamped her heel upon it, striving to crush it. But her\r\nsmall boot heel did not make an indenture, not a mark upon the little\r\nglittering circlet.\r\n\r\nIn a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung\r\nit upon the tiles of the hearth. She wanted to destroy something. The\r\ncrash and clatter were what she wanted to hear.\r\n\r\nA maid, alarmed at the din of breaking glass, entered the room to\r\ndiscover what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA vase fell upon the hearth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; leave it till\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you might get some of the glass in your feet, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the\r\nyoung woman, picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered\r\nupon the carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s your ring, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, under the chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdna held out her hand, and taking the ring, slipped it upon her\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nThe following morning Mr. Pontellier, upon leaving for his office,\r\nasked Edna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some\r\nnew fixtures for the library.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly think we need new fixtures, L\xc3\xa9once. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let us get anything\r\nnew; you are too extravagant. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you ever think of saving\r\nor putting by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way to become rich is to make money, my dear Edna, not to save\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with\r\nhim and select new fixtures. He kissed her good-by, and told her she\r\nwas not looking well and must take care of herself. She was unusually\r\npale and very quiet.\r\n\r\nShe stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house, and absently\r\npicked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by. She\r\ninhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her\r\nwhite morning gown. The boys were dragging along the banquette a small\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexpress wagon,\xe2\x80\x9d which they had filled with blocks and sticks. The\r\nquadroon was following them with little quick steps, having assumed a\r\nfictitious animation and alacrity for the occasion. A fruit vender was\r\ncrying his wares in the street.\r\n\r\nEdna looked straight before her with a self-absorbed expression upon\r\nher face. She felt no interest in anything about her. The street, the\r\nchildren, the fruit vender, the flowers growing there under her eyes,\r\nwere all part and parcel of an alien world which had suddenly become\r\nantagonistic.\r\n\r\nShe went back into the house. She had thought of speaking to the cook\r\nconcerning her blunders of the previous night; but Mr. Pontellier had\r\nsaved her that disagreeable mission, for which she was so poorly\r\nfitted. Mr. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s arguments were usually convincing with those\r\nwhom he employed. He left home feeling quite sure that he and Edna\r\nwould sit down that evening, and possibly a few subsequent evenings, to\r\na dinner deserving of the name.\r\n\r\nEdna spent an hour or two in looking over some of her old sketches. She\r\ncould see their shortcomings and defects, which were glaring in her\r\neyes. She tried to work a little, but found she was not in the humor.\r\nFinally she gathered together a few of the sketches\xe2\x80\x94those which she\r\nconsidered the least discreditable; and she carried them with her when,\r\na little later, she dressed and left the house. She looked handsome and\r\ndistinguished in her street gown. The tan of the seashore had left her\r\nface, and her forehead was smooth, white, and polished beneath her\r\nheavy, yellow-brown hair. There were a few freckles on her face, and a\r\nsmall, dark mole near the under lip and one on the temple, half-hidden\r\nin her hair.\r\n\r\nAs Edna walked along the street she was thinking of Robert. She was\r\nstill under the spell of her infatuation. She had tried to forget him,\r\nrealizing the inutility of remembering. But the thought of him was like\r\nan obsession, ever pressing itself upon her. It was not that she dwelt\r\nupon details of their acquaintance, or recalled in any special or\r\npeculiar way his personality; it was his being, his existence, which\r\ndominated her thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the\r\nmist of the forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled\r\nher with an incomprehensible longing.\r\n\r\nEdna was on her way to Madame Ratignolle\xe2\x80\x99s. Their intimacy, begun at\r\nGrand Isle, had not declined, and they had seen each other with some\r\nfrequency since their return to the city. The Ratignolles lived at no\r\ngreat distance from Edna\xe2\x80\x99s home, on the corner of a side street, where\r\nMonsieur Ratignolle owned and conducted a drug store which enjoyed a\r\nsteady and prosperous trade. His father had been in the business before\r\nhim, and Monsieur Ratignolle stood well in the community and bore an\r\nenviable reputation for integrity and clearheadedness. His family lived\r\nin commodious apartments over the store, having an entrance on the side\r\nwithin the _porte coch\xc3\xa8re_. There was something which Edna thought very\r\nFrench, very foreign, about their whole manner of living. In the large\r\nand pleasant salon which extended across the width of the house, the\r\nRatignolles entertained their friends once a fortnight with a _soir\xc3\xa9e\r\nmusicale_, sometimes diversified by card-playing. There was a friend\r\nwho played upon the cello. One brought his flute and another his\r\nviolin, while there were some who sang and a number who performed upon\r\nthe piano with various degrees of taste and agility. The Ratignolles\xe2\x80\x99\r\n_soir\xc3\xa9es musicales_ were widely known, and it was considered a\r\nprivilege to be invited to them.\r\n\r\nEdna found her friend engaged in assorting the clothes which had\r\nreturned that morning from the laundry. She at once abandoned her\r\noccupation upon seeing Edna, who had been ushered without ceremony into\r\nher presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Cit\xc3\xa9 can do it as well as I; it is really her business,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexplained to Edna, who apologized for interrupting her. And she\r\nsummoned a young black woman, whom she instructed, in French, to be\r\nvery careful in checking off the list which she handed her. She told\r\nher to notice particularly if a fine linen handkerchief of Monsieur\r\nRatignolle\xe2\x80\x99s, which was missing last week, had been returned; and to be\r\nsure to set to one side such pieces as required mending and darning.\r\n\r\nThen placing an arm around Edna\xe2\x80\x99s waist, she led her to the front of\r\nthe house, to the salon, where it was cool and sweet with the odor of\r\ngreat roses that stood upon the hearth in jars.\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home, in a\r\nneglig\xc3\xa9 which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich,\r\nmelting curves of her white throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna\r\nwith a smile when they were seated. She produced the roll of sketches\r\nand started to unfold them. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I ought to work again. I feel as\r\nif I wanted to be doing something. What do you think of them? Do you\r\nthink it worth while to take it up again and study some more? I might\r\nstudy for a while with Laidpore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knew that Madame Ratignolle\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in such a matter would be\r\nnext to valueless, that she herself had not alone decided, but\r\ndetermined; but she sought the words of praise and encouragement that\r\nwould help her to put heart into her venture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour talent is immense, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d protested Edna, well pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmense, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Madame Ratignolle, surveying the\r\nsketches one by one, at close range, then holding them at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length,\r\nnarrowing her eyes, and dropping her head on one side. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely, this\r\nBavarian peasant is worthy of framing; and this basket of apples! never\r\nhave I seen anything more lifelike. One might almost be tempted to\r\nreach out a hand and take one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdna could not control a feeling which bordered upon complacency at her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s praise, even realizing, as she did, its true worth. She\r\nretained a few of the sketches, and gave all the rest to Madame\r\nRatignolle, who appreciated the gift far beyond its value and proudly\r\nexhibited the pictures to her husband when he came up from the store a\r\nlittle later for his midday dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. Ratignolle was one of those men who are called the salt of the\r\nearth. His cheerfulness was unbounded, and it was matched by his\r\ngoodness of heart, his broad charity, and common sense. He and his wife\r\nspoke English with an accent which was only discernible through its\r\nun-English emphasis and a certain carefulness and deliberation. Edna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband spoke English with no accent whatever. The Ratignolles\r\nunderstood each other perfectly. If ever the fusion of two human beings\r\ninto one has been accomplished on this sphere it was surely in their\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nAs Edna seated herself at table with them she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cBetter a dinner\r\nof herbs,\xe2\x80\x9d though it did not take her long to discover that it was no\r\ndinner of herbs, but a delicious repast, simple, choice, and in every\r\nway satisfying.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Ratignolle was delighted to see her, though he found her\r\nlooking not so well as at Grand Isle, and he advised a tonic. He talked\r\na good deal on various topics, a little politics, some city news and\r\nneighborhood gossip. He spoke with an animation and earnestness that\r\ngave an exaggerated importance to every syllable he uttered. His wife\r\nwas keenly interested in everything he said, laying down her fork the\r\nbetter to listen, chiming in, taking the words out of his mouth.\r\n\r\nEdna felt depressed rather than soothed after leaving them. The little\r\nglimpse of domestic harmony which had been offered her, gave her no\r\nregret, no longing. It was not a condition of life which fitted her,\r\nand she could see in it but an appalling and hopeless ennui. She was\r\nmoved by a kind of commiseration for Madame Ratignolle,\xe2\x80\x94a pity for that\r\ncolorless existence which never uplifted its possessor beyond the\r\nregion of blind contentment, in which no moment of anguish ever visited\r\nher soul, in which she would never have the taste of life\xe2\x80\x99s delirium.\r\nEdna vaguely wondered what she meant by \xe2\x80\x9clife\xe2\x80\x99s delirium.\xe2\x80\x9d It had\r\ncrossed her thought like some unsought, extraneous impression.\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nEdna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish,\r\nto have stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon\r\nthe tiles. She was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such\r\nfutile expedients. She began to do as she liked and to feel as she\r\nliked. She completely abandoned her Tuesdays at home, and did not\r\nreturn the visits of those who had called upon her. She made no\r\nineffectual efforts to conduct her household _en bonne m\xc3\xa9nag\xc3\xa8re_, going\r\nand coming as it suited her fancy, and, so far as she was able, lending\r\nherself to any passing caprice.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met a\r\ncertain tacit submissiveness in his wife. But her new and unexpected\r\nline of conduct completely bewildered him. It shocked him. Then her\r\nabsolute disregard for her duties as a wife angered him. When Mr.\r\nPontellier became rude, Edna grew insolent. She had resolved never to\r\ntake another step backward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a\r\nhousehold, and the mother of children, to spend in an atelier days\r\nwhich would be better employed contriving for the comfort of her\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel like painting,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Edna. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I shan\xe2\x80\x99t always feel\r\nlike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen in God\xe2\x80\x99s name paint! but don\xe2\x80\x99t let the family go to the devil.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s Madame Ratignolle; because she keeps up her music, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet everything else go to chaos. And she\xe2\x80\x99s more of a musician than you\r\nare a painter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t a musician, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not a painter. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t on account of\r\npainting that I let things go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn account of what, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Let me alone; you bother me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt sometimes entered Mr. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s mind to wonder if his wife were\r\nnot growing a little unbalanced mentally. He could see plainly that she\r\nwas not herself. That is, he could not see that she was becoming\r\nherself and daily casting aside that fictitious self which we assume\r\nlike a garment with which to appear before the world.\r\n\r\nHer husband let her alone as she requested, and went away to his\r\noffice. Edna went up to her atelier\xe2\x80\x94a bright room in the top of the\r\nhouse. She was working with great energy and interest, without\r\naccomplishing anything, however, which satisfied her even in the\r\nsmallest degree. For a time she had the whole household enrolled in the\r\nservice of art. The boys posed for her. They thought it amusing at\r\nfirst, but the occupation soon lost its attractiveness when they\r\ndiscovered that it was not a game arranged especially for their\r\nentertainment. The quadroon sat for hours before Edna\xe2\x80\x99s palette,\r\npatient as a savage, while the house-maid took charge of the children,\r\nand the drawing-room went undusted. But the house-maid, too, served her\r\nterm as model when Edna perceived that the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s back and\r\nshoulders were molded on classic lines, and that her hair, loosened\r\nfrom its confining cap, became an inspiration. While Edna worked she\r\nsometimes sang low the little air, \xe2\x80\x9c_Ah! si tu savais!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt moved her with recollections. She could hear again the ripple of the\r\nwater, the flapping sail. She could see the glint of the moon upon the\r\nbay, and could feel the soft, gusty beating of the hot south wind. A\r\nsubtle current of desire passed through her body, weakening her hold\r\nupon the brushes and making her eyes burn.\r\n\r\nThere were days when she was very happy without knowing why. She was\r\nhappy to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one\r\nwith the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some\r\nperfect Southern day. She liked then to wander alone into strange and\r\nunfamiliar places. She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner,\r\nfashioned to dream in. And she found it good to dream and to be alone\r\nand unmolested.\r\n\r\nThere were days when she was unhappy, she did not know why,\xe2\x80\x94when it did\r\nnot seem worth while to be glad or sorry, to be alive or dead; when\r\nlife appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like\r\nworms struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation. She could not\r\nwork on such a day, nor weave fancies to stir her pulses and warm her\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nIt was during such a mood that Edna hunted up Mademoiselle Reisz. She\r\nhad not forgotten the rather disagreeable impression left upon her by\r\ntheir last interview; but she nevertheless felt a desire to see\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94above all, to listen while she played upon the piano. Quite early\r\nin the afternoon she started upon her quest for the pianist.\r\nUnfortunately she had mislaid or lost Mademoiselle Reisz\xe2\x80\x99s card, and\r\nlooking up her address in the city directory, she found that the woman\r\nlived on Bienville Street, some distance away. The directory which fell\r\ninto her hands was a year or more old, however, and upon reaching the\r\nnumber indicated, Edna discovered that the house was occupied by a\r\nrespectable family of mulattoes who had _chambres garnies_ to let. They\r\nhad been living there for six months, and knew absolutely nothing of a\r\nMademoiselle Reisz. In fact, they knew nothing of any of their\r\nneighbors; their lodgers were all people of the highest distinction,\r\nthey assured Edna. She did not linger to discuss class distinctions\r\nwith Madame Pouponne, but hastened to a neighboring grocery store,\r\nfeeling sure that Mademoiselle would have left her address with the\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nHe knew Mademoiselle Reisz a good deal better than he wanted to know\r\nher, he informed his questioner. In truth, he did not want to know her\r\nat all, or anything concerning her\xe2\x80\x94the most disagreeable and unpopular\r\nwoman who ever lived in Bienville Street. He thanked heaven she had\r\nleft the neighborhood, and was equally thankful that he did not know\r\nwhere she had gone.\r\n\r\nEdna\xe2\x80\x99s desire to see Mademoiselle Reisz had increased tenfold since\r\nthese unlooked-for obstacles had arisen to thwart it. She was wondering\r\nwho could give her the information she sought, when it suddenly\r\noccurred to her that Madame Lebrun would be the one most likely to do\r\nso. She knew it was useless to ask Madame Ratignolle, who was on the\r\nmost distant terms with the musician, and preferred to know nothing\r\nconcerning her. She had once been almost as emphatic in expressing\r\nherself upon the subject as the corner grocer.\r\n\r\nEdna knew that Madame Lebrun had returned to the city, for it was the\r\nmiddle of November. And she also knew where the Lebruns lived, on\r\nChartres Street.\r\n\r\nTheir home from the outside looked like a prison, with iron bars before\r\nthe door and lower windows. The iron bars were a relic of the old\r\n_r\xc3\xa9gime_, and no one had ever thought of dislodging them. At the side\r\nwas a high fence enclosing the garden. A gate or door opening upon the\r\nstreet was locked. Edna rang the bell at this side garden gate, and\r\nstood upon the banquette, waiting to be admitted.\r\n\r\nIt was Victor who opened the gate for her. A black woman, wiping her\r\nhands upon her apron, was close at his heels. Before she saw them Edna\r\ncould hear them in altercation, the woman\xe2\x80\x94plainly an anomaly\xe2\x80\x94claiming\r\nthe right to be allowed to perform her duties, one of which was to\r\nanswer the bell.\r\n\r\nVictor was surprised and delighted to see Mrs. Pontellier, and he made\r\nno attempt to conceal either his astonishment or his delight. He was a\r\ndark-browed, good-looking youngster of nineteen, greatly resembling his\r\nmother, but with ten times her impetuosity. He instructed the black\r\nwoman to go at once and inform Madame Lebrun that Mrs. Pontellier\r\ndesired to see her. The woman grumbled a refusal to do part of her duty\r\nwhen she had not been permitted to do it all, and started back to her\r\ninterrupted task of weeding the garden. Whereupon Victor administered a\r\nrebuke in the form of a volley of abuse, which, owing to its rapidity\r\nand incoherence, was all but incomprehensible to Edna. Whatever it was,\r\nthe rebuke was convincing, for the woman dropped her hoe and went\r\nmumbling into the house.\r\n\r\nEdna did not wish to enter. It was very pleasant there on the side\r\nporch, where there were chairs, a wicker lounge, and a small table. She\r\nseated herself, for she was tired from her long tramp; and she began to\r\nrock gently and smooth out the folds of her silk parasol. Victor drew\r\nup his chair beside her. He at once explained that the black woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffensive conduct was all due to imperfect training, as he was not\r\nthere to take her in hand. He had only come up from the island the\r\nmorning before, and expected to return next day. He stayed all winter\r\nat the island; he lived there, and kept the place in order and got\r\nthings ready for the summer visitors.\r\n\r\nBut a man needed occasional relaxation, he informed Mrs. Pontellier,\r\nand every now and again he drummed up a pretext to bring him to the\r\ncity. My! but he had had a time of it the evening before! He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant his mother to know, and he began to talk in a whisper. He was\r\nscintillant with recollections. Of course, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of telling\r\nMrs. Pontellier all about it, she being a woman and not comprehending\r\nsuch things. But it all began with a girl peeping and smiling at him\r\nthrough the shutters as he passed by. Oh! but she was a beauty!\r\nCertainly he smiled back, and went up and talked to her. Mrs.\r\nPontellier did not know him if she supposed he was one to let an\r\nopportunity like that escape him. Despite herself, the youngster amused\r\nher. She must have betrayed in her look some degree of interest or\r\nentertainment. The boy grew more daring, and Mrs. Pontellier might have\r\nfound herself, in a little while, listening to a highly colored story\r\nbut for the timely appearance of Madame Lebrun.\r\n\r\nThat lady was still clad in white, according to her custom of the\r\nsummer. Her eyes beamed an effusive welcome. Would not Mrs. Pontellier\r\ngo inside? Would she partake of some refreshment? Why had she not been\r\nthere before? How was that dear Mr. Pontellier and how were those sweet\r\nchildren? Had Mrs. Pontellier ever known such a warm November?\r\n\r\nVictor went and reclined on the wicker lounge behind his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair, where he commanded a view of Edna\xe2\x80\x99s face. He had taken her\r\nparasol from her hands while he spoke to her, and he now lifted it and\r\ntwirled it above him as he lay on his back. When Madame Lebrun\r\ncomplained that it was _so_ dull coming back to the city; that she saw\r\n_so_ few people now; that even Victor, when he came up from the island\r\nfor a day or two, had _so_ much to occupy him and engage his time; then\r\nit was that the youth went into contortions on the lounge and winked\r\nmischievously at Edna. She somehow felt like a confederate in crime,\r\nand tried to look severe and disapproving.\r\n\r\nThere had been but two letters from Robert, with little in them, they\r\ntold her. Victor said it was really not worth while to go inside for\r\nthe letters, when his mother entreated him to go in search of them. He\r\nremembered the contents, which in truth he rattled off very glibly when\r\nput to the test.\r\n\r\nOne letter was written from Vera Cruz and the other from the City of\r\nMexico. He had met Montel, who was doing everything toward his\r\nadvancement. So far, the financial situation was no improvement over\r\nthe one he had left in New Orleans, but of course the prospects were\r\nvastly better. He wrote of the City of Mexico, the buildings, the\r\npeople and their habits, the conditions of life which he found there.\r\nHe sent his love to the family. He inclosed a check to his mother, and\r\nhoped she would affectionately remember him to all his friends. That\r\nwas about the substance of the two letters. Edna felt that if there had\r\nbeen a message for her, she would have received it. The despondent\r\nframe of mind in which she had left home began again to overtake her,\r\nand she remembered that she wished to find Mademoiselle Reisz.\r\n\r\nMadame Lebrun knew where Mademoiselle Reisz lived. She gave Edna the\r\naddress, regretting that she would not consent to stay and spend the\r\nremainder of the afternoon, and pay a visit to Mademoiselle Reisz some\r\nother day. The afternoon was already well advanced.\r\n\r\nVictor escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and\r\nheld it over her while he walked to the car with her. He entreated her\r\nto bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly\r\nconfidential. She laughed and bantered him a little, remembering too\r\nlate that she should have been dignified and reserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow handsome Mrs. Pontellier looked!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lebrun to her son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRavishing!\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe city atmosphere has improved her. Some\r\nway she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like the same woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nSome people contended that the reason Mademoiselle Reisz always chose\r\napartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars,\r\npeddlars and callers. There were plenty of windows in her little front\r\nroom. They were for the most part dingy, but as they were nearly always\r\nopen it did not make so much difference. They often admitted into the\r\nroom a good deal of smoke and soot; but at the same time all the light\r\nand air that there was came through them. From her windows could be\r\nseen the crescent of the river, the masts of ships and the big chimneys\r\nof the Mississippi steamers. A magnificent piano crowded the apartment.\r\nIn the next room she slept, and in the third and last she harbored a\r\ngasoline stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to\r\ndescend to the neighboring restaurant. It was there also that she ate,\r\nkeeping her belongings in a rare old buffet, dingy and battered from a\r\nhundred years of use.\r\n\r\nWhen Edna knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz\xe2\x80\x99s front room door and entered,\r\nshe discovered that person standing beside the window, engaged in\r\nmending or patching an old prunella gaiter. The little musician laughed\r\nall over when she saw Edna. Her laugh consisted of a contortion of the\r\nface and all the muscles of the body. She seemed strikingly homely,\r\nstanding there in the afternoon light. She still wore the shabby lace\r\nand the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you remembered me at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle. \xe2\x80\x9cI had said to\r\nmyself, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, bah! she will never come.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you want me to come?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not thought much about it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mademoiselle. The two had\r\nseated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad, however, that you came. I have the water boiling back\r\nthere, and was just about to make some coffee. You will drink a cup\r\nwith me. And how is _la belle dame?_ Always handsome! always healthy!\r\nalways contented!\xe2\x80\x9d She took Edna\xe2\x80\x99s hand between her strong wiry\r\nfingers, holding it loosely without warmth, and executing a sort of\r\ndouble theme upon the back and palm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on; \xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes thought: \xe2\x80\x98She will never come. She\r\npromised as those women in society always do, without meaning it. She\r\nwill not come.\xe2\x80\x99 For I really don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you like me, Mrs.\r\nPontellier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I like you or not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Edna, gazing down at\r\nthe little woman with a quizzical look.\r\n\r\nThe candor of Mrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s admission greatly pleased Mademoiselle\r\nReisz. She expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the\r\nregion of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised\r\ncup of coffee. The coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very\r\nacceptable to Edna, who had declined refreshment at Madame Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nwas now beginning to feel hungry. Mademoiselle set the tray which she\r\nbrought in upon a small table near at hand, and seated herself once\r\nagain on the lumpy sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a letter from your friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, as she poured a\r\nlittle cream into Edna\xe2\x80\x99s cup and handed it to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your friend Robert. He wrote to me from the City of Mexico.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrote to _you_?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Edna in amazement, stirring her coffee\r\nabsently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to me. Why not? Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir all the warmth out of your coffee;\r\ndrink it. Though the letter might as well have been sent to you; it was\r\nnothing but Mrs. Pontellier from beginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see it,\xe2\x80\x9d requested the young woman, entreatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; a letter concerns no one but the person who writes it and the one\r\nto whom it is written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you just said it concerned me from beginning to end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was written about you, not to you. \xe2\x80\x98Have you seen Mrs. Pontellier?\r\nHow is she looking?\xe2\x80\x99 he asks. \xe2\x80\x98As Mrs. Pontellier says,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98as Mrs.\r\nPontellier once said.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If Mrs. Pontellier should call upon you, play\r\nfor her that Impromptu of Chopin\xe2\x80\x99s, my favorite. I heard it here a day\r\nor two ago, but not as you play it. I should like to know how it\r\naffects her,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on, as if he supposed we were constantly in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you answered it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, and again, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen play the Impromptu for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is growing late; what time do you have to be home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern me. Your question seems a little rude. Play the\r\nImpromptu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have told me nothing of yourself. What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPainting!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Edna. \xe2\x80\x9cI am becoming an artist. Think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! an artist! You have pretensions, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy pretensions? Do you think I could not become an artist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know you well enough to say. I do not know your talent or\r\nyour temperament. To be an artist includes much; one must possess many\r\ngifts\xe2\x80\x94absolute gifts\xe2\x80\x94which have not been acquired by one\xe2\x80\x99s own effort.\r\nAnd, moreover, to succeed, the artist must possess the courageous\r\nsoul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the courageous soul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourageous, _ma foi!_ The brave soul. The soul that dares and defies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me the letter and play for me the Impromptu. You see that I have\r\npersistence. Does that quality count for anything in art?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt counts with a foolish old woman whom you have captivated,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMademoiselle, with her wriggling laugh.\r\n\r\nThe letter was right there at hand in the drawer of the little table\r\nupon which Edna had just placed her coffee cup. Mademoiselle opened the\r\ndrawer and drew forth the letter, the topmost one. She placed it in\r\nEdna\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and without further comment arose and went to the piano.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle played a soft interlude. It was an improvisation. She sat\r\nlow at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into\r\nungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity.\r\nGradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening\r\nminor chords of the Chopin Impromptu.\r\n\r\nEdna did not know when the Impromptu began or ended. She sat in the\r\nsofa corner reading Robert\xe2\x80\x99s letter by the fading light. Mademoiselle\r\nhad glided from the Chopin into the quivering love notes of Isolde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsong, and back again to the Impromptu with its soulful and poignant\r\nlonging.\r\n\r\nThe shadows deepened in the little room. The music grew strange and\r\nfantastic\xe2\x80\x94turbulent, insistent, plaintive and soft with entreaty. The\r\nshadows grew deeper. The music filled the room. It floated out upon the\r\nnight, over the housetops, the crescent of the river, losing itself in\r\nthe silence of the upper air.\r\n\r\nEdna was sobbing, just as she had wept one midnight at Grand Isle when\r\nstrange, new voices awoke in her. She arose in some agitation to take\r\nher departure. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I come again, Mademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome whenever you feel like it. Be careful; the stairs and landings\r\nare dark; don\xe2\x80\x99t stumble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle reentered and lit a candle. Robert\xe2\x80\x99s letter was on the\r\nfloor. She stooped and picked it up. It was crumpled and damp with\r\ntears. Mademoiselle smoothed the letter out, restored it to the\r\nenvelope, and replaced it in the table drawer.\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nOne morning on his way into town Mr. Pontellier stopped at the house of\r\nhis old friend and family physician, Doctor Mandelet. The Doctor was a\r\nsemi-retired physician, resting, as the saying is, upon his laurels. He\r\nbore a reputation for wisdom rather than skill\xe2\x80\x94leaving the active\r\npractice of medicine to his assistants and younger contemporaries\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwas much sought for in matters of consultation. A few families, united\r\nto him by bonds of friendship, he still attended when they required the\r\nservices of a physician. The Pontelliers were among these.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier found the Doctor reading at the open window of his\r\nstudy. His house stood rather far back from the street, in the center\r\nof a delightful garden, so that it was quiet and peaceful at the old\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s study window. He was a great reader. He stared up\r\ndisapprovingly over his eye-glasses as Mr. Pontellier entered,\r\nwondering who had the temerity to disturb him at that hour of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Pontellier! Not sick, I hope. Come and have a seat. What news do\r\nyou bring this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d He was quite portly, with a profusion of gray\r\nhair, and small blue eyes which age had robbed of much of their\r\nbrightness but none of their penetration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I\xe2\x80\x99m never sick, Doctor. You know that I come of tough fiber\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nthat old Creole race of Pontelliers that dry up and finally blow away.\r\nI came to consult\xe2\x80\x94no, not precisely to consult\xe2\x80\x94to talk to you about\r\nEdna. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what ails her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Pontellier not well,\xe2\x80\x9d marveled the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I saw her\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthink it was a week ago\xe2\x80\x94walking along Canal Street, the picture of\r\nhealth, it seemed to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; she seems quite well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pontellier, leaning forward\r\nand whirling his stick between his two hands; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act\r\nwell. She\xe2\x80\x99s odd, she\xe2\x80\x99s not like herself. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make her out, and I\r\nthought perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does she act?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to explain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pontellier, throwing himself\r\nback in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cShe lets the housekeeping go to the dickens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well; women are not all alike, my dear Pontellier. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nconsider\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that; I told you I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain. Her whole attitude\xe2\x80\x94toward\r\nme and everybody and everything\xe2\x80\x94has changed. You know I have a quick\r\ntemper, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to quarrel or be rude to a woman, especially\r\nmy wife; yet I\xe2\x80\x99m driven to it, and feel like ten thousand devils after\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve made a fool of myself. She\xe2\x80\x99s making it devilishly uncomfortable\r\nfor me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got some sort of notion in her\r\nhead concerning the eternal rights of women; and\xe2\x80\x94you understand\xe2\x80\x94we meet\r\nin the morning at the breakfast table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman lifted his shaggy eyebrows, protruded his thick\r\nnether lip, and tapped the arms of his chair with his cushioned\r\nfingertips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing to her, Pontellier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoing! _Parbleu!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Doctor, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9chas she been associating of\r\nlate with a circle of pseudo-intellectual women\xe2\x80\x94super-spiritual\r\nsuperior beings? My wife has been telling me about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in Mr. Pontellier, \xe2\x80\x9cshe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nassociating with any one. She has abandoned her Tuesdays at home, has\r\nthrown over all her acquaintances, and goes tramping about by herself,\r\nmoping in the street-cars, getting in after dark. I tell you she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npeculiar. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it; I feel a little worried over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a new aspect for the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing hereditary?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nseriously. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing peculiar about her family antecedents, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, indeed! She comes of sound old Presbyterian Kentucky stock.\r\nThe old gentleman, her father, I have heard, used to atone for his\r\nweekday sins with his Sunday devotions. I know for a fact, that his\r\nrace horses literally ran away with the prettiest bit of Kentucky\r\nfarming land I ever laid eyes upon. Margaret\xe2\x80\x94you know Margaret\xe2\x80\x94she has\r\nall the Presbyterianism undiluted. And the youngest is something of a\r\nvixen. By the way, she gets married in a couple of weeks from now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend your wife up to the wedding,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Doctor, foreseeing a\r\nhappy solution. \xe2\x80\x9cLet her stay among her own people for a while; it will\r\ndo her good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want her to do. She won\xe2\x80\x99t go to the marriage. She says a\r\nwedding is one of the most lamentable spectacles on earth. Nice thing\r\nfor a woman to say to her husband!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Pontellier, fuming\r\nanew at the recollection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPontellier,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, \xe2\x80\x9clet your\r\nwife alone for a while. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother her, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let her bother you.\r\nWoman, my dear friend, is a very peculiar and delicate organism\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsensitive and highly organized woman, such as I know Mrs. Pontellier to\r\nbe, is especially peculiar. It would require an inspired psychologist\r\nto deal successfully with them. And when ordinary fellows like you and\r\nme attempt to cope with their idiosyncrasies the result is bungling.\r\nMost women are moody and whimsical. This is some passing whim of your\r\nwife, due to some cause or causes which you and I needn\xe2\x80\x99t try to\r\nfathom. But it will pass happily over, especially if you let her alone.\r\nSend her around to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that; there\xe2\x80\x99d be no reason for it,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Mr.\r\nPontellier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll go around and see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll drop in to\r\ndinner some evening _en bon ami_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo! by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Mr. Pontellier. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat evening will you come?\r\nSay Thursday. Will you come Thursday?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, rising to take his\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; Thursday. My wife may possibly have some engagement for me\r\nThursday. In case she has, I shall let you know. Otherwise, you may\r\nexpect me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier turned before leaving to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to New York on business very soon. I have a big scheme on\r\nhand, and want to be on the field proper to pull the ropes and handle\r\nthe ribbons. We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you in on the inside if you say so, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thank you, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cI leave such\r\nventures to you younger men with the fever of life still in your\r\nblood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I wanted to say,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Pontellier, with his hand on the\r\nknob; \xe2\x80\x9cI may have to be absent a good while. Would you advise me to\r\ntake Edna along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means, if she wishes to go. If not, leave her here. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncontradict her. The mood will pass, I assure you. It may take a month,\r\ntwo, three months\xe2\x80\x94possibly longer, but it will pass; have patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, _\xc3\xa0 jeudi_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pontellier, as he let himself out.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor would have liked during the course of conversation to ask,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any man in the case?\xe2\x80\x9d but he knew his Creole too well to make\r\nsuch a blunder as that.\r\n\r\nHe did not resume his book immediately, but sat for a while\r\nmeditatively looking out into the garden.\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nEdna\xe2\x80\x99s father was in the city, and had been with them several days. She\r\nwas not very warmly or deeply attached to him, but they had certain\r\ntastes in common, and when together they were companionable. His coming\r\nwas in the nature of a welcome disturbance; it seemed to furnish a new\r\ndirection for her emotions.\r\n\r\nHe had come to purchase a wedding gift for his daughter, Janet, and an\r\noutfit for himself in which he might make a creditable appearance at\r\nher marriage. Mr. Pontellier had selected the bridal gift, as every one\r\nimmediately connected with him always deferred to his taste in such\r\nmatters. And his suggestions on the question of dress\xe2\x80\x94which too often\r\nassumes the nature of a problem\xe2\x80\x94were of inestimable value to his\r\nfather-in-law. But for the past few days the old gentleman had been\r\nupon Edna\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and in his society she was becoming acquainted with\r\na new set of sensations. He had been a colonel in the Confederate army,\r\nand still maintained, with the title, the military bearing which had\r\nalways accompanied it. His hair and mustache were white and silky,\r\nemphasizing the rugged bronze of his face. He was tall and thin, and\r\nwore his coats padded, which gave a fictitious breadth and depth to his\r\nshoulders and chest. Edna and her father looked very distinguished\r\ntogether, and excited a good deal of notice during their\r\nperambulations. Upon his arrival she began by introducing him to her\r\natelier and making a sketch of him. He took the whole matter very\r\nseriously. If her talent had been ten-fold greater than it was, it\r\nwould not have surprised him, convinced as he was that he had\r\nbequeathed to all of his daughters the germs of a masterful capability,\r\nwhich only depended upon their own efforts to be directed toward\r\nsuccessful achievement.\r\n\r\nBefore her pencil he sat rigid and unflinching, as he had faced the\r\ncannon\xe2\x80\x99s mouth in days gone by. He resented the intrusion of the\r\nchildren, who gaped with wondering eyes at him, sitting so stiff up\r\nthere in their mother\xe2\x80\x99s bright atelier. When they drew near he motioned\r\nthem away with an expressive action of the foot, loath to disturb the\r\nfixed lines of his countenance, his arms, or his rigid shoulders.\r\n\r\nEdna, anxious to entertain him, invited Mademoiselle Reisz to meet him,\r\nhaving promised him a treat in her piano playing; but Mademoiselle\r\ndeclined the invitation. So together they attended a _soir\xc3\xa9e musicale_\r\nat the Ratignolles\xe2\x80\x99. Monsieur and Madame Ratignolle made much of the\r\nColonel, installing him as the guest of honor and engaging him at once\r\nto dine with them the following Sunday, or any day which he might\r\nselect. Madame coquetted with him in the most captivating and naive\r\nmanner, with eyes, gestures, and a profusion of compliments, till the\r\nColonel\xe2\x80\x99s old head felt thirty years younger on his padded shoulders.\r\nEdna marveled, not comprehending. She herself was almost devoid of\r\ncoquetry.\r\n\r\nThere were one or two men whom she observed at the _soir\xc3\xa9e musicale;_\r\nbut she would never have felt moved to any kittenish display to attract\r\ntheir notice\xe2\x80\x94to any feline or feminine wiles to express herself toward\r\nthem. Their personality attracted her in an agreeable way. Her fancy\r\nselected them, and she was glad when a lull in the music gave them an\r\nopportunity to meet her and talk with her. Often on the street the\r\nglance of strange eyes had lingered in her memory, and sometimes had\r\ndisturbed her.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier did not attend these _soir\xc3\xa9es musicales_. He considered\r\nthem _bourgeois_, and found more diversion at the club. To Madame\r\nRatignolle he said the music dispensed at her _soir\xc3\xa9es_ was too\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cheavy,\xe2\x80\x9d too far beyond his untrained comprehension. His excuse\r\nflattered her. But she disapproved of Mr. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s club, and she\r\nwas frank enough to tell Edna so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity Mr. Pontellier doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay home more in the evenings. I\r\nthink you would be more\xe2\x80\x94well, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying it\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nunited, if he did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, with a blank look in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I\r\ndo if he stayed home? We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say to each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had not much of anything to say to her father, for that matter; but\r\nhe did not antagonize her. She discovered that he interested her,\r\nthough she realized that he might not interest her long; and for the\r\nfirst time in her life she felt as if she were thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith him. He kept her busy serving him and ministering to his wants. It\r\namused her to do so. She would not permit a servant or one of the\r\nchildren to do anything for him which she might do herself. Her husband\r\nnoticed, and thought it was the expression of a deep filial attachment\r\nwhich he had never suspected.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel drank numerous \xe2\x80\x9ctoddies\xe2\x80\x9d during the course of the day,\r\nwhich left him, however, imperturbed. He was an expert at concocting\r\nstrong drinks. He had even invented some, to which he had given\r\nfantastic names, and for whose manufacture he required diverse\r\ningredients that it devolved upon Edna to procure for him.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Mandelet dined with the Pontelliers on Thursday he could\r\ndiscern in Mrs. Pontellier no trace of that morbid condition which her\r\nhusband had reported to him. She was excited and in a manner radiant.\r\nShe and her father had been to the race course, and their thoughts when\r\nthey seated themselves at table were still occupied with the events of\r\nthe afternoon, and their talk was still of the track. The Doctor had\r\nnot kept pace with turf affairs. He had certain recollections of racing\r\nin what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthe good old times\xe2\x80\x9d when the Lecompte stables\r\nflourished, and he drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not\r\nbe left out and seem wholly devoid of the modern spirit. But he failed\r\nto impose upon the Colonel, and was even far from impressing him with\r\nthis trumped-up knowledge of bygone days. Edna had staked her father on\r\nhis last venture, with the most gratifying results to both of them.\r\nBesides, they had met some very charming people, according to the\r\nColonel\xe2\x80\x99s impressions. Mrs. Mortimer Merriman and Mrs. James Highcamp,\r\nwho were there with Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin, had joined them and had enlivened the\r\nhours in a fashion that warmed him to think of.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward horseracing,\r\nand was even rather inclined to discourage it as a pastime, especially\r\nwhen he considered the fate of that blue-grass farm in Kentucky. He\r\nendeavored, in a general way, to express a particular disapproval, and\r\nonly succeeded in arousing the ire and opposition of his father-in-law.\r\nA pretty dispute followed, in which Edna warmly espoused her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncause and the Doctor remained neutral.\r\n\r\nHe observed his hostess attentively from under his shaggy brows, and\r\nnoted a subtle change which had transformed her from the listless woman\r\nhe had known into a being who, for the moment, seemed palpitant with\r\nthe forces of life. Her speech was warm and energetic. There was no\r\nrepression in her glance or gesture. She reminded him of some\r\nbeautiful, sleek animal waking up in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was excellent. The claret was warm and the champagne was\r\ncold, and under their beneficent influence the threatened\r\nunpleasantness melted and vanished with the fumes of the wine.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier warmed up and grew reminiscent. He told some amusing\r\nplantation experiences, recollections of old Iberville and his youth,\r\nwhen he hunted \xe2\x80\x99possum in company with some friendly darky; thrashed\r\nthe pecan trees, shot the grosbec, and roamed the woods and fields in\r\nmischievous idleness.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel, with little sense of humor and of the fitness of things,\r\nrelated a somber episode of those dark and bitter days, in which he had\r\nacted a conspicuous part and always formed a central figure. Nor was\r\nthe Doctor happier in his selection, when he told the old, ever new and\r\ncurious story of the waning of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s love, seeking strange, new\r\nchannels, only to return to its legitimate source after days of fierce\r\nunrest. It was one of the many little human documents which had been\r\nunfolded to him during his long career as a physician. The story did\r\nnot seem especially to impress Edna. She had one of her own to tell, of\r\na woman who paddled away with her lover one night in a pirogue and\r\nnever came back. They were lost amid the Baratarian Islands, and no one\r\never heard of them or found trace of them from that day to this. It was\r\na pure invention. She said that Madame Antoine had related it to her.\r\nThat, also, was an invention. Perhaps it was a dream she had had. But\r\nevery glowing word seemed real to those who listened. They could feel\r\nthe hot breath of the Southern night; they could hear the long sweep of\r\nthe pirogue through the glistening moonlit water, the beating of birds\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwings, rising startled from among the reeds in the salt-water pools;\r\nthey could see the faces of the lovers, pale, close together, rapt in\r\noblivious forgetfulness, drifting into the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe champagne was cold, and its subtle fumes played fantastic tricks\r\nwith Edna\xe2\x80\x99s memory that night.\r\n\r\nOutside, away from the glow of the fire and the soft lamplight, the\r\nnight was chill and murky. The Doctor doubled his old-fashioned cloak\r\nacross his breast as he strode home through the darkness. He knew his\r\nfellow-creatures better than most men; knew that inner life which so\r\nseldom unfolds itself to unanointed eyes. He was sorry he had accepted\r\nPontellier\xe2\x80\x99s invitation. He was growing old, and beginning to need rest\r\nand an imperturbed spirit. He did not want the secrets of other lives\r\nthrust upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Arobin,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself as he walked. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\r\nto heaven it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nEdna and her father had a warm, and almost violent dispute upon the\r\nsubject of her refusal to attend her sister\xe2\x80\x99s wedding. Mr. Pontellier\r\ndeclined to interfere, to interpose either his influence or his\r\nauthority. He was following Doctor Mandelet\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and letting her\r\ndo as she liked. The Colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of\r\nfilial kindness and respect, her want of sisterly affection and womanly\r\nconsideration. His arguments were labored and unconvincing. He doubted\r\nif Janet would accept any excuse\xe2\x80\x94forgetting that Edna had offered none.\r\nHe doubted if Janet would ever speak to her again, and he was sure\r\nMargaret would not.\r\n\r\nEdna was glad to be rid of her father when he finally took himself off\r\nwith his wedding garments and his bridal gifts, with his padded\r\nshoulders, his Bible reading, his \xe2\x80\x9ctoddies\xe2\x80\x9d and ponderous oaths.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier followed him closely. He meant to stop at the wedding on\r\nhis way to New York and endeavor by every means which money and love\r\ncould devise to atone somewhat for Edna\xe2\x80\x99s incomprehensible action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too lenient, too lenient by far, L\xc3\xa9once,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted the\r\nColonel. \xe2\x80\x9cAuthority, coercion are what is needed. Put your foot down\r\ngood and hard; the only way to manage a wife. Take my word for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was perhaps unaware that he had coerced his own wife into\r\nher grave. Mr. Pontellier had a vague suspicion of it which he thought\r\nit needless to mention at that late day.\r\n\r\nEdna was not so consciously gratified at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s leaving home as\r\nshe had been over the departure of her father. As the day approached\r\nwhen he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay, she grew\r\nmelting and affectionate, remembering his many acts of consideration\r\nand his repeated expressions of an ardent attachment. She was\r\nsolicitous about his health and his welfare. She bustled around,\r\nlooking after his clothing, thinking about heavy underwear, quite as\r\nMadame Ratignolle would have done under similar circumstances. She\r\ncried when he went away, calling him her dear, good friend, and she was\r\nquite certain she would grow lonely before very long and go to join him\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\nBut after all, a radiant peace settled upon her when she at last found\r\nherself alone. Even the children were gone. Old Madame Pontellier had\r\ncome herself and carried them off to Iberville with their quadroon. The\r\nold madame did not venture to say she was afraid they would be\r\nneglected during L\xc3\xa9once\xe2\x80\x99s absence; she hardly ventured to think so. She\r\nwas hungry for them\xe2\x80\x94even a little fierce in her attachment. She did not\r\nwant them to be wholly \xe2\x80\x9cchildren of the pavement,\xe2\x80\x9d she always said when\r\nbegging to have them for a space. She wished them to know the country,\r\nwith its streams, its fields, its woods, its freedom, so delicious to\r\nthe young. She wished them to taste something of the life their father\r\nhad lived and known and loved when he, too, was a little child.\r\n\r\nWhen Edna was at last alone, she breathed a big, genuine sigh of\r\nrelief. A feeling that was unfamiliar but very delicious came over her.\r\nShe walked all through the house, from one room to another, as if\r\ninspecting it for the first time. She tried the various chairs and\r\nlounges, as if she had never sat and reclined upon them before. And she\r\nperambulated around the outside of the house, investigating, looking to\r\nsee if windows and shutters were secure and in order. The flowers were\r\nlike new acquaintances; she approached them in a familiar spirit, and\r\nmade herself at home among them. The garden walks were damp, and Edna\r\ncalled to the maid to bring out her rubber sandals. And there she\r\nstayed, and stooped, digging around the plants, trimming, picking dead,\r\ndry leaves. The children\xe2\x80\x99s little dog came out, interfering, getting in\r\nher way. She scolded him, laughed at him, played with him. The garden\r\nsmelled so good and looked so pretty in the afternoon sunlight. Edna\r\nplucked all the bright flowers she could find, and went into the house\r\nwith them, she and the little dog.\r\n\r\nEven the kitchen assumed a sudden interesting character which she had\r\nnever before perceived. She went in to give directions to the cook, to\r\nsay that the butcher would have to bring much less meat, that they\r\nwould require only half their usual quantity of bread, of milk and\r\ngroceries. She told the cook that she herself would be greatly occupied\r\nduring Mr. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s absence, and she begged her to take all thought\r\nand responsibility of the larder upon her own shoulders.\r\n\r\nThat night Edna dined alone. The candelabra, with a few candles in the\r\ncenter of the table, gave all the light she needed. Outside the circle\r\nof light in which she sat, the large dining-room looked solemn and\r\nshadowy. The cook, placed upon her mettle, served a delicious repast\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nluscious tenderloin broiled _\xc3\xa0 point_. The wine tasted good; the\r\n_marron glac\xc3\xa9_ seemed to be just what she wanted. It was so pleasant,\r\ntoo, to dine in a comfortable _peignoir_.\r\n\r\nShe thought a little sentimentally about L\xc3\xa9once and the children, and\r\nwondered what they were doing. As she gave a dainty scrap or two to the\r\ndoggie, she talked intimately to him about Etienne and Raoul. He was\r\nbeside himself with astonishment and delight over these companionable\r\nadvances, and showed his appreciation by his little quick, snappy barks\r\nand a lively agitation.\r\n\r\nThen Edna sat in the library after dinner and read Emerson until she\r\ngrew sleepy. She realized that she had neglected her reading, and\r\ndetermined to start anew upon a course of improving studies, now that\r\nher time was completely her own to do with as she liked.\r\n\r\nAfter a refreshing bath, Edna went to bed. And as she snuggled\r\ncomfortably beneath the eiderdown a sense of restfulness invaded her,\r\nsuch as she had not known before.\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nWhen the weather was dark and cloudy Edna could not work. She needed\r\nthe sun to mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point. She had\r\nreached a stage when she seemed to be no longer feeling her way,\r\nworking, when in the humor, with sureness and ease. And being devoid of\r\nambition, and striving not toward accomplishment, she drew satisfaction\r\nfrom the work in itself.\r\n\r\nOn rainy or melancholy days Edna went out and sought the society of the\r\nfriends she had made at Grand Isle. Or else she stayed indoors and\r\nnursed a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own\r\ncomfort and peace of mind. It was not despair; but it seemed to her as\r\nif life were passing by, leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled.\r\nYet there were other days when she listened, was led on and deceived by\r\nfresh promises which her youth held out to her.\r\n\r\nShe went again to the races, and again. Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin and Mrs. Highcamp\r\ncalled for her one bright afternoon in Arobin\xe2\x80\x99s drag. Mrs. Highcamp was\r\na worldly but unaffected, intelligent, slim, tall blonde woman in the\r\nforties, with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared. She had\r\na daughter who served her as a pretext for cultivating the society of\r\nyoung men of fashion. Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin was one of them. He was a familiar\r\nfigure at the race course, the opera, the fashionable clubs. There was\r\na perpetual smile in his eyes, which seldom failed to awaken a\r\ncorresponding cheerfulness in any one who looked into them and listened\r\nto his good-humored voice. His manner was quiet, and at times a little\r\ninsolent. He possessed a good figure, a pleasing face, not overburdened\r\nwith depth of thought or feeling; and his dress was that of the\r\nconventional man of fashion.\r\n\r\nHe admired Edna extravagantly, after meeting her at the races with her\r\nfather. He had met her before on other occasions, but she had seemed to\r\nhim unapproachable until that day. It was at his instigation that Mrs.\r\nHighcamp called to ask her to go with them to the Jockey Club to\r\nwitness the turf event of the season.\r\n\r\nThere were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse\r\nas well as Edna, but there was certainly none who knew it better. She\r\nsat between her two companions as one having authority to speak. She\r\nlaughed at Arobin\xe2\x80\x99s pretensions, and deplored Mrs. Highcamp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nignorance. The race horse was a friend and intimate associate of her\r\nchildhood. The atmosphere of the stables and the breath of the blue\r\ngrass paddock revived in her memory and lingered in her nostrils. She\r\ndid not perceive that she was talking like her father as the sleek\r\ngeldings ambled in review before them. She played for very high stakes,\r\nand fortune favored her. The fever of the game flamed in her cheeks and\r\neyes, and it got into her blood and into her brain like an intoxicant.\r\nPeople turned their heads to look at her, and more than one lent an\r\nattentive ear to her utterances, hoping thereby to secure the elusive\r\nbut ever-desired \xe2\x80\x9ctip.\xe2\x80\x9d Arobin caught the contagion of excitement which\r\ndrew him to Edna like a magnet. Mrs. Highcamp remained, as usual,\r\nunmoved, with her indifferent stare and uplifted eyebrows.\r\n\r\nEdna stayed and dined with Mrs. Highcamp upon being urged to do so.\r\nArobin also remained and sent away his drag.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was quiet and uninteresting, save for the cheerful efforts\r\nof Arobin to enliven things. Mrs. Highcamp deplored the absence of her\r\ndaughter from the races, and tried to convey to her what she had missed\r\nby going to the \xe2\x80\x9cDante reading\xe2\x80\x9d instead of joining them. The girl held\r\na geranium leaf up to her nose and said nothing, but looked knowing and\r\nnoncommittal. Mr. Highcamp was a plain, bald-headed man, who only\r\ntalked under compulsion. He was unresponsive. Mrs. Highcamp was full of\r\ndelicate courtesy and consideration toward her husband. She addressed\r\nmost of her conversation to him at table. They sat in the library after\r\ndinner and read the evening papers together under the droplight; while\r\nthe younger people went into the drawing-room near by and talked. Miss\r\nHighcamp played some selections from Grieg upon the piano. She seemed\r\nto have apprehended all of the composer\xe2\x80\x99s coldness and none of his\r\npoetry. While Edna listened she could not help wondering if she had\r\nlost her taste for music.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for her to go home, Mr. Highcamp grunted a lame\r\noffer to escort her, looking down at his slippered feet with tactless\r\nconcern. It was Arobin who took her home. The car ride was long, and it\r\nwas late when they reached Esplanade Street. Arobin asked permission to\r\nenter for a second to light his cigarette\xe2\x80\x94his match safe was empty. He\r\nfilled his match safe, but did not light his cigarette until he left\r\nher, after she had expressed her willingness to go to the races with\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\nEdna was neither tired nor sleepy. She was hungry again, for the\r\nHighcamp dinner, though of excellent quality, had lacked abundance. She\r\nrummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of Gruyere and some\r\ncrackers. She opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox.\r\nEdna felt extremely restless and excited. She vacantly hummed a\r\nfantastic tune as she poked at the wood embers on the hearth and\r\nmunched a cracker.\r\n\r\nShe wanted something to happen\xe2\x80\x94something, anything; she did not know\r\nwhat. She regretted that she had not made Arobin stay a half hour to\r\ntalk over the horses with her. She counted the money she had won. But\r\nthere was nothing else to do, so she went to bed, and tossed there for\r\nhours in a sort of monotonous agitation.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night she remembered that she had forgotten to\r\nwrite her regular letter to her husband; and she decided to do so next\r\nday and tell him about her afternoon at the Jockey Club. She lay wide\r\nawake composing a letter which was nothing like the one which she wrote\r\nnext day. When the maid awoke her in the morning Edna was dreaming of\r\nMr. Highcamp playing the piano at the entrance of a music store on\r\nCanal Street, while his wife was saying to Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin, as they\r\nboarded an Esplanade Street car:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity that so much talent has been neglected! but I must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen, a few days later, Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin again called for Edna in his drag,\r\nMrs. Highcamp was not with him. He said they would pick her up. But as\r\nthat lady had not been apprised of his intention of picking her up, she\r\nwas not at home. The daughter was just leaving the house to attend the\r\nmeeting of a branch Folk Lore Society, and regretted that she could not\r\naccompany them. Arobin appeared nonplused, and asked Edna if there were\r\nany one else she cared to ask.\r\n\r\nShe did not deem it worth while to go in search of any of the\r\nfashionable acquaintances from whom she had withdrawn herself. She\r\nthought of Madame Ratignolle, but knew that her fair friend did not\r\nleave the house, except to take a languid walk around the block with\r\nher husband after nightfall. Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed at\r\nsuch a request from Edna. Madame Lebrun might have enjoyed the outing,\r\nbut for some reason Edna did not want her. So they went alone, she and\r\nArobin.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was intensely interesting to her. The excitement came\r\nback upon her like a remittent fever. Her talk grew familiar and\r\nconfidential. It was no labor to become intimate with Arobin. His\r\nmanner invited easy confidence. The preliminary stage of becoming\r\nacquainted was one which he always endeavored to ignore when a pretty\r\nand engaging woman was concerned.\r\n\r\nHe stayed and dined with Edna. He stayed and sat beside the wood fire.\r\nThey laughed and talked; and before it was time to go he was telling\r\nher how different life might have been if he had known her years\r\nbefore. With ingenuous frankness he spoke of what a wicked,\r\nill-disciplined boy he had been, and impulsively drew up his cuff to\r\nexhibit upon his wrist the scar from a saber cut which he had received\r\nin a duel outside of Paris when he was nineteen. She touched his hand\r\nas she scanned the red cicatrice on the inside of his white wrist. A\r\nquick impulse that was somewhat spasmodic impelled her fingers to close\r\nin a sort of clutch upon his hand. He felt the pressure of her pointed\r\nnails in the flesh of his palm.\r\n\r\nShe arose hastily and walked toward the mantel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sight of a wound or scar always agitates and sickens me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have looked at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he entreated, following her; \xe2\x80\x9cit never occurred to\r\nme that it might be repulsive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood close to her, and the effrontery in his eyes repelled the old,\r\nvanishing self in her, yet drew all her awakening sensuousness. He saw\r\nenough in her face to impel him to take her hand and hold it while he\r\nsaid his lingering good night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go to the races again?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of the races. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose all\r\nthe money I\xe2\x80\x99ve won, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work when the weather is bright,\r\ninstead of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; work; to be sure. You promised to show me your work. What morning\r\nmay I come up to your atelier? To-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDay after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me! I know something of such things. I might\r\nhelp you with a stray suggestion or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Good night. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go after you have said good night? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on in a high, excited pitch, attempting to\r\ndraw away her hand. She felt that her words lacked dignity and\r\nsincerity, and she knew that he felt it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you don\xe2\x80\x99t like me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I offended you. How have I\r\noffended you? What have I done? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d And he bent and\r\npressed his lips upon her hand as if he wished never more to withdraw\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Arobin,\xe2\x80\x9d she complained, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m greatly upset by the excitement of\r\nthe afternoon; I\xe2\x80\x99m not myself. My manner must have misled you in some\r\nway. I wish you to go, please.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke in a monotonous, dull tone.\r\nHe took his hat from the table, and stood with eyes turned from her,\r\nlooking into the dying fire. For a moment or two he kept an impressive\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour manner has not misled me, Mrs. Pontellier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nown emotions have done that. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. When I\xe2\x80\x99m near you, how\r\ncould I help it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything of it, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother, please. You\r\nsee, I go when you command me. If you wish me to stay away, I shall do\r\nso. If you let me come back, I\xe2\x80\x94oh! you will let me come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe cast one appealing glance at her, to which she made no response.\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e Arobin\xe2\x80\x99s manner was so genuine that it often deceived even\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nEdna did not care or think whether it were genuine or not. When she was\r\nalone she looked mechanically at the back of her hand which he had\r\nkissed so warmly. Then she leaned her head down on the mantelpiece. She\r\nfelt somewhat like a woman who in a moment of passion is betrayed into\r\nan act of infidelity, and realizes the significance of the act without\r\nbeing wholly awakened from its glamour. The thought was passing vaguely\r\nthrough her mind, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would he think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not mean her husband; she was thinking of Robert Lebrun. Her\r\nhusband seemed to her now like a person whom she had married without\r\nlove as an excuse.\r\n\r\nShe lit a candle and went up to her room. Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin was absolutely\r\nnothing to her. Yet his presence, his manners, the warmth of his\r\nglances, and above all the touch of his lips upon her hand had acted\r\nlike a narcotic upon her.\r\n\r\nShe slept a languorous sleep, interwoven with vanishing dreams.\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nAlc\xc3\xa9e Arobin wrote Edna an elaborate note of apology, palpitant with\r\nsincerity. It embarrassed her; for in a cooler, quieter moment it\r\nappeared to her absurd that she should have taken his action so\r\nseriously, so dramatically. She felt sure that the significance of the\r\nwhole occurrence had lain in her own self-consciousness. If she ignored\r\nhis note it would give undue importance to a trivial affair. If she\r\nreplied to it in a serious spirit it would still leave in his mind the\r\nimpression that she had in a susceptible moment yielded to his\r\ninfluence. After all, it was no great matter to have one\xe2\x80\x99s hand kissed.\r\nShe was provoked at his having written the apology. She answered in as\r\nlight and bantering a spirit as she fancied it deserved, and said she\r\nwould be glad to have him look in upon her at work whenever he felt the\r\ninclination and his business gave him the opportunity.\r\n\r\nHe responded at once by presenting himself at her home with all his\r\ndisarming na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9. And then there was scarcely a day which followed\r\nthat she did not see him or was not reminded of him. He was prolific in\r\npretexts. His attitude became one of good-humored subservience and\r\ntacit adoration. He was ready at all times to submit to her moods,\r\nwhich were as often kind as they were cold. She grew accustomed to him.\r\nThey became intimate and friendly by imperceptible degrees, and then by\r\nleaps. He sometimes talked in a way that astonished her at first and\r\nbrought the crimson into her face; in a way that pleased her at last,\r\nappealing to the animalism that stirred impatiently within her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing which so quieted the turmoil of Edna\xe2\x80\x99s senses as a\r\nvisit to Mademoiselle Reisz. It was then, in the presence of that\r\npersonality which was offensive to her, that the woman, by her divine\r\nart, seemed to reach Edna\xe2\x80\x99s spirit and set it free.\r\n\r\nIt was misty, with heavy, lowering atmosphere, one afternoon, when Edna\r\nclimbed the stairs to the pianist\xe2\x80\x99s apartments under the roof. Her\r\nclothes were dripping with moisture. She felt chilled and pinched as\r\nshe entered the room. Mademoiselle was poking at a rusty stove that\r\nsmoked a little and warmed the room indifferently. She was endeavoring\r\nto heat a pot of chocolate on the stove. The room looked cheerless and\r\ndingy to Edna as she entered. A bust of Beethoven, covered with a hood\r\nof dust, scowled at her from the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! here comes the sunlight!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mademoiselle, rising from her\r\nknees before the stove. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it will be warm and bright enough; I can\r\nlet the fire alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed the stove door with a bang, and approaching, assisted in\r\nremoving Edna\xe2\x80\x99s dripping mackintosh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are cold; you look miserable. The chocolate will soon be hot. But\r\nwould you rather have a taste of brandy? I have scarcely touched the\r\nbottle which you brought me for my cold.\xe2\x80\x9d A piece of red flannel was\r\nwrapped around Mademoiselle\xe2\x80\x99s throat; a stiff neck compelled her to\r\nhold her head on one side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take some brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, shivering as she removed her\r\ngloves and overshoes. She drank the liquor from the glass as a man\r\nwould have done. Then flinging herself upon the uncomfortable sofa she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle, I am going to move away from my house on Esplanade\r\nStreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated the musician, neither surprised nor especially\r\ninterested. Nothing ever seemed to astonish her very much. She was\r\nendeavoring to adjust the bunch of violets which had become loose from\r\nits fastening in her hair. Edna drew her down upon the sofa, and taking\r\na pin from her own hair, secured the shabby artificial flowers in their\r\naccustomed place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you astonished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPassably. Where are you going? to New York? to Iberville? to your\r\nfather in Mississippi? where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust two steps away,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Edna, \xe2\x80\x9cin a little four-room house\r\naround the corner. It looks so cozy, so inviting and restful, whenever\r\nI pass by; and it\xe2\x80\x99s for rent. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired looking after that big house.\r\nIt never seemed like mine, anyway\xe2\x80\x94like home. It\xe2\x80\x99s too much trouble. I\r\nhave to keep too many servants. I am tired bothering with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not your true reason, _ma belle_. There is no use in telling\r\nme lies. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your reason, but you have not told me the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEdna did not protest or endeavor to justify herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house, the money that provides for it, are not mine. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nenough reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are your husband\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mademoiselle, with a shrug and a\r\nmalicious elevation of the eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I see there is no deceiving you. Then let me tell you: It is a\r\ncaprice. I have a little money of my own from my mother\xe2\x80\x99s estate, which\r\nmy father sends me by driblets. I won a large sum this winter on the\r\nraces, and I am beginning to sell my sketches. Laidpore is more and\r\nmore pleased with my work; he says it grows in force and individuality.\r\nI cannot judge of that myself, but I feel that I have gained in ease\r\nand confidence. However, as I said, I have sold a good many through\r\nLaidpore. I can live in the tiny house for little or nothing, with one\r\nservant. Old Celestine, who works occasionally for me, says she will\r\ncome stay with me and do my work. I know I shall like it, like the\r\nfeeling of freedom and independence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does your husband say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not told him yet. I only thought of it this morning. He will\r\nthink I am demented, no doubt. Perhaps you think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle shook her head slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cYour reason is not yet clear to\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nNeither was it quite clear to Edna herself; but it unfolded itself as\r\nshe sat for a while in silence. Instinct had prompted her to put away\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s bounty in casting off her allegiance. She did not know\r\nhow it would be when he returned. There would have to be an\r\nunderstanding, an explanation. Conditions would some way adjust\r\nthemselves, she felt; but whatever came, she had resolved never again\r\nto belong to another than herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall give a grand dinner before I leave the old house!\xe2\x80\x9d Edna\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to come to it, Mademoiselle. I will give you\r\neverything that you like to eat and to drink. We shall sing and laugh\r\nand be merry for once.\xe2\x80\x9d And she uttered a sigh that came from the very\r\ndepths of her being.\r\n\r\nIf Mademoiselle happened to have received a letter from Robert during\r\nthe interval of Edna\xe2\x80\x99s visits, she would give her the letter\r\nunsolicited. And she would seat herself at the piano and play as her\r\nhumor prompted her while the young woman read the letter.\r\n\r\nThe little stove was roaring; it was red-hot, and the chocolate in the\r\ntin sizzled and sputtered. Edna went forward and opened the stove door,\r\nand Mademoiselle rising, took a letter from under the bust of Beethoven\r\nand handed it to Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother! so soon!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, her eyes filled with delight. \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nme, Mademoiselle, does he know that I see his letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever in the world! He would be angry and would never write to me\r\nagain if he thought so. Does he write to you? Never a line. Does he\r\nsend you a message? Never a word. It is because he loves you, poor\r\nfool, and is trying to forget you, since you are not free to listen to\r\nhim or to belong to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you show me his letters, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you begged for them? Can I refuse you anything? Oh! you cannot\r\ndeceive me,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mademoiselle approached her beloved instrument and\r\nbegan to play. Edna did not at once read the letter. She sat holding it\r\nin her hand, while the music penetrated her whole being like an\r\neffulgence, warming and brightening the dark places of her soul. It\r\nprepared her for joy and exultation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, letting the letter fall to the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you\r\nnot tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d She went and grasped Mademoiselle\xe2\x80\x99s hands up from the\r\nkeys. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! unkind! malicious! Why did you not tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he was coming back? No great news, _ma foi_. I wonder he did not\r\ncome long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when, when?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edna, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe does not say when.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says \xe2\x80\x98very soon.\xe2\x80\x99 You know as much about it as I do; it is all in\r\nthe letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why? Why is he coming? Oh, if I thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and she snatched the\r\nletter from the floor and turned the pages this way and that way,\r\nlooking for the reason, which was left untold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were young and in love with a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle, turning on\r\nthe stool and pressing her wiry hands between her knees as she looked\r\ndown at Edna, who sat on the floor holding the letter, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to me\r\nhe would have to be some _grand esprit;_ a man with lofty aims and\r\nability to reach them; one who stood high enough to attract the notice\r\nof his fellow-men. It seems to me if I were young and in love I should\r\nnever deem a man of ordinary caliber worthy of my devotion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it is you who are telling lies and seeking to deceive me,\r\nMademoiselle; or else you have never been in love, and know nothing\r\nabout it. Why,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Edna, clasping her knees and looking up into\r\nMademoiselle\xe2\x80\x99s twisted face, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you suppose a woman knows why she\r\nloves? Does she select? Does she say to herself: \xe2\x80\x98Go to! Here is a\r\ndistinguished statesman with presidential possibilities; I shall\r\nproceed to fall in love with him.\xe2\x80\x99 Or, \xe2\x80\x98I shall set my heart upon this\r\nmusician, whose fame is on every tongue?\xe2\x80\x99 Or, \xe2\x80\x98This financier, who\r\ncontrols the world\xe2\x80\x99s money markets?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are purposely misunderstanding me, _ma reine_. Are you in love\r\nwith Robert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna. It was the first time she had admitted it, and a glow\r\noverspread her face, blotching it with red spots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her companion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you love him when you ought not\r\nto?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdna, with a motion or two, dragged herself on her knees before\r\nMademoiselle Reisz, who took the glowing face between her two hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because his hair is brown and grows away from his temples;\r\nbecause he opens and shuts his eyes, and his nose is a little out of\r\ndrawing; because he has two lips and a square chin, and a little finger\r\nwhich he can\xe2\x80\x99t straighten from having played baseball too energetically\r\nin his youth. Because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you do, in short,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Mademoiselle. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do\r\nwhen he comes back?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo? Nothing, except feel glad and happy to be alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was already glad and happy to be alive at the mere thought of his\r\nreturn. The murky, lowering sky, which had depressed her a few hours\r\nbefore, seemed bracing and invigorating as she splashed through the\r\nstreets on her way home.\r\n\r\nShe stopped at a confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s and ordered a huge box of bonbons for\r\nthe children in Iberville. She slipped a card in the box, on which she\r\nscribbled a tender message and sent an abundance of kisses.\r\n\r\nBefore dinner in the evening Edna wrote a charming letter to her\r\nhusband, telling him of her intention to move for a while into the\r\nlittle house around the block, and to give a farewell dinner before\r\nleaving, regretting that he was not there to share it, to help out with\r\nthe menu and assist her in entertaining the guests. Her letter was\r\nbrilliant and brimming with cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arobin that evening. \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\nfound you in such a happy mood.\xe2\x80\x9d Edna was tired by that time, and was\r\nreclining on the lounge before the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know the weather prophet has told us we shall see the sun\r\npretty soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that ought to be reason enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he acquiesced. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive me another if I sat here all night imploring you.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat close to\r\nher on a low tabouret, and as he spoke his fingers lightly touched the\r\nhair that fell a little over her forehead. She liked the touch of his\r\nfingers through her hair, and closed her eyes sensitively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of these days,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to pull myself together for a\r\nwhile and think\xe2\x80\x94try to determine what character of a woman I am; for,\r\ncandidly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. By all the codes which I am acquainted with, I\r\nam a devilishly wicked specimen of the sex. But some way I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconvince myself that I am. I must think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use? Why should you bother thinking about it when I\r\ncan tell you what manner of woman you are.\xe2\x80\x9d His fingers strayed\r\noccasionally down to her warm, smooth cheeks and firm chin, which was\r\ngrowing a little full and double.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! You will tell me that I am adorable; everything that is\r\ncaptivating. Spare yourself the effort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I shan\xe2\x80\x99t tell you anything of the sort, though I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nlying if I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Mademoiselle Reisz?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pianist? I know her by sight. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard her play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says queer things sometimes in a bantering way that you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnotice at the time and you find yourself thinking about afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for instance, when I left her to-day, she put her arms around me\r\nand felt my shoulder blades, to see if my wings were strong, she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition and\r\nprejudice must have strong wings. It is a sad spectacle to see the\r\nweaklings bruised, exhausted, fluttering back to earth.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither would you soar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking of any extraordinary flights. I only half comprehend\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard she\xe2\x80\x99s partially demented,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arobin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seems to me wonderfully sane,\xe2\x80\x9d Edna replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m told she\xe2\x80\x99s extremely disagreeable and unpleasant. Why have you\r\nintroduced her at a moment when I desired to talk of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! talk of me if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edna, clasping her hands beneath\r\nher head; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let me think of something else while you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m jealous of your thoughts to-night. They\xe2\x80\x99re making you a little\r\nkinder than usual; but some way I feel as if they were wandering, as if\r\nthey were not here with me.\xe2\x80\x9d She only looked at him and smiled. His\r\neyes were very near. He leaned upon the lounge with an arm extended\r\nacross her, while the other hand still rested upon her hair. They\r\ncontinued silently to look into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. When he leaned\r\nforward and kissed her, she clasped his head, holding his lips to hers.\r\n\r\nIt was the first kiss of her life to which her nature had really\r\nresponded. It was a flaming torch that kindled desire.\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nEdna cried a little that night after Arobin left her. It was only one\r\nphase of the multitudinous emotions which had assailed her. There was\r\nwith her an overwhelming feeling of irresponsibility. There was the\r\nshock of the unexpected and the unaccustomed. There was her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreproach looking at her from the external things around her which he\r\nhad provided for her external existence. There was Robert\xe2\x80\x99s reproach\r\nmaking itself felt by a quicker, fiercer, more overpowering love, which\r\nhad awakened within her toward him. Above all, there was understanding.\r\nShe felt as if a mist had been lifted from her eyes, enabling her to\r\nlook upon and comprehend the significance of life, that monster made up\r\nof beauty and brutality. But among the conflicting sensations which\r\nassailed her, there was neither shame nor remorse. There was a dull\r\npang of regret because it was not the kiss of love which had inflamed\r\nher, because it was not love which had held this cup of life to her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nWithout even waiting for an answer from her husband regarding his\r\nopinion or wishes in the matter, Edna hastened her preparations for\r\nquitting her home on Esplanade Street and moving into the little house\r\naround the block. A feverish anxiety attended her every action in that\r\ndirection. There was no moment of deliberation, no interval of repose\r\nbetween the thought and its fulfillment. Early upon the morning\r\nfollowing those hours passed in Arobin\xe2\x80\x99s society, Edna set about\r\nsecuring her new abode and hurrying her arrangements for occupying it.\r\nWithin the precincts of her home she felt like one who has entered and\r\nlingered within the portals of some forbidden temple in which a\r\nthousand muffled voices bade her begone.\r\n\r\nWhatever was her own in the house, everything which she had acquired\r\naside from her husband\xe2\x80\x99s bounty, she caused to be transported to the\r\nother house, supplying simple and meager deficiencies from her own\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nArobin found her with rolled sleeves, working in company with the\r\nhouse-maid when he looked in during the afternoon. She was splendid and\r\nrobust, and had never appeared handsomer than in the old blue gown,\r\nwith a red silk handkerchief knotted at random around her head to\r\nprotect her hair from the dust. She was mounted upon a high stepladder,\r\nunhooking a picture from the wall when he entered. He had found the\r\nfront door open, and had followed his ring by walking in\r\nunceremoniously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to kill yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d She greeted him\r\nwith affected carelessness, and appeared absorbed in her occupation.\r\n\r\nIf he had expected to find her languishing, reproachful, or indulging\r\nin sentimental tears, he must have been greatly surprised.\r\n\r\nHe was no doubt prepared for any emergency, ready for any one of the\r\nforegoing attitudes, just as he bent himself easily and naturally to\r\nthe situation which confronted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come down,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted, holding the ladder and looking up at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9cEllen is afraid to mount the ladder. Joe is\r\nworking over at the \xe2\x80\x98pigeon house\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the name Ellen gives it,\r\nbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s so small and looks like a pigeon house\xe2\x80\x94and some one has to\r\ndo this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArobin pulled off his coat, and expressed himself ready and willing to\r\ntempt fate in her place. Ellen brought him one of her dust-caps, and\r\nwent into contortions of mirth, which she found it impossible to\r\ncontrol, when she saw him put it on before the mirror as grotesquely as\r\nhe could. Edna herself could not refrain from smiling when she fastened\r\nit at his request. So it was he who in turn mounted the ladder,\r\nunhooking pictures and curtains, and dislodging ornaments as Edna\r\ndirected. When he had finished he took off his dust-cap and went out to\r\nwash his hands.\r\n\r\nEdna was sitting on the tabouret, idly brushing the tips of a feather\r\nduster along the carpet when he came in again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything more you will let me do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cEllen can manage the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d She kept the\r\nyoung woman occupied in the drawing-room, unwilling to be left alone\r\nwith Arobin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked; \xe2\x80\x9cthe grand event, the _coup\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be day after to-morrow. Why do you call it the \xe2\x80\x98_coup\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat?_\xe2\x80\x99 Oh! it will be very fine; all my best of everything\xe2\x80\x94crystal,\r\nsilver and gold, S\xc3\xa8vres, flowers, music, and champagne to swim in. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlet L\xc3\xa9once pay the bills. I wonder what he\xe2\x80\x99ll say when he sees the\r\nbills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you ask me why I call it a _coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat?_\xe2\x80\x9d Arobin had put on his\r\ncoat, and he stood before her and asked if his cravat was plumb. She\r\ntold him it was, looking no higher than the tip of his collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you go to the \xe2\x80\x98pigeon house?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94with all due acknowledgment to\r\nEllen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDay after to-morrow, after the dinner. I shall sleep there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen, will you very kindly get me a glass of water?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arobin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dust in the curtains, if you will pardon me for hinting such a\r\nthing, has parched my throat to a crisp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile Ellen gets the water,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cI will say good-by\r\nand let you go. I must get rid of this grime, and I have a million\r\nthings to do and think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall I see you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arobin, seeking to detain her, the maid\r\nhaving left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the dinner, of course. You are invited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot before?\xe2\x80\x94not to-night or to-morrow morning or to-morrow noon or\r\nnight? or the day after morning or noon? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see yourself,\r\nwithout my telling you, what an eternity it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had followed her into the hall and to the foot of the stairway,\r\nlooking up at her as she mounted with her face half turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot an instant sooner,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. But she laughed and looked at him\r\nwith eyes that at once gave him courage to wait and made it torture to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nThough Edna had spoken of the dinner as a very grand affair, it was in\r\ntruth a very small affair and very select, in so much as the guests\r\ninvited were few and were selected with discrimination. She had counted\r\nupon an even dozen seating themselves at her round mahogany board,\r\nforgetting for the moment that Madame Ratignolle was to the last degree\r\n_souffrante_ and unpresentable, and not foreseeing that Madame Lebrun\r\nwould send a thousand regrets at the last moment. So there were only\r\nten, after all, which made a cozy, comfortable number.\r\n\r\nThere were Mr. and Mrs. Merriman, a pretty, vivacious little woman in\r\nthe thirties; her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a\r\nshallow-pate, who laughed a good deal at other people\xe2\x80\x99s witticisms, and\r\nhad thereby made himself extremely popular. Mrs. Highcamp had\r\naccompanied them. Of course, there was Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin; and Mademoiselle\r\nReisz had consented to come. Edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets\r\nwith black lace trimmings for her hair. Monsieur Ratignolle brought\r\nhimself and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s excuses. Victor Lebrun, who happened to be in\r\nthe city, bent upon relaxation, had accepted with alacrity. There was a\r\nMiss Mayblunt, no longer in her teens, who looked at the world through\r\nlorgnettes and with the keenest interest. It was thought and said that\r\nshe was intellectual; it was suspected of her that she wrote under a\r\n_nom de guerre_. She had come with a gentleman by the name of\r\nGouvernail, connected with one of the daily papers, of whom nothing\r\nspecial could be said, except that he was observant and seemed quiet\r\nand inoffensive. Edna herself made the tenth, and at half-past eight\r\nthey seated themselves at table, Arobin and Monsieur Ratignolle on\r\neither side of their hostess.\r\n\r\nMrs. Highcamp sat between Arobin and Victor Lebrun. Then came Mrs.\r\nMerriman, Mr. Gouvernail, Miss Mayblunt, Mr. Merriman, and Mademoiselle\r\nReisz next to Monsieur Ratignolle.\r\n\r\nThere was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the\r\ntable, an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin\r\nunder strips of lace-work. There were wax candles, in massive brass\r\ncandelabra, burning softly under yellow silk shades; full, fragrant\r\nroses, yellow and red, abounded. There were silver and gold, as she had\r\nsaid there would be, and crystal which glittered like the gems which\r\nthe women wore.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary stiff dining chairs had been discarded for the occasion\r\nand replaced by the most commodious and luxurious which could be\r\ncollected throughout the house. Mademoiselle Reisz, being exceedingly\r\ndiminutive, was elevated upon cushions, as small children are sometimes\r\nhoisted at table upon bulky volumes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething new, Edna?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Mayblunt, with lorgnette directed\r\ntoward a magnificent cluster of diamonds that sparkled, that almost\r\nsputtered, in Edna\xe2\x80\x99s hair, just over the center of her forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite new; \xe2\x80\x98brand\xe2\x80\x99 new, in fact; a present from my husband. It arrived\r\nthis morning from New York. I may as well admit that this is my\r\nbirthday, and that I am twenty-nine. In good time I expect you to drink\r\nmy health. Meanwhile, I shall ask you to begin with this cocktail,\r\ncomposed\xe2\x80\x94would you say \xe2\x80\x98composed?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d with an appeal to Miss\r\nMayblunt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccomposed by my father in honor of Sister Janet\xe2\x80\x99s wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore each guest stood a tiny glass that looked and sparkled like a\r\ngarnet gem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, all things considered,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Arobin, \xe2\x80\x9cit might not be amiss to\r\nstart out by drinking the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s health in the cocktail which he\r\ncomposed, on the birthday of the most charming of women\xe2\x80\x94the daughter\r\nwhom he invented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Merriman\xe2\x80\x99s laugh at this sally was such a genuine outburst and so\r\ncontagious that it started the dinner with an agreeable swing that\r\nnever slackened.\r\n\r\nMiss Mayblunt begged to be allowed to keep her cocktail untouched\r\nbefore her, just to look at. The color was marvelous! She could compare\r\nit to nothing she had ever seen, and the garnet lights which it emitted\r\nwere unspeakably rare. She pronounced the Colonel an artist, and stuck\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Ratignolle was prepared to take things seriously; the _mets_,\r\nthe _entre-mets_, the service, the decorations, even the people. He\r\nlooked up from his pompano and inquired of Arobin if he were related to\r\nthe gentleman of that name who formed one of the firm of Laitner and\r\nArobin, lawyers. The young man admitted that Laitner was a warm\r\npersonal friend, who permitted Arobin\xe2\x80\x99s name to decorate the firm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletterheads and to appear upon a shingle that graced Perdido Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many inquisitive people and institutions abounding,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArobin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one is really forced as a matter of convenience these\r\ndays to assume the virtue of an occupation if he has it not.\xe2\x80\x9d Monsieur\r\nRatignolle stared a little, and turned to ask Mademoiselle Reisz if she\r\nconsidered the symphony concerts up to the standard which had been set\r\nthe previous winter. Mademoiselle Reisz answered Monsieur Ratignolle in\r\nFrench, which Edna thought a little rude, under the circumstances, but\r\ncharacteristic. Mademoiselle had only disagreeable things to say of the\r\nsymphony concerts, and insulting remarks to make of all the musicians\r\nof New Orleans, singly and collectively. All her interest seemed to be\r\ncentered upon the delicacies placed before her.\r\n\r\nMr. Merriman said that Mr. Arobin\xe2\x80\x99s remark about inquisitive people\r\nreminded him of a man from Waco the other day at the St. Charles\r\nHotel\xe2\x80\x94but as Mr. Merriman\xe2\x80\x99s stories were always lame and lacking point,\r\nhis wife seldom permitted him to complete them. She interrupted him to\r\nask if he remembered the name of the author whose book she had bought\r\nthe week before to send to a friend in Geneva. She was talking \xe2\x80\x9cbooks\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith Mr. Gouvernail and trying to draw from him his opinion upon\r\ncurrent literary topics. Her husband told the story of the Waco man\r\nprivately to Miss Mayblunt, who pretended to be greatly amused and to\r\nthink it extremely clever.\r\n\r\nMrs. Highcamp hung with languid but unaffected interest upon the warm\r\nand impetuous volubility of her left-hand neighbor, Victor Lebrun. Her\r\nattention was never for a moment withdrawn from him after seating\r\nherself at table; and when he turned to Mrs. Merriman, who was prettier\r\nand more vivacious than Mrs. Highcamp, she waited with easy\r\nindifference for an opportunity to reclaim his attention. There was the\r\noccasional sound of music, of mandolins, sufficiently removed to be an\r\nagreeable accompaniment rather than an interruption to the\r\nconversation. Outside the soft, monotonous splash of a fountain could\r\nbe heard; the sound penetrated into the room with the heavy odor of\r\njessamine that came through the open windows.\r\n\r\nThe golden shimmer of Edna\xe2\x80\x99s satin gown spread in rich folds on either\r\nside of her. There was a soft fall of lace encircling her shoulders. It\r\nwas the color of her skin, without the glow, the myriad living tints\r\nthat one may sometimes discover in vibrant flesh. There was something\r\nin her attitude, in her whole appearance when she leaned her head\r\nagainst the high-backed chair and spread her arms, which suggested the\r\nregal woman, the one who rules, who looks on, who stands alone.\r\n\r\nBut as she sat there amid her guests, she felt the old ennui overtaking\r\nher; the hopelessness which so often assailed her, which came upon her\r\nlike an obsession, like something extraneous, independent of volition.\r\nIt was something which announced itself; a chill breath that seemed to\r\nissue from some vast cavern wherein discords waited. There came over\r\nher the acute longing which always summoned into her spiritual vision\r\nthe presence of the beloved one, overpowering her at once with a sense\r\nof the unattainable.\r\n\r\nThe moments glided on, while a feeling of good fellowship passed around\r\nthe circle like a mystic cord, holding and binding these people\r\ntogether with jest and laughter. Monsieur Ratignolle was the first to\r\nbreak the pleasant charm. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock he excused himself. Madame\r\nRatignolle was waiting for him at home. She was _bien souffrante_, and\r\nshe was filled with vague dread, which only her husband\xe2\x80\x99s presence\r\ncould allay.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Reisz arose with Monsieur Ratignolle, who offered to\r\nescort her to the car. She had eaten well; she had tasted the good,\r\nrich wines, and they must have turned her head, for she bowed\r\npleasantly to all as she withdrew from table. She kissed Edna upon the\r\nshoulder, and whispered: \xe2\x80\x9c_Bonne nuit, ma reine; soyez sage_.\xe2\x80\x9d She had\r\nbeen a little bewildered upon rising, or rather, descending from her\r\ncushions, and Monsieur Ratignolle gallantly took her arm and led her\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMrs. Highcamp was weaving a garland of roses, yellow and red. When she\r\nhad finished the garland, she laid it lightly upon Victor\xe2\x80\x99s black\r\ncurls. He was reclining far back in the luxurious chair, holding a\r\nglass of champagne to the light.\r\n\r\nAs if a magician\xe2\x80\x99s wand had touched him, the garland of roses\r\ntransformed him into a vision of Oriental beauty. His cheeks were the\r\ncolor of crushed grapes, and his dusky eyes glowed with a languishing\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sapristi!_\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Arobin.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Highcamp had one more touch to add to the picture. She took\r\nfrom the back of her chair a white silken scarf, with which she had\r\ncovered her shoulders in the early part of the evening. She draped it\r\nacross the boy in graceful folds, and in a way to conceal his black,\r\nconventional evening dress. He did not seem to mind what she did to\r\nhim, only smiled, showing a faint gleam of white teeth, while he\r\ncontinued to gaze with narrowing eyes at the light through his glass of\r\nchampagne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! to be able to paint in color rather than in words!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss\r\nMayblunt, losing herself in a rhapsodic dream as she looked at him.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There was a graven image of Desire\r\n    Painted with red blood on a ground of gold.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nmurmured Gouvernail, under his breath.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the wine upon Victor was to change his accustomed\r\nvolubility into silence. He seemed to have abandoned himself to a\r\nreverie, and to be seeing pleasing visions in the amber bead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSing,\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Mrs. Highcamp. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you sing to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arobin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s posing,\xe2\x80\x9d offered Mr. Merriman; \xe2\x80\x9clet him have it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe he\xe2\x80\x99s paralyzed,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Mrs. Merriman. And leaning over the\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x99s chair, she took the glass from his hand and held it to his\r\nlips. He sipped the wine slowly, and when he had drained the glass she\r\nlaid it upon the table and wiped his lips with her little filmy\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sing for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning in his chair toward Mrs.\r\nHighcamp. He clasped his hands behind his head, and looking up at the\r\nceiling began to hum a little, trying his voice like a musician tuning\r\nan instrument. Then, looking at Edna, he began to sing:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAh! si tu savais!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t sing that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to sing it,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe laid her glass so impetuously and blindly upon the table as to\r\nshatter it against a carafe. The wine spilled over Arobin\xe2\x80\x99s legs and\r\nsome of it trickled down upon Mrs. Highcamp\xe2\x80\x99s black gauze gown. Victor\r\nhad lost all idea of courtesy, or else he thought his hostess was not\r\nin earnest, for he laughed and went on:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAh! si tu savais\r\n    Ce que tes yeux me disent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t! you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Edna, and pushing back her\r\nchair she got up, and going behind him placed her hand over his mouth.\r\nHe kissed the soft palm that pressed upon his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, Mrs. Pontellier. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you meant it,\xe2\x80\x9d looking\r\nup at her with caressing eyes. The touch of his lips was like a\r\npleasing sting to her hand. She lifted the garland of roses from his\r\nhead and flung it across the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Victor; you\xe2\x80\x99ve posed long enough. Give Mrs. Highcamp her scarf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Highcamp undraped the scarf from about him with her own hands.\r\nMiss Mayblunt and Mr. Gouvernail suddenly conceived the notion that it\r\nwas time to say good night. And Mr. and Mrs. Merriman wondered how it\r\ncould be so late.\r\n\r\nBefore parting from Victor, Mrs. Highcamp invited him to call upon her\r\ndaughter, who she knew would be charmed to meet him and talk French and\r\nsing French songs with him. Victor expressed his desire and intention\r\nto call upon Miss Highcamp at the first opportunity which presented\r\nitself. He asked if Arobin were going his way. Arobin was not.\r\n\r\nThe mandolin players had long since stolen away. A profound stillness\r\nhad fallen upon the broad, beautiful street. The voices of Edna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisbanding guests jarred like a discordant note upon the quiet harmony\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Arobin, who had remained with Edna after the others\r\nhad departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she reiterated, and stood up, stretching her arms, and feeling\r\nthe need to relax her muscles after having been so long seated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants are all gone. They left when the musicians did. I have\r\ndismissed them. The house has to be closed and locked, and I shall trot\r\naround to the pigeon house, and shall send Celestine over in the\r\nmorning to straighten things up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked around, and began to turn out some of the lights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is all right; but there may be a window or two unlatched.\r\nWe had better look; you might take a candle and see. And bring me my\r\nwrap and hat on the foot of the bed in the middle room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went up with the light, and Edna began closing doors and windows.\r\nShe hated to shut in the smoke and the fumes of the wine. Arobin found\r\nher cape and hat, which he brought down and helped her to put on.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was secured and the lights put out, they left through\r\nthe front door, Arobin locking it and taking the key, which he carried\r\nfor Edna. He helped her down the steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have a spray of jessamine?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, breaking off a few\r\nblossoms as he passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed disheartened, and had nothing to say. She took his arm,\r\nwhich he offered her, holding up the weight of her satin train with the\r\nother hand. She looked down, noticing the black line of his leg moving\r\nin and out so close to her against the yellow shimmer of her gown.\r\nThere was the whistle of a railway train somewhere in the distance, and\r\nthe midnight bells were ringing. They met no one in their short walk.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cpigeon house\xe2\x80\x9d stood behind a locked gate, and a shallow _parterre_\r\nthat had been somewhat neglected. There was a small front porch, upon\r\nwhich a long window and the front door opened. The door opened directly\r\ninto the parlor; there was no side entry. Back in the yard was a room\r\nfor servants, in which old Celestine had been ensconced.\r\n\r\nEdna had left a lamp burning low upon the table. She had succeeded in\r\nmaking the room look habitable and homelike. There were some books on\r\nthe table and a lounge near at hand. On the floor was a fresh matting,\r\ncovered with a rug or two; and on the walls hung a few tasteful\r\npictures. But the room was filled with flowers. These were a surprise\r\nto her. Arobin had sent them, and had had Celestine distribute them\r\nduring Edna\xe2\x80\x99s absence. Her bedroom was adjoining, and across a small\r\npassage were the dining-room and kitchen.\r\n\r\nEdna seated herself with every appearance of discomfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you tired?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and chilled, and miserable. I feel as if I had been wound up to a\r\ncertain pitch\xe2\x80\x94too tight\xe2\x80\x94and something inside of me had snapped.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nrested her head against the table upon her bare arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to rest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand to be quiet. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go; I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you\r\nand let you rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nHe stood up beside her and smoothed her hair with his soft, magnetic\r\nhand. His touch conveyed to her a certain physical comfort. She could\r\nhave fallen quietly asleep there if he had continued to pass his hand\r\nover her hair. He brushed the hair upward from the nape of her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will feel better and happier in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave tried to do too much in the past few days. The dinner was the last\r\nstraw; you might have dispensed with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted; \xe2\x80\x9cit was stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was delightful; but it has worn you out.\xe2\x80\x9d His hand had strayed\r\nto her beautiful shoulders, and he could feel the response of her flesh\r\nto his touch. He seated himself beside her and kissed her lightly upon\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were going away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in an uneven voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, after I have said good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, except to continue to caress her. He did not say\r\ngood night until she had become supple to his gentle, seductive\r\nentreaties.\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pontellier learned of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s intention to abandon her home\r\nand take up her residence elsewhere, he immediately wrote her a letter\r\nof unqualified disapproval and remonstrance. She had given reasons\r\nwhich he was unwilling to acknowledge as adequate. He hoped she had not\r\nacted upon her rash impulse; and he begged her to consider first,\r\nforemost, and above all else, what people would say. He was not\r\ndreaming of scandal when he uttered this warning; that was a thing\r\nwhich would never have entered into his mind to consider in connection\r\nwith his wife\xe2\x80\x99s name or his own. He was simply thinking of his\r\nfinancial integrity. It might get noised about that the Pontelliers had\r\nmet with reverses, and were forced to conduct their _m\xc3\xa9nage_ on a\r\nhumbler scale than heretofore. It might do incalculable mischief to his\r\nbusiness prospects.\r\n\r\nBut remembering Edna\xe2\x80\x99s whimsical turn of mind of late, and foreseeing\r\nthat she had immediately acted upon her impetuous determination, he\r\ngrasped the situation with his usual promptness and handled it with his\r\nwell-known business tact and cleverness.\r\n\r\nThe same mail which brought to Edna his letter of disapproval carried\r\ninstructions\xe2\x80\x94the most minute instructions\xe2\x80\x94to a well-known architect\r\nconcerning the remodeling of his home, changes which he had long\r\ncontemplated, and which he desired carried forward during his temporary\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nExpert and reliable packers and movers were engaged to convey the\r\nfurniture, carpets, pictures\xe2\x80\x94everything movable, in short\xe2\x80\x94to places of\r\nsecurity. And in an incredibly short time the Pontellier house was\r\nturned over to the artisans. There was to be an addition\xe2\x80\x94a small\r\nsnuggery; there was to be frescoing, and hardwood flooring was to be\r\nput into such rooms as had not yet been subjected to this improvement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in one of the daily papers appeared a brief notice to the\r\neffect that Mr. and Mrs. Pontellier were contemplating a summer sojourn\r\nabroad, and that their handsome residence on Esplanade Street was\r\nundergoing sumptuous alterations, and would not be ready for occupancy\r\nuntil their return. Mr. Pontellier had saved appearances!\r\n\r\nEdna admired the skill of his maneuver, and avoided any occasion to\r\nbalk his intentions. When the situation as set forth by Mr. Pontellier\r\nwas accepted and taken for granted, she was apparently satisfied that\r\nit should be so.\r\n\r\nThe pigeon house pleased her. It at once assumed the intimate character\r\nof a home, while she herself invested it with a charm which it\r\nreflected like a warm glow. There was with her a feeling of having\r\ndescended in the social scale, with a corresponding sense of having\r\nrisen in the spiritual. Every step which she took toward relieving\r\nherself from obligations added to her strength and expansion as an\r\nindividual. She began to look with her own eyes; to see and to\r\napprehend the deeper undercurrents of life. No longer was she content\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cfeed upon opinion\xe2\x80\x9d when her own soul had invited her.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, a few days, in fact, Edna went up and spent a\r\nweek with her children in Iberville. They were delicious February days,\r\nwith all the summer\xe2\x80\x99s promise hovering in the air.\r\n\r\nHow glad she was to see the children! She wept for very pleasure when\r\nshe felt their little arms clasping her; their hard, ruddy cheeks\r\npressed against her own glowing cheeks. She looked into their faces\r\nwith hungry eyes that could not be satisfied with looking. And what\r\nstories they had to tell their mother! About the pigs, the cows, the\r\nmules! About riding to the mill behind Gluglu; fishing back in the lake\r\nwith their Uncle Jasper; picking pecans with Lidie\xe2\x80\x99s little black\r\nbrood, and hauling chips in their express wagon. It was a thousand\r\ntimes more fun to haul real chips for old lame Susie\xe2\x80\x99s real fire than\r\nto drag painted blocks along the banquette on Esplanade Street!\r\n\r\nShe went with them herself to see the pigs and the cows, to look at the\r\ndarkies laying the cane, to thrash the pecan trees, and catch fish in\r\nthe back lake. She lived with them a whole week long, giving them all\r\nof herself, and gathering and filling herself with their young\r\nexistence. They listened, breathless, when she told them the house in\r\nEsplanade Street was crowded with workmen, hammering, nailing, sawing,\r\nand filling the place with clatter. They wanted to know where their bed\r\nwas; what had been done with their rocking-horse; and where did Joe\r\nsleep, and where had Ellen gone, and the cook? But, above all, they\r\nwere fired with a desire to see the little house around the block. Was\r\nthere any place to play? Were there any boys next door? Raoul, with\r\npessimistic foreboding, was convinced that there were only girls next\r\ndoor. Where would they sleep, and where would papa sleep? She told them\r\nthe fairies would fix it all right.\r\n\r\nThe old Madame was charmed with Edna\xe2\x80\x99s visit, and showered all manner\r\nof delicate attentions upon her. She was delighted to know that the\r\nEsplanade Street house was in a dismantled condition. It gave her the\r\npromise and pretext to keep the children indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt was with a wrench and a pang that Edna left her children. She\r\ncarried away with her the sound of their voices and the touch of their\r\ncheeks. All along the journey homeward their presence lingered with her\r\nlike the memory of a delicious song. But by the time she had regained\r\nthe city the song no longer echoed in her soul. She was again alone.\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nIt happened sometimes when Edna went to see Mademoiselle Reisz that the\r\nlittle musician was absent, giving a lesson or making some small\r\nnecessary household purchase. The key was always left in a secret\r\nhiding-place in the entry, which Edna knew. If Mademoiselle happened to\r\nbe away, Edna would usually enter and wait for her return.\r\n\r\nWhen she knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz\xe2\x80\x99s door one afternoon there was\r\nno response; so unlocking the door, as usual, she entered and found the\r\napartment deserted, as she had expected. Her day had been quite filled\r\nup, and it was for a rest, for a refuge, and to talk about Robert, that\r\nshe sought out her friend.\r\n\r\nShe had worked at her canvas\xe2\x80\x94a young Italian character study\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\nmorning, completing the work without the model; but there had been many\r\ninterruptions, some incident to her modest housekeeping, and others of\r\na social nature.\r\n\r\nMadame Ratignolle had dragged herself over, avoiding the too public\r\nthoroughfares, she said. She complained that Edna had neglected her\r\nmuch of late. Besides, she was consumed with curiosity to see the\r\nlittle house and the manner in which it was conducted. She wanted to\r\nhear all about the dinner party; Monsieur Ratignolle had left _so_\r\nearly. What had happened after he left? The champagne and grapes which\r\nEdna sent over were _too_ delicious. She had so little appetite; they\r\nhad refreshed and toned her stomach. Where on earth was she going to\r\nput Mr. Pontellier in that little house, and the boys? And then she\r\nmade Edna promise to go to her when her hour of trial overtook her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any time\xe2\x80\x94any time of the day or night, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Edna assured her.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Madame Ratignolle said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some way you seem to me like a child, Edna. You seem to act without\r\na certain amount of reflection which is necessary in this life. That is\r\nthe reason I want to say you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I advise you to be a\r\nlittle careful while you are living here alone. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you have some\r\none come and stay with you? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Mademoiselle Reisz come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to come, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want her always with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the reason\xe2\x80\x94you know how evil-minded the world is\xe2\x80\x94some one was\r\ntalking of Alc\xc3\xa9e Arobin visiting you. Of course, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if\r\nMr. Arobin had not such a dreadful reputation. Monsieur Ratignolle was\r\ntelling me that his attentions alone are considered enough to ruin a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he boast of his successes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna, indifferently, squinting\r\nat her picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think not. I believe he is a decent fellow as far as that goes.\r\nBut his character is so well known among the men. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able to\r\ncome back and see you; it was very, very imprudent to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind the step!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t neglect me,\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Madame Ratignolle; \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t mind what I\r\nsaid about Arobin, or having some one to stay with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d Edna laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may say anything you like to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey kissed each other good-by. Madame Ratignolle had not far to go,\r\nand Edna stood on the porch a while watching her walk down the street.\r\n\r\nThen in the afternoon Mrs. Merriman and Mrs. Highcamp had made their\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cparty call.\xe2\x80\x9d Edna felt that they might have dispensed with the\r\nformality. They had also come to invite her to play _vingt-et-un_ one\r\nevening at Mrs. Merriman\xe2\x80\x99s. She was asked to go early, to dinner, and\r\nMr. Merriman or Mr. Arobin would take her home. Edna accepted in a\r\nhalf-hearted way. She sometimes felt very tired of Mrs. Highcamp and\r\nMrs. Merriman.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon she sought refuge with Mademoiselle Reisz, and\r\nstayed there alone, waiting for her, feeling a kind of repose invade\r\nher with the very atmosphere of the shabby, unpretentious little room.\r\n\r\nEdna sat at the window, which looked out over the house-tops and across\r\nthe river. The window frame was filled with pots of flowers, and she\r\nsat and picked the dry leaves from a rose geranium. The day was warm,\r\nand the breeze which blew from the river was very pleasant. She removed\r\nher hat and laid it on the piano. She went on picking the leaves and\r\ndigging around the plants with her hat pin. Once she thought she heard\r\nMademoiselle Reisz approaching. But it was a young black girl, who came\r\nin, bringing a small bundle of laundry, which she deposited in the\r\nadjoining room, and went away.\r\n\r\nEdna seated herself at the piano, and softly picked out with one hand\r\nthe bars of a piece of music which lay open before her. A half-hour\r\nwent by. There was the occasional sound of people going and coming in\r\nthe lower hall. She was growing interested in her occupation of picking\r\nout the aria, when there was a second rap at the door. She vaguely\r\nwondered what these people did when they found Mademoiselle\xe2\x80\x99s door\r\nlocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d she called, turning her face toward the door. And this time\r\nit was Robert Lebrun who presented himself. She attempted to rise; she\r\ncould not have done so without betraying the agitation which mastered\r\nher at sight of him, so she fell back upon the stool, only exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Robert!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came and clasped her hand, seemingly without knowing what he was\r\nsaying or doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Pontellier! How do you happen\xe2\x80\x94oh! how well you look! Is\r\nMademoiselle Reisz not here? I never expected to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you come back?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna in an unsteady voice, wiping her\r\nface with her handkerchief. She seemed ill at ease on the piano stool,\r\nand he begged her to take the chair by the window.\r\n\r\nShe did so, mechanically, while he seated himself on the stool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI returned day before yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, while he leaned his arm\r\non the keys, bringing forth a crash of discordant sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDay before yesterday!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, aloud; and went on thinking to\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x9cday before yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d in a sort of an uncomprehending way.\r\nShe had pictured him seeking her at the very first hour, and he had\r\nlived under the same sky since day before yesterday; while only by\r\naccident had he stumbled upon her. Mademoiselle must have lied when she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fool, he loves you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDay before yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, breaking off a spray of\r\nMademoiselle\xe2\x80\x99s geranium; \xe2\x80\x9cthen if you had not met me here to-day you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94that is, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you mean to come and see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I should have gone to see you. There have been so many\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he turned the leaves of Mademoiselle\xe2\x80\x99s music nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nstarted in at once yesterday with the old firm. After all there is as\r\nmuch chance for me here as there was there\xe2\x80\x94that is, I might find it\r\nprofitable some day. The Mexicans were not very congenial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he had come back because the Mexicans were not congenial; because\r\nbusiness was as profitable here as there; because of any reason, and\r\nnot because he cared to be near her. She remembered the day she sat on\r\nthe floor, turning the pages of his letter, seeking the reason which\r\nwas left untold.\r\n\r\nShe had not noticed how he looked\xe2\x80\x94only feeling his presence; but she\r\nturned deliberately and observed him. After all, he had been absent but\r\na few months, and was not changed. His hair\xe2\x80\x94the color of hers\xe2\x80\x94waved\r\nback from his temples in the same way as before. His skin was not more\r\nburned than it had been at Grand Isle. She found in his eyes, when he\r\nlooked at her for one silent moment, the same tender caress, with an\r\nadded warmth and entreaty which had not been there before\xe2\x80\x94the same\r\nglance which had penetrated to the sleeping places of her soul and\r\nawakened them.\r\n\r\nA hundred times Edna had pictured Robert\xe2\x80\x99s return, and imagined their\r\nfirst meeting. It was usually at her home, whither he had sought her\r\nout at once. She always fancied him expressing or betraying in some way\r\nhis love for her. And here, the reality was that they sat ten feet\r\napart, she at the window, crushing geranium leaves in her hand and\r\nsmelling them, he twirling around on the piano stool, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was very much surprised to hear of Mr. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s absence; it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwonder Mademoiselle Reisz did not tell me; and your moving\xe2\x80\x94mother told\r\nme yesterday. I should think you would have gone to New York with him,\r\nor to Iberville with the children, rather than be bothered here with\r\nhousekeeping. And you are going abroad, too, I hear. We shan\xe2\x80\x99t have you\r\nat Grand Isle next summer; it won\xe2\x80\x99t seem\xe2\x80\x94do you see much of\r\nMademoiselle Reisz? She often spoke of you in the few letters she\r\nwrote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that you promised to write to me when you went away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nA flush overspread his whole face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that my letters would be of any interest to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is an excuse; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d Edna reached for her hat on\r\nthe piano. She adjusted it, sticking the hat pin through the heavy coil\r\nof hair with some deliberation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not going to wait for Mademoiselle Reisz?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Robert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have found when she is absent this long, she is liable not to\r\ncome back till late.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew on her gloves, and Robert picked up his\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you wait for her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you think she will not be back till late,\xe2\x80\x9d adding, as if\r\nsuddenly aware of some discourtesy in his speech, \xe2\x80\x9cand I should miss\r\nthe pleasure of walking home with you.\xe2\x80\x9d Edna locked the door and put\r\nthe key back in its hiding-place.\r\n\r\nThey went together, picking their way across muddy streets and\r\nsidewalks encumbered with the cheap display of small tradesmen. Part of\r\nthe distance they rode in the car, and after disembarking, passed the\r\nPontellier mansion, which looked broken and half torn asunder. Robert\r\nhad never known the house, and looked at it with interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew you in your home,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d She did not answer. They went on around the corner, and it\r\nseemed as if her dreams were coming true after all, when he followed\r\nher into the little house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must stay and dine with me, Robert. You see I am all alone, and it\r\nis so long since I have seen you. There is so much I want to ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took off her hat and gloves. He stood irresolute, making some\r\nexcuse about his mother who expected him; he even muttered something\r\nabout an engagement. She struck a match and lit the lamp on the table;\r\nit was growing dusk. When he saw her face in the lamp-light, looking\r\npained, with all the soft lines gone out of it, he threw his hat aside\r\nand seated himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you know I want to stay if you will let me!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. All the\r\nsoftness came back. She laughed, and went and put her hand on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first moment you have seemed like the old Robert. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\ntell Celestine.\xe2\x80\x9d She hurried away to tell Celestine to set an extra\r\nplace. She even sent her off in search of some added delicacy which she\r\nhad not thought of for herself. And she recommended great care in\r\ndripping the coffee and having the omelet done to a proper turn.\r\n\r\nWhen she reentered, Robert was turning over magazines, sketches, and\r\nthings that lay upon the table in great disorder. He picked up a\r\nphotograph, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlc\xc3\xa9e Arobin! What on earth is his picture doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to make a sketch of his head one day,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Edna, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\r\nthought the photograph might help me. It was at the other house. I\r\nthought it had been left there. I must have packed it up with my\r\ndrawing materials.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think you would give it back to him if you have finished with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I have a great many such photographs. I never think of returning\r\nthem. They don\xe2\x80\x99t amount to anything.\xe2\x80\x9d Robert kept on looking at the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me\xe2\x80\x94do you think his head worth drawing? Is he a friend of\r\nMr. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s? You never said you knew him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t a friend of Mr. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s; he\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of mine. I always\r\nknew him\xe2\x80\x94that is, it is only of late that I know him pretty well. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather talk about you, and know what you have been seeing and doing\r\nand feeling out there in Mexico.\xe2\x80\x9d Robert threw aside the picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing the waves and the white beach of Grand Isle; the\r\nquiet, grassy street of the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re;_ the old fort at Grande Terre.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been working like a machine, and feeling like a lost soul. There\r\nwas nothing interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leaned her head upon her hand to shade her eyes from the light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you been seeing and doing and feeling all these days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing the waves and the white beach of Grand Isle; the\r\nquiet, grassy street of the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re Caminada;_ the old sunny fort at\r\nGrande Terre. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with a little more comprehension than a\r\nmachine, and still feeling like a lost soul. There was nothing\r\ninteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Pontellier, you are cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with feeling, closing his\r\neyes and resting his head back in his chair. They remained in silence\r\ntill old Celestine announced dinner.\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nThe dining-room was very small. Edna\xe2\x80\x99s round mahogany would have almost\r\nfilled it. As it was there was but a step or two from the little table\r\nto the kitchen, to the mantel, the small buffet, and the side door that\r\nopened out on the narrow brick-paved yard.\r\n\r\nA certain degree of ceremony settled upon them with the announcement of\r\ndinner. There was no return to personalities. Robert related incidents\r\nof his sojourn in Mexico, and Edna talked of events likely to interest\r\nhim, which had occurred during his absence. The dinner was of ordinary\r\nquality, except for the few delicacies which she had sent out to\r\npurchase. Old Celestine, with a bandana _tignon_ twisted about her\r\nhead, hobbled in and out, taking a personal interest in everything; and\r\nshe lingered occasionally to talk patois with Robert, whom she had\r\nknown as a boy.\r\n\r\nHe went out to a neighboring cigar stand to purchase cigarette papers,\r\nand when he came back he found that Celestine had served the black\r\ncoffee in the parlor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are tired of\r\nme, tell me to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never tire me. You must have forgotten the hours and hours at\r\nGrand Isle in which we grew accustomed to each other and used to being\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have forgotten nothing at Grand Isle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, not looking at her,\r\nbut rolling a cigarette. His tobacco pouch, which he laid upon the\r\ntable, was a fantastic embroidered silk affair, evidently the handiwork\r\nof a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used to carry your tobacco in a rubber pouch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, picking\r\nup the pouch and examining the needlework.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you buy this one? In Mexico?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was given to me by a Vera Cruz girl; they are very generous,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied, striking a match and lighting his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are very handsome, I suppose, those Mexican women; very\r\npicturesque, with their black eyes and their lace scarfs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome are; others are hideous, just as you find women everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was she like\xe2\x80\x94the one who gave you the pouch? You must have known\r\nher very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was very ordinary. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t of the slightest importance. I knew\r\nher well enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you visit at her house? Was it interesting? I should like to know\r\nand hear about the people you met, and the impressions they made on\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some people who leave impressions not so lasting as the\r\nimprint of an oar upon the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she such a one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be ungenerous for me to admit that she was of that order and\r\nkind.\xe2\x80\x9d He thrust the pouch back in his pocket, as if to put away the\r\nsubject with the trifle which had brought it up.\r\n\r\nArobin dropped in with a message from Mrs. Merriman, to say that the\r\ncard party was postponed on account of the illness of one of her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Arobin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert, rising from the obscurity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Lebrun. To be sure! I heard yesterday you were back. How did they\r\ntreat you down in Mexique?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairly well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not well enough to keep you there. Stunning girls, though, in\r\nMexico. I thought I should never get away from Vera Cruz when I was\r\ndown there a couple of years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they embroider slippers and tobacco pouches and hat-bands and\r\nthings for you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my! no! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get so deep in their regard. I fear they made\r\nmore impression on me than I made on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were less fortunate than Robert, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am always less fortunate than Robert. Has he been imparting tender\r\nconfidences?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been imposing myself long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert, rising, and\r\nshaking hands with Edna. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease convey my regards to Mr. Pontellier\r\nwhen you write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with Arobin and went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine fellow, that Lebrun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arobin when Robert had gone. \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\nheard you speak of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew him last summer at Grand Isle,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is that\r\nphotograph of yours. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want with it? Throw it away.\xe2\x80\x9d She threw it back on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to Mrs. Merriman\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you see her, tell her\r\nso. But perhaps I had better write. I think I shall write now, and say\r\nthat I am sorry her child is sick, and tell her not to count on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a good scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d acquiesced Arobin. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you;\r\nstupid lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdna opened the blotter, and having procured paper and pen, began to\r\nwrite the note. Arobin lit a cigar and read the evening paper, which he\r\nhad in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the date?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. He told her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you mail this for me when you go out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d He read to her little bits out of the newspaper, while she\r\nstraightened things on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, throwing aside the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nwant to go out for a walk or a drive or anything? It would be a fine\r\nnight to drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything but just be quiet. You go away and\r\namuse yourself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go away if I must; but I shan\xe2\x80\x99t amuse myself. You know that I\r\nonly live when I am near you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood up to bid her good night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that one of the things you always say to women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said it before, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever came so near meaning\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with a smile. There were no warm lights in her eyes;\r\nonly a dreamy, absent look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night. I adore you. Sleep well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and he kissed her hand\r\nand went away.\r\n\r\nShe stayed alone in a kind of reverie\xe2\x80\x94a sort of stupor. Step by step\r\nshe lived over every instant of the time she had been with Robert after\r\nhe had entered Mademoiselle Reisz\xe2\x80\x99s door. She recalled his words, his\r\nlooks. How few and meager they had been for her hungry heart! A\r\nvision\xe2\x80\x94a transcendently seductive vision of a Mexican girl arose before\r\nher. She writhed with a jealous pang. She wondered when he would come\r\nback. He had not said he would come back. She had been with him, had\r\nheard his voice and touched his hand. But some way he had seemed nearer\r\nto her off there in Mexico.\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nThe morning was full of sunlight and hope. Edna could see before her no\r\ndenial\xe2\x80\x94only the promise of excessive joy. She lay in bed awake, with\r\nbright eyes full of speculation. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loves you, poor fool.\xe2\x80\x9d If she\r\ncould but get that conviction firmly fixed in her mind, what mattered\r\nabout the rest? She felt she had been childish and unwise the night\r\nbefore in giving herself over to despondency. She recapitulated the\r\nmotives which no doubt explained Robert\xe2\x80\x99s reserve. They were not\r\ninsurmountable; they would not hold if he really loved her; they could\r\nnot hold against her own passion, which he must come to realize in\r\ntime. She pictured him going to his business that morning. She even saw\r\nhow he was dressed; how he walked down one street, and turned the\r\ncorner of another; saw him bending over his desk, talking to people who\r\nentered the office, going to his lunch, and perhaps watching for her on\r\nthe street. He would come to her in the afternoon or evening, sit and\r\nroll his cigarette, talk a little, and go away as he had done the night\r\nbefore. But how delicious it would be to have him there with her! She\r\nwould have no regrets, nor seek to penetrate his reserve if he still\r\nchose to wear it.\r\n\r\nEdna ate her breakfast only half dressed. The maid brought her a\r\ndelicious printed scrawl from Raoul, expressing his love, asking her to\r\nsend him some bonbons, and telling her they had found that morning ten\r\ntiny white pigs all lying in a row beside Lidie\xe2\x80\x99s big white pig.\r\n\r\nA letter also came from her husband, saying he hoped to be back early\r\nin March, and then they would get ready for that journey abroad which\r\nhe had promised her so long, which he felt now fully able to afford; he\r\nfelt able to travel as people should, without any thought of small\r\neconomies\xe2\x80\x94thanks to his recent speculations in Wall Street.\r\n\r\nMuch to her surprise she received a note from Arobin, written at\r\nmidnight from the club. It was to say good morning to her, to hope she\r\nhad slept well, to assure her of his devotion, which he trusted she in\r\nsome faintest manner returned.\r\n\r\nAll these letters were pleasing to her. She answered the children in a\r\ncheerful frame of mind, promising them bonbons, and congratulating them\r\nupon their happy find of the little pigs.\r\n\r\nShe answered her husband with friendly evasiveness,\xe2\x80\x94not with any fixed\r\ndesign to mislead him, only because all sense of reality had gone out\r\nof her life; she had abandoned herself to Fate, and awaited the\r\nconsequences with indifference.\r\n\r\nTo Arobin\xe2\x80\x99s note she made no reply. She put it under Celestine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstove-lid.\r\n\r\nEdna worked several hours with much spirit. She saw no one but a\r\npicture dealer, who asked her if it were true that she was going abroad\r\nto study in Paris.\r\n\r\nShe said possibly she might, and he negotiated with her for some\r\nParisian studies to reach him in time for the holiday trade in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nRobert did not come that day. She was keenly disappointed. He did not\r\ncome the following day, nor the next. Each morning she awoke with hope,\r\nand each night she was a prey to despondency. She was tempted to seek\r\nhim out. But far from yielding to the impulse, she avoided any occasion\r\nwhich might throw her in his way. She did not go to Mademoiselle\r\nReisz\xe2\x80\x99s nor pass by Madame Lebrun\xe2\x80\x99s, as she might have done if he had\r\nstill been in Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhen Arobin, one night, urged her to drive with him, she went\xe2\x80\x94out to\r\nthe lake, on the Shell Road. His horses were full of mettle, and even a\r\nlittle unmanageable. She liked the rapid gait at which they spun along,\r\nand the quick, sharp sound of the horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs on the hard road. They\r\ndid not stop anywhere to eat or to drink. Arobin was not needlessly\r\nimprudent. But they ate and they drank when they regained Edna\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\ndining-room\xe2\x80\x94which was comparatively early in the evening.\r\n\r\nIt was late when he left her. It was getting to be more than a passing\r\nwhim with Arobin to see her and be with her. He had detected the latent\r\nsensuality, which unfolded under his delicate sense of her nature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequirements like a torpid, torrid, sensitive blossom.\r\n\r\nThere was no despondency when she fell asleep that night; nor was there\r\nhope when she awoke in the morning.\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nThere was a garden out in the suburbs; a small, leafy corner, with a\r\nfew green tables under the orange trees. An old cat slept all day on\r\nthe stone step in the sun, and an old _mulatresse_ slept her idle hours\r\naway in her chair at the open window, till some one happened to knock\r\non one of the green tables. She had milk and cream cheese to sell, and\r\nbread and butter. There was no one who could make such excellent coffee\r\nor fry a chicken so golden brown as she.\r\n\r\nThe place was too modest to attract the attention of people of fashion,\r\nand so quiet as to have escaped the notice of those in search of\r\npleasure and dissipation. Edna had discovered it accidentally one day\r\nwhen the high-board gate stood ajar. She caught sight of a little green\r\ntable, blotched with the checkered sunlight that filtered through the\r\nquivering leaves overhead. Within she had found the slumbering\r\n_mulatresse_, the drowsy cat, and a glass of milk which reminded her of\r\nthe milk she had tasted in Iberville.\r\n\r\nShe often stopped there during her perambulations; sometimes taking a\r\nbook with her, and sitting an hour or two under the trees when she\r\nfound the place deserted. Once or twice she took a quiet dinner there\r\nalone, having instructed Celestine beforehand to prepare no dinner at\r\nhome. It was the last place in the city where she would have expected\r\nto meet any one she knew.\r\n\r\nStill she was not astonished when, as she was partaking of a modest\r\ndinner late in the afternoon, looking into an open book, stroking the\r\ncat, which had made friends with her\xe2\x80\x94she was not greatly astonished to\r\nsee Robert come in at the tall garden gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am destined to see you only by accident,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shoving the cat\r\noff the chair beside her. He was surprised, ill at ease, almost\r\nembarrassed at meeting her thus so unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you come here often?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost live here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to drop in very often for a cup of Catiche\xe2\x80\x99s good coffee. This\r\nis the first time since I came back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you a plate, and you will share my dinner. There\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nenough for two\xe2\x80\x94even three.\xe2\x80\x9d Edna had intended to be indifferent and as\r\nreserved as he when she met him; she had reached the determination by a\r\nlaborious train of reasoning, incident to one of her despondent moods.\r\nBut her resolve melted when she saw him before designing Providence had\r\nled him into her path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you kept away from me, Robert?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, closing the book\r\nthat lay open upon the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so personal, Mrs. Pontellier? Why do you force me to\r\nidiotic subterfuges?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed with sudden warmth. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no use telling you I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very busy, or that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sick,\r\nor that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see you and not found you at home. Please let me\r\noff with any one of these excuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the embodiment of selfishness,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou save yourself\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x94but there is some selfish motive, and in\r\nsparing yourself you never consider for a moment what I think, or how I\r\nfeel your neglect and indifference. I suppose this is what you would\r\ncall unwomanly; but I have got into a habit of expressing myself. It\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me, and you may think me unwomanly if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I only think you cruel, as I said the other day. Maybe not\r\nintentionally cruel; but you seem to be forcing me into disclosures\r\nwhich can result in nothing; as if you would have me bare a wound for\r\nthe pleasure of looking at it, without the intention or power of\r\nhealing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m spoiling your dinner, Robert; never mind what I say. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neaten a morsel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only came in for a cup of coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d His sensitive face was all\r\ndisfigured with excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this a delightful place?\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad it has\r\nnever actually been discovered. It is so quiet, so sweet, here. Do you\r\nnotice there is scarcely a sound to be heard? It\xe2\x80\x99s so out of the way;\r\nand a good walk from the car. However, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind walking. I always\r\nfeel so sorry for women who don\xe2\x80\x99t like to walk; they miss so much\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nmany rare little glimpses of life; and we women learn so little of life\r\non the whole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatiche\xe2\x80\x99s coffee is always hot. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how she manages it, here\r\nin the open air. Celestine\xe2\x80\x99s coffee gets cold bringing it from the\r\nkitchen to the dining-room. Three lumps! How can you drink it so sweet?\r\nTake some of the cress with your chop; it\xe2\x80\x99s so biting and crisp. Then\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s the advantage of being able to smoke with your coffee out here.\r\nNow, in the city\xe2\x80\x94aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a while,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying a cigar on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bought it. I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m getting reckless; I bought a whole box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe was determined not to be personal again and make him uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe cat made friends with him, and climbed into his lap when he smoked\r\nhis cigar. He stroked her silky fur, and talked a little about her. He\r\nlooked at Edna\xe2\x80\x99s book, which he had read; and he told her the end, to\r\nsave her the trouble of wading through it, he said.\r\n\r\nAgain he accompanied her back to her home; and it was after dusk when\r\nthey reached the little \xe2\x80\x9cpigeon-house.\xe2\x80\x9d She did not ask him to remain,\r\nwhich he was grateful for, as it permitted him to stay without the\r\ndiscomfort of blundering through an excuse which he had no intention of\r\nconsidering. He helped her to light the lamp; then she went into her\r\nroom to take off her hat and to bathe her face and hands.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back Robert was not examining the pictures and magazines\r\nas before; he sat off in the shadow, leaning his head back on the chair\r\nas if in a reverie. Edna lingered a moment beside the table, arranging\r\nthe books there. Then she went across the room to where he sat. She\r\nbent over the arm of his chair and called his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobert,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9care you asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, looking up at her.\r\n\r\nShe leaned over and kissed him\xe2\x80\x94a soft, cool, delicate kiss, whose\r\nvoluptuous sting penetrated his whole being\xe2\x80\x94then she moved away from\r\nhim. He followed, and took her in his arms, just holding her close to\r\nhim. She put her hand up to his face and pressed his cheek against her\r\nown. The action was full of love and tenderness. He sought her lips\r\nagain. Then he drew her down upon the sofa beside him and held her hand\r\nin both of his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnow you know what I have been fighting\r\nagainst since last summer at Grand Isle; what drove me away and drove\r\nme back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you been fighting against it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. Her face glowed\r\nwith soft lights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because you were not free; you were L\xc3\xa9once Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s wife. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help loving you if you were ten times his wife; but so long as\r\nI went away from you and kept away I could help telling you so.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nput her free hand up to his shoulder, and then against his cheek,\r\nrubbing it softly. He kissed her again. His face was warm and flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere in Mexico I was thinking of you all the time, and longing for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not writing to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething put into my head that you cared for me; and I lost my\r\nsenses. I forgot everything but a wild dream of your some way becoming\r\nmy wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReligion, loyalty, everything would give way if only you cared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must have forgotten that I was L\xc3\xa9once Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I was demented, dreaming of wild, impossible things, recalling men\r\nwho had set their wives free, we have heard of such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we have heard of such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came back full of vague, mad intentions. And when I got here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you got here you never came near me!\xe2\x80\x9d She was still caressing his\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI realized what a cur I was to dream of such a thing, even if you had\r\nbeen willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took his face between her hands and looked into it as if she would\r\nnever withdraw her eyes more. She kissed him on the forehead, the eyes,\r\nthe cheeks, and the lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been a very, very foolish boy, wasting your time dreaming of\r\nimpossible things when you speak of Mr. Pontellier setting me free! I\r\nam no longer one of Mr. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s possessions to dispose of or not.\r\nI give myself where I choose. If he were to say, \xe2\x80\x98Here, Robert, take\r\nher and be happy; she is yours,\xe2\x80\x99 I should laugh at you both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face grew a little white. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. Old Celestine came in to say that Madame\r\nRatignolle\xe2\x80\x99s servant had come around the back way with a message that\r\nMadame had been taken sick and begged Mrs. Pontellier to go to her\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, rising; \xe2\x80\x9cI promised. Tell her yes\xe2\x80\x94to wait for\r\nme. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me walk over with you,\xe2\x80\x9d offered Robert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will go with the servant.\xe2\x80\x9d She went into her room to\r\nput on her hat, and when she came in again she sat once more upon the\r\nsofa beside him. He had not stirred. She put her arms about his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my sweet Robert. Tell me good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d He kissed her with a\r\ndegree of passion which had not before entered into his caress, and\r\nstrained her to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9conly you; no one but you. It was you who\r\nawoke me last summer out of a life-long, stupid dream. Oh! you have\r\nmade me so unhappy with your indifference. Oh! I have suffered,\r\nsuffered! Now you are here we shall love each other, my Robert. We\r\nshall be everything to each other. Nothing else in the world is of any\r\nconsequence. I must go to my friend; but you will wait for me? No\r\nmatter how late; you will wait for me, Robert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go; don\xe2\x80\x99t go! Oh! Edna, stay with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should\r\nyou go? Stay with me, stay with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come back as soon as I can; I shall find you here.\xe2\x80\x9d She buried\r\nher face in his neck, and said good-by again. Her seductive voice,\r\ntogether with his great love for her, had enthralled his senses, had\r\ndeprived him of every impulse but the longing to hold her and keep her.\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\nEdna looked in at the drug store. Monsieur Ratignolle was putting up a\r\nmixture himself, very carefully, dropping a red liquid into a tiny\r\nglass. He was grateful to Edna for having come; her presence would be a\r\ncomfort to his wife. Madame Ratignolle\xe2\x80\x99s sister, who had always been\r\nwith her at such trying times, had not been able to come up from the\r\nplantation, and Ad\xc3\xa8le had been inconsolable until Mrs. Pontellier so\r\nkindly promised to come to her. The nurse had been with them at night\r\nfor the past week, as she lived a great distance away. And Dr. Mandelet\r\nhad been coming and going all the afternoon. They were then looking for\r\nhim any moment.\r\n\r\nEdna hastened upstairs by a private stairway that led from the rear of\r\nthe store to the apartments above. The children were all sleeping in a\r\nback room. Madame Ratignolle was in the salon, whither she had strayed\r\nin her suffering impatience. She sat on the sofa, clad in an ample\r\nwhite _peignoir_, holding a handkerchief tight in her hand with a\r\nnervous clutch. Her face was drawn and pinched, her sweet blue eyes\r\nhaggard and unnatural. All her beautiful hair had been drawn back and\r\nplaited. It lay in a long braid on the sofa pillow, coiled like a\r\ngolden serpent. The nurse, a comfortable looking Griffe woman in white\r\napron and cap, was urging her to return to her bedroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no use, there is no use,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at once to Edna. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must\r\nget rid of Mandelet; he is getting too old and careless. He said he\r\nwould be here at half-past seven; now it must be eight. See what time\r\nit is, Jos\xc3\xa9phine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman was possessed of a cheerful nature, and refused to take any\r\nsituation too seriously, especially a situation with which she was so\r\nfamiliar. She urged Madame to have courage and patience. But Madame\r\nonly set her teeth hard into her under lip, and Edna saw the sweat\r\ngather in beads on her white forehead. After a moment or two she\r\nuttered a profound sigh and wiped her face with the handkerchief rolled\r\nin a ball. She appeared exhausted. The nurse gave her a fresh\r\nhandkerchief, sprinkled with cologne water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is too much!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMandelet ought to be killed! Where is\r\nAlphonse? Is it possible I am to be abandoned like this\xe2\x80\x94neglected by\r\nevery one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeglected, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the nurse. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she there? And here\r\nwas Mrs. Pontellier leaving, no doubt, a pleasant evening at home to\r\ndevote to her? And wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Monsieur Ratignolle coming that very instant\r\nthrough the hall? And Jos\xc3\xa9phine was quite sure she had heard Doctor\r\nMandelet\xe2\x80\x99s coup\xc3\xa9. Yes, there it was, down at the door.\r\n\r\nAd\xc3\xa8le consented to go back to her room. She sat on the edge of a little\r\nlow couch next to her bed.\r\n\r\nDoctor Mandelet paid no attention to Madame Ratignolle\xe2\x80\x99s upbraidings.\r\nHe was accustomed to them at such times, and was too well convinced of\r\nher loyalty to doubt it.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to see Edna, and wanted her to go with him into the salon\r\nand entertain him. But Madame Ratignolle would not consent that Edna\r\nshould leave her for an instant. Between agonizing moments, she chatted\r\na little, and said it took her mind off her sufferings.\r\n\r\nEdna began to feel uneasy. She was seized with a vague dread. Her own\r\nlike experiences seemed far away, unreal, and only half remembered. She\r\nrecalled faintly an ecstasy of pain, the heavy odor of chloroform, a\r\nstupor which had deadened sensation, and an awakening to find a little\r\nnew life to which she had given being, added to the great unnumbered\r\nmultitude of souls that come and go.\r\n\r\nShe began to wish she had not come; her presence was not necessary. She\r\nmight have invented a pretext for staying away; she might even invent a\r\npretext now for going. But Edna did not go. With an inward agony, with\r\na flaming, outspoken revolt against the ways of Nature, she witnessed\r\nthe scene of torture.\r\n\r\nShe was still stunned and speechless with emotion when later she leaned\r\nover her friend to kiss her and softly say good-by. Ad\xc3\xa8le, pressing her\r\ncheek, whispered in an exhausted voice: \xe2\x80\x9cThink of the children, Edna.\r\nOh think of the children! Remember them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nEdna still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air. The\r\nDoctor\xe2\x80\x99s coup\xc3\xa9 had returned for him and stood before the _porte\r\ncoch\xc3\xa8re_. She did not wish to enter the coup\xc3\xa9, and told Doctor Mandelet\r\nshe would walk; she was not afraid, and would go alone. He directed his\r\ncarriage to meet him at Mrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s, and he started to walk home\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nUp\xe2\x80\x94away up, over the narrow street between the tall houses, the stars\r\nwere blazing. The air was mild and caressing, but cool with the breath\r\nof spring and the night. They walked slowly, the Doctor with a heavy,\r\nmeasured tread and his hands behind him; Edna, in an absent-minded way,\r\nas she had walked one night at Grand Isle, as if her thoughts had gone\r\nahead of her and she was striving to overtake them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been there, Mrs. Pontellier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was no\r\nplace for you. Ad\xc3\xa8le is full of whims at such times. There were a dozen\r\nwomen she might have had with her, unimpressionable women. I felt that\r\nit was cruel, cruel. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, indifferently. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it matters\r\nafter all. One has to think of the children some time or other; the\r\nsooner the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is L\xc3\xa9once coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite soon. Some time in March.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are going abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94no, I am not going. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be forced into doing\r\nthings. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go abroad. I want to be let alone. Nobody has\r\nany right\xe2\x80\x94except children, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94and even then, it seems to me\xe2\x80\x94or it\r\ndid seem\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She felt that her speech was voicing the incoherency of her\r\nthoughts, and stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trouble is,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the Doctor, grasping her meaning intuitively,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat youth is given up to illusions. It seems to be a provision of\r\nNature; a decoy to secure mothers for the race. And Nature takes no\r\naccount of moral consequences, of arbitrary conditions which we create,\r\nand which we feel obliged to maintain at any cost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe years that are gone seem like dreams\xe2\x80\x94if one might\r\ngo on sleeping and dreaming\xe2\x80\x94but to wake up and find\xe2\x80\x94oh! well! perhaps\r\nit is better to wake up after all, even to suffer, rather than to\r\nremain a dupe to illusions all one\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, my dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor at parting, holding\r\nher hand, \xe2\x80\x9cyou seem to me to be in trouble. I am not going to ask for\r\nyour confidence. I will only say that if ever you feel moved to give it\r\nto me, perhaps I might help you. I know I would understand. And I tell\r\nyou there are not many who would\xe2\x80\x94not many, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome way I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel moved to speak of things that trouble me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I am ungrateful or that I don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate your sympathy. There\r\nare periods of despondency and suffering which take possession of me.\r\nBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything but my own way. That is wanting a good deal,\r\nof course, when you have to trample upon the lives, the hearts, the\r\nprejudices of others\xe2\x80\x94but no matter\xe2\x80\x94still, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to trample\r\nupon the little lives. Oh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, Doctor. Good\r\nnight. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will blame you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t come and see me soon. We will talk\r\nof things you never have dreamt of talking about before. It will do us\r\nboth good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to blame yourself, whatever comes. Good\r\nnight, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let herself in at the gate, but instead of entering she sat upon\r\nthe step of the porch. The night was quiet and soothing. All the\r\ntearing emotion of the last few hours seemed to fall away from her like\r\na somber, uncomfortable garment, which she had but to loosen to be rid\r\nof. She went back to that hour before Ad\xc3\xa8le had sent for her; and her\r\nsenses kindled afresh in thinking of Robert\xe2\x80\x99s words, the pressure of\r\nhis arms, and the feeling of his lips upon her own. She could picture\r\nat that moment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved\r\none. His expression of love had already given him to her in part. When\r\nshe thought that he was there at hand, waiting for her, she grew numb\r\nwith the intoxication of expectancy. It was so late; he would be asleep\r\nperhaps. She would awaken him with a kiss. She hoped he would be asleep\r\nthat she might arouse him with her caresses.\r\n\r\nStill, she remembered Ad\xc3\xa8le\xe2\x80\x99s voice whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cThink of the children;\r\nthink of them.\xe2\x80\x9d She meant to think of them; that determination had\r\ndriven into her soul like a death wound\xe2\x80\x94but not to-night. To-morrow\r\nwould be time to think of everything.\r\n\r\nRobert was not waiting for her in the little parlor. He was nowhere at\r\nhand. The house was empty. But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that\r\nlay in the lamplight:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you. Good-by\xe2\x80\x94because I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdna grew faint when she read the words. She went and sat on the sofa.\r\nThen she stretched herself out there, never uttering a sound. She did\r\nnot sleep. She did not go to bed. The lamp sputtered and went out. She\r\nwas still awake in the morning, when Celestine unlocked the kitchen\r\ndoor and came in to light the fire.\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\nVictor, with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling, was patching a\r\ncorner of one of the galleries. Mariequita sat near by, dangling her\r\nlegs, watching him work, and handing him nails from the tool-box. The\r\nsun was beating down upon them. The girl had covered her head with her\r\napron folded into a square pad. They had been talking for an hour or\r\nmore. She was never tired of hearing Victor describe the dinner at Mrs.\r\nPontellier\xe2\x80\x99s. He exaggerated every detail, making it appear a veritable\r\nLucullean feast. The flowers were in tubs, he said. The champagne was\r\nquaffed from huge golden goblets. Venus rising from the foam could have\r\npresented no more entrancing a spectacle than Mrs. Pontellier, blazing\r\nwith beauty and diamonds at the head of the board, while the other\r\nwomen were all of them youthful houris, possessed of incomparable\r\ncharms. She got it into her head that Victor was in love with Mrs.\r\nPontellier, and he gave her evasive answers, framed so as to confirm\r\nher belief. She grew sullen and cried a little, threatening to go off\r\nand leave him to his fine ladies. There were a dozen men crazy about\r\nher at the _Ch\xc3\xaani\xc3\xa8re;_ and since it was the fashion to be in love with\r\nmarried people, why, she could run away any time she liked to New\r\nOrleans with C\xc3\xa9lina\xe2\x80\x99s husband.\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa9lina\xe2\x80\x99s husband was a fool, a coward, and a pig, and to prove it to\r\nher, Victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he\r\nencountered him. This assurance was very consoling to Mariequita. She\r\ndried her eyes, and grew cheerful at the prospect.\r\n\r\nThey were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life\r\nwhen Mrs. Pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house.\r\nThe two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they\r\nconsidered to be an apparition. But it was really she in flesh and\r\nblood, looking tired and a little travel-stained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked up from the wharf,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand heard the hammering. I\r\nsupposed it was you, mending the porch. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. I was always\r\ntripping over those loose planks last summer. How dreary and deserted\r\neverything looks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt took Victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in\r\nBeaudelet\xe2\x80\x99s lugger, that she had come alone, and for no purpose but to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing fixed up yet, you see. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you my room; it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nonly place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny corner will do,\xe2\x80\x9d she assured him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you can stand Philomel\xe2\x80\x99s cooking,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I might\r\ntry to get her mother while you are here. Do you think she would come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nturning to Mariequita.\r\n\r\nMariequita thought that perhaps Philomel\xe2\x80\x99s mother might come for a few\r\ndays, and money enough.\r\n\r\nBeholding Mrs. Pontellier make her appearance, the girl had at once\r\nsuspected a lovers\xe2\x80\x99 rendezvous. But Victor\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment was so\r\ngenuine, and Mrs. Pontellier\xe2\x80\x99s indifference so apparent, that the\r\ndisturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain. She contemplated\r\nwith the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous\r\ndinners in America, and who had all the men in New Orleans at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time will you have dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Edna. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very hungry; but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get anything extra.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have it ready in little or no time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bustling and\r\npacking away his tools. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may go to my room to brush up and rest\r\nyourself. Mariequita will show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, do you know, I have a notion to go down\r\nto the beach and take a good wash and even a little swim, before\r\ndinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe water is too cold!\xe2\x80\x9d they both exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I might go down and try\xe2\x80\x94dip my toes in. Why, it seems to me the\r\nsun is hot enough to have warmed the very depths of the ocean. Could\r\nyou get me a couple of towels? I\xe2\x80\x99d better go right away, so as to be\r\nback in time. It would be a little too chilly if I waited till this\r\nafternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMariequita ran over to Victor\xe2\x80\x99s room, and returned with some towels,\r\nwhich she gave to Edna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have fish for dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edna, as she started to walk\r\naway; \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything extra if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun and find Philomel\xe2\x80\x99s mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Victor instructed the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nto the kitchen and see what I can do. By Gimminy! Women have no\r\nconsideration! She might have sent me word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically, not noticing\r\nanything special except that the sun was hot. She was not dwelling upon\r\nany particular train of thought. She had done all the thinking which\r\nwas necessary after Robert went away, when she lay awake upon the sofa\r\ntill morning.\r\n\r\nShe had said over and over to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day it is Arobin; to-morrow\r\nit will be some one else. It makes no difference to me, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter about L\xc3\xa9once Pontellier\xe2\x80\x94but Raoul and Etienne!\xe2\x80\x9d She understood\r\nnow clearly what she had meant long ago when she said to Ad\xc3\xa8le\r\nRatignolle that she would give up the unessential, but she would never\r\nsacrifice herself for her children.\r\n\r\nDespondency had come upon her there in the wakeful night, and had never\r\nlifted. There was no one thing in the world that she desired. There was\r\nno human being whom she wanted near her except Robert; and she even\r\nrealized that the day would come when he, too, and the thought of him\r\nwould melt out of her existence, leaving her alone. The children\r\nappeared before her like antagonists who had overcome her; who had\r\noverpowered and sought to drag her into the soul\xe2\x80\x99s slavery for the rest\r\nof her days. But she knew a way to elude them. She was not thinking of\r\nthese things when she walked down to the beach.\r\n\r\nThe water of the Gulf stretched out before her, gleaming with the\r\nmillion lights of the sun. The voice of the sea is seductive, never\r\nceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander\r\nin abysses of solitude. All along the white beach, up and down, there\r\nwas no living thing in sight. A bird with a broken wing was beating the\r\nair above, reeling, fluttering, circling disabled down, down to the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nEdna had found her old bathing suit still hanging, faded, upon its\r\naccustomed peg.\r\n\r\nShe put it on, leaving her clothing in the bath-house. But when she was\r\nthere beside the sea, absolutely alone, she cast the unpleasant,\r\npricking garments from her, and for the first time in her life she\r\nstood naked in the open air, at the mercy of the sun, the breeze that\r\nbeat upon her, and the waves that invited her.\r\n\r\nHow strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky! how\r\ndelicious! She felt like some new-born creature, opening its eyes in a\r\nfamiliar world that it had never known.\r\n\r\nThe foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet, and coiled like\r\nserpents about her ankles. She walked out. The water was chill, but she\r\nwalked on. The water was deep, but she lifted her white body and\r\nreached out with a long, sweeping stroke. The touch of the sea is\r\nsensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.\r\n\r\nShe went on and on. She remembered the night she swam far out, and\r\nrecalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to\r\nregain the shore. She did not look back now, but went on and on,\r\nthinking of the blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little\r\nchild, believing that it had no beginning and no end.\r\n\r\nHer arms and legs were growing tired.\r\n\r\nShe thought of L\xc3\xa9once and the children. They were a part of her life.\r\nBut they need not have thought that they could possess her, body and\r\nsoul. How Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed, perhaps sneered, if\r\nshe knew! \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you call yourself an artist! What pretensions, Madame!\r\nThe artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by\xe2\x80\x94because I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not know; he did not understand.\r\nHe would never understand. Perhaps Doctor Mandelet would have\r\nunderstood if she had seen him\xe2\x80\x94but it was too late; the shore was far\r\nbehind her, and her strength was gone.\r\n\r\nShe looked into the distance, and the old terror flamed up for an\r\ninstant, then sank again. Edna heard her father\xe2\x80\x99s voice and her sister\r\nMargaret\xe2\x80\x99s. She heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the\r\nsycamore tree. The spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked\r\nacross the porch. There was the hum of bees, and the musky odor of\r\npinks filled the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEYOND THE BAYOU\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bayou curved like a crescent around the point of land on which La\r\nFolle\xe2\x80\x99s cabin stood. Between the stream and the hut lay a big abandoned\r\nfield, where cattle were pastured when the bayou supplied them with\r\nwater enough. Through the woods that spread back into unknown regions\r\nthe woman had drawn an imaginary line, and past this circle she never\r\nstepped. This was the form of her only mania.\r\n\r\nShe was now a large, gaunt black woman, past thirty-five. Her real name\r\nwas Jacqueline, but every one on the plantation called her La Folle,\r\nbecause in childhood she had been frightened literally \xe2\x80\x9cout of her\r\nsenses,\xe2\x80\x9d and had never wholly regained them.\r\n\r\nIt was when there had been skirmishing and sharpshooting all day in the\r\nwoods. Evening was near when P\xe2\x80\x99tit Ma\xc3\xaetre, black with powder and\r\ncrimson with blood, had staggered into the cabin of Jacqueline\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother, his pursuers close at his heels. The sight had stunned her\r\nchildish reason.\r\n\r\nShe dwelt alone in her solitary cabin, for the rest of the quarters had\r\nlong since been removed beyond her sight and knowledge. She had more\r\nphysical strength than most men, and made her patch of cotton and corn\r\nand tobacco like the best of them. But of the world beyond the bayou\r\nshe had long known nothing, save what her morbid fancy conceived.\r\n\r\nPeople at Bellissime had grown used to her and her way, and they\r\nthought nothing of it. Even when \xe2\x80\x9cOld Mis\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d died, they did not wonder\r\nthat La Folle had not crossed the bayou, but had stood upon her side of\r\nit, wailing and lamenting.\r\n\r\nP\xe2\x80\x99tit Ma\xc3\xaetre was now the owner of Bellissime. He was a middle-aged man,\r\nwith a family of beautiful daughters about him, and a little son whom\r\nLa Folle loved as if he had been her own. She called him Ch\xc3\xa9ri, and so\r\ndid every one else because she did.\r\n\r\nNone of the girls had ever been to her what Ch\xc3\xa9ri was. They had each\r\nand all loved to be with her, and to listen to her wondrous stories of\r\nthings that always happened \xe2\x80\x9cyonda, beyon\xe2\x80\x99 de bayou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut none of them had stroked her black hand quite as Ch\xc3\xa9ri did, nor\r\nrested their heads against her knee so confidingly, nor fallen asleep\r\nin her arms as he used to do. For Ch\xc3\xa9ri hardly did such things now,\r\nsince he had become the proud possessor of a gun, and had had his black\r\ncurls cut off.\r\n\r\nThat summer\xe2\x80\x94the summer Ch\xc3\xa9ri gave La Folle two black curls tied with a\r\nknot of red ribbon\xe2\x80\x94the water ran so low in the bayou that even the\r\nlittle children at Bellissime were able to cross it on foot, and the\r\ncattle were sent to pasture down by the river. La Folle was sorry when\r\nthey were gone, for she loved these dumb companions well, and liked to\r\nfeel that they were there, and to hear them browsing by night up to her\r\nown enclosure.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday afternoon, when the fields were deserted. The men had\r\nflocked to a neighboring village to do their week\xe2\x80\x99s trading, and the\r\nwomen were occupied with household affairs,\xe2\x80\x94La Folle as well as the\r\nothers. It was then she mended and washed her handful of clothes,\r\nscoured her house, and did her baking.\r\n\r\nIn this last employment she never forgot Ch\xc3\xa9ri. To-day she had\r\nfashioned croquignoles of the most fantastic and alluring shapes for\r\nhim. So when she saw the boy come trudging across the old field with\r\nhis gleaming little new rifle on his shoulder, she called out gayly to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cCh\xc3\xa9ri! Ch\xc3\xa9ri!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ch\xc3\xa9ri did not need the summons, for he was coming straight to her.\r\nHis pockets all bulged out with almonds and raisins and an orange that\r\nhe had secured for her from the very fine dinner which had been given\r\nthat day up at his father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nHe was a sunny-faced youngster of ten. When he had emptied his pockets,\r\nLa Folle patted his round red cheek, wiped his soiled hands on her\r\napron, and smoothed his hair. Then she watched him as, with his cakes\r\nin his hand, he crossed her strip of cotton back of the cabin, and\r\ndisappeared into the wood.\r\n\r\nHe had boasted of the things he was going to do with his gun out there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think they got plenty deer in the wood, La Folle?\xe2\x80\x9d he had\r\ninquired, with the calculating air of an experienced hunter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Non, non!_\xe2\x80\x9d the woman laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you look fo\xe2\x80\x99 no deer, Ch\xc3\xa9ri.\r\nDat\xe2\x80\x99s too big. But you bring La Folle one good fat squirrel fo\xe2\x80\x99 her\r\ndinner to-morrow, an\xe2\x80\x99 she goin\xe2\x80\x99 be satisfi\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne squirrel ain\xe2\x80\x99t a bite. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you mo\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99an one, La Folle,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nhad boasted pompously as he went away.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman, an hour later, heard the report of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s rifle\r\nclose to the wood\xe2\x80\x99s edge, she would have thought nothing of it if a\r\nsharp cry of distress had not followed the sound.\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her arms from the tub of suds in which they had been\r\nplunged, dried them upon her apron, and as quickly as her trembling\r\nlimbs would bear her, hurried to the spot whence the ominous report had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nIt was as she feared. There she found Ch\xc3\xa9ri stretched upon the ground,\r\nwith his rifle beside him. He moaned piteously:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dead, La Folle! I\xe2\x80\x99m dead! I\xe2\x80\x99m gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Non, non!_\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed resolutely, as she knelt beside him. \xe2\x80\x9cPut\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99 arm \xe2\x80\x99roun\xe2\x80\x99 La Folle\xe2\x80\x99s nake, Ch\xc3\xa9ri. Dat\xe2\x80\x99s nuttin\xe2\x80\x99; dat goin\xe2\x80\x99 be\r\nnuttin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d She lifted him in her powerful arms.\r\n\r\nCh\xc3\xa9ri had carried his gun muzzle-downward. He had stumbled,\xe2\x80\x94he did not\r\nknow how. He only knew that he had a ball lodged somewhere in his leg,\r\nand he thought that his end was at hand. Now, with his head upon the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, he moaned and wept with pain and fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, La Folle! La Folle! it hurt so bad! I can\xe2\x80\x99 stan\xe2\x80\x99 it, La Folle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, _mon b\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9, mon b\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9, mon Ch\xc3\xa9ri!_\xe2\x80\x9d the woman spoke\r\nsoothingly as she covered the ground with long strides. \xe2\x80\x9cLa Folle goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmine you; Doctor Bonfils goin\xe2\x80\x99 come make _mon Ch\xc3\xa9ri_ well agin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had reached the abandoned field. As she crossed it with her\r\nprecious burden, she looked constantly and restlessly from side to\r\nside. A terrible fear was upon her,\xe2\x80\x94the fear of the world beyond the\r\nbayou, the morbid and insane dread she had been under since childhood.\r\n\r\nWhen she was at the bayou\xe2\x80\x99s edge she stood there, and shouted for help\r\nas if a life depended upon it:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, P\xe2\x80\x99tit Ma\xc3\xaetre! P\xe2\x80\x99tit Ma\xc3\xaetre! Venez donc! Au secours! Au secours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo voice responded. Ch\xc3\xa9ri\xe2\x80\x99s hot tears were scalding her neck. She\r\ncalled for each and every one upon the place, and still no answer came.\r\n\r\nShe shouted, she wailed; but whether her voice remained unheard or\r\nunheeded, no reply came to her frenzied cries. And all the while Ch\xc3\xa9ri\r\nmoaned and wept and entreated to be taken home to his mother.\r\n\r\nLa Folle gave a last despairing look around her. Extreme terror was\r\nupon her. She clasped the child close against her breast, where he\r\ncould feel her heart beat like a muffled hammer. Then shutting her\r\neyes, she ran suddenly down the shallow bank of the bayou, and never\r\nstopped till she had climbed the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nShe stood there quivering an instant as she opened her eyes. Then she\r\nplunged into the footpath through the trees.\r\n\r\nShe spoke no more to Ch\xc3\xa9ri, but muttered constantly, \xe2\x80\x9cBon Dieu, ayez\r\npiti\xc3\xa9 La Folle! Bon Dieu, ayez piti\xc3\xa9 moi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstinct seemed to guide her. When the pathway spread clear and smooth\r\nenough before her, she again closed her eyes tightly against the sight\r\nof that unknown and terrifying world.\r\n\r\nA child, playing in some weeds, caught sight of her as she neared the\r\nquarters. The little one uttered a cry of dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Folle!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed, in her piercing treble. \xe2\x80\x9cLa Folle done cross\r\nde bayer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuickly the cry passed down the line of cabins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonda, La Folle done cross de bayou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChildren, old men, old women, young ones with infants in their arms,\r\nflocked to doors and windows to see this awe-inspiring spectacle. Most\r\nof them shuddered with superstitious dread of what it might portend.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe totin\xe2\x80\x99 Ch\xc3\xa9ri!\xe2\x80\x9d some of them shouted.\r\n\r\nSome of the more daring gathered about her, and followed at her heels,\r\nonly to fall back with new terror when she turned her distorted face\r\nupon them. Her eyes were bloodshot and the saliva had gathered in a\r\nwhite foam on her black lips.\r\n\r\nSome one had run ahead of her to where P\xe2\x80\x99tit Ma\xc3\xaetre sat with his family\r\nand guests upon the gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x99tit Ma\xc3\xaetre! La Folle done cross de bayou! Look her! Look her yonda\r\ntotin\xe2\x80\x99 Ch\xc3\xa9ri!\xe2\x80\x9d This startling intimation was the first which they had\r\nof the woman\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\r\n\r\nShe was now near at hand. She walked with long strides. Her eyes were\r\nfixed desperately before her, and she breathed heavily, as a tired ox.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stairway, which she could not have mounted, she laid\r\nthe boy in his father\xe2\x80\x99s arms. Then the world that had looked red to La\r\nFolle suddenly turned black,\xe2\x80\x94like that day she had seen powder and\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nShe reeled for an instant. Before a sustaining arm could reach her, she\r\nfell heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen La Folle regained consciousness, she was at home again, in her own\r\ncabin and upon her own bed. The moon rays, streaming in through the\r\nopen door and windows, gave what light was needed to the old black\r\nmammy who stood at the table concocting a tisane of fragrant herbs. It\r\nwas very late.\r\n\r\nOthers who had come, and found that the stupor clung to her, had gone\r\nagain. P\xe2\x80\x99tit Ma\xc3\xaetre had been there, and with him Doctor Bonfils, who\r\nsaid that La Folle might die.\r\n\r\nBut death had passed her by. The voice was very clear and steady with\r\nwhich she spoke to Tante Lizette, brewing her tisane there in a corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEf you will give me one good drink tisane, Tante Lizette, I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 sleep, me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she did sleep; so soundly, so healthfully, that old Lizette without\r\ncompunction stole softly away, to creep back through the moonlit fields\r\nto her own cabin in the new quarters.\r\n\r\nThe first touch of the cool gray morning awoke La Folle. She arose,\r\ncalmly, as if no tempest had shaken and threatened her existence but\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nShe donned her new blue cottonade and white apron, for she remembered\r\nthat this was Sunday. When she had made for herself a cup of strong\r\nblack coffee, and drunk it with relish, she quitted the cabin and\r\nwalked across the old familiar field to the bayou\xe2\x80\x99s edge again.\r\n\r\nShe did not stop there as she had always done before, but crossed with\r\na long, steady stride as if she had done this all her life.\r\n\r\nWhen she had made her way through the brush and scrub cottonwood-trees\r\nthat lined the opposite bank, she found herself upon the border of a\r\nfield where the white, bursting cotton, with the dew upon it, gleamed\r\nfor acres and acres like frosted silver in the early dawn.\r\n\r\nLa Folle drew a long, deep breath as she gazed across the country. She\r\nwalked slowly and uncertainly, like one who hardly knows how, looking\r\nabout her as she went.\r\n\r\nThe cabins, that yesterday had sent a clamor of voices to pursue her,\r\nwere quiet now. No one was yet astir at Bellissime. Only the birds that\r\ndarted here and there from hedges were awake, and singing their matins.\r\n\r\nWhen La Folle came to the broad stretch of velvety lawn that surrounded\r\nthe house, she moved slowly and with delight over the springy turf,\r\nthat was delicious beneath her tread.\r\n\r\nShe stopped to find whence came those perfumes that were assailing her\r\nsenses with memories from a time far gone.\r\n\r\nThere they were, stealing up to her from the thousand blue violets that\r\npeeped out from green, luxuriant beds. There they were, showering down\r\nfrom the big waxen bells of the magnolias far above her head, and from\r\nthe jessamine clumps around her.\r\n\r\nThere were roses, too, without number. To right and left palms spread\r\nin broad and graceful curves. It all looked like enchantment beneath\r\nthe sparkling sheen of dew.\r\n\r\nWhen La Folle had slowly and cautiously mounted the many steps that led\r\nup to the veranda, she turned to look back at the perilous ascent she\r\nhad made. Then she caught sight of the river, bending like a silver bow\r\nat the foot of Bellissime. Exultation possessed her soul.\r\n\r\nLa Folle rapped softly upon a door near at hand. Ch\xc3\xa9ri\xe2\x80\x99s mother soon\r\ncautiously opened it. Quickly and cleverly she dissembled the\r\nastonishment she felt at seeing La Folle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, La Folle! Is it you, so early?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Oui_, madame. I come ax how my po\xe2\x80\x99 li\xe2\x80\x99le Ch\xc3\xa9ri do, \xe2\x80\x99s mo\xe2\x80\x99nin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is feeling easier, thank you, La Folle. Dr. Bonfils says it will be\r\nnothing serious. He\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping now. Will you come back when he awakes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Non_, madame. I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 wait yair tell Ch\xc3\xa9ri wake up.\xe2\x80\x9d La Folle\r\nseated herself upon the topmost step of the veranda.\r\n\r\nA look of wonder and deep content crept into her face as she watched\r\nfor the first time the sun rise upon the new, the beautiful world\r\nbeyond the bayou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMA\xe2\x80\x99AME P\xc3\x89LAGIE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen the war began, there stood on C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse an imposing mansion of\r\nred brick, shaped like the Pantheon. A grove of majestic live-oaks\r\nsurrounded it.\r\n\r\nThirty years later, only the thick walls were standing, with the dull\r\nred brick showing here and there through a matted growth of clinging\r\nvines. The huge round pillars were intact; so to some extent was the\r\nstone flagging of hall and portico. There had been no home so stately\r\nalong the whole stretch of C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse. Every one knew that, as they\r\nknew it had cost Philippe Valm\xc3\xaat sixty thousand dollars to build, away\r\nback in 1840. No one was in danger of forgetting that fact, so long as\r\nhis daughter P\xc3\xa9lagie survived. She was a queenly, white-haired woman of\r\nfifty. \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie,\xe2\x80\x9d they called her, though she was unmarried, as\r\nwas her sister Pauline, a child in Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; a child of\r\nthirty-five.\r\n\r\nThe two lived alone in a three-roomed cabin, almost within the shadow\r\nof the ruin. They lived for a dream, for Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\xe2\x80\x99s dream, which\r\nwas to rebuild the old home.\r\n\r\nIt would be pitiful to tell how their days were spent to accomplish\r\nthis end; how the dollars had been saved for thirty years and the\r\npicayunes hoarded; and yet, not half enough gathered! But Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie felt sure of twenty years of life before her, and counted upon\r\nas many more for her sister. And what could not come to pass in\r\ntwenty\xe2\x80\x94in forty\xe2\x80\x94years?\r\n\r\nOften, of pleasant afternoons, the two would drink their black coffee,\r\nseated upon the stone-flagged portico whose canopy was the blue sky of\r\nLouisiana. They loved to sit there in the silence, with only each other\r\nand the sheeny, prying lizards for company, talking of the old times\r\nand planning for the new; while light breezes stirred the tattered\r\nvines high up among the columns, where owls nested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can never hope to have all just as it was, Pauline,\xe2\x80\x9d Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\r\nwould say; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the marble pillars of the salon will have to be\r\nreplaced by wooden ones, and the crystal candelabra left out. Should\r\nyou be willing, Pauline?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes Sesoeur, I shall be willing.\xe2\x80\x9d It was always, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sesoeur,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sesoeur,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please, Sesoeur,\xe2\x80\x9d with poor little\r\nMam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline. For what did she remember of that old life and that\r\nold spendor? Only a faint gleam here and there; the half-consciousness\r\nof a young, uneventful existence; and then a great crash. That meant\r\nthe nearness of war; the revolt of slaves; confusion ending in fire and\r\nflame through which she was borne safely in the strong arms of P\xc3\xa9lagie,\r\nand carried to the log cabin which was still their home. Their brother,\r\nL\xc3\xa9andre, had known more of it all than Pauline, and not so much as\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie. He had left the management of the big plantation with all its\r\nmemories and traditions to his older sister, and had gone away to dwell\r\nin cities. That was many years ago. Now, L\xc3\xa9andre\xe2\x80\x99s business called him\r\nfrequently and upon long journeys from home, and his motherless\r\ndaughter was coming to stay with her aunts at C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse.\r\n\r\nThey talked about it, sipping their coffee on the ruined portico.\r\nMam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline was terribly excited; the flush that throbbed into\r\nher pale, nervous face showed it; and she locked her thin fingers in\r\nand out incessantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what shall we do with La Petite, Sesoeur? Where shall we put her?\r\nHow shall we amuse her? Ah, Seigneur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will sleep upon a cot in the room next to ours,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie, \xe2\x80\x9cand live as we do. She knows how we live, and why we live;\r\nher father has told her. She knows we have money and could squander it\r\nif we chose. Do not fret, Pauline; let us hope La Petite is a true\r\nValm\xc3\xaat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie rose with stately deliberation and went to saddle\r\nher horse, for she had yet to make her last daily round through the\r\nfields; and Mam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline threaded her way slowly among the tangled\r\ngrasses toward the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe coming of La Petite, bringing with her as she did the pungent\r\natmosphere of an outside and dimly known world, was a shock to these\r\ntwo, living their dream-life. The girl was quite as tall as her aunt\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie, with dark eyes that reflected joy as a still pool reflects the\r\nlight of stars; and her rounded cheek was tinged like the pink cr\xc3\xa8pe\r\nmyrtle. Mam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline kissed her and trembled. Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\r\nlooked into her eyes with a searching gaze, which seemed to seek a\r\nlikeness of the past in the living present.\r\n\r\nAnd they made room between them for this young life.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLa Petite had determined upon trying to fit herself to the strange,\r\nnarrow existence which she knew awaited her at C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse. It went\r\nwell enough at first. Sometimes she followed Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie into the\r\nfields to note how the cotton was opening, ripe and white; or to count\r\nthe ears of corn upon the hardy stalks. But oftener she was with her\r\naunt Pauline, assisting in household offices, chattering of her brief\r\npast, or walking with the older woman arm-in-arm under the trailing\r\nmoss of the giant oaks.\r\n\r\nMam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline\xe2\x80\x99s steps grew very buoyant that summer, and her eyes\r\nwere sometimes as bright as a bird\xe2\x80\x99s, unless La Petite were away from\r\nher side, when they would lose all other light but one of uneasy\r\nexpectancy. The girl seemed to love her well in return, and called her\r\nendearingly Tan\xe2\x80\x99tante. But as the time went by, La Petite became very\r\nquiet,\xe2\x80\x94not listless, but thoughtful, and slow in her movements. Then\r\nher cheeks began to pale, till they were tinged like the creamy plumes\r\nof the white cr\xc3\xa8pe myrtle that grew in the ruin.\r\n\r\nOne day when she sat within its shadow, between her aunts, holding a\r\nhand of each, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cTante P\xc3\xa9lagie, I must tell you something, you\r\nand Tan\xe2\x80\x99tante.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke low, but clearly and firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you\r\nboth,\xe2\x80\x94please remember that I love you both. But I must go away from\r\nyou. I can\xe2\x80\x99t live any longer here at C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA spasm passed through Mam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline\xe2\x80\x99s delicate frame. La Petite\r\ncould feel the twitch of it in the wiry fingers that were intertwined\r\nwith her own. Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie remained unchanged and motionless. No\r\nhuman eye could penetrate so deep as to see the satisfaction which her\r\nsoul felt. She said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Petite? Your father has sent\r\nyou to us, and I am sure it is his wish that you remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father loves me, tante P\xc3\xa9lagie, and such will not be his wish when\r\nhe knows. Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued with a restless movement, \xe2\x80\x9cit is as though\r\na weight were pressing me backward here. I must live another life; the\r\nlife I lived before. I want to know things that are happening from day\r\nto day over the world, and hear them talked about. I want my music, my\r\nbooks, my companions. If I had known no other life but this one of\r\nprivation, I suppose it would be different. If I had to live this life,\r\nI should make the best of it. But I do not have to; and you know, tante\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie, you do not need to. It seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in a whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat it is a sin against myself. Ah, Tan\xe2\x80\x99tante!\xe2\x80\x94what is the matter\r\nwith Tan\xe2\x80\x99tante?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was nothing; only a slight feeling of faintness, that would soon\r\npass. She entreated them to take no notice; but they brought her some\r\nwater and fanned her with a palmetto leaf.\r\n\r\nBut that night, in the stillness of the room, Mam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline sobbed\r\nand would not be comforted. Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie took her in her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPauline, my little sister Pauline,\xe2\x80\x9d she entreated, \xe2\x80\x9cI never have seen\r\nyou like this before. Do you no longer love me? Have we not been happy\r\ntogether, you and I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, Sesoeur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it because La Petite is going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sesoeur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she is dearer to you than I!\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie with sharp\r\nresentment. \xe2\x80\x9cThan I, who held you and warmed you in my arms the day you\r\nwere born; than I, your mother, father, sister, everything that could\r\ncherish you. Pauline, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline tried to talk through her sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it to you, Sesoeur. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it myself. I\r\nlove you as I have always loved you; next to God. But if La Petite goes\r\naway I shall die. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x94help me, Sesoeur. She seems\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nseems like a saviour; like one who had come and taken me by the hand\r\nand was leading me somewhere\xe2\x80\x94somewhere I want to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had been sitting beside the bed in her _peignoir_ and\r\nslippers. She held the hand of her sister who lay there, and smoothed\r\ndown the woman\xe2\x80\x99s soft brown hair. She said not a word, and the silence\r\nwas broken only by Mam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline\xe2\x80\x99s continued sobs. Once Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie arose to mix a drink of orange-flower water, which she gave to\r\nher sister, as she would have offered it to a nervous, fretful child.\r\nAlmost an hour passed before Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie spoke again. Then she\r\nsaid:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPauline, you must cease that sobbing, now, and sleep. You will make\r\nyourself ill. La Petite will not go away. Do you hear me? Do you\r\nunderstand? She will stay, I promise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline could not clearly comprehend, but she had great faith\r\nin the word of her sister, and soothed by the promise and the touch of\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie\xe2\x80\x99s strong, gentle hand, she fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie, when she saw that her sister slept, arose noiselessly\r\nand stepped outside upon the low-roofed narrow gallery. She did not\r\nlinger there, but with a step that was hurried and agitated, she\r\ncrossed the distance that divided her cabin from the ruin.\r\n\r\nThe night was not a dark one, for the sky was clear and the moon\r\nresplendent. But light or dark would have made no difference to Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie. It was not the first time she had stolen away to the ruin at\r\nnight-time, when the whole plantation slept; but she never before had\r\nbeen there with a heart so nearly broken. She was going there for the\r\nlast time to dream her dreams; to see the visions that hitherto had\r\ncrowded her days and nights, and to bid them farewell.\r\n\r\nThere was the first of them, awaiting her upon the very portal; a\r\nrobust old white-haired man, chiding her for returning home so late.\r\nThere are guests to be entertained. Does she not know it? Guests from\r\nthe city and from the near plantations. Yes, she knows it is late. She\r\nhad been abroad with F\xc3\xa9lix, and they did not notice how the time was\r\nspeeding. F\xc3\xa9lix is there; he will explain it all. He is there beside\r\nher, but she does not want to hear what he will tell her father.\r\n\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had sunk upon the bench where she and her sister so\r\noften came to sit. Turning, she gazed in through the gaping chasm of\r\nthe window at her side. The interior of the ruin is ablaze. Not with\r\nthe moonlight, for that is faint beside the other one\xe2\x80\x94the sparkle from\r\nthe crystal candelabra, which negroes, moving noiselessly and\r\nrespectfully about, are lighting, one after the other. How the gleam of\r\nthem reflects and glances from the polished marble pillars!\r\n\r\nThe room holds a number of guests. There is old Monsieur Lucien\r\nSantien, leaning against one of the pillars, and laughing at something\r\nwhich Monsieur Lafirme is telling him, till his fat shoulders shake.\r\nHis son Jules is with him\xe2\x80\x94Jules, who wants to marry her. She laughs.\r\nShe wonders if F\xc3\xa9lix has told her father yet. There is young J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me\r\nLafirme playing at checkers upon the sofa with L\xc3\xa9andre. Little Pauline\r\nstands annoying them and disturbing the game. L\xc3\xa9andre reproves her. She\r\nbegins to cry, and old black Clementine, her nurse, who is not far off,\r\nlimps across the room to pick her up and carry her away. How sensitive\r\nthe little one is! But she trots about and takes care of herself better\r\nthan she did a year or two ago, when she fell upon the stone hall floor\r\nand raised a great \xe2\x80\x9cbo-bo\xe2\x80\x9d on her forehead. P\xc3\xa9lagie was hurt and angry\r\nenough about it; and she ordered rugs and buffalo robes to be brought\r\nand laid thick upon the tiles, till the little one\xe2\x80\x99s steps were surer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIl ne faut pas faire mal \xc3\xa0 Pauline.\xe2\x80\x9d She was saying it aloud\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfaire\r\nmal a Pauline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she gazes beyond the salon, back into the big dining hall, where\r\nthe white cr\xc3\xa8pe myrtle grows. Ha! how low that bat has circled. It has\r\nstruck Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie full on the breast. She does not know it. She is\r\nbeyond there in the dining hall, where her father sits with a group of\r\nfriends over their wine. As usual they are talking politics. How\r\ntiresome! She has heard them say \xe2\x80\x9cla guerre\xe2\x80\x9d oftener than once. La\r\nguerre. Bah! She and F\xc3\xa9lix have something pleasanter to talk about, out\r\nunder the oaks, or back in the shadow of the oleanders.\r\n\r\nBut they were right! The sound of a cannon, shot at Sumter, has rolled\r\nacross the Southern States, and its echo is heard along the whole\r\nstretch of C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse.\r\n\r\nYet P\xc3\xa9lagie does not believe it. Not till La Ricaneuse stands before\r\nher with bare, black arms akimbo, uttering a volley of vile abuse and\r\nof brazen impudence. P\xc3\xa9lagie wants to kill her. But yet she will not\r\nbelieve. Not till F\xc3\xa9lix comes to her in the chamber above the dining\r\nhall\xe2\x80\x94there where that trumpet vine hangs\xe2\x80\x94comes to say good-by to her.\r\nThe hurt which the big brass buttons of his new gray uniform pressed\r\ninto the tender flesh of her bosom has never left it. She sits upon the\r\nsofa, and he beside her, both speechless with pain. That room would not\r\nhave been altered. Even the sofa would have been there in the same\r\nspot, and Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had meant all along, for thirty years, all\r\nalong, to lie there upon it some day when the time came to die.\r\n\r\nBut there is no time to weep, with the enemy at the door. The door has\r\nbeen no barrier. They are clattering through the halls now, drinking\r\nthe wines, shattering the crystal and glass, slashing the portraits.\r\n\r\nOne of them stands before her and tells her to leave the house. She\r\nslaps his face. How the stigma stands out red as blood upon his\r\nblanched cheek!\r\n\r\nNow there is a roar of fire and the flames are bearing down upon her\r\nmotionless figure. She wants to show them how a daughter of Louisiana\r\ncan perish before her conquerors. But little Pauline clings to her\r\nknees in an agony of terror. Little Pauline must be saved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIl ne faut pas faire mal \xc3\xa0 Pauline.\xe2\x80\x9d Again she is saying it\r\naloud\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfaire mal \xc3\xa0 Pauline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe night was nearly spent; Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had glided from the bench\r\nupon which she had rested, and for hours lay prone upon the stone\r\nflagging, motionless. When she dragged herself to her feet it was to\r\nwalk like one in a dream. About the great, solemn pillars, one after\r\nthe other, she reached her arms, and pressed her cheek and her lips\r\nupon the senseless brick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, adieu!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer the moon to guide her steps across the familiar\r\npathway to the cabin. The brightest light in the sky was Venus, that\r\nswung low in the east. The bats had ceased to beat their wings about\r\nthe ruin. Even the mocking-bird that had warbled for hours in the old\r\nmulberry-tree had sung himself asleep. That darkest hour before the day\r\nwas mantling the earth. Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie hurried through the wet,\r\nclinging grass, beating aside the heavy moss that swept across her\r\nface, walking on toward the cabin\xe2\x80\x94toward Pauline. Not once did she look\r\nback upon the ruin that brooded like a huge monster\xe2\x80\x94a black spot in the\r\ndarkness that enveloped it.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLittle more than a year later the transformation which the old Valm\xc3\xaat\r\nplace had undergone was the talk and wonder of C\xc3\xb4te Joyeuse. One would\r\nhave looked in vain for the ruin; it was no longer there; neither was\r\nthe log cabin. But out in the open, where the sun shone upon it, and\r\nthe breezes blew about it, was a shapely structure fashioned from woods\r\nthat the forests of the State had furnished. It rested upon a solid\r\nfoundation of brick.\r\n\r\nUpon a corner of the pleasant gallery sat L\xc3\xa9andre smoking his afternoon\r\ncigar, and chatting with neighbors who had called. This was to be his\r\n_pied \xc3\xa0 terre_ now; the home where his sisters and his daughter dwelt.\r\nThe laughter of young people was heard out under the trees, and within\r\nthe house where La Petite was playing upon the piano. With the\r\nenthusiasm of a young artist she drew from the keys strains that seemed\r\nmarvelously beautiful to Mam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline, who stood enraptured near\r\nher. Mam\xe2\x80\x99selle Pauline had been touched by the re-creation of Valm\xc3\xaat.\r\nHer cheek was as full and almost as flushed as La Petite\xe2\x80\x99s. The years\r\nwere falling away from her.\r\n\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie had been conversing with her brother and his friends.\r\nThen she turned and walked away; stopping to listen awhile to the music\r\nwhich La Petite was making. But it was only for a moment. She went on\r\naround the curve of the veranda, where she found herself alone. She\r\nstayed there, erect, holding to the banister rail and looking out\r\ncalmly in the distance across the fields.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in black, with the white kerchief she always wore\r\nfolded across her bosom. Her thick, glossy hair rose like a silver\r\ndiadem from her brow. In her deep, dark eyes smouldered the light of\r\nfires that would never flame. She had grown very old. Years instead of\r\nmonths seemed to have passed over her since the night she bade farewell\r\nto her visions.\r\n\r\nPoor Ma\xe2\x80\x99ame P\xc3\xa9lagie! How could it be different! While the outward\r\npressure of a young and joyous existence had forced her footsteps into\r\nthe light, her soul had stayed in the shadow of the ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xc3\x89SIR\xc3\x89E\xe2\x80\x99S BABY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the day was pleasant, Madame Valmond\xc3\xa9 drove over to L\xe2\x80\x99Abri to see\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e and the baby.\r\n\r\nIt made her laugh to think of D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e with a baby. Why, it seemed but\r\nyesterday that D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e was little more than a baby herself; when\r\nMonsieur in riding through the gateway of Valmond\xc3\xa9 had found her lying\r\nasleep in the shadow of the big stone pillar.\r\n\r\nThe little one awoke in his arms and began to cry for \xe2\x80\x9cDada.\xe2\x80\x9d That was\r\nas much as she could do or say. Some people thought she might have\r\nstrayed there of her own accord, for she was of the toddling age. The\r\nprevailing belief was that she had been purposely left by a party of\r\nTexans, whose canvas-covered wagon, late in the day, had crossed the\r\nferry that Coton Ma\xc3\xafs kept, just below the plantation. In time Madame\r\nValmond\xc3\xa9 abandoned every speculation but the one that D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e had been\r\nsent to her by a beneficent Providence to be the child of her\r\naffection, seeing that she was without child of the flesh. For the girl\r\ngrew to be beautiful and gentle, affectionate and sincere,\xe2\x80\x94the idol of\r\nValmond\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder, when she stood one day against the stone pillar in\r\nwhose shadow she had lain asleep, eighteen years before, that Armand\r\nAubigny riding by and seeing her there, had fallen in love with her.\r\nThat was the way all the Aubignys fell in love, as if struck by a\r\npistol shot. The wonder was that he had not loved her before; for he\r\nhad known her since his father brought him home from Paris, a boy of\r\neight, after his mother died there. The passion that awoke in him that\r\nday, when he saw her at the gate, swept along like an avalanche, or\r\nlike a prairie fire, or like anything that drives headlong over all\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Valmond\xc3\xa9 grew practical and wanted things well considered:\r\nthat is, the girl\xe2\x80\x99s obscure origin. Armand looked into her eyes and did\r\nnot care. He was reminded that she was nameless. What did it matter\r\nabout a name when he could give her one of the oldest and proudest in\r\nLouisiana? He ordered the _corbeille_ from Paris, and contained himself\r\nwith what patience he could until it arrived; then they were married.\r\n\r\nMadame Valmond\xc3\xa9 had not seen D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e and the baby for four weeks. When\r\nshe reached L\xe2\x80\x99Abri she shuddered at the first sight of it, as she\r\nalways did. It was a sad looking place, which for many years had not\r\nknown the gentle presence of a mistress, old Monsieur Aubigny having\r\nmarried and buried his wife in France, and she having loved her own\r\nland too well ever to leave it. The roof came down steep and black like\r\na cowl, reaching out beyond the wide galleries that encircled the\r\nyellow stuccoed house. Big, solemn oaks grew close to it, and their\r\nthick-leaved, far-reaching branches shadowed it like a pall. Young\r\nAubigny\xe2\x80\x99s rule was a strict one, too, and under it his negroes had\r\nforgotten how to be gay, as they had been during the old master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neasy-going and indulgent lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe young mother was recovering slowly, and lay full length, in her\r\nsoft white muslins and laces, upon a couch. The baby was beside her,\r\nupon her arm, where he had fallen asleep, at her breast. The yellow\r\nnurse woman sat beside a window fanning herself.\r\n\r\nMadame Valmond\xc3\xa9 bent her portly figure over D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e and kissed her,\r\nholding her an instant tenderly in her arms. Then she turned to the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the baby!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in startled tones. French was\r\nthe language spoken at Valmond\xc3\xa9 in those days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would be astonished,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e, \xe2\x80\x9cat the way he has\r\ngrown. The little _cochon de lait!_ Look at his legs, mamma, and his\r\nhands and finger-nails,\xe2\x80\x94real finger-nails. Zandrine had to cut them\r\nthis morning. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true, Zandrine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman bowed her turbaned head majestically, \xe2\x80\x9cMais si, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the way he cries,\xe2\x80\x9d went on D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e, \xe2\x80\x9cis deafening. Armand heard\r\nhim the other day as far away as La Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s cabin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Valmond\xc3\xa9 had never removed her eyes from the child. She lifted\r\nit and walked with it over to the window that was lightest. She scanned\r\nthe baby narrowly, then looked as searchingly at Zandrine, whose face\r\nwas turned to gaze across the fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the child has grown, has changed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Valmond\xc3\xa9, slowly,\r\nas she replaced it beside its mother. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does Armand say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x99s face became suffused with a glow that was happiness itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Armand is the proudest father in the parish, I believe, chiefly\r\nbecause it is a boy, to bear his name; though he says not,\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nwould have loved a girl as well. But I know it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. I know he\r\nsays that to please me. And mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, drawing Madame\r\nValmond\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s head down to her, and speaking in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9che hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npunished one of them\xe2\x80\x94not one of them\xe2\x80\x94since baby is born. Even\r\nN\xc3\xa9grillon, who pretended to have burnt his leg that he might rest from\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94he only laughed, and said N\xc3\xa9grillon was a great scamp. Oh, mamma,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so happy; it frightens me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e said was true. Marriage, and later the birth of his son\r\nhad softened Armand Aubigny\xe2\x80\x99s imperious and exacting nature greatly.\r\nThis was what made the gentle D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e so happy, for she loved him\r\ndesperately. When he frowned she trembled, but loved him. When he\r\nsmiled, she asked no greater blessing of God. But Armand\xe2\x80\x99s dark,\r\nhandsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since the day he\r\nfell in love with her.\r\n\r\nWhen the baby was about three months old, D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e awoke one day to the\r\nconviction that there was something in the air menacing her peace. It\r\nwas at first too subtle to grasp. It had only been a disquieting\r\nsuggestion; an air of mystery among the blacks; unexpected visits from\r\nfar-off neighbors who could hardly account for their coming. Then a\r\nstrange, an awful change in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s manner, which she dared not\r\nask him to explain. When he spoke to her, it was with averted eyes,\r\nfrom which the old love-light seemed to have gone out. He absented\r\nhimself from home; and when there, avoided her presence and that of her\r\nchild, without excuse. And the very spirit of Satan seemed suddenly to\r\ntake hold of him in his dealings with the slaves. D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e was miserable\r\nenough to die.\r\n\r\nShe sat in her room, one hot afternoon, in her _peignoir_, listlessly\r\ndrawing through her fingers the strands of her long, silky brown hair\r\nthat hung about her shoulders. The baby, half naked, lay asleep upon\r\nher own great mahogany bed, that was like a sumptuous throne, with its\r\nsatin-lined half-canopy. One of La Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s little quadroon boys\xe2\x80\x94half\r\nnaked too\xe2\x80\x94stood fanning the child slowly with a fan of peacock\r\nfeathers. D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had been fixed absently and sadly upon the\r\nbaby, while she was striving to penetrate the threatening mist that she\r\nfelt closing about her. She looked from her child to the boy who stood\r\nbeside him, and back again; over and over. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d It was a cry that she\r\ncould not help; which she was not conscious of having uttered. The\r\nblood turned like ice in her veins, and a clammy moisture gathered upon\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nShe tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound would come,\r\nat first. When he heard his name uttered, he looked up, and his\r\nmistress was pointing to the door. He laid aside the great, soft fan,\r\nand obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare\r\ntiptoes.\r\n\r\nShe stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face\r\nthe picture of fright.\r\n\r\nPresently her husband entered the room, and without noticing her, went\r\nto a table and began to search among some papers which covered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmand,\xe2\x80\x9d she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed him, if\r\nhe was human. But he did not notice. \xe2\x80\x9cArmand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said again. Then she\r\nrose and tottered towards him. \xe2\x80\x9cArmand,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted once more,\r\nclutching his arm, \xe2\x80\x9clook at our child. What does it mean? tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust\r\nthe hand away from him. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what it means!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried\r\ndespairingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered lightly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the child is not white; it means\r\nthat you are not white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her nerved her\r\nwith unwonted courage to deny it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a lie; it is not true, I am\r\nwhite! Look at my hair, it is brown; and my eyes are gray, Armand, you\r\nknow they are gray. And my skin is fair,\xe2\x80\x9d seizing his wrist. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nmy hand; whiter than yours, Armand,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed hysterically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs white as La Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned cruelly; and went away leaving\r\nher alone with their child.\r\n\r\nWhen she could hold a pen in her hand, she sent a despairing letter to\r\nMadame Valmond\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother, they tell me I am not white. Armand has told me I am not\r\nwhite. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake tell them it is not true. You must know it is not\r\ntrue. I shall die. I must die. I cannot be so unhappy, and live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer that came was brief:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e: Come home to Valmond\xc3\xa9; back to your mother who loves\r\nyou. Come with your child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the letter reached D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e she went with it to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudy, and laid it open upon the desk before which he sat. She was like\r\na stone image: silent, white, motionless after she placed it there.\r\n\r\nIn silence he ran his cold eyes over the written words.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I go, Armand?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in tones sharp with\r\nagonized suspense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I want you to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought Almighty God had dealt cruelly and unjustly with him; and\r\nfelt, somehow, that he was paying Him back in kind when he stabbed thus\r\ninto his wife\xe2\x80\x99s soul. Moreover he no longer loved her, because of the\r\nunconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name.\r\n\r\nShe turned away like one stunned by a blow, and walked slowly towards\r\nthe door, hoping he would call her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Armand,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer her. That was his last blow at fate.\r\n\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e went in search of her child. Zandrine was pacing the sombre\r\ngallery with it. She took the little one from the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s arms with no\r\nword of explanation, and descending the steps, walked away, under the\r\nlive-oak branches.\r\n\r\nIt was an October afternoon; the sun was just sinking. Out in the still\r\nfields the negroes were picking cotton.\r\n\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e had not changed the thin white garment nor the slippers which\r\nshe wore. Her hair was uncovered and the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays brought a golden\r\ngleam from its brown meshes. She did not take the broad, beaten road\r\nwhich led to the far-off plantation of Valmond\xc3\xa9. She walked across a\r\ndeserted field, where the stubble bruised her tender feet, so\r\ndelicately shod, and tore her thin gown to shreds.\r\n\r\nShe disappeared among the reeds and willows that grew thick along the\r\nbanks of the deep, sluggish bayou; and she did not come back again.\r\n\r\nSome weeks later there was a curious scene enacted at L\xe2\x80\x99Abri. In the\r\ncentre of the smoothly swept back yard was a great bonfire. Armand\r\nAubigny sat in the wide hallway that commanded a view of the spectacle;\r\nand it was he who dealt out to a half dozen negroes the material which\r\nkept this fire ablaze.\r\n\r\nA graceful cradle of willow, with all its dainty furbishings, was laid\r\nupon the pyre, which had already been fed with the richness of a\r\npriceless _layette_. Then there were silk gowns, and velvet and satin\r\nones added to these; laces, too, and embroideries; bonnets and gloves;\r\nfor the _corbeille_ had been of rare quality.\r\n\r\nThe last thing to go was a tiny bundle of letters; innocent little\r\nscribblings that D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e had sent to him during the days of their\r\nespousal. There was the remnant of one back in the drawer from which he\r\ntook them. But it was not D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x99s; it was part of an old letter from\r\nhis mother to his father. He read it. She was thanking God for the\r\nblessing of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s love:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut above all,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cnight and day, I thank the good God for\r\nhaving so arranged our lives that our dear Armand will never know that\r\nhis mother, who adores him, belongs to the race that is cursed with the\r\nbrand of slavery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RESPECTABLE WOMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Baroda was a little provoked to learn that her husband expected\r\nhis friend, Gouvernail, up to spend a week or two on the plantation.\r\n\r\nThey had entertained a good deal during the winter; much of the time\r\nhad also been passed in New Orleans in various forms of mild\r\ndissipation. She was looking forward to a period of unbroken rest, now,\r\nand undisturbed t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate with her husband, when he informed her that\r\nGouvernail was coming up to stay a week or two.\r\n\r\nThis was a man she had heard much of but never seen. He had been her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s college friend; was now a journalist, and in no sense a\r\nsociety man or \xe2\x80\x9ca man about town,\xe2\x80\x9d which were, perhaps, some of the\r\nreasons she had never met him. But she had unconsciously formed an\r\nimage of him in her mind. She pictured him tall, slim, cynical; with\r\neye-glasses, and his hands in his pockets; and she did not like him.\r\nGouvernail was slim enough, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very tall nor very cynical;\r\nneither did he wear eyeglasses nor carry his hands in his pockets. And\r\nshe rather liked him when he first presented himself.\r\n\r\nBut why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to herself\r\nwhen she partly attempted to do so. She could discover in him none of\r\nthose brilliant and promising traits which Gaston, her husband, had\r\noften assured her that he possessed. On the contrary, he sat rather\r\nmute and receptive before her chatty eagerness to make him feel at home\r\nand in face of Gaston\xe2\x80\x99s frank and wordy hospitality. His manner was as\r\ncourteous toward her as the most exacting woman could require; but he\r\nmade no direct appeal to her approval or even esteem.\r\n\r\nOnce settled at the plantation he seemed to like to sit upon the wide\r\nportico in the shade of one of the big Corinthian pillars, smoking his\r\ncigar lazily and listening attentively to Gaston\xe2\x80\x99s experience as a\r\nsugar planter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I call living,\xe2\x80\x9d he would utter with deep satisfaction, as\r\nthe air that swept across the sugar field caressed him with its warm\r\nand scented velvety touch. It pleased him also to get on familiar terms\r\nwith the big dogs that came about him, rubbing themselves sociably\r\nagainst his legs. He did not care to fish, and displayed no eagerness\r\nto go out and kill grosbecs when Gaston proposed doing so.\r\n\r\nGouvernail\xe2\x80\x99s personality puzzled Mrs. Baroda, but she liked him.\r\nIndeed, he was a lovable, inoffensive fellow. After a few days, when\r\nshe could understand him no better than at first, she gave over being\r\npuzzled and remained piqued. In this mood she left her husband and her\r\nguest, for the most part, alone together. Then finding that Gouvernail\r\ntook no manner of exception to her action, she imposed her society upon\r\nhim, accompanying him in his idle strolls to the mill and walks along\r\nthe batture. She persistently sought to penetrate the reserve in which\r\nhe had unconsciously enveloped himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is he going\xe2\x80\x94your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d she one day asked her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my\r\npart, he tires me frightfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for a week yet, dear. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand; he gives you no\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I should like him better if he did; if he were more like others,\r\nand I had to plan somewhat for his comfort and enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGaston took his wife\xe2\x80\x99s pretty face between his hands and looked\r\ntenderly and laughingly into her troubled eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were making a bit of toilet sociably together in Mrs. Baroda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are full of surprises, ma belle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. \xe2\x80\x9cEven I can\r\nnever count upon how you are going to act under given conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nkissed her and turned to fasten his cravat before the mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9ctaking poor Gouvernail seriously and\r\nmaking a commotion over him, the last thing he would desire or expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommotion!\xe2\x80\x9d she hotly resented. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! How can you say such a\r\nthing? Commotion, indeed! But, you know, you said he was clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he is. But the poor fellow is run down by overwork now. That\xe2\x80\x99s why\r\nI asked him here to take a rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used to say he was a man of ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, unconciliated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected him to be interesting, at least. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the city in\r\nthe morning to have my spring gowns fitted. Let me know when Mr.\r\nGouvernail is gone; I shall be at my Aunt Octavie\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night she went and sat alone upon a bench that stood beneath a\r\nlive oak tree at the edge of the gravel walk.\r\n\r\nShe had never known her thoughts or her intentions to be so confused.\r\nShe could gather nothing from them but the feeling of a distinct\r\nnecessity to quit her home in the morning.\r\n\r\nMrs. Baroda heard footsteps crunching the gravel; but could discern in\r\nthe darkness only the approaching red point of a lighted cigar. She\r\nknew it was Gouvernail, for her husband did not smoke. She hoped to\r\nremain unnoticed, but her white gown revealed her to him. He threw away\r\nhis cigar and seated himself upon the bench beside her; without a\r\nsuspicion that she might object to his presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband told me to bring this to you, Mrs. Baroda,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nhanding her a filmy, white scarf with which she sometimes enveloped her\r\nhead and shoulders. She accepted the scarf from him with a murmur of\r\nthanks, and let it lie in her lap.\r\n\r\nHe made some commonplace observation upon the baneful effect of the\r\nnight air at the season. Then as his gaze reached out into the\r\ndarkness, he murmured, half to himself:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Night of south winds\xe2\x80\x94night of the large few stars!\r\n    Still nodding night\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply to this apostrophe to the night, which, indeed, was\r\nnot addressed to her.\r\n\r\nGouvernail was in no sense a diffident man, for he was not a\r\nself-conscious one. His periods of reserve were not constitutional, but\r\nthe result of moods. Sitting there beside Mrs. Baroda, his silence\r\nmelted for the time.\r\n\r\nHe talked freely and intimately in a low, hesitating drawl that was not\r\nunpleasant to hear. He talked of the old college days when he and\r\nGaston had been a good deal to each other; of the days of keen and\r\nblind ambitions and large intentions. Now there was left with him, at\r\nleast, a philosophic acquiescence to the existing order\xe2\x80\x94only a desire\r\nto be permitted to exist, with now and then a little whiff of genuine\r\nlife, such as he was breathing now.\r\n\r\nHer mind only vaguely grasped what he was saying. Her physical being\r\nwas for the moment predominant. She was not thinking of his words, only\r\ndrinking in the tones of his voice. She wanted to reach out her hand in\r\nthe darkness and touch him with the sensitive tips of her fingers upon\r\nthe face or the lips. She wanted to draw close to him and whisper\r\nagainst his cheek\xe2\x80\x94she did not care what\xe2\x80\x94as she might have done if she\r\nhad not been a respectable woman.\r\n\r\nThe stronger the impulse grew to bring herself near him, the further,\r\nin fact, did she draw away from him. As soon as she could do so without\r\nan appearance of too great rudeness, she rose and left him there alone.\r\n\r\nBefore she reached the house, Gouvernail had lighted a fresh cigar and\r\nended his apostrophe to the night.\r\n\r\nMrs. Baroda was greatly tempted that night to tell her husband\xe2\x80\x94who was\r\nalso her friend\xe2\x80\x94of this folly that had seized her. But she did not\r\nyield to the temptation. Beside being a respectable woman she was a\r\nvery sensible one; and she knew there are some battles in life which a\r\nhuman being must fight alone.\r\n\r\nWhen Gaston arose in the morning, his wife had already departed. She\r\nhad taken an early morning train to the city. She did not return till\r\nGouvernail was gone from under her roof.\r\n\r\nThere was some talk of having him back during the summer that followed.\r\nThat is, Gaston greatly desired it; but this desire yielded to his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s strenuous opposition.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the year ended, she proposed, wholly from herself, to\r\nhave Gouvernail visit them again. Her husband was surprised and\r\ndelighted with the suggestion coming from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad, ch\xc3\xa8re amie, to know that you have finally overcome your\r\ndislike for him; truly he did not deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him, laughingly, after pressing a long, tender kiss upon\r\nhis lips, \xe2\x80\x9cI have overcome everything! you will see. This time I shall\r\nbe very nice to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KISS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was still quite light out of doors, but inside with the curtains\r\ndrawn and the smouldering fire sending out a dim, uncertain glow, the\r\nroom was full of deep shadows.\r\n\r\nBrantain sat in one of these shadows; it had overtaken him and he did\r\nnot mind. The obscurity lent him courage to keep his eyes fastened as\r\nardently as he liked upon the girl who sat in the firelight.\r\n\r\nShe was very handsome, with a certain fine, rich coloring that belongs\r\nto the healthy brune type. She was quite composed, as she idly stroked\r\nthe satiny coat of the cat that lay curled in her lap, and she\r\noccasionally sent a slow glance into the shadow where her companion\r\nsat. They were talking low, of indifferent things which plainly were\r\nnot the things that occupied their thoughts. She knew that he loved\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94a frank, blustering fellow without guile enough to conceal his\r\nfeelings, and no desire to do so. For two weeks past he had sought her\r\nsociety eagerly and persistently. She was confidently waiting for him\r\nto declare himself and she meant to accept him. The rather\r\ninsignificant and unattractive Brantain was enormously rich; and she\r\nliked and required the entourage which wealth could give her.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the pauses between their talk of the last tea and the\r\nnext reception the door opened and a young man entered whom Brantain\r\nknew quite well. The girl turned her face toward him. A stride or two\r\nbrought him to her side, and bending over her chair\xe2\x80\x94before she could\r\nsuspect his intention, for she did not realize that he had not seen her\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x94he pressed an ardent, lingering kiss upon her lips.\r\n\r\nBrantain slowly arose; so did the girl arise, but quickly, and the\r\nnewcomer stood between them, a little amusement and some defiance\r\nstruggling with the confusion in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Brantain, \xe2\x80\x9cI see that I have stayed too long.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94I had no idea\xe2\x80\x94that is, I must wish you good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d He was clutching his\r\nhat with both hands, and probably did not perceive that she was\r\nextending her hand to him, her presence of mind had not completely\r\ndeserted her; but she could not have trusted herself to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang me if I saw him sitting there, Nattie! I know it\xe2\x80\x99s deuced awkward\r\nfor you. But I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me this once\xe2\x80\x94this very first break.\r\nWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch me; don\xe2\x80\x99t come near me,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou mean by entering the house without ringing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came in with your brother, as I often do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered coldly, in\r\nself-justification. \xe2\x80\x9cWe came in the side way. He went upstairs and I\r\ncame in here hoping to find you. The explanation is simple enough and\r\nought to satisfy you that the misadventure was unavoidable. But do say\r\nthat you forgive me, Nathalie,\xe2\x80\x9d he entreated, softening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive you! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are talking about. Let me pass.\r\nIt depends upon\xe2\x80\x94a good deal whether I ever forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that next reception which she and Brantain had been talking about\r\nshe approached the young man with a delicious frankness of manner when\r\nshe saw him there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me speak to you a moment or two, Mr. Brantain?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nwith an engaging but perturbed smile. He seemed extremely unhappy; but\r\nwhen she took his arm and walked away with him, seeking a retired\r\ncorner, a ray of hope mingled with the almost comical misery of his\r\nexpression. She was apparently very outspoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I should not have sought this interview, Mr. Brantain;\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x94but, oh, I have been very uncomfortable, almost miserable since\r\nthat little encounter the other afternoon. When I thought how you might\r\nhave misinterpreted it, and believed things\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94hope was plainly gaining\r\nthe ascendancy over misery in Brantain\xe2\x80\x99s round, guileless face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse, I know it is nothing to you, but for my own sake I do want you\r\nto understand that Mr. Harvy is an intimate friend of long standing.\r\nWhy, we have always been like cousins\xe2\x80\x94like brother and sister, I may\r\nsay. He is my brother\xe2\x80\x99s most intimate associate and often fancies that\r\nhe is entitled to the same privileges as the family. Oh, I know it is\r\nabsurd, uncalled for, to tell you this; undignified even,\xe2\x80\x9d she was\r\nalmost weeping, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it makes so much difference to me what you think\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94of me.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice had grown very low and agitated. The misery had\r\nall disappeared from Brantain\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you do really care what I think, Miss Nathalie? May I call you\r\nMiss Nathalie?\xe2\x80\x9d They turned into a long, dim corridor that was lined on\r\neither side with tall, graceful plants. They walked slowly to the very\r\nend of it. When they turned to retrace their steps Brantain\xe2\x80\x99s face was\r\nradiant and hers was triumphant.\r\n\r\nHarvy was among the guests at the wedding; and he sought her out in a\r\nrare moment when she stood alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9chas sent me over to kiss you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA quick blush suffused her face and round polished throat. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s natural for a man to feel and act generously on an occasion of\r\nthis kind. He tells me he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want his marriage to interrupt wholly\r\nthat pleasant intimacy which has existed between you and me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling him,\xe2\x80\x9d with an insolent smile, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he has\r\nsent me here to kiss you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt like a chess player who, by the clever handling of his pieces,\r\nsees the game taking the course intended. Her eyes were bright and\r\ntender with a smile as they glanced up into his; and her lips looked\r\nhungry for the kiss which they invited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him so, it would\r\nhave seemed ungrateful, but I can tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped kissing women;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, she had Brantain and his million left. A person can\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\neverything in this world; and it was a little unreasonable of her to\r\nexpect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PAIR OF SILK STOCKINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Mrs. Sommers one day found herself the unexpected possessor of\r\nfifteen dollars. It seemed to her a very large amount of money, and the\r\nway in which it stuffed and bulged her worn old _porte-monnaie_ gave\r\nher a feeling of importance such as she had not enjoyed for years.\r\n\r\nThe question of investment was one that occupied her greatly. For a day\r\nor two she walked about apparently in a dreamy state, but really\r\nabsorbed in speculation and calculation. She did not wish to act\r\nhastily, to do anything she might afterward regret. But it was during\r\nthe still hours of the night when she lay awake revolving plans in her\r\nmind that she seemed to see her way clearly toward a proper and\r\njudicious use of the money.\r\n\r\nA dollar or two should be added to the price usually paid for Janie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoes, which would insure their lasting an appreciable time longer than\r\nthey usually did. She would buy so and so many yards of percale for new\r\nshirt waists for the boys and Janie and Mag. She had intended to make\r\nthe old ones do by skilful patching. Mag should have another gown. She\r\nhad seen some beautiful patterns, veritable bargains in the shop\r\nwindows. And still there would be left enough for new stockings\xe2\x80\x94two\r\npairs apiece\xe2\x80\x94and what darning that would save for a while! She would\r\nget caps for the boys and sailor-hats for the girls. The vision of her\r\nlittle brood looking fresh and dainty and new for once in their lives\r\nexcited her and made her restless and wakeful with anticipation.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors sometimes talked of certain \xe2\x80\x9cbetter days\xe2\x80\x9d that little\r\nMrs. Sommers had known before she had ever thought of being Mrs.\r\nSommers. She herself indulged in no such morbid retrospection. She had\r\nno time\xe2\x80\x94no second of time to devote to the past. The needs of the\r\npresent absorbed her every faculty. A vision of the future like some\r\ndim, gaunt monster sometimes appalled her, but luckily to-morrow never\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sommers was one who knew the value of bargains; who could stand\r\nfor hours making her way inch by inch toward the desired object that\r\nwas selling below cost. She could elbow her way if need be; she had\r\nlearned to clutch a piece of goods and hold it and stick to it with\r\npersistence and determination till her turn came to be served, no\r\nmatter when it came.\r\n\r\nBut that day she was a little faint and tired. She had swallowed a\r\nlight luncheon\xe2\x80\x94no! when she came to think of it, between getting the\r\nchildren fed and the place righted, and preparing herself for the\r\nshopping bout, she had actually forgotten to eat any luncheon at all!\r\n\r\nShe sat herself upon a revolving stool before a counter that was\r\ncomparatively deserted, trying to gather strength and courage to charge\r\nthrough an eager multitude that was besieging breastworks of shirting\r\nand figured lawn. An all-gone limp feeling had come over her and she\r\nrested her hand aimlessly upon the counter. She wore no gloves. By\r\ndegrees she grew aware that her hand had encountered something very\r\nsoothing, very pleasant to touch. She looked down to see that her hand\r\nlay upon a pile of silk stockings. A placard near by announced that\r\nthey had been reduced in price from two dollars and fifty cents to one\r\ndollar and ninety-eight cents; and a young girl who stood behind the\r\ncounter asked her if she wished to examine their line of silk hosiery.\r\nShe smiled, just as if she had been asked to inspect a tiara of\r\ndiamonds with the ultimate view of purchasing it. But she went on\r\nfeeling the soft, sheeny luxurious things\xe2\x80\x94with both hands now, holding\r\nthem up to see them glisten, and to feel them glide serpent-like\r\nthrough her fingers.\r\n\r\nTwo hectic blotches came suddenly into her pale cheeks. She looked up\r\nat the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think there are any eights-and-a-half among these?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were any number of eights-and-a-half. In fact, there were more of\r\nthat size than any other. Here was a light-blue pair; there were some\r\nlavender, some all black and various shades of tan and gray. Mrs.\r\nSommers selected a black pair and looked at them very long and closely.\r\nShe pretended to be examining their texture, which the clerk assured\r\nher was excellent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dollar and ninety-eight cents,\xe2\x80\x9d she mused aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nthis pair.\xe2\x80\x9d She handed the girl a five-dollar bill and waited for her\r\nchange and for her parcel. What a very small parcel it was! It seemed\r\nlost in the depths of her shabby old shopping-bag.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sommers after that did not move in the direction of the bargain\r\ncounter. She took the elevator, which carried her to an upper floor\r\ninto the region of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 waiting-rooms. Here, in a retired\r\ncorner, she exchanged her cotton stockings for the new silk ones which\r\nshe had just bought. She was not going through any acute mental process\r\nor reasoning with herself, nor was she striving to explain to her\r\nsatisfaction the motive of her action. She was not thinking at all. She\r\nseemed for the time to be taking a rest from that laborious and\r\nfatiguing function and to have abandoned herself to some mechanical\r\nimpulse that directed her actions and freed her of responsibility.\r\n\r\nHow good was the touch of the raw silk to her flesh! She felt like\r\nlying back in the cushioned chair and reveling for a while in the\r\nluxury of it. She did for a little while. Then she replaced her shoes,\r\nrolled the cotton stockings together and thrust them into her bag.\r\nAfter doing this she crossed straight over to the shoe department and\r\ntook her seat to be fitted.\r\n\r\nShe was fastidious. The clerk could not make her out; he could not\r\nreconcile her shoes with her stockings, and she was not too easily\r\npleased. She held back her skirts and turned her feet one way and her\r\nhead another way as she glanced down at the polished, pointed-tipped\r\nboots. Her foot and ankle looked very pretty. She could not realize\r\nthat they belonged to her and were a part of herself. She wanted an\r\nexcellent and stylish fit, she told the young fellow who served her,\r\nand she did not mind the difference of a dollar or two more in the\r\nprice so long as she got what she desired.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time since Mrs. Sommers had been fitted with gloves. On\r\nrare occasions when she had bought a pair they were always \xe2\x80\x9cbargains,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nso cheap that it would have been preposterous and unreasonable to have\r\nexpected them to be fitted to the hand.\r\n\r\nNow she rested her elbow on the cushion of the glove counter, and a\r\npretty, pleasant young creature, delicate and deft of touch, drew a\r\nlong-wristed \xe2\x80\x9ckid\xe2\x80\x9d over Mrs. Sommers\xe2\x80\x99s hand. She smoothed it down over\r\nthe wrist and buttoned it neatly, and both lost themselves for a second\r\nor two in admiring contemplation of the little symmetrical gloved hand.\r\nBut there were other places where money might be spent.\r\n\r\nThere were books and magazines piled up in the window of a stall a few\r\npaces down the street. Mrs. Sommers bought two high-priced magazines\r\nsuch as she had been accustomed to read in the days when she had been\r\naccustomed to other pleasant things. She carried them without wrapping.\r\nAs well as she could she lifted her skirts at the crossings. Her\r\nstockings and boots and well fitting gloves had worked marvels in her\r\nbearing\xe2\x80\x94had given her a feeling of assurance, a sense of belonging to\r\nthe well-dressed multitude.\r\n\r\nShe was very hungry. Another time she would have stilled the cravings\r\nfor food until reaching her own home, where she would have brewed\r\nherself a cup of tea and taken a snack of anything that was available.\r\nBut the impulse that was guiding her would not suffer her to entertain\r\nany such thought.\r\n\r\nThere was a restaurant at the corner. She had never entered its doors;\r\nfrom the outside she had sometimes caught glimpses of spotless damask\r\nand shining crystal, and soft-stepping waiters serving people of\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered her appearance created no surprise, no consternation,\r\nas she had half feared it might. She seated herself at a small table\r\nalone, and an attentive waiter at once approached to take her order.\r\nShe did not want a profusion; she craved a nice and tasty bite\xe2\x80\x94a half\r\ndozen blue-points, a plump chop with cress, a something sweet\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncr\xc3\xa8me-frapp\xc3\xa9e, for instance; a glass of Rhine wine, and after all a\r\nsmall cup of black coffee.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting to be served she removed her gloves very leisurely and\r\nlaid them beside her. Then she picked up a magazine and glanced through\r\nit, cutting the pages with a blunt edge of her knife. It was all very\r\nagreeable. The damask was even more spotless than it had seemed through\r\nthe window, and the crystal more sparkling. There were quiet ladies and\r\ngentlemen, who did not notice her, lunching at the small tables like\r\nher own. A soft, pleasing strain of music could be heard, and a gentle\r\nbreeze was blowing through the window. She tasted a bite, and she read\r\na word or two, and she sipped the amber wine and wiggled her toes in\r\nthe silk stockings. The price of it made no difference. She counted the\r\nmoney out to the waiter and left an extra coin on his tray, whereupon\r\nhe bowed before her as before a princess of royal blood.\r\n\r\nThere was still money in her purse, and her next temptation presented\r\nitself in the shape of a matinee poster.\r\n\r\nIt was a little later when she entered the theatre, the play had begun\r\nand the house seemed to her to be packed. But there were vacant seats\r\nhere and there, and into one of them she was ushered, between\r\nbrilliantly dressed women who had gone there to kill time and eat candy\r\nand display their gaudy attire. There were many others who were there\r\nsolely for the play and acting. It is safe to say there was no one\r\npresent who bore quite the attitude which Mrs. Sommers did to her\r\nsurroundings. She gathered in the whole\xe2\x80\x94stage and players and people in\r\none wide impression, and absorbed it and enjoyed it. She laughed at the\r\ncomedy and wept\xe2\x80\x94she and the gaudy woman next to her wept over the\r\ntragedy. And they talked a little together over it. And the gaudy woman\r\nwiped her eyes and sniffled on a tiny square of filmy, perfumed lace\r\nand passed little Mrs. Sommers her box of candy.\r\n\r\nThe play was over, the music ceased, the crowd filed out. It was like a\r\ndream ended. People scattered in all directions. Mrs. Sommers went to\r\nthe corner and waited for the cable car.\r\n\r\nA man with keen eyes, who sat opposite to her, seemed to like the study\r\nof her small, pale face. It puzzled him to decipher what he saw there.\r\nIn truth, he saw nothing\xe2\x80\x94unless he were wizard enough to detect a\r\npoignant wish, a powerful longing that the cable car would never stop\r\nanywhere, but go on and on with her forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOCKET\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOne night in autumn a few men were gathered about a fire on the slope\r\nof a hill. They belonged to a small detachment of Confederate forces\r\nand were awaiting orders to march. Their gray uniforms were worn beyond\r\nthe point of shabbiness. One of the men was heating something in a tin\r\ncup over the embers. Two were lying at full length a little distance\r\naway, while a fourth was trying to decipher a letter and had drawn\r\nclose to the light. He had unfastened his collar and a good bit of his\r\nflannel shirt front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that you got around your neck, Ned?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one of the men lying\r\nin the obscurity.\r\n\r\nNed\xe2\x80\x94or Edmond\xe2\x80\x94mechanically fastened another button of his shirt and did\r\nnot reply. He went on reading his letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your sweet heart\xe2\x80\x99s picture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Taint no gal\xe2\x80\x99s picture,\xe2\x80\x9d offered the man at the fire. He had removed\r\nhis tin cup and was engaged in stirring its grimy contents with a small\r\nstick. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a charm; some kind of hoodoo business that one o\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\npriests gave him to keep him out o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble. I know them Cath\xe2\x80\x99lics.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how come Frenchy got permoted an never got a scratch sence he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen in the ranks. Hey, French! aint I right?\xe2\x80\x9d Edmond looked up\r\nabsently from his letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAint that a charm you got round your neck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be, Nick,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Edmond with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\r\ncould have gone through this year and a half without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter had made Edmond heart sick and home sick. He stretched\r\nhimself on his back and looked straight up at the blinking stars. But\r\nhe was not thinking of them nor of anything but a certain spring day\r\nwhen the bees were humming in the clematis; when a girl was saying good\r\nbye to him. He could see her as she unclasped from her neck the locket\r\nwhich she fastened about his own. It was an old fashioned golden locket\r\nbearing miniatures of her father and mother with their names and the\r\ndate of their marriage. It was her most precious earthly possession.\r\nEdmond could feel again the folds of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s soft white gown, and\r\nsee the droop of the angel-sleeves as she circled her fair arms about\r\nhis neck. Her sweet face, appealing, pathetic, tormented by the pain of\r\nparting, appeared before him as vividly as life. He turned over,\r\nburying his face in his arm and there he lay, still and motionless.\r\n\r\nThe profound and treacherous night with its silence and semblance of\r\npeace settled upon the camp. He dreamed that the fair Octavie brought\r\nhim a letter. He had no chair to offer her and was pained and\r\nembarrassed at the condition of his garments. He was ashamed of the\r\npoor food which comprised the dinner at which he begged her to join\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe dreamt of a serpent coiling around his throat, and when he strove to\r\ngrasp it the slimy thing glided away from his clutch. Then his dream\r\nwas clamor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGit your duds! you! Frenchy!\xe2\x80\x9d Nick was bellowing in his face. There\r\nwas what appeared to be a scramble and a rush rather than any regulated\r\nmovement. The hill side was alive with clatter and motion; with sudden\r\nup-springing lights among the pines. In the east the dawn was unfolding\r\nout of the darkness. Its glimmer was yet dim in the plain below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d wondered a big black bird perched in the top of\r\nthe tallest tree. He was an old solitary and a wise one, yet he was not\r\nwise enough to guess what it was all about. So all day long he kept\r\nblinking and wondering.\r\n\r\nThe noise reached far out over the plain and across the hills and awoke\r\nthe little babes that were sleeping in their cradles. The smoke curled\r\nup toward the sun and shadowed the plain so that the stupid birds\r\nthought it was going to rain; but the wise one knew better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are children playing a game,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall know more\r\nabout it if I watch long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the approach of night they had all vanished away with their din and\r\nsmoke. Then the old bird plumed his feathers. At last he had\r\nunderstood! With a flap of his great, black wings he shot downward,\r\ncircling toward the plain.\r\n\r\nA man was picking his way across the plain. He was dressed in the garb\r\nof a clergyman. His mission was to administer the consolations of\r\nreligion to any of the prostrate figures in whom there might yet linger\r\na spark of life. A negro accompanied him, bearing a bucket of water and\r\na flask of wine.\r\n\r\nThere were no wounded here; they had been borne away. But the retreat\r\nhad been hurried and the vultures and the good Samaritans would have to\r\nlook to the dead.\r\n\r\nThere was a soldier\xe2\x80\x94a mere boy\xe2\x80\x94lying with his face to the sky. His\r\nhands were clutching the sward on either side and his finger nails were\r\nstuffed with earth and bits of grass that he had gathered in his\r\ndespairing grasp upon life. His musket was gone; he was hatless and his\r\nface and clothing were begrimed. Around his neck hung a gold chain and\r\nlocket. The priest, bending over him, unclasped the chain and removed\r\nit from the dead soldier\xe2\x80\x99s neck. He had grown used to the terrors of\r\nwar and could face them unflinchingly; but its pathos, someway, always\r\nbrought the tears to his old, dim eyes.\r\n\r\nThe angelus was ringing half a mile away. The priest and the negro\r\nknelt and murmured together the evening benediction and a prayer for\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe peace and beauty of a spring day had descended upon the earth like\r\na benediction. Along the leafy road which skirted a narrow, tortuous\r\nstream in central Louisiana, rumbled an old fashioned cabriolet, much\r\nthe worse for hard and rough usage over country roads and lanes. The\r\nfat, black horses went in a slow, measured trot, notwithstanding\r\nconstant urging on the part of the fat, black coachman. Within the\r\nvehicle were seated the fair Octavie and her old friend and neighbor,\r\nJudge Pillier, who had come to take her for a morning drive.\r\n\r\nOctavie wore a plain black dress, severe in its simplicity. A narrow\r\nbelt held it at the waist and the sleeves were gathered into close\r\nfitting wristbands. She had discarded her hoopskirt and appeared not\r\nunlike a nun. Beneath the folds of her bodice nestled the old locket.\r\nShe never displayed it now. It had returned to her sanctified in her\r\neyes; made precious as material things sometimes are by being forever\r\nidentified with a significant moment of one\xe2\x80\x99s existence.\r\n\r\nA hundred times she had read over the letter with which the locket had\r\ncome back to her. No later than that morning she had again pored over\r\nit. As she sat beside the window, smoothing the letter out upon her\r\nknee, heavy and spiced odors stole in to her with the songs of birds\r\nand the humming of insects in the air.\r\n\r\nShe was so young and the world was so beautiful that there came over\r\nher a sense of unreality as she read again and again the priest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. He told of that autumn day drawing to its close, with the gold\r\nand the red fading out of the west, and the night gathering its shadows\r\nto cover the faces of the dead. Oh! She could not believe that one of\r\nthose dead was her own! with visage uplifted to the gray sky in an\r\nagony of supplication. A spasm of resistance and rebellion seized and\r\nswept over her. Why was the spring here with its flowers and its\r\nseductive breath if he was dead! Why was she here! What further had she\r\nto do with life and the living!\r\n\r\nOctavie had experienced many such moments of despair, but a blessed\r\nresignation had never failed to follow, and it fell then upon her like\r\na mantle and enveloped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall grow old and quiet and sad like poor Aunt Tavie,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured\r\nto herself as she folded the letter and replaced it in the secretary.\r\nAlready she gave herself a little demure air like her Aunt Tavie. She\r\nwalked with a slow glide in unconscious imitation of Mademoiselle Tavie\r\nwhom some youthful affliction had robbed of earthly compensation while\r\nleaving her in possession of youth\xe2\x80\x99s illusions.\r\n\r\nAs she sat in the old cabriolet beside the father of her dead lover,\r\nagain there came to Octavie the terrible sense of loss which had\r\nassailed her so often before. The soul of her youth clamored for its\r\nrights; for a share in the world\xe2\x80\x99s glory and exultation. She leaned\r\nback and drew her veil a little closer about her face. It was an old\r\nblack veil of her Aunt Tavie\xe2\x80\x99s. A whiff of dust from the road had blown\r\nin and she wiped her cheeks and her eyes with her soft, white\r\nhandkerchief, a homemade handkerchief, fabricated from one of her old\r\nfine muslin petticoats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you do me the favor, Octavie,\xe2\x80\x9d requested the judge in the\r\ncourteous tone which he never abandoned, \xe2\x80\x9cto remove that veil which you\r\nwear. It seems out of harmony, someway, with the beauty and promise of\r\nthe day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl obediently yielded to her old companion\xe2\x80\x99s wish and\r\nunpinning the cumbersome, sombre drapery from her bonnet, folded it\r\nneatly and laid it upon the seat in front of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is better; far better!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a tone expressing\r\nunbounded relief. \xe2\x80\x9cNever put it on again, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d Octavie felt a little\r\nhurt; as if he wished to debar her from share and parcel in the burden\r\nof affliction which had been placed upon all of them. Again she drew\r\nforth the old muslin handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThey had left the big road and turned into a level plain which had\r\nformerly been an old meadow. There were clumps of thorn trees here and\r\nthere, gorgeous in their spring radiance. Some cattle were grazing off\r\nin the distance in spots where the grass was tall and luscious. At the\r\nfar end of the meadow was the towering lilac hedge, skirting the lane\r\nthat led to Judge Pillier\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the scent of its heavy blossoms\r\nmet them like a soft and tender embrace of welcome.\r\n\r\nAs they neared the house the old gentleman placed an arm around the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and turning her face up to him he said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not\r\nthink that on a day like this, miracles might happen? When the whole\r\nearth is vibrant with life, does it not seem to you, Octavie, that\r\nheaven might for once relent and give us back our dead?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke very\r\nlow, advisedly, and impressively. In his voice was an old quaver which\r\nwas not habitual and there was agitation in every line of his visage.\r\nShe gazed at him with eyes that were full of supplication and a certain\r\nterror of joy.\r\n\r\nThey had been driving through the lane with the towering hedge on one\r\nside and the open meadow on the other. The horses had somewhat\r\nquickened their lazy pace. As they turned into the avenue leading to\r\nthe house, a whole choir of feathered songsters fluted a sudden torrent\r\nof melodious greeting from their leafy hiding places.\r\n\r\nOctavie felt as if she had passed into a stage of existence which was\r\nlike a dream, more poignant and real than life. There was the old gray\r\nhouse with its sloping eaves. Amid the blur of green, and dimly, she\r\nsaw familiar faces and heard voices as if they came from far across the\r\nfields, and Edmond was holding her. Her dead Edmond; her living Edmond,\r\nand she felt the beating of his heart against her and the agonizing\r\nrapture of his kisses striving to awake her. It was as if the spirit of\r\nlife and the awakening spring had given back the soul to her youth and\r\nbade her rejoice.\r\n\r\nIt was many hours later that Octavie drew the locket from her bosom and\r\nlooked at Edmond with a questioning appeal in her glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the night before an engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the hurry of the\r\nencounter, and the retreat next day, I never missed it till the fight\r\nwas over. I thought of course I had lost it in the heat of the\r\nstruggle, but it was stolen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStolen,\xe2\x80\x9d she shuddered, and thought of the dead soldier with his face\r\nuplifted to the sky in an agony of supplication.\r\n\r\nEdmond said nothing; but he thought of his messmate; the one who had\r\nlain far back in the shadow; the one who had said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA REFLECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people are born with a vital and responsive energy. It not only\r\nenables them to keep abreast of the times; it qualifies them to furnish\r\nin their own personality a good bit of the motive power to the mad\r\npace. They are fortunate beings. They do not need to apprehend the\r\nsignificance of things. They do not grow weary nor miss step, nor do\r\nthey fall out of rank and sink by the wayside to be left contemplating\r\nthe moving procession.\r\n\r\nAh! that moving procession that has left me by the road-side! Its\r\nfantastic colors are more brilliant and beautiful than the sun on the\r\nundulating waters. What matter if souls and bodies are falling beneath\r\nthe feet of the ever-pressing multitude! It moves with the majestic\r\nrhythm of the spheres. Its discordant clashes sweep upward in one\r\nharmonious tone that blends with the music of other worlds\xe2\x80\x94to complete\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s orchestra.\r\n\r\nIt is greater than the stars\xe2\x80\x94that moving procession of human energy;\r\ngreater than the palpitating earth and the things growing thereon. Oh!\r\nI could weep at being left by the wayside; left with the grass and the\r\nclouds and a few dumb animals. True, I feel at home in the society of\r\nthese symbols of life\xe2\x80\x99s immutability. In the procession I should feel\r\nthe crushing feet, the clashing discords, the ruthless hands and\r\nstifling breath. I could not hear the rhythm of the march.\r\n\r\n_Salve!_ ye dumb hearts. Let us be still and wait by the roadside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AWAKENING AND SELECTED SHORT STORIES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 160-0.txt or 160-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/160/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
