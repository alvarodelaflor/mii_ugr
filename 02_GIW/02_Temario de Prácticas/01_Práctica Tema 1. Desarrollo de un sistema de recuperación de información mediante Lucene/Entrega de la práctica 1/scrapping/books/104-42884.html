<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this and the succeeding volume, we present various
documents (notably the <i>Relation</i> of Antonio Pigafetta) which
could not be obtained in season for publication in regular
chronological order, and which it has seemed advisable to insert as
addenda at this point.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>With the present volume is begun the publication of Antonio
Pigafetta&rsquo;s relation of the first circumnavigation of the
world&mdash;the greatest single achievement in all the history of sea
exploration and discovery. Written by a participant of the expedition,
Pigafetta&rsquo;s relation has a greater value than any other narrative
of the voyage. Its great value and the fact that it has never been
adequately presented to the English-speaking public have induced the
editors to insert this relation in the present series both in the
original Italian (rigidly adhering to and preserving all the
peculiarities of the original manuscript) and in English translation.
This relation is especially valuable for its descriptions of the
various peoples, countries, and products, of Oriental seas, and for its
vocabularies, as well as for its account of the first circumnavigation.
From its very nature, the relation has called for an unusual amount of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>annotation, which has been drawn freely from
various sources: chiefly Mosto&rsquo;s annotations in his publication
of Pigafetta&rsquo;s relation in Part V, volume iii, of the <i lang=
"it">Raccolta di documenti e studi</i>, published by the Royal
Columbian Commission of the fourth centenary of the discovery of
America under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction (Roma,
1894); Navarrete&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Col. de viages</i>, iv (Madrid,
1837); various publications of the Hakluyt Society; and F. H. H.
Guillemard&rsquo;s <i>Life of Ferdinand Magellan</i> (New York, 1891).
The publication of the original Italian and the English, page for page,
renders it necessary to place the annotations at the end of the volume
instead of in footnote as hitherto. The various charts of the Italian
manuscript are all presented in facsimile in the course of the work. In
order that the various peculiarities of the manuscript might be
preserved, it has been necessary to specially design and cast certain
characters that appear in Pigafetta&rsquo;s narrative. None of these
characters have been reproduced by Mosto, who also writes out all
abbreviations. Throughout we have aimed to present the document as it
exists in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana (even to the spacing of words) with
the exception that paragraphs in the manuscript begin with a hanging
indention and usually end with a series of dots and dashes. A brief
synopsis of the relation follows.</p>
<p>After a brief dedication to the grand master of the Hospitaler
knights of Rhodes or Malta, as they were called later, and of which
order he is a member, Pigafetta relates that, being at Barcelona in
1519 with the papal legate, he first hears of the expedition about to
set out under Magalh&atilde;es. Being <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>desirous of seeing the
world, he gains permission to accompany the expedition, and soon joins
the fleet at Seville, whence it is to depart. Magalh&atilde;es, as a
wise commander, issues his instructions to the various commanders of
the vessels ere port is left, so that they may keep together in the
unknown seas before them, and that they may act in harmony.</p>
<p>Setting sail from Seville on August 10, 1519, the fleet of five
small vessels starts on its long journey amid salvos of artillery. At
the mouth of the Guadalquivir, San Lucar de Barrameda, they anchor
until September 20, when setting sail once more, they make for the
Canaries, which are reached September 26. There they reprovision and
taking their departure on October 3, coast southward along Africa amid
alternating calms and violent storms (cheered however by the welcome
apparition of St. Elmo&rsquo;s fire, which promises them safety), until
they cross the line. Thereupon taking a general westerly course, the
cape of St. Augustine on the Brazilian coast is soon sighted. The fresh
provisions, so essential to sea voyages, are procured on the coast of
Brazil, where occurs the first communication with the natives, with
whom wonderful bargains are made. Those Indians, cannibals though they
be, and whom Pigafetta describes briefly (not failing to inscribe some
of their language) receive the mariners hospitably, and thinking that
the latter are come to remain among them, build them a house. But after
a stay of eighteen days, the sails are again trimmed toward the south,
and descending the coast, Magalh&atilde;es anchors next at the Rio de
la Plata which had formerly proved so disastrous to Juan de Solis and
his men. Unable here to hold converse with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>anthropophagous natives, who flee at their
approach, the fleet retakes its course, anchoring at two islands where
many sea-wolves and penguins are taken, and thus fresh food obtained.
The next anchorage is at the famous Bay of St. Julian along the
desolate Patagonian coast, where for five months they winter. For two
months not an individual is seen, but one day they gain their first
sight of the Patagonians, whose huge bulk strikes all with surprise,
and who are held as giants. Amicable relations are entered into with
various of these wandering Indians, and finally Magalh&atilde;es, with
the taste for the wonderful that characterized his period, as strongly,
or more strongly than our own, determines to capture two of them to
take back to Spain as novelties. His ruse is successful, but an attempt
to induce the wife of one of the Indians to go to the ship fails. Very
interesting are these giants to the curious Pigafetta, and to him is
due the earliest description of their manners and customs and the
earliest specimens of their language. The two captured giants are
placed in separate vessels, but unfortunately both die ere reaching the
end of the journey, one in the deserting ship &ldquo;San
Antonio,&rdquo; and the other in Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s own ship, the
&ldquo;Trinidad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the five months at that port &ldquo;many things happened
there.&rdquo; Shortly after entering the port, the most critical moment
of all Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s life comes, and one which he has
perhaps, dreaded from the beginning of the expedition. This is the
mutiny headed by Juan de Cartagena, captain of one of the vessels, and
other malcontents, who hate Magalh&atilde;es because he is a
Portuguese. The latter, however, proves equal to the emergency, and by
his prompt <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>action and the punishments tempered by mercy that
he inflicts, quiets the trouble. Jo&atilde;o Serr&atilde;o, captain of
the &ldquo;Santiago&rdquo; is sent to explore the coast, but is
shipwrecked, although all the crew are saved. Their rescue (not well
told by Pigafetta) is a thrilling and arduous matter, and calls into
play the endurance of men already tried by misfortune and buffetings
with Nature.</p>
<p>With the fleet reduced to four vessels, the mariners leave port St.
Julian and proceeding along the coast, anchor at the river of Sardines,
where stormy weather threatens a disastrous end to the expedition. A
stay of two months is made, during which the ships are enabled to lay
in a good supply of provisions, wood, and water. Before leaving that
river, the crews (for Magalh&atilde;es looks after the spiritual
welfare of his men) confess and take communion. Then resuming the
voyage, the great object of the first half of the expedition is
attained, namely, the discovery of the strait, which occurs October 21,
1520. &ldquo;That strait is one hundred and ten leguas ... long, and it
is one-half legua broad, more or less.&rdquo; Its discovery is due to
the indomitable energy and endurance of Magalh&atilde;es, and his
certain knowledge (probably overstated by Pigafetta) of its existence.
Continuing, Pigafetta briefly narrates the passage through the strait,
and the desertion of the &ldquo;San Antonio,&rdquo; which returns to
Spain, after putting the captain, Alvaro de Mesquita, a relative of
Magalh&atilde;es, in irons; for the pilot, a Portuguese named Esteban
Gomez, is jealous of Magalh&atilde;es, as the latter&rsquo;s expedition
has destroyed ambitious plans of his own. The other three ships,
leaving letters and signals in the strait, in case the &ldquo;San
Antonio&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>tries to regain them, proceeds on its way,
debouching from the strait November 28. Then begins a long voyage over
the trackless Pacific &ldquo;in truth ... very pacific;&rdquo; and the
three ships sail on steadily for three and two-thirds months without
being able to reprovision. To the horrors of famine are added the
sufferings of the dread scurvy. Pigafetta, whose curiosity is always
alert and active, and who remains well, diverts himself with talking to
the Patagonian, who is finally baptized, but who is one of those to
die. In the vast stretch from the strait to the Ladrones (first seen by
them of all Europeans), only two islands, both desert, are sighted, and
those, since they are unable to find anchorage there, are called the
&ldquo;Unfortunate Isles.&rdquo; Pigafetta mentions the southern
constellation <i>Crux</i> and the star clouds since called after
Magalh&atilde;es. His geographical information, as one might expect, is
not always accurate, for he places Cipangu (Japan) in the open Pacific.
Thoughts of relief that come upon sighting various islands (which they
called the Ladrones because of the thievishness of the inhabitants) are
quickly dissipated by the hostility there encountered. So bold are
these natives (whose appearance, life, and customs, Pigafetta describes
briefly), that they even steal the ship&rsquo;s boat from the stern of
the &ldquo;Trinidad,&rdquo; thus necessitating a raid into one of the
islands, where some of the natives are killed, and some houses burned,
but the boat recovered.</p>
<p>On March 16, 1521, the first of the Philippines (by them called the
archipelago of San Lazaro) to be seen by Europeans, is sighted. Anchor
is cast at a small desert island called Humunu, (but which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>the
mariners call &ldquo;The watering-place of good signs&rdquo; because
the first traces of gold are found there), near Samar, where two tents
are quickly set up for the sick, whom Magalh&atilde;es himself tends
with solicitude. March 18, they gain their first acquaintance with the
natives, who prove hospitable, and promise fresh provisions. These are
brought on the twenty-second of March, and the Europeans have their
first sight of a tattooed Visayan chief, who, as well as his men, is
decked out in gold ornaments. After a week&rsquo;s stay, the ships
again set sail, Pigafetta almost coming to an untimely end by slipping
over the side of the vessel while fishing, but happily saved by the aid
of &ldquo;that fount of mercy,&rdquo; the Virgin.</p>
<p>March 28, anchor is cast at the island of Limasaua (Mazava), where
Enrique, the Malaccan slave of Magalh&atilde;es, serves as interpreter.
Amicable relations are speedily entered into and confirmed by the
Malayan rite of blood brotherhood. The king of Limasaua, and his
brother, the king of certain districts in Mindanao, prove most helpful,
and are completely won over by a judicious presentation of gifts.
Greatly are the natives impressed by the power of the new comers, as
seen in the artillery and armor, and their astonishment is increased
when Magalh&atilde;es relates his course to their islands and the
discovery of the strait.</p>
<p>On Good Friday, Pigafetta and a companion visit the natives ashore,
where they spend the night in the king&rsquo;s palace, a typical
Visayan house raised aloft on supports and thatched with nipa. Here the
various ceremonies that he witnesses impress Pigafetta, and his
companion, cast in coarser mould than he, becomes intoxicated.
Pigafetta, always interested in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>the language of the new peoples
whom he meets, writes down certain of their words, whereat they are
greatly astonished. He records that he &ldquo;ate meat on Holy Friday,
for I could not help myself.&rdquo; On Easter Sunday, the natives are
deeply impressed by the mass that is celebrated ashore, and the cross
which is planted in the highest part of the island, and which they
promise to adore.</p>
<p>The limited amount of food in Limasaua, which is used only as a
place of recreation by the two kings, who go there to visit one another
and hunt, leads Magalh&atilde;es to seek a more abundant harbor. Among
the places pointed out where food is abundant is the island of
Ceb&uacute;, and there Magalh&atilde;es determines to go, &ldquo;for so
did his unhappy fate will.&rdquo; After a seven days&rsquo; stay at
Limasaua, the course is laid to Ceb&uacute; under the pilotage of the
king of Limasaua, who is finally taken aboard the
&ldquo;Trinidad&rdquo; as his vessel is unable to keep up with the
swifter-moving European vessels. Entering the port of Ceb&uacute; on
April 7, amid the thunder of their guns, the settlement is thrown into
consternation, but the Malaccan being sent ashore reassures them of his
master&rsquo;s good intentions, whom he proclaims to be a
&ldquo;captain of the greatest king and prince in the world,&rdquo; who
&ldquo;was going to discover Malucho,&rdquo; but hearing of the great
fame of the king of Ceb&uacute;, wishes trade with him. The king of
Ceb&uacute; is willing to accord friendship to the Europeans, but asks
a tribute, as it is the custom for all visitors to pay it to him. But
no tribute will be paid him, asserts Enrique, and the king, at the
advice of a Moro merchant who has heard of the deeds of the Portuguese
along Malacca and the Indian coast, and confuses the strangers with
them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>until undeceived by Enrique (who declares them to
be much greater than the Portuguese), expresses his willingness to make
friendship with Magalh&atilde;es. With the help of the friendly king of
Limasaua, peace is made according to Malay rites, and gifts exchanged.
Magalh&atilde;es, deeply religious, in common with many of his age,
early seeks to lure the natives of Ceb&uacute; to holy baptism, by
presenting to them its most attractive side, and promising the king if
he becomes a Christian, a suit of armor; but they must become willing
converts, and not for the hope of gain or for fear. The peace is more
firmly cemented by the visit of Pigafetta and a companion to the king,
where they witness ceremonies similar to those of Limasaua, and where
gifts are bestowed upon the king and some others. They also visit the
house of the prince apparent, where they hear their first concert of
Visayan music and see a native dance. On the following Wednesday two of
the crew are buried ashore on consecrated ground with as much pomp as
possible.</p>
<p>Trading is instituted by carrying a quantity of merchandise ashore,
the safety of which is assured by the king. Those people are found to
have weights and measures for their trading; and besides their gongs, a
flute-like instrument. Their houses are entered by ladders. On Friday
begins the trading, gold being given for metals and large articles, and
food for the smaller wares. The good bargains obtained by the
Europeans, would have been materially less and the trade spoiled
forever had it not been for Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s watchfulness, for
so eager are the men at the sight of the gold, that they would have
given almost anything for it. On the following Sunday, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>the king
and his chief men, and the queen and many women, are baptized and given
European names, and ere the week closes all the Cebuans have become
Christians, as well as some from neighboring islands. The queen at her
earnest request, is given a small image of the Christ child, the same
afterward recovered by Legazpi, and still held in the greatest of
reverence at Ceb&uacute;. The opposition of certain chiefs to the king
of Ceb&uacute; is satisfactorily ended by the inducements and threats
of Magalh&atilde;es. The latter swears to be faithful in his friendship
with the natives, who likewise swear allegiance to the king of Spain.
However, the natives are loath to destroy their idols, according to
their promise, and Magalh&atilde;es finds them still sacrificing to
them for the cure of sickness. Substituting therefore the assurance
that the new faith will work a cure, in lieu of which he offers his
head, the sick man (who is the prince&rsquo;s brother and the bravest
and wisest man in the island) is miraculously cured. Thereupon many
idols are burned amid great demonstrations. Vivid descriptions are
given of the people and their customs and ceremonies, especially those
of sacrifice and mourning.</p>
<p>April 20, a chief from the neighboring island of Mactan sends a
small present to Magalh&atilde;es, with the request to aid him with a
boat load of men against the chief Cilapulapu, who refuses allegiance
to Spain. Magalh&atilde;es in his ardor, and notwithstanding the
remonstrances of his friends, leads three boat loads of men (sixty in
all) to the island, where having ordered the king of Ceb&uacute; to be
a witness of the battle only, he engages the natives. Disastrous indeed
does that day prove, for beset by multitudes of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>foes,
the Europeans are compelled to retreat, and the retreat becomes a rout,
the personal bravery of Magalh&atilde;es and a few of his closest
friends only saving the men from almost complete massacre. Recognizing
the leader, the natives make their greatest efforts against him, and
finally he is killed while knee deep in the water, but after all the
others are saved. Pigafetta&rsquo;s lament is tragic and sorrowful;
they &ldquo;killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true
guide.&rdquo; Insolent in their victory, the natives refuse to give up
the body of the slain leader at the request of the king of Ceb&uacute;.
The Europeans stunned by the loss of their leader, withdraw their
merchandise and guards to the ship, and make preparations for
departure. Duarte Barbosa and Jo&atilde;o de Serr&atilde;o are chosen
leaders. The second act in the drama follows speedily. The slave
Enrique, enraged at a severe reprimand and threats by Barbosa,
conspires with the king of Ceb&uacute;; with the result that twenty-six
men, including both of the leaders, are murdered at a banquet on May 1,
to which the king invites them. Jo&atilde;o Carvalho, deaf to the
entreaties of Jo&atilde;o Serr&atilde;o, his comrade, and anxious to
become leader, sails away leaving him to his death. Pigafetta names the
products of Ceb&uacute;, and gives a valuable vocabulary of Visayan
words, most of which are still in use by those people.</p>
<p>By mutual consent, the three vessels proceed to Bohol, where the
&ldquo;Concepcion&rdquo; is burned, as there are too few men left to
work all three ships; although its supplies and all else possible are
transferred to the &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trinidad.&rdquo;
Then, cruising along, they put in at Mindanao where Pigafetta goes
ashore alone, after the king has made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>blood friendship at the
ships. There they hear of Luz&oacute;n, where the Chinese trade
annually. Departing from Mindanao, they anchor at Cagayan Sulu, a penal
settlement for Borneo, where the blowpipe and poisoned arrows are used,
and the daggers adorned with gold. The next anchorage is at Paragua,
although before reaching that island, the men have been tempted to
abandon the ships because of hunger. There the rice is cooked under the
fire in bamboos and is better than that cooked in earthen pots. Those
people raise fighting cocks and bet on their favorite birds. Ten
leagues from Paragua is the great island of Borneo, whither the ships
next go, and anchor at the city of Brunei, which is built over the
water, and contains twenty-five thousand fires. Hospitably received by
eight chiefs who visit the ships, they enter into relations with the
Borneans. Seven men go as ambassadors to visit the king, and bear
presents to him and the chief men. Here some of the grandeurs of an
oriental court are spread before their eyes, which Pigafetta briefly
describes. The strangers are graciously given permission to take on
fresh supplies of food, water, and wood, and to trade at pleasure.
Later actions of the Borneans cause the men of the ships to fear
treachery, and forestalling any action by that people, they attack a
number of junks near them, and capture four. Among the captives is the
son of the king of Luz&oacute;n, who is the chief captain in Borneo,
and whom Carvalho allows to escape, without consulting the others, for
a large sum of gold. His action in so doing reacts on himself, for the
king refuses to allow two men who were ashore and Carvalho&rsquo;s own
son (born of a native woman in Brazil) to return to the ships, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>they are left behind. The Borneans and their junks
are described. They use porcelain dishes which are made from a fine
white clay that is buried under ground for fifty years in order to
refine it, and inherited from father to son. Camphor is obtained there,
and the island is so large that it can be circumnavigated by a prau
only in three months&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>On leaving Borneo, a number of prisoners from the captured junks are
kept, among them three women whom Carvalho ostensibly retains as
presents for the queen of Spain, but in reality for himself. Happily
escaping from the point on which one of the ships has become grounded,
and the fear of explosion from a candle which is snuffed into a barrel
of powder, the ships anchor at a point of Borneo, where for forty-two
days, the men are busied in repairing, calking, and furnishing the
vessels. The journey is resumed back toward Paragua, the governor of a
district of that island being captured on the way; with whom, however,
they enter into friendly relations. Thence the ships cruise along
between Cagayan, Jol&oacute;, and Mindanao, capturing a native boat
from Maingdanao of the latter island, from the captive occupants of
which they learn news of the Moluccas. Pushing on amid stormy weather,
they anchor at the island of Sarangani, just south of Mindanao; and
thence proceed in a generally southerly direction amid many islands
until the Moluccas are reached, and they enter the harbor of Tidore on
Friday, November 8, 1521, after twenty-seven months, less two days,
since their departure from Spain.</p>
<p>At Tidore a warm welcome awaits them from the king, who is a
powerful astrologer and has been expecting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>their
arrival. He promises them as many cloves as they wish, even offering to
go outside his island, contrary to the practice of kings, to provide
them the sooner; in return for his services hoping for their aid in his
designs for power in the Moluccas, especially against the king of
Ternate. There they learn that Francisco Serr&atilde;o, the great
friend of Magalh&atilde;es, has perished some eight months previously
from poison administered by the king of Tidore, whom he had visited,
because he had aided the king of Ternate against Tidore. This
Serr&atilde;o, says Pigafetta, was the cause of Magalh&atilde;es
undertaking his expedition, and he had been in the Moluccas for ten
years, for so long ago had Portugal discovered those islands. The
efforts of the Ternatans to gain the new strangers fail, for they are
already pledged to the king of Tidore. On November 12, a house is built
ashore and on the thirteenth the merchandise is carried there, among it
being that captured with the various junks at and near Borneo. The
sailors are somewhat careless of their bargains for they are in haste
to return to Spain. The king continues his kindness, and to humor him,
as he is a Mahometan, all the swine in the boats are killed. This
relation will be concluded in <span class="sc">Vol. XXXIV</span>.</p>

<p class="first">Inasmuch as, most illustrious and excellent Lord,
there are many curious persons who not only take pleasure in knowing
and hearing the great and wonderful things which God has permitted me
to see and suffer during my long and dangerous voyage, hereto appended,
but who also wish to know the means and manners and paths that I have
taken in making that voyage [<i>literally</i>: &ldquo;in going
thither&rdquo;]; and who do not lend that entire faith to the end
unless they have a perfect assurance of the beginning: therefore, your
most illustrious Lordship must know that, finding myself, in the year
of the nativity of our Savior MCCCCCXIX in Spagnia, in the court of the
most serene king of the Romans,<sup><a href="#n5" id="r5" name=
"r5">5</a></sup> with the reverend Monsignor, Francesco Chieregato,
then apostolic protonotary and nuncio of Pope Leo X of holy memory (and
who has since become bishop of Aprutino and prince of
Teramo),<sup><a href="#n6" id="r6" name="r6">6</a></sup> and having
learned many things from many books that I had read, as well as from
various persons,<sup><a href="#n7" id="r7" name="r7">7</a></sup> who
discussed the great and marvelous things of the Ocean Sea with his
Lordship, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>I determined, by the good favor of his
C&aelig;sarean Majesty, and of his Lordship abovesaid, to experience
and to go to see those things for myself, so that I might be able
thereby to satisfy myself somewhat, and so that I might be able to gain
some renown for later posterity.<sup><a href="#n8" id="r8" name=
"r8">8</a></sup> Having heard that a fleet composed of five vessels had
been fitted out in the city of Siviglia for the purpose of going to
discover the spicery in the islands of Maluco, under command of
Captain-general Fernando de Magaglianes,<sup><a href="#n9" id="r9"
name="r9">9</a></sup> a Portuguese gentleman, comendador of the [Order
of] Santo Jacobo de la Spada [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;St. James of the
Sword&rdquo;],<sup><a href="#n10" id="r10" name="r10">10</a></sup>
[who] had many times traversed the Ocean Sea in various directions,
whence he had acquired great praise, I set out from the city of
Barsalonna, where his Majesty was then residing, bearing many letters
in my favor. I went by ship as far as Malega, where, taking the
highroad, I went overland to Siviglia. Having been there about three
full months, waiting for the said fleet to be set in order for the
departure,<sup><a href="#n11" id="r11" name="r11">11</a></sup> finally,
as your most excellent Lordship will learn below, we commenced our
voyage under most happy auspices. And inasmuch as when I was in Ytalia
and going to see his Holiness, Pope Clement,<sup><a href="#n12" id=
"r12" name="r12">12</a></sup> you by your grace showed yourself very
kind and good to me at Monteroso, and told me that you would be greatly
pleased if I would write down for you all those things which I had seen
and suffered during my voyage; and although I have had little
opportunity, yet I have tried to satisfy your desire according to my
poor ability; therefore, I offer you, in this little book of mine, all
my vigils, hardships, and wanderings, begging you, although
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=

deign to skim through it, by which I shall be enabled to receive a not
slight remuneration from your most illustrious Lordship, to whose good
favor I consign and commend myself.<sup><a href="#n13" id="r13" name=

<p class="first">The captain-general having resolved to make so long a
voyage through the Ocean Sea, where furious winds and great storms are
always reigning, but not desiring to make known to any of his men the
voyage that he was about to make, so that they might not be cast down
at the thought of doing so great and extraordinary a deed, as he did
accomplish with the aid of God (the captains who accompanied him, hated
him exceedingly, I know not why, unless because he was a Portuguese,
and they Spaniards), with the desire to conclude what he promised under
oath to the emperor, Don Carlo, king of Spagnia, prescribed the
following orders and gave them to all the pilots and masters of his
ships, so that the ships might not become separated from one another
during the storms and night.<sup><a href="#n14" id="r14" name=
"r14">14</a></sup> These were [to the effect] that he would always
precede the other ships at night, and they were to follow his ship
which would have a large torch of wood, which they call
<i>farol</i>.<sup><a href="#n15" id="r15" name="r15">15</a></sup> He
always carried that <i>farol</i> set at the poop of his ship as a
signal so that they might always follow him. Another light was made by
means of a lantern or by means of a piece of wicking made from a rush
and called <i>sparto</i> rope<sup><a href="#n16" id="r16" name=
"r16">16</a></sup> which is well beaten in the water, and then dried in
the sun or in the smoke&mdash;a most excellent material for such use.
They were to answer him so that he might know by that signal whether
all of the ships were coming together. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>If he showed two lights
besides that of the <i>farol</i>, they were to veer or take another
tack, [doing this] when the wind was not favorable or suitable for us
to continue on our way, or when he wished to sail slowly. If he showed
three lights, they were to lower away the bonnet-sail, which is a part
of the sail that is fastened below the mainsail, when the weather is
suitable for making better time. It is lowered so that it may be easier
to furl the mainsail when it is struck hastily during a sudden
squall.<sup><a href="#n17" id="r17" name="r17">17</a></sup> If he
showed four lights, they were to strike all the sails;<sup><a href=
"#n18" id="r18" name="r18">18</a></sup> after which he showed a signal
by one light, [which meant] that he was standing still. If he showed a
greater number of lights, or fired a mortar, it was a signal of land or
of shoals.<sup><a href="#n19" id="r19" name="r19">19</a></sup> Then he
showed four lights when he wished to have the sails set full, so that
they might always sail in his wake by the torch on the poop. When he
desired to set the bonnet-sail, he showed three lights.<sup><a href=
"#n20" id="r20" name="r20">20</a></sup> When he desired to alter his
course, he showed two;<sup><a href="#n21" id="r21" name=
"r21">21</a></sup> and then if he wished to ascertain whether all the
ships were following and whether they were coming together, he showed
one light, so that each one of the ships might do the same and reply to
him. Three watches were set nightly: the first at the beginning of the
night; the second, which is called the midnight,<sup><a href="#n22" id=
"r22" name="r22">22</a></sup> and the third at the end [of the night].
All of the men in the ships were divided into three parts: the first
was the division of the captain or boatswain, those two alternating
nightly; the second, of either the pilot or boatswain&rsquo;s mate; and
the third, of the master.<sup><a href="#n23" id="r23" name=
"r23">23</a></sup> Thus did the captain-general order that all the
ships observe the above signals and watches, so that their voyage might
be more propitious.<sup><a href="#n24" id="r24" name="r24">24</a></sup>

<p class="first">On Monday morning, August x, St. Lawrence&rsquo;s day,
in the year abovesaid, the fleet, having been supplied with all the
things necessary for the sea,<sup><a href="#n25" id="r25" name=
"r25">25</a></sup> (and counting those of every nationality, we were
two hundred and thirty-seven men), made ready to leave the harbor of
Siviglia.<sup><a href="#n26" id="r26" name="r26">26</a></sup>
Discharging many pieces of artillery, the ships held their
forestaysails to the wind, and descended the river Betis, at present
called Gadalcavir, passing by a village called Gioan dal Farax, once a
large Moorish settlement. In the midst of it was once a bridge that
crossed the said river, and led to Siviglia. Two columns of that bridge
have remained even to this day at the bottom of the water, and when
ships sail by there, they need men who know the location of the columns
thoroughly, so that the ships may not strike against them. They must
also be passed when the river is highest with the tide; as must also
many other villages along the river, which has not sufficient depth [of
itself] for ships that are laden and which are not very large to pass.
Then the ships reached another village called Coria, and passed by many
other villages along the river, until they came to a castle of the duke
of Medina Cidonia, called San Lucar, which is a port by which to enter
the Ocean Sea.<sup><a href="#n27" id="r27" name="r27">27</a></sup> It
is in an east and west direction with the cape of Sanct Vincent, which
lies in 37 degrees of latitude, and x leguas from the said
port.<sup><a href="#n28" id="r28" name="r28">28</a></sup> From Siviglia
to this point [<i>i.e.</i>, San Lucar], it is 17 or 20 leguas by
river.<sup><a href="#n29" id="r29" name="r29">29</a></sup> Some days
after, the captain-general, with his other captains, descended the
river in the small boats belonging to their ships. We remained there
for a considerable number of days in order to finish<sup><a href="#n30"

things that it needed. Every day we went ashore to hear mass in a
village called Nostra Dona de Baremeda [our Lady of Barrameda], near
San Lucar. Before the departure, the captain-general wished all the men
to confess, and would not allow any<sup><a href="#n31" id="r31" name=

<p class="first">At midnight of Monday, October three, the sails were
trimmed toward the south,<sup><a href="#n39" id="r39" name=
"r39">39</a></sup> and we took to the open Ocean Sea, passing between
Cape Verde and its islands in 14 and one-half degrees. Thus for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>many days did we sail along the coast of Ghinea,
or Ethiopia, where there is a mountain called Siera Leona, which lies
in 8 degrees of latitude, with contrary winds, calms, and rains without
wind, until we reached the equinoctial line, having sixty days of
continual rain.<sup><a href="#n40" id="r40" name="r40">40</a></sup>
Contrary to the opinion of the ancients,<sup><a href="#n41" id="r41"
name="r41">41</a></sup> before we reached the line many furious squalls
of wind, and currents of water struck us head on in 14 degrees. As we
could not advance, and in order that the ships might not be
wrecked,<sup><a href="#n42" id="r42" name="r42">42</a></sup> all the
sails were struck; and in this manner did we wander hither and yon on
the sea, waiting for the tempest to cease, for it was very
furious.<sup><a href="#n43" id="r43" name="r43">43</a></sup> When it
rained there was no wind. When the sun shone, it was calm. Certain
large fishes called <i>tiburoni</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, sharks] came to the
side of the ships. They have terrible teeth, and whenever they find men
in the sea they devour them. We caught many of them with iron
hooks,<sup><a href="#n44" id="r44" name="r44">44</a></sup> although
they are not good to eat unless they are small, and even then they are
not very good. During those storms the holy body, that is to say St.
Elmo, appeared to us many times, in light&mdash;among other times on an
exceedingly dark night,<sup><a href="#n45" id="r45" name=
"r45">45</a></sup> with the brightness of a blazing torch, on the
maintop, where he stayed for about two hours or more, to our
consolation, for we were weeping. When that blessed light was about to
leave us, so dazzling was the brightness that it cast into our eyes,
that we all remained for more than an eighth of an hour<sup><a href=
"#n46" id="r46" name="r46">46</a></sup> blinded and calling for mercy.
And truly when we thought that we were dead men, the sea suddenly grew
calm.<sup><a href="#n47" id="r47" name="r47">47</a></sup></p>

<p class="first">That land of Verzin is wealthier and larger than
Spagnia, Fransa, and Italia,<sup><a href="#n57" id="r57" name=
"r57">57</a></sup> put together, and belongs to the king of Portugalo.
The people of that land are not Christians, and have no manner of
worship. They live according to the dictates of nature,<sup><a href=
"#n58" id="r58" name="r58">58</a></sup> and reach an age of one hundred
and twenty-five and one hundred and forty years.<sup><a href="#n59" id=
"r59" name="r59">59</a></sup> They go naked, both men and women. They
live in certain long houses which they call <i>boii</i><sup><a href=
"#n60" id="r60" name="r60">60</a></sup> and sleep in cotton hammocks
called <i>amache</i>, which are fastened in those houses by each end to
large beams. A fire is built on the ground under those hammocks. In
each one of those <i>boii</i>, there are one hundred men with their
wives and children,<sup><a href="#n61" id="r61" name="r61">61</a></sup>
and they make a great racket. They have boats called canoes made of one
single huge tree,<sup><a href="#n62" id="r62" name="r62">62</a></sup>
hollowed out by the use of stone hatchets. Those people employ stones
as we do iron, as they have no iron. Thirty or forty men occupy one of
those boats. They paddle with blades like the shovels of a furnace, and
thus, black, naked, and shaven, they resemble, when paddling, the
inhabitants of the Stygian marsh.<sup><a href="#n63" id="r63" name=
"r63">63</a></sup> Men and women are as well proportioned as we. They
eat the human flesh of their enemies, not because it is good, but
because it is a certain established custom. That custom, which is
mutual, was begun by an old woman,<sup><a href="#n64" id="r64" name=
"r64">64</a></sup> who had but one son who was killed by his enemies.
In return some days later, that old woman&rsquo;s friends captured one
of the company who had killed her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>son, and brought him to the
place of her abode. She seeing him, and remembering her son, ran upon
him like an infuriated bitch, and bit him on one shoulder. Shortly
afterward he escaped to his own people, whom he told that they had
tried to eat him, showing them [in proof] the marks on his shoulder.
Whomever the latter captured afterward at any time from the former they
ate, and the former did the same to the latter, so that such a custom
has sprung up in this way. They do not eat the bodies all at once, but
every one cuts off a piece, and carries it to his house, where he
smokes it. Then every week,<sup><a href="#n65" id="r65" name=
"r65">65</a></sup> he cuts off a small bit, which he eats thus smoked
with his other food to remind him of his enemies. The above was told me
by the pilot, Johane Carnagio,<sup><a href="#n66" id="r66" name=
"r66">66</a></sup> who came with us, and who had lived in that land for
four years. Those people paint the whole body and the face in a
wonderful manner with fire in various fashions, as do the women also.
The men are [are: <i>doublet in original manuscript</i>] smooth shaven
and have no beard, for they pull it out. They clothe themselves in a
dress made of parrot feathers, with large round arrangements at their
buttocks made from the largest feathers, and it is a ridiculous sight.
Almost all the people, except the women and children,<sup><a href=
"#n67" id="r67" name="r67">67</a></sup> have three holes pierced in the
lower lip, where they carry round stones, one finger or thereabouts in
length and hanging down outside. Those people are not entirely black,
but of a dark brown color. They keep the privies uncovered, and the
body is without hair,<sup><a href="#n68" id="r68" name=
"r68">68</a></sup> while both men and women always go naked. Their king
is called cacich [<i>i.e.</i>, cacique]. They have an infinite number
of parrots, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>and gave us 8 or 10 for one mirror: and little
monkeys that look like lions, only [they are] yellow, and very
beautiful.<sup><a href="#n69" id="r69" name="r69">69</a></sup> They
make round white [loaves of] bread from the marrowy substance of trees,
which is not very good, and is found between the wood and the bark and
resembles buttermilk curds.<sup><a href="#n70" id="r70" name=
"r70">70</a></sup> They have swine which have their navels
[<i>lombelico</i>] on their backs,<sup><a href="#n71" id="r71" name=
"r71">71</a></sup> and large birds with beaks like spoons and no
tongues.<sup><a href="#n72" id="r72" name="r72">72</a></sup> The men
gave us one or two of their young daughters as slaves for one hatchet
or one large knife, but they would not give us their wives in exchange
for anything at all. The women will not shame their husbands under any
considerations whatever, and as was told us, refuse to consent to their
husbands by day, but only by night.<sup><a href="#n73" id="r73" name=
"r73">73</a></sup> The women cultivate the fields, and carry all their
food from the mountains in panniers or baskets on the head or fastened
to the head.<sup><a href="#n74" id="r74" name="r74">74</a></sup> But
they are always accompanied by their husbands, who are armed only with
a bow of brazil-wood or of black palm-wood, and a bundle of cane
arrows, doing this because they are jealous [of their wives]. The women
carry their children hanging in a cotton net from their necks. I omit
other particulars, in order not to be tedious. Mass was said twice on
shore, during which those people remained on their knees with so great
contrition and with clasped hands raised aloft, that it was an
exceeding great pleasure<sup><a href="#n75" id="r75" name=
"r75">75</a></sup> to behold them. They built us a house as they
thought that we were going to stay with them for some time, and at our
departure they cut a great quantity of brazil-wood [<i>verzin</i>] to
give us.<sup><a href="#n76" id="r76" name="r76">76</a></sup> It had
been about two months since it had rained in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>that
land, and when we reached that port, it happened to rain, whereupon
they said that we came from the sky and that we had brought the rain
with us.<sup><a href="#n77" id="r77" name="r77">77</a></sup> Those
people could be converted easily to the faith of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="first">At first those people thought that the small boats
were the children of the ships, and that the latter gave birth to them
when they were lowered into the sea from the ships, and when they were
lying so alongside the ships (as is the custom), they believed that the
ships were nursing them.<sup><a href="#n78" id="r78" name=

flagship, where I was, for no other purpose than to seek what chance
might offer. While there and waiting, she cast her eyes upon the
master&rsquo;s room, and saw a nail longer than one&rsquo;s finger.
Picking it up very delightedly and neatly, she thrust it through the
lips of her vagina [<i>natura</i>], and bending down low immediately
departed, the captain-general and I having seen that
action.<sup><a href="#n79" id="r79" name="r79">79</a></sup></p>

on our way, we went as far as 34 and one-third degrees<sup><a href=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=

called Canibali [<i>i.e.</i>, cannibals], who eat human flesh. One of
them, in stature almost a giant, came to the flagship in order to
assure [the safety of] the others his friends.<sup><a href="#n82" id=

in the ship, the others carried away their possessions from the place
where they were living into the interior, for fear of us. Seeing that,
we landed one hundred men in order to have speech and converse with
them, or to capture one of them by force. They fled, and in fleeing
they took so large a step that we although running could not gain on
their steps. There are seven islands in that river, in the largest of
which precious gems are found. That place is called the cape of Santa
Maria, and it was formerly thought that one passed thence to the sea of
Sur, that is to say the South Sea, but nothing further was ever
discovered. Now the name is not [given to] a cape, but [to] a river,
with a mouth 17 leguas in width.<sup><a href="#n83" id="r83" name=

men, who were going to discover lands like us, were formerly eaten at

islands full of geese and sea-wolves.<sup><a href="#n85" id="r85" name=

reckoned; in one hour we loaded the five ships [with them]. Those geese
are black and have all their feathers alike both on body and wings.
They do not fly, and live on fish. They were so fat that it was not
necessary to pluck them but to skin them. Their beak is like that of a
crow. Those sea-wolves are of various colors, and as large as a calf,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=

round, and large teeth. They have no legs but only feet with small
nails attached to the body, which resemble our hands, and between their
fingers the same kind of skin as the geese. They would be very fierce
if they could run. They swim, and live on fish. At that place the ships
suffered a very great storm, during which the three holy bodies
appeared to us many times, that is to say, St. Elmo, St. Nicholas, and
St. Clara, whereupon the storm quickly ceased.</p>

<td class="second">
<p class="first">Leaving that place, we finally reached 49 and one-half
degrees toward the Antarctic Pole. As it was winter, the ships entered
a safe port to winter.<sup><a href="#n86" id="r86" name=
"r86">86</a></sup> We passed two months in that place without seeing
anyone. One day we suddenly saw a naked man of giant stature on the
shore of the port, dancing,<sup><a href="#n87" id="r87" name=
"r87">87</a></sup> singing, and throwing dust on his head. The
captain-general sent one of our men to the giant so that he might
perform the same, actions as a sign of peace. Having done that, the man
led the giant to an islet into the presence of the captain-general.
When the giant was in the captain-general&rsquo;s and our presence, he
marveled greatly,<sup><a href="#n88" id="r88" name="r88">88</a></sup>
and made signs with one finger raised upward, believing that we had
come from the sky. He was so tall that we reached only to his waist,
and he was well proportioned. His face was large and painted red all
over while about his eyes he was painted yellow; and he had two hearts
painted on the middle of his cheeks. His scanty hair was painted
white.<sup><a href="#n89" id="r89" name="r89">89</a></sup> He was
dressed in the skins of animals skilfully sewn together. That animal
has a head and ears as large as those of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>mule, a
neck and body like those of a camel, the legs of a deer, and the tail
of a horse, like which it neighs, and that land has very many of
them.<sup><a href="#n90" id="r90" name="r90">90</a></sup> His feet were
shod with the same kind of skins which covered his feet in the manner
of shoes.<sup><a href="#n91" id="r91" name="r91">91</a></sup> In his
hand he carried a short, heavy bow, with a cord somewhat thicker than
those of the lute,<sup><a href="#n92" id="r92" name="r92">92</a></sup>
and made from the intestines of the same animal, and a bundle of rather
short cane arrows feathered like ours, and with points of white and
black flint stones in the manner of Turkish arrows, instead of iron.
Those points were fashioned by means of another stone.<sup><a href=
"#n93" id="r93" name="r93">93</a></sup> The captain-general had the
giant given something to eat and drink, and among other things which
were shown to him was a large steel mirror. When he saw his face, he
was greatly terrified, and jumped back throwing three or
four<sup><a href="#n94" id="r94" name="r94">94</a></sup> of our men to
the ground. After that he was given some bells, a mirror, a comb, and
certain Pater Nosters. The captain-general sent him ashore with 4 armed
men. When one of his companions, who would never come to the ships, saw
him coming with our men, he ran to the place where the others were, who
came [down to the shore] all naked one after the other. When our men
reached them, they began to dance and to sing, lifting one finger to
the sky. They showed our men some white powder made from the roots of
an herb, which they kept in earthen pots, and which they ate because
they had nothing else. Our men made signs inviting them to the ships,
and that they would help them carry their possessions. Thereupon, those
men quickly took only their bows, while their women laden like asses
carried everything. The latter are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>not so tall as the men but are
very much fatter. When we saw them we were greatly surprised. Their
breasts are one-half braza long, and they are painted and clothed like
their husbands, except that before their privies [<i>natura</i>] they
have a small skin which covers them. They led four of those young
animals, fastened with thongs like a halter. When those people wish to
catch some of those animals, they tie one of these young ones to a
thornbush. Thereupon, the large ones come to play with the little ones;
and those people kill them with their arrows from their place of
concealment. Our men led eighteen of those people, counting men and
women, to the ships, and they were distributed on the two sides of the
port so that they might catch some of the said animals.</p>

was seen by some [of our men] who were cutting wood. He had a bow and
arrows in his hand. When our men approached him, he first touched his
head, face,<sup><a href="#n96" id="r96" name="r96">96</a></sup> and
body, and then did the same to our men, afterward lifting his hands
toward the sky. When the captain-general was informed of it, he ordered
him to be brought in the small boat. He was taken to that island in the
port where our men had built a house for the smiths<sup><a href="#n97"
id="r97" name="r97">97</a></sup> and for the storage of some things
from the ships. That man was even taller and better built than the
others and as tractable and amiable. Jumping up and down, he danced,
and when he danced, at every leap, his feet sank a palmo into the
earth. He remained with us for a considerable number of days, so long
that we baptized him, calling him Johanni. <span class=

uttered [the words] &ldquo;<i>Jesu</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Pater

&ldquo;<i>Jovani</i>&rdquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, John<sup>97</sup> as
distinctly as we, but with an exceedingly loud voice. Then the
captain-general gave him a shirt, a woolen jerkin [<i lang=

bells, and other things, and sent him away like his companions. He left
us very joyous and happy. The following day he brought one of those
large animals to the captain-general, in return for which many things
were given to him, so that he might bring some more to us; but we did
not see him again. We thought that his companions had killed him
because he had conversed with us.</p>

<p class="first">A fortnight later we saw four of those giants without
their arms for they had hidden them in certain bushes as the two whom
we captured showed us. Each one was painted differently. The
captain-general kept two of them&mdash;the youngest and best
proportioned&mdash;by means of a very cunning trick, in order to take
them to Spagnia.<sup><a href="#n98" id="r98" name="r98">98</a></sup>
Had he used any other means [than those he employed], they could easily
have killed some of us.<sup><a href="#n99" id="r99" name=
"r99">99</a></sup> The trick that he employed in keeping them was as
follows. He gave them many knives, scissors, mirrors, bells, and glass
beads; and those two having their hands filled with the said articles,
the captain-general had two pairs of iron manacles brought, such as are
fastened on the feet.<sup><a href="#n100" id="r100" name=
"r100">100</a></sup> He made motions that he would give them to the
giants, whereat they were very pleased since those manacles were of
iron, but they did not know how to carry them. They were grieved at
leaving them behind, but they had no place to put those gifts; for they
had to hold the skin wrapped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>about them with their
hands.<sup><a href="#n101" id="r101" name="r101">101</a></sup> The
other two giants wished to help them, but the captain refused. Seeing
that they were loth to leave those manacles behind, the captain made
them a sign that he would put them on their feet, and that they could
carry them away. They nodded assent with the head. Immediately, the
captain had the manacles put on both of them at the same time. When our
men were driving home the cross bolt, the giants began to suspect
something, but the captain assuring them, however, they stood still.
When they saw later that they were tricked, they raged like bulls,
calling loudly for <i>Setebos</i><sup><a href="#n102" id="r102" name=
"r102">102</a></sup> to aid them. With difficulty could we bind the
hands of the other two, whom we sent ashore with nine of our men, in
order that the giants might guide them to the place where the wife of
one of the two whom we had captured<sup><a href="#n103" id="r103" name=
"r103">103</a></sup> was; for the latter expressed his great grief at
leaving her by signs so that we understood [that he meant] her. While
they were on their way, one of the giants freed his hands, and took to
his heels with such swiftness that our men lost sight of him. He went
to the place where his associates were, but he did not find [there] one
of his companions, who had remained behind with the women, and who had
gone hunting. He immediately went in search of the latter, and told him
all that had happened.<sup><a href="#n104" id="r104" name=
"r104">104</a></sup> The other giant endeavored so hard to free himself
from his bonds, that our men struck him, wounding him slightly on the
head, whereat he raging led them to where the women were. Gioan
Cavagio, the pilot and commander of those men, refused to bring back
the woman<sup><a href="#n105" id="r105" name="r105">105</a></sup> that
night, but determined to sleep there, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>for night was
approaching. The other two giants came, and seeing their companion
wounded, hesitated,<sup><a href="#n106" id="r106" name=
"r106">106</a></sup> but said nothing then. But with the dawn, they
spoke<sup><a href="#n107" id="r107" name="r107">107</a></sup> to the
women, [whereupon] they immediately ran away (and the smaller ones ran
faster than the taller), leaving all their possessions behind them. Two
of them turned aside to shoot their arrows at our men. The other was
leading away those small animals of theirs in order to
hunt.<sup><a href="#n108" id="r108" name="r108">108</a></sup> Thus
fighting, one of them pierced the thigh of one of our men with an
arrow, and the latter died immediately. When the giants saw that, they
ran away quickly. Our men had muskets and crossbows, but they could
never hit any of the giants, [for] when the latter fought, they never
stood still, but leaped hither and thither. Our men buried their dead
companion, and burned all the possessions left behind by the giants. Of
a truth those giants run swifter than horses and are exceedingly
jealous of their wives.</p>

<p class="first">When those people feel sick at the stomach, instead of
purging themselves,<sup><a href="#n109" id="r109" name=
"r109">109</a></sup> they thrust an arrow down their throat for two
palmos or more<sup><a href="#n110" id="r110" name="r110">110</a></sup>
and vomit [substance of a] green color mixed with blood, for they eat a
certain kind of thistle. When they have a headache, they cut themselves
across the forehead; and they do the same on the arms or on the legs
and in any part of the body, letting a quantity of blood. One of those
whom we had captured, and whom we kept in our ship, said that the blood
refused to stay there [<i>i.e.</i>, in the place of the pain], and
consequently causes them suffering. They wear their hair cut with the
tonsure, like friars, but it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65"

id="r111" name="r111">111</a></sup> and they have a cotton cord wrapped
about the head, to which they fasten their arrows when they go hunting.
They bind their privies close to their bodies because of the exceeding
great cold.<sup><a href="#n112" id="r112" name="r112">112</a></sup>
When one of those people die, x or twelve demons all painted appear to
them and dance very joyfully about the corpse. They notice that one of
those demons is much taller than the others, and he cries out and
rejoices more.<sup><a href="#n113" id="r113" name="r113">113</a></sup>
They paint themselves exactly in the same manner as the demon appears
to them painted. They call the larger demon Setebos,<sup><a href=
"#n114" id="r114" name="r114">114</a></sup> and the others Cheleulle.
That giant also told us by signs that he had seen the demons with two
horns on their heads, and long hair which hung to the feet belching
forth fire from mouth and buttocks. The captain-general called those
people Patagoni.<sup><a href="#n115" id="r115" name=

animal above mentioned; and they have no houses except those made from
the skin of the same animal, and they wander hither and thither with
those houses just as the Cingani<sup><a href="#n116" id="r116" name=

which they call chapae.<sup><a href="#n117" id="r117" name=

of biscuit, and drank one-half pailful of water at a gulp. They also
ate rats without skinning them.</p>

<p class="first">In that port which we called the port of Santo
Julianno, we remained about five months.<sup><a href="#n118" id="r118"
name="r118">118</a></sup> Many things happened there. In order that
your most illustrious Lordship may know some of them, it happened that
as soon as we had entered the port, the captains of the other four
ships plotted treason in order that they might kill the
captain-general. Those conspirators consisted of the overseer of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>fleet, one Johan de Cartagena, the treasurer,
Alouise de Mendosa, the accountant, Anthonio Cocha, and Gaspar de
Cazada. The overseer of the men having been quartered, the treasurer
was killed by dagger blows, for the treason was discovered. Some days
after that, Gaspar de Casada, was banished with a priest in that land
of Patagonia. The captain-general did not wish to have him killed,
because the emperor, Don Carlo, had appointed him captain.<sup><a href=
"#n119" id="r119" name="r119">119</a></sup> A ship called &ldquo;Sancto
Jacobo&rdquo; was wrecked in an expedition made to explore the coast.
All the men were saved as by a miracle, not even getting wet. Two of
them came to the ships after suffering great hardships, and reported
the whole occurrence to us. Consequently, the captain-general sent some
men with bags full of biscuits [sufficient to last] for two months. It
was necessary for us to carry them the food, for daily pieces of the
ship [that was wrecked] were found. The way thither was long, [being]
24 leguas,<sup><a href="#n120" id="r120" name="r120">120</a></sup> or
one hundred millas, and the path was very rough and full of thorns. The
men were 4 days on the road, sleeping at night in the bushes. They
found no drinking water, but only ice, which caused them the greatest
hardship.<sup><a href="#n121" id="r121" name="r121">121</a></sup> There
were very many long shellfish which are called
<i>missiglioni</i><sup><a href="#n122" id="r122" name=
"r122">122</a></sup> in that port [of Santo Julianno]. They have
pearls, although small ones in the middle, but could not be eaten.
Incense, ostriches,<sup><a href="#n123" id="r123" name=
"r123">123</a></sup> foxes, sparrows, and rabbits much smaller than
ours were also found. We erected a cross on the top of the highest
summit there, as a sign in that land that it belonged to the king of
Spagnia; and we called that summit Monte de Christo [<i>i.e.</i>, Mount
of Christ]. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=

<p class="first">Then going to fifty-two degrees toward the same
pole,<sup><a href="#n128" id="r128" name="r128">128</a></sup> we found
a strait on the day of the [feast of the]<sup><a href="#n129" id="r129"
name="r129">129</a></sup> eleven thousand virgins [i.e. October 21],
whose head is called Capo de le Undici Millia Vergine [<i>i.e.</i>,
cape of the Eleven Thousand Virgins] because of that very great
miracle. That strait is one hundred and ten leguas or 440 millas long,
and it is one-half legua broad, more or less.<sup><a href="#n130" id=
"r130" name="r130">130</a></sup> It leads to another sea called the
Pacific Sea, and is surrounded by very lofty mountains laden with snow.
There it was impossible to find bottom [for anchoring], but [it was
necessary to fasten] the moorings<sup><a href="#n131" id="r131" name=
"r131">131</a></sup> on land 25 or 30 brazas away. Had it not been for
the captain-general, we would not have found that strait, for we all
thought and said that it was closed on all sides. But the
captain-general who knew where to sail to find a well-hidden strait,
which he saw depicted on a map in the treasury of the king of Portugal,
which was made by that excellent man, Martin de Boemia, sent two ships,
the &ldquo;Santo Anthonio&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Conceptione&rdquo; (for
thus they were called), to discover what was inside the cape de la
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>Baia [<i>i.e.</i>, of the Bay].<sup><a href=
"#n132" id="r132" name="r132">132</a></sup> We, with the other two
ships, [namely], the flagship, called &ldquo;Trinitade,&rdquo; and the
other the &ldquo;Victoria,&rdquo; stayed inside the bay to await
them.<sup><a href="#n133" id="r133" name="r133">133</a></sup> A great
storm struck us that night, which lasted until the middle of next day,
which necessitated our lifting anchor, and letting ourselves drift
hither and thither about the bay. The other two ships suffered a
headwind and could not double a cape<sup><a href="#n134" id="r134"
name="r134">134</a></sup> formed by the bay almost at its end, as they
were trying to return to join us; so that they thought that they would
have to run aground. But on approaching the end of the bay, and
thinking that they were lost, they saw a small opening which did not
[exceed: <i>crossed out in original MS.</i>] appear to be an opening,
but a sharp turn [<i>cantone</i>].<sup><a href="#n135" id="r135" name=
"r135">135</a></sup> Like desperate men they hauled into it, and thus
they discovered the strait by chance. Seeing that it was not a sharp
turn, but a strait with land, they proceeded farther, and found a
bay.<sup><a href="#n136" id="r136" name="r136">136</a></sup> And then
farther on they found another strait and another bay larger than the
first two.<sup><a href="#n137" id="r137" name="r137">137</a></sup> Very
joyful they immediately turned back to inform the captain-general. We
thought that they had been wrecked, first, by reason of the violent
storm, and second, because two days had passed and they had not
appeared, and also because of certain [signals with] smoke made by two
of their men who had been sent ashore to advise us.<sup><a href="#n138"
id="r138" name="r138">138</a></sup> And so, while in suspense, we saw
the two ships with sails full and banners flying to the wind, coming
toward us. When they neared us in this manner, they suddenly discharged
a number of mortars, and burst into cheers.<sup><a href="#n139" id=
"r139" name="r139">139</a></sup> Then all together thanking God and the
Virgin Mary, we went to seek [the strait] farther on. <span class=

<td class="second">
<p class="first">After entering that strait, we found two openings, one
to the southeast, and the other to the southwest.<sup><a href="#n140"
id="r140" name="r140">140</a></sup> The captain-general sent the ship
&ldquo;Sancto Anthonio&rdquo; together with the
&ldquo;Concitione&rdquo; to ascertain whether that opening which was
toward the southeast had an exit into the Pacific Sea. The ship
&ldquo;Sancto Anthonio&rdquo; would not await the
&ldquo;Conceptione,&rdquo; because it intended to flee and return to
Spagnia&mdash;which it did. The pilot of that ship was one Stefan
Gomes,<sup><a href="#n141" id="r141" name="r141">141</a></sup> and he
hated the captain-general exceedingly, because before that fleet was
fitted out, the emperor had ordered that he be given some caravels with
which to discover lands, but his Majesty did not give them to him
because of the coming of the captain-general. On that account he
conspired with certain Spaniards, and next night they captured the
captain of their ship, a cousin<sup><a href="#n142" id="r142" name=
"r142">142</a></sup> of the captain-general, one Alvaro de Meschita,
whom they wounded and put in irons, and in this condition took to
Spagnia. The other giant whom we had captured was in that ship, but he
died when the heat came on. The &ldquo;Conceptione,&rdquo; as it could
not follow that ship, waited for it, sailing about hither and thither.
The &ldquo;Sancto Anthonio&rdquo; turned back at night and fled along
the same [port: <i>crossed out in original MS.</i>]
strait.<sup><a href="#n143" id="r143" name="r143">143</a></sup> We had
gone to explore the other opening toward the southwest. Finding,
however, the same [port: <i>crossed out in original MS.</i>] strait
continuously, we came upon a river which we called the river of Sardine
[<i>i.e.</i>, Sardines], because there were many sardines near
it.<sup><a href="#n144" id="r144" name="r144">144</a></sup> So we
stayed there for four days in order to await the two ships. During that
period we sent a well-equipped boat to explore the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>cape of
the other sea. The men returned within three days, and reported that
they had seen the cape and the open sea. The captain-general wept for
joy, and called that cape, Cape Dezeado [<i>i.e.</i>,
Desire],<sup><a href="#n145" id="r145" name="r145">145</a></sup> for we
had been desiring it for a long time. We turned back to look for the
two ships,<sup><a href="#n146" id="r146" name="r146">146</a></sup> but
we found only the &ldquo;Conceptione.&rdquo; Upon asking them where the
other one was, Johan Seranno,<sup><a href="#n147" id="r147" name=
"r147">147</a></sup> who was captain and pilot of the former ship (and
also of that ship that had been wrecked) replied that he did not know,
and that he had never seen it after it had entered the opening. We
sought it in all parts of the strait, as far as that opening whence it
had fled, and the captain-general sent the ship &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo;
back to the entrance of the strait to ascertain whether the ship was
there. Orders were given them, if they did not find it, to plant a
banner on the summit of some small hill with a letter in an earthen pot
buried in the earth near the banner, so that if the banner were seen
the letter might be found, and the ship might learn the course that we
were sailing. For this was the arrangement made between us in case that
we went astray one from the other.<sup><a href="#n148" id="r148" name=
"r148">148</a></sup> Two banners were planted with their
letters&mdash;one on a little eminence in the first bay, and the other
in an islet in the third bay<sup><a href="#n149" id="r149" name=
"r149">149</a></sup> where there were many sea-wolves and large birds.
The captain-general waited for the ship with his other ship near he
river of Isleo,<sup><a href="#n150" id="r150" name="r150">150</a></sup>
and he had a cross set up in an islet near that river, which flowed
between high mountains covered with snow and emptied into the sea near
the river of Sardine. Had we not discovered that strait, the
captain-general had determined to go as far as seventy-five
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>degrees toward the Antarctic Pole. There in that
latitude, during the summer season, there is no night, or if there is
any night it is but short, and so in the winter with the day. In order
that your most illustrious Lordship may believe it, when we were in
that strait, the nights were only three hours long, and it was then the
month of October.<sup><a href="#n151" id="r151" name=
"r151">151</a></sup> The land on the left-hand side of that strait
turned toward the southeast<sup><a href="#n152" id="r152" name=
"r152">152</a></sup> and was low. We called that strait the strait of
Patagonia. One finds the safest of ports every half legua in
it,<sup><a href="#n153" id="r153" name="r153">153</a></sup> water, the
finest of wood (but not of cedar), fish, sardines, and missiglioni,
while smallage,<sup><a href="#n154" id="r154" name="r154">154</a></sup>
a sweet herb (although there is also some that is bitter) grows around
the springs. We ate of it for many days as we had nothing else. I
believe that there is not a more beautiful or better strait in the
world than that one.<sup><a href="#n155" id="r155" name=
"r155">155</a></sup> In that Ocean Sea one sees a very amusing fish
hunt. The fish [that hunt] are of three sorts, and are one braza and
more in length, and are called dorado, albicore, and
bonito.<sup><a href="#n156" id="r156" name="r156">156</a></sup> Those
fish follow the flying fish called colondrini,<sup><a href="#n157" id=
"r157" name="r157">157</a></sup> which are one palmo and
more<sup><a href="#n158" id="r158" name="r158">158</a></sup> in length
and very good to eat. When the above three kinds [of fish] find any of
those flying fish, the latter immediately leap from the water and fly
as long as their wings are wet&mdash;more than a crossbow&rsquo;s
flight. While they are flying, the others run along back of them under
the water following the shadow of the flying fish. The latter have no
sooner fallen into the water than the others immediately seize and eat
them. It is in fine a very amusing thing to watch. <span class=

him, kissed it. He immediately cried out &ldquo;Setebos,&rdquo; and
made me a sign that if I made the sign of the cross again, Setebos
would enter into my body and cause it to burst. When that giant was
sick, he asked for the cross, and embracing it and kissing it many
times, desired to become a Christian before his death. We called him
Paulo. When those people wish to make a fire, they rub a sharpened
piece of wood against another piece until the fire catches in the pith
of a certain tree, which is placed between those two
sticks.<sup><a href="#n163" id="r163" name="r163">163</a></sup></p>

<p class="first">Wednesday, November 28, 1520, we debouched from that
strait, engulfing ourselves in the Pacific Sea.<sup><a href="#n164" id=
"r164" name="r164">164</a></sup> We were three months and twenty days
without getting any kind of fresh food. We ate biscuit, which was no
longer biscuit, but powder of biscuits swarming with worms, for they
had eaten the good. It stank strongly of the urine of
rats.<sup><a href="#n165" id="r165" name="r165">165</a></sup> We drank
yellow water that had been putrid for many days. We also ate some ox
hides that covered the top of the mainyard to prevent the yard from
chafing the shrouds, and which had become exceedingly hard because of
the sun, rain, and wind.<sup><a href="#n166" id="r166" name=
"r166">166</a></sup> We left them in the sea for four or five days, and
then placed them for a few moments on top of the embers, and so ate
them; and often we ate sawdust from boards. Rats were sold for one-half
ducado apiece, and even then we could not get them.<sup><a href="#n167"
id="r167" name="r167">167</a></sup> But above all the other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>misfortunes the following was the worst. The gums
of both the lower and upper teeth of some of our men swelled, so that
they could not eat under any circumstances and therefore
died.<sup><a href="#n168" id="r168" name="r168">168</a></sup> Nineteen
men died from that sickness, and the giant together with an Indian from
the country of Verzin. Twenty-five or thirty men fell sick [during that
time], in the arms, legs, or in another place, so that but few remained
well. However, I, by the grace of God, suffered no sickness. We sailed
about four thousand leguas during those three months and twenty days
through an open stretch in that Pacific Sea.<sup><a href="#n169" id=
"r169" name="r169">169</a></sup> In truth it is very
pacific,<sup><a href="#n170" id="r170" name="r170">170</a></sup> for
during that time we did not suffer any storm. We saw no land except two
desert islets, where we found nothing but birds and trees, for which we
called them the Ysolle Infortunate [<i>i.e.</i>, the Unfortunate
Isles]. They are two hundred leguas apart. We found no anchorage, [but]
near them saw many sharks.<sup><a href="#n171" id="r171" name=
"r171">171</a></sup> The first islet lies in fifteen degrees of south
latitude, and the other in nine. Daily we made runs of fifty, sixty, or
seventy leguas at the catena or at the stern.<sup><a href="#n172" id=
"r172" name="r172">172</a></sup> Had not God and His blessed mother
given us so good weather we would all have died of hunger in that
exceeding vast sea. Of a verity I believe no such voyage will ever be
made [again].</p>

<p class="first">The Antarctic Pole is not so starry as the Arctic.
Many small stars clustered together are seen, which have the appearance
of two clouds of mist. There is but little distance between them, and
they are somewhat dim. In the midst of them are two large and not very
luminous stars, which move only slightly. Those two stars are the
Antarctic Pole. Our loadstone, although it moved hither and thither,
always pointed toward its own Arctic Pole, although it did not have so
much strength as on its own side. And on that account when we were in
that open expanse, the captain-general, asking all the pilots whether
they were always sailing forward in the course which we had laid down
on the maps, all replied: &ldquo;By your course exactly as laid
down.&rdquo; He answered them that they were pointing
wrongly&mdash;which was a fact&mdash;and that it would be fitting to
adjust the needle of navigation, for it was not receiving so much force
from its side. When we were in the midst of that open expanse, we saw a
cross with five extremely bright stars straight toward the west, those
stars being exactly placed with regard to one another.<sup><a href=

March 6, a small island to the northwest, and two others toward the
southwest, one of which was higher and larger than the other two. The
captain-general wished to stop at the large island and get some fresh
food, but he was unable to do so because the inhabitants of that island
entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on, so
that we could not protect ourselves. The men were about to strike the
sails so that we could go ashore, but the natives very deftly stole
from us the small boat<sup><a href="#n180" id="r180" name=

piece of wood pointed at the top, with poles laid across it and resting

<p class="first">At dawn on Saturday, March sixteen,<sup><a href=
"#n196" id="r196" name="r196">196</a></sup> 1521, we came upon a high
land at a distance of three hundred leguas from the islands of
Latroni&mdash;an island named Zamal [<i>i.e.</i>, Samar]. The following
day, the captain-general desired to land on another island which was
uninhabited and lay to the right of the abovementioned island, in order
to be more secure, and to get water and have some rest. He had two
tents set up on the shore for the sick and had a sow killed for them.
On Monday afternoon, March 18, we saw a boat coming toward us with nine
men in it. Therefore, the captain-general ordered that no one should
move or say a word without his permission. When those men reached the
shore, their chief went immediately to the captain-general, giving
signs of joy because of our arrival. Five of the most ornately adorned
of them remained with us, while the rest went to get some others who
were fishing, and so they all came. The captain-general seeing that
they were reasonable men, ordered food to be set before them, and gave
them red caps, mirrors, combs, bells, ivory, bocasine,<sup><a href=
"#n197" id="r197" name="r197">197</a></sup> and other things. When they
saw the captain&rsquo;s courtesy, they presented fish, a jar of palm
wine, which they call <i>uraca</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, arrack], figs more
than one palmo long [<i>i.e.</i>, bananas],<sup><a href="#n198" id=
"r198" name="r198">198</a></sup> and others which were smaller and more
delicate, and two cocoanuts. They had nothing else then, but made us
signs with their hands that they would bring <i>umay</i> or
rice,<sup><a href="#n199" id="r199" name="r199">199</a></sup> and
cocoanuts and many other articles of food within four days.

<p class="first">Cocoanuts are the fruit of the palmtree.<sup><a href=
"#n200" id="r200" name="r200">200</a></sup> Just as we have bread,
wine, oil, and milk, so those people get everything from that tree.
They get wine in the following manner. They bore a hole into the heart
of the said palm at the top called palmito [<i>i.e.</i>, stalk], from
which distils a liquor<sup><a href="#n201" id="r201" name=
"r201">201</a></sup> which resembles white must. That liquor is sweet
but somewhat tart, and [is gathered] in canes [of bamboo] as thick as
the leg and thicker. They fasten the bamboo to the tree at evening for
the morning, and in the morning for the evening. That palm bears a
fruit, namely, the cocoanut, which is as large as the head or
thereabouts. Its outside husk is green and thicker than two fingers.
Certain filaments are found in that husk, whence is made cord for
binding together their boats. Under that husk there is a hard shell,
much thicker than the shell of the walnut, which they burn and make
therefrom a powder that is useful to them.<sup><a href="#n202" id=
"r202" name="r202">202</a></sup> Under that shell there is a white
marrowy substance one finger in thickness, which they eat fresh with
meat and fish as we do bread; and it has a taste resembling the almond.
It could be dried and made into bread. There is a clear, sweet water in
the middle of that marrowy substance which is very refreshing. When
that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals
and becomes like an apple. When the natives wish to make oil, they take
that cocoanut, and allow the marrowy substance and the water to
putrefy. Then they boil it and it becomes oil like butter. When they
wish to make vinegar, they allow only the water to putrefy, and then
place it in the sun, and a vinegar results like [that made from] white
wine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>Milk can also be made from it for we made some.
We scraped that marrowy substance and then mixed the scrapings with its
own water which we strained through a cloth, and so obtained milk like
goat&rsquo;s milk. Those palms resemble date-palms, but although not
smooth they are less knotty than the latter. A family of x persons can
be supported on two trees, by utilizing them week about for the wine;
for if they did otherwise, the trees would dry up. They last a
century.<sup><a href="#n203" id="r203" name="r203">203</a></sup></p>

us many things, their names and those of some of the islands that could
be seen from that place. Their own island was called Zuluan and it is
not very large.<sup><a href="#n204" id="r204" name="r204">204</a></sup>
We took great pleasure with them, for they were very pleasant and
conversable. In order to show them greater honor, the
captain-general<sup><a href="#n205" id="r205" name="r205">205</a></sup>
took them to his ship and showed them all his merchandise&mdash;cloves,
cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, mace, gold, and all the things in the
ship. He had some mortars fired for them, whereat they exhibited great
fear, and tried to jump out of the ship.<sup><a href="#n206" id="r206"
name="r206">206</a></sup> They made signs to us that the abovesaid
articles grew in that place where we were going. When they were about
to retire they took their leave very gracefully and neatly, saying that
they would return according to their promise. The island where we were
is called Humunu; but inasmuch as we found two springs there of the
clearest water, we called it Acquada da li buoni Segnialli
[<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the Watering-place of good Signs&rdquo;], for
there were the first signs of gold which we found in those

and large trees with fruit a trifle smaller than the almond and
resembling pine seeds. There are also many palms, some of them good and
others bad. There are many islands in that district, and therefore we
called them the archipelago of San Lazaro, as they were discovered on
the Sabbath of St. Lazurus.<sup><a href="#n208" id="r208" name=

coming. They are large boats and are so called [by those people]. They
were full of men, and their king was in the larger of them, being
seated under an awning of mats. When the king came near the flagship,
the slave spoke to him. The king understood him, for in those districts
the kings know more languages than the other people. He ordered some of
his men to enter the ships, but he always remained in his balanghai, at
some little distance from the ship until his own men returned; and as
soon as they returned he departed. The captain-general showed great
honor to the men who entered the ship, and gave them some presents, for
which the king wished before his departure to give the captain a large
bar<sup><a href="#n221" id="r221" name="r221">221</a></sup> of gold and
a basketful of ginger. The latter, however, thanked the king heartily

<p class="first">Next day, holy Friday, the captain-general sent his
slave, who acted as our interpreter, ashore in a small boat to ask the
king if he had any food to have it carried to the ships;<sup><a href=
"#n222" id="r222" name="r222">222</a></sup> and to say that they would
be well satisfied with us, for he [and his men] had come to the island
as friends and not as enemies. The king came with six or eight
men<sup><a href="#n223" id="r223" name="r223">223</a></sup> in the same
boat and entered the ship. He embraced the captain-general to whom he
gave three porcelain jars covered with leaves and full of raw rice, two
very large <i>orade</i>,<sup><a href="#n224" id="r224" name=
"r224">224</a></sup> and other things. The captain-general gave the
king a garment of red and yellow cloth made in the Turkish fashion, and
a fine red cap; and to the others (the king&rsquo;s men), to some
knives and to others mirrors. Then the captain-general <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>had
a collation spread for them, and had the king told through the slave
that he desired to be <i>casi casi</i><sup><a href="#n225" id="r225"
name="r225">225</a></sup> with him, that is to say, brother. The king
replied that he also wished to enter the same relations with the
captain-general. Then the captain showed him cloth of various colors,
linen, coral [ornaments], and many other articles of merchandise, and
all the artillery, some of which he had discharged for him, whereat the
natives were greatly frightened. Then the captain-general had a man
armed as a soldier,<sup><a href="#n226" id="r226" name=
"r226">226</a></sup> and placed him in the midst of three men armed
with swords and daggers, who struck him on all parts of the body.
Thereby was the king rendered almost speechless. The captain-general
told him through the slave that one of those armed men was worth one
hundred of his own men. The king answered that that was a fact. The
captain-general said that he had two hundred men in each ship who were
armed in that manner.<sup><a href="#n227" id="r227" name=
"r227">227</a></sup> He showed the king cuirasses, swords, and
bucklers, and had a review made for him.<sup><a href="#n228" id="r228"
name="r228">228</a></sup> Then he led the king to the deck of the ship,
that is located above at the stern; and had his sea-chart and compass
brought.<sup><a href="#n229" id="r229" name="r229">229</a></sup> He
told the king through the interpreter how he had found the strait in
order to voyage thither, and how many moons he had been without seeing
land, whereat the king was astonished. Lastly, he told the king that he
would like, if it were pleasing to him, to send two of his men with him
so that he might show them some of his things. The king replied that he
was agreeable, and I went in company with one of the other
men.<sup><a href="#n230" id="r230" name="r230">230</a></sup></p>

<p class="first">When I reached shore, the king raised his hands
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>toward the sky and then turned toward us two. We
did the same toward him<sup><a href="#n231" id="r231" name=
"r231">231</a></sup> as did all the others. The king took me by the
hand; one of his chiefs took my companion<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6678" title="Source: :">;</span> and thus they led us under a
bamboo covering, where there was a balanghai,<sup><a href="#n232" id=
"r232" name="r232">232</a></sup> as long as eighty of my palm lengths,
and resembling a fusta. We sat down upon the stern of that balanghai,
constantly conversing with signs. The king&rsquo;s men stood about us
in a circle with swords, daggers, spears, and bucklers.<sup><a href=
"#n233" id="r233" name="r233">233</a></sup> The king had a plate of
pork brought in and a large jar filled with wine. At every mouthful, we
drank a cup of wine. The wine that was left [in the cup] at any time,
although that happened but rarely, was put into a jar by itself. The
king&rsquo;s cup was always kept covered and no one else drank from it
but he and I. Before the king took the cup to drink, he raised his
clasped hands toward the sky, and then toward me; and when he was about
to drink, he extended the fist of his left hand toward me (at first I
thought that he was about to strike me) and then drank. I did the same
toward the king. They all make those signs one toward another when they
drink. We ate with such ceremonies and with other signs of friendship.
I ate meat on holy Friday, for I could not help myself. Before the
supper hour I gave the king many things which I had brought. I wrote
down the names of many things in their language. When the king and the
others saw me writing, and when I told them their words, they were all
astonished.<sup><a href="#n234" id="r234" name="r234">234</a></sup>
While engaged in that the supper hour was announced. Two large
porcelain dishes were brought in, one full of rice and the other of
pork with its gravy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span>We ate with the same signs and ceremonies,
after which we went to the palace of the king which was built like a
hayloft and was thatched with fig [<i>i.e.</i>, banana] and palm
leaves. It was built up high from the ground on huge posts of wood and
it was necessary to ascend to it by means of ladders.<sup><a href=
"#n235" id="r235" name="r235">235</a></sup> The king made us sit down
there on a bamboo mat with our feet drawn up like tailors. After a
half-hour a platter of roast fish cut in pieces was brought in, and
ginger freshly gathered, and wine. The king&rsquo;s eldest son, who was
the prince, came over to us, whereupon the king told him to sit down
near us, and he accordingly did so. Then two platters were brought in
(one with fish and its sauce, and the other with rice), so that we
might eat with the prince. My companion became intoxicated as a
consequence of so much drinking and eating. They used the gum of a tree
called <i>anime</i> wrapped in palm or fig [<i>i.e.</i>, banana] leaves
for lights. The king made us a sign that he was going to go to sleep.
He left the prince with us, and we slept with the latter on a bamboo
mat with pillows made of leaves. When day dawned the king came and took
me by the hand, and in that manner we went to where we had had supper,
in order to partake of refreshments, but the boat came to get us.
Before we left, the king kissed our hands with great joy, and we his.
One of his brothers, the king of another island, and three men came
with us. The captain-general kept him to dine with us, and gave him
many things.<sup><a href="#n236" id="r236" name=

<p class="first">Early on the morning of Sunday, the last of March, and
Easter-day, the captain-general sent the priest with some men to
prepare the place where mass was to be said;<sup><a href="#n241" id=
"r241" name="r241">241</a></sup> together with the interpreter to tell
the king that we were not going to land in order to dine with him, but
to say mass. Therefore the king sent us two swine that he had had
killed. When the hour for mass arrived, we landed with about fifty men,
without our body armor, but carrying our other arms, and dressed in our
best clothes.<sup><a href="#n242" id="r242" name="r242">242</a></sup>
Before we reached the shore with our boats, six pieces were discharged
as a sign of peace. We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=
"#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>landed; the two kings embraced the
captain-general, and placed him between them. We went in marching order
to the place consecrated, which was not far from the shore. Before the
commencement of mass, the captain sprinkled the entire bodies of the
two kings with musk water.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n243" id="r243" name=
"r243">243</a></sup> The mass was offered up. The kings went forward to
kiss the cross as we did, but they did not offer the
sacrifice.<sup><a href="#n244" id="r244" name="r244">244</a></sup> When
the body of our Lord was elevated, they remained on their knees and
worshiped Him with clasped hands. The ships fired all their artillery
at once when the body of Christ was elevated, the signal having been
given from the shore with muskets. After the conclusion of mass, some
of our men took communion.<sup><a href="#n245" id="r245" name=
"r245">245</a></sup> The captain-general arranged a fencing
tournament,<sup><a href="#n246" id="r246" name="r246">246</a></sup> at
which the kings were greatly pleased. Then he had a cross carried in
and the nails and a crown, to which immediate reverence was
made.<sup><a href="#n247" id="r247" name="r247">247</a></sup> He told
the kings through the interpreter that they were the standards given to
him by the emperor his sovereign, so that wherever he might go he might
set up those his tokens. [He said] that he wished to set it up in that
place for their benefit, for whenever any of our ships
came,<sup><a href="#n248" id="r248" name="r248">248</a></sup> they
would know that we had been there by that cross, and would do nothing
to displease them or harm their property [property: <i>doublet in
original MS.</i>]. If any of their men were captured, they would be set
free immediately on that sign being shown. It was necessary to set that
cross on the summit of the highest mountain, so that on seeing it every
morning, they might adore it; and if they did that, neither thunder,
lightning, nor storms would harm them in the least. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>thanked him heartily and [said] that they would
do everything willingly. The captain-general also had them asked
whether they were Moros or heathen, or what was their belief. They
replied that they worshiped nothing, but that they raised their clasped
hands and their face to the sky; and that they called their god
&ldquo;Abba.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n249" id="r249" name=
"r249">249</a></sup> Thereat the captain was very glad, and seeing
that, the first king raised his hands to the sky, and said that he
wished that it were possible for him to make the captain see his love
for him. The interpreter asked the king why there was so little to eat
there. The latter replied that he did not live in that place except
when he went hunting and to see his brother, but that he lived in
another island where all his family were. The captain-general had him
asked to declare whether he had any enemies, so that he might go with
his ships to destroy them and to render them obedient to
him.<sup><a href="#n250" id="r250" name="r250">250</a></sup> The king
thanked him and said that he did indeed have two islands hostile to
him, but that it was not then the season to go there. The captain told
him that if God would again allow him to return to those districts, he
would bring so many men that he would make the king&rsquo;s enemies
subject to him by force. He said that he was about to go to dinner, and
that he would return afterward to have the cross set up on the summit
of the mountain. They replied that they were satisfied, and then
forming in battalion and firing the muskets, and the captain having
embraced the two kings, we took our leave.</p>

that afternoon<sup><a href="#n251" id="r251" name="r251">251</a></sup>
went together with the two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href=

mountain there. When we reached the summit, the captain-general told
them that he esteemed highly having sweated for them, for since the
cross was there, it could not but be of great use to them. On asking
them which port was the best to get food, they replied that there were
three, namely, Ceylon, Zubu, and Calaghann, but that Zubu was the
largest and the one with most trade. They offered of their own accord
to give us pilots to show us the way. The captain-general thanked them,
and determined to go there, for so did his unhappy fate will. After the
cross was erected in position, each of us repeated a <i>Pater
Noster</i> and an <i>Ave Maria</i>, and adored the cross; and the kings
did the same. Then we descended through their cultivated fields, and
went to the place where the balanghai was.<sup><a href="#n252" id=
"r252" name="r252">252</a></sup> The kings had some cocoanuts brought
in so that we might refresh ourselves. The captain asked the kings for
the pilots for he intended to depart the following morning, and [said]
that he would treat them as if they were the kings themselves, and
would leave one of us as hostage. The kings replied that every hour he
wished the pilots were at his command, but that night the first king
changed his mind, and in the morning when we were about to depart, sent
word to the captain-general, asking him for love of him to wait two
days until he should have his rice harvested, and other trifles
attended to. He asked the captain-general to send him some men to help
him, so that it might be done sooner; and said that he intended to act
as our pilot himself. The captain sent him some men, but the kings ate
and drank so much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>that they slept all the day. Some said to
excuse them that they were slightly sick. Our men did nothing on that
day, but they worked the next two days.<sup><a href="#n253" id="r253"

sand, through the great heat of which they hatch out. When the chicks
are born, they push up the sand, and come out. Those eggs are good to
eat. There is a distance of twenty leguas from Mazaua to Gatighan. We
set out westward from Gatighan, but the king of Mazaua could not follow

<p class="first">At noon on Sunday, April seven, we entered the port of
Zubu, passing by many villages, where we saw many houses built upon
logs. On approaching the city, the captain-general ordered the ships to
fling their banners. The sails were lowered and arranged as if for
battle, and all the artillery was fired, an action which caused great
fear to those people. The captain sent a foster-son of his as
ambassador to the king of Zubo with the interpreter. When they reached
the city, they found a vast crowd of people together with the king, all
of whom had been frightened by the mortars. The interpreter told
them<sup><a href="#n270" id="r270" name="r270">270</a></sup> that that
was our custom when entering into such places, as a sign of peace and
friendship, and that we had discharged all our mortars to honor the
king of the village. The king and all of his men were reassured, and
the king had us asked by his governor what we wanted. The interpreter
replied that his master was a captain of the greatest king and prince
in the world, and that he was going to discover Malucho;<sup><a href=
"#n271" id="r271" name="r271">271</a></sup> but that he had come solely
to visit the king because of the good report which he had heard of him
from the king of Mazaua, and to buy food with his merchandise. The king
told him that he was welcome [<i>literally</i>: he had come at a good
time], but that it was their custom for all ships that entered their
ports to pay tribute, and that it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139"
href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>was but four days since a
junk from Ciama [<i>i.e.</i>, Siam] laden with gold and slaves had paid
him tribute. As proof of his statement the king pointed out to the
interpreter a merchant from Ciama, who had remained to trade the gold
and slaves. The interpreter told the king that, since his master was
the captain of so great a king, he did not pay tribute to any seignior
in the world, and that if the king wished peace he would have peace,
but if war instead, war. Thereupon, the Moro merchant said to the king
<i>Cata raia chita</i> that is to say,<sup><a href="#n272" id="r272"
name="r272">272</a></sup> &ldquo;Look well, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;These
men are the same who have conquered Calicut, Malaca, and all India
Magiore [<i>i.e.</i>, India Major].<sup><a href="#n273" id="r273" name=
"r273">273</a></sup> If they are treated well, they will give good
treatment, but if they are treated evil, evil and worse treatment, as
they have done to Calicut and Malaca.&rdquo; The interpreter understood
it all and told the king that his master&rsquo;s king was more powerful
in men and ships than the king of Portogalo, that he was the king of
Spagnia and emperor of all the Christians, and that if the king did not
care to be his friend<sup><a href="#n274" id="r274" name=
"r274">274</a></sup> he would next time send so many men that they
would destroy him. The Moro related everything to the
king,<sup><a href="#n275" id="r275" name="r275">275</a></sup> who said
thereupon that he would deliberate with his men, and would answer the
captain on the following day. Then he had refreshments of many dishes,
all made from meat and contained in porcelain platters, besides many
jars of wine brought in. After our men had refreshed themselves, they
returned and told us everything. The king of Mazaua,<sup><a href=
"#n276" id="r276" name="r276">276</a></sup> who was the most
influential after that king and the seignior of a number of islands,
went ashore to speak to the king of the great courtesy of our
captain-general. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141"

<p class="first">Monday morning, our notary, together with the

the open square where he had our men sit down near him. He asked the
notary whether there were more than one captain in that company, and
whether that captain wished him to pay tribute to the emperor his
master. The notary replied in the negative, but that the captain wished
only to trade with him and with no others. The king said that he was
satisfied, and that if the captain wished to become his friend, he
should send him a drop of blood from his right arm, and he himself
would do the same [to him] as a sign of the most sincere
friendship.<sup><a href="#n277" id="r277" name="r277">277</a></sup> The
notary answered that the captain would do it. Thereupon, the king told
him that all the captains who came to that place, were wont to give
presents one to the other [<i>i.e.</i>, mutual presents between the

<p class="first">After dinner the king&rsquo;s nephew, who was the
prince, came to the ships with the king of Mazaua, the Moro, the
governor, the chief constable, and eight chiefs, to make peace with us.
The captain-general was seated in a red velvet chair, the principal
men<sup><a href="#n281" id="r281" name="r281">281</a></sup> on leather
chairs, and the others on mats upon the floor. The captain-general
asked them through the interpreter whether it were their custom to
speak in secret or in public, and whether that prince and the king of
Mazaua had authority to make peace.<sup><a href="#n282" id="r282" name=
"r282">282</a></sup> They answered that they spoke in public, and that
they were empowered to make peace. The captain-general said many things
concerning peace, and that he prayed God to confirm it in heaven. They
said that they had never heard any one speak such words, but that they
took great pleasure in hearing them. The captain seeing that they
listened and answered willingly, began to advance arguments to induce
them to accept the faith. Asking them who would succeed to the
seigniory after the death of the king, he was answered that the king
had no sons but only daughters, the eldest of whom was the wife of that
nephew of his, who therefore was the prince. [They said that] when the
fathers and mothers grew old, they received no further honor, but their
children commanded them. The captain told them that God made the sky,
the earth, the sea, and everything else, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>and that He had
commanded us to honor our fathers and mothers, and that whoever did
otherwise was condemned to eternal fire; that we are all descended from
Adam and Eva, our first parents; that we have an immortal
spirit;<sup><a href="#n283" id="r283" name="r283">283</a></sup> and
many other things pertaining to the faith. All joyfully entreated the
captain to leave them two men, or at least one,<sup><a href="#n284" id=
"r284" name="r284">284</a></sup> to instruct them in the faith, and
[said] that they would show them great honor. The captain replied to
them that he could not leave them any men then, but that if they wished
to become Christians, our priest would baptize them, and that he would
next time bring priests and friars who would instruct them in our
faith. They answered that they would first speak to their king, and
that then they would become Christians, [whereat] we all wept with
great joy. The captain-general told them that they should not become
Christians for fear or to please us, but of their own free
wills;<sup><a href="#n285" id="r285" name="r285">285</a></sup> and that
he would not cause any displeasure to those who wished to live
according to their own law, but that the Christians would be better
regarded and treated than the others. All cried out with one voice that
they were not becoming Christians through fear or to please us, but of
their own free will. Then the captain told them that if they became
Christians, he would leave a suit of armor,<sup><a href="#n286" id=
"r286" name="r286">286</a></sup> for so had his king commanded him;
that we could not have intercourse with their women without committing
a very great, sin, since they were pagans; and that he assured them
that if they became Christians, the devil would no longer appear to
them except in the last moment at their death.<sup><a href="#n287" id=
"r287" name="r287">287</a></sup> They said that they could not answer
the beautiful words of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>captain, but that they placed
themselves in his hands, and that he should treat them as his most
faithful servants. The captain embraced them weeping, and clasping one
of the prince&rsquo;s hands and one of the king&rsquo;s between his
own, said to them that, by his faith in God and to his sovereign, the
emperor, and by the habit which he wore,<sup><a href="#n288" id="r288"
name="r288">288</a></sup> he promised them that he would give them
perpetual peace with the king of Spagnia. They answered that they
promised the same. After the conclusion of the peace, the captain had
refreshments served to them. Then the prince and the king [of Mazaua]
presented some baskets of rice, swine, goats, and fowls to the
captain-general on behalf of their king, and asked him to pardon them,
for such things were but little [to give] to one such as he. The
captain gave the prince a white cloth of the finest linen, a red cap,
some strings of glass beads, and a gilded glass drinking cup. Those
glasses are greatly appreciated in those districts. He did not give any
present to the king of Mazaua, for he had already given him a robe of
Cambaya, besides other articles.<sup><a href="#n289" id="r289" name=
"r289">289</a></sup> To the others he gave now one thing and now
another. Then he sent to the king of Zubu through me and one other a
yellow and violet silk robe, made in Turkish style, a fine red cap,
some strings of glass beads, all in a silver dish, and two gilt
drinking cups in our hands.<sup><a href="#n290" id="r290" name=
"r290">290</a></sup> When we reached the city we found the king in his
palace surrounded by many people. He was seated on a palm mat on the
ground, with only a cotton cloth before his privies, and a scarf
embroidered with the needle about his head, a necklace of great value
hanging from his neck, and two large gold earrings fastened in his ears
set round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>with precious gems. He was fat and short, and
tattooed with fire<sup><a href="#n291" id="r291" name=
"r291">291</a></sup> in various designs. From another mat on the ground
he was eating turtle eggs which were in two porcelain dishes, and he
had four jars full of palm wine in front of him covered with
sweet-smelling herbs and arranged with four small reeds in each jar by
means of which he drank.<sup><a href="#n292" id="r292" name=
"r292">292</a></sup> Having duly made reverence to him, the interpreter
told the king that his master thanked him very warmly for his present,
and that he sent this present not in return for his present but for the
intrinsic love which he bore him.<sup><a href="#n293" id="r293" name=
"r293">293</a></sup> We dressed him in the robe, placed the cap on his
head, and gave him the other things; then kissing the beads and putting
them upon his head, I presented them to him. He doing the same
[<i>i.e.</i>, kissing them] accepted them. Then the king had us eat
some of those eggs and drink through those slender reeds. The others,
his men, told him in that place, the words of the captain concerning
peace and his exhortation to them to become Christians. The king wished
to have us stay to supper with him, but we told him that we could not
stay then. Having taken our leave of him, the prince took us with him
to his house, where four young girls were playing
[instruments]&mdash;one, on a drum like ours, but resting on the
ground; the second was striking two suspended gongs alternately with a
stick wrapped somewhat thickly at the end with palm cloth; the third,
one large gong in the same manner; and the last, two small gongs held
in her hand, by striking one against the other, which gave forth a
sweet sound. They played so harmoniously that one would believe they
possessed good musical sense. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151"
href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>Those girls were very
beautiful and almost as white as our girls and as large. They were
naked except for tree cloth hanging from the waist and reaching to the
knees. Some were quite naked and had large holes in their ears with a
small round piece of wood in the hole, which keeps the hole round and
large. They have long black hair, and wear a short cloth about the
head, and are always barefoot. The prince had three quite naked girls
dance for us. We took refreshments and then went to the ships. Those
gongs are made of brass [<i>metalo</i>] and are manufactured in the
regions about the Signio Magno<sup><a href="#n294" id="r294" name=
"r294">294</a></sup> which is called China. They are used in those
regions as we use bells and are called <i>aghon</i>.<sup><a href=

<p class="first">On Wednesday morning, as one of our men had died
during the previous night, the interpreter and I<sup><a href="#n296"
id="r296" name="r296">296</a></sup> went to ask the king where we could
bury him. We found the king surrounded by many men, of whom, after the
due reverence was made, I asked it.<sup><a href="#n297" id="r297" name=
"r297">297</a></sup> He replied, &ldquo;If I and my vassals all belong
to your sovereign, how much more ought the land.&rdquo; I told the king
that we would like to consecrate the place,<sup><a href="#n298" id=
"r298" name="r298">298</a></sup> and to set up a cross there. He
replied that he was quite satisfied, and that he wished to adore the
cross as did we. The deceased was buried in the square with as much
pomp as possible, in order to furnish a good example. Then we
consecrated the place, and in the evening buried another man. We
carried a quantity of merchandise ashore which we stored in a house.
The king took it under his care as well as four men who were left to
trade the goods by wholesale.<sup><a href="#n299" id="r299" name=

have weights and measures. They love <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

quiet. They have wooden balances, the bar of which has a cord in the
middle by which it is held. At one end is a bit of lead, and at the
other marks like quarter-libras, third-libras, and libras. When they
wish to weigh they take the scales which has three wires like ours, and
place it above the marks, and so weigh accurately.<sup><a href="#n300"

call <i>subin</i>. Their houses are constructed of wood, and are built
of planks and bamboo, raised high from the ground on large logs, and
one must enter them by means of ladders. They have rooms like ours; and
under the house they keep their swine, goats, and fowls. Large sea
snails [<i>corniolli</i>], beautiful to the sight, are found there
which kill whales. For the whale swallows them alive, and when they are
in the whale&rsquo;s body, they come out of their shells and eat the
whale&rsquo;s heart. Those people afterward find them alive near the
dead whale&rsquo;s heart. Those creatures have black teeth and skin and
a white shell, and the flesh is good to eat. They are called

<p class="first">On Sunday morning, April fourteen, forty men of us
went ashore, two of whom were completely armed and preceded the royal
banner.<sup><a href="#n307" id="r307" name="r307">307</a></sup> When we
reached land all the artillery was fired.<sup><a href="#n308" id="r308"
name="r308">308</a></sup> Those people followed us hither and thither.
The captain and the king embraced. The captain told the king that the
royal banner was not taken ashore except with fifty men armed as were
those two, and with fifty musketeers; but so great was his love for him
that he had thus brought the banner.<sup><a href="#n309" id="r309"
name="r309">309</a></sup> Then we all approached the platform joyfully.
The captain and the king sat down in chairs of red and violet
velvet,<sup><a href="#n310" id="r310" name="r310">310</a></sup> the
chiefs on cushions, and the others on mats.<sup><a href="#n311" id=
"r311" name="r311">311</a></sup> The captain told the king through the
interpreter that he thanked God for inspiring him to became a
Christian; and that [now] he would more easily conquer his enemies than
before. The king replied that he wished to become a Christian, but that
some of his chiefs did not wish to obey, because they said that they
were as good men as he. Then our captain had all the chiefs of the king
called, and told them that, unless they obeyed the king as their king,
he would have them killed, and would give their possessions to the
king. They replied that they would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157"
href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>obey him. The captain told
the king that he was going to Spagnia, but that he would return again
with so many forces that he would make him the greatest king of those
regions, as he had been the first to express a determination to become
a Christian. The king, lifting his hands to the sky, thanked the
captain, and requested him to let some of his men remain [with him], so
that he and his people might be better instructed in the faith. The
captain replied that he would leave two men to satisfy him, but that he
would like to take two of the children of the chiefs with him, so that
they might learn our language, who afterward on their return would be
able to tell the others the wonders [<i>cose</i>] of Spagnia. A large
cross was set up in the middle of the square. The captain told them
that if they wished to become Christians as they had declared on the
previous days, that they must burn all their idols and set up a cross
in their place. They were to adore that cross daily with clasped hands,
and every morning after their [<i>i.e.</i>, the Spaniards&rsquo;]
custom, they were to make the sign of the cross (which the captain
showed them how to make); and they ought to come hourly, at least in
the morning, to that cross, and adore it kneeling. The intention that
they had already declared, they were to confirm with good works. The
king and all the others wished to confirm it thoroughly. The
captain-general told the king that he was clad all in white to
demonstrate his sincere love toward them. They replied that they could
not respond to his sweet words. The captain led the king by the hand to
the platform while speaking these good words in order to baptize him.
He told the king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"
name="pb159">159</a>]</span>that he would call him Don Carlo, after his
sovereign the emperor; the prince, Don Fernando, after the
emperor&rsquo;s brother; the king of Mazaua, Johanni; a chief,
Fernando, after our chief, that is to say, the captain; the Moro,
Christoforo; and then the others, now one name, and now another. Five
hundred men were baptized before mass. After the conclusion of mass,
the captain invited the king and some of the other chiefs to dinner,
but they refused, accompanying us, however, to the shore. The ships
discharged all the mortars; and embracing, the king and chiefs and the
captain took leave of one another.<sup><a href="#n312" id="r312" name=

<p class="first">After dinner the priest and some of the others went
ashore to baptize the queen, who came with forty women. We conducted
her to the platform, and she was made to sit down upon a cushion, and
the other women near her, until the priest should be ready. She was
shown an image of our Lady, a very beautiful wooden child Jesus, and a
cross. Thereupon, she was overcome with contrition, and asked for
baptism amid her tears.<sup><a href="#n313" id="r313" name=
"r313">313</a></sup> We named her Johanna, after the emperor&rsquo;s
mother; her daughter, the wife of the prince, Catherina; the queen of
Mazaua, Lisabeta; and the others, each their [distinctive] name.
Counting men, women, and children, we baptized eight hundred
souls.<sup><a href="#n314" id="r314" name="r314">314</a></sup> The
queen was young and beautiful, and was entirely covered with a white
and black cloth. Her mouth and nails were very red, while on her head
she wore a large hat of palm leaves in the manner of a
parasol,<sup><a href="#n315" id="r315" name="r315">315</a></sup> with a
crown about it of the same leaves, like the tiara of the pope; and she
never goes any place without such a one.<sup><a href="#n316" id="r316"
name="r316">316</a></sup> She asked us to give her the little child
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>Jesus to keep in place of her
idols;<sup><a href="#n317" id="r317" name="r317">317</a></sup> and then
she went away. In the afternoon,<sup><a href="#n318" id="r318" name=
"r318">318</a></sup> the king and queen, accompanied by numerous
persons, came to the shore. Thereupon, the captain had many trombs of
fire and large mortars discharged, by which they were most highly
delighted.<sup><a href="#n319" id="r319" name="r319">319</a></sup> The
captain and the king called one another brothers. That king&rsquo;s
name was Raia Humabon. Before that week had gone, all the persons of
that island, and some from the other island, were baptized. We burned
one hamlet which was located in a neighboring island, because it
refused to obey the king or us. We set up the cross there for those
people were heathen. Had they been Moros, we would have erected a
column there as a token of greater hardness, for the Moros are much
harder to convert than the heathen.</p>

<p class="first">The captain-general went ashore daily during those
days to hear mass, and told the king many things regarding the
faith.<sup><a href="#n320" id="r320" name="r320">320</a></sup> One day
the queen came with great pomp to hear mass. Three girls preceded her
with three of her hats in their hands.<sup><a href="#n321" id="r321"

large silk scarf, crossed with gold stripes thrown over her head, which
covered her shoulders; and she had on her hat. A great number of women
accompanied her, who were all naked and barefoot, except that they had
a small covering of palm-tree cloth before their privies, and a small
scarf upon the head, and all with hair flowing free. The queen, having
made the due reverence to the altar, seated herself on a silk
embroidered cushion. Before the commencement of the mass, the captain
sprayed her and some of her women with musk rosewater, for they
delighted exceedingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=

knowing that the queen was very much pleased with the child Jesus, gave
it to her, telling her to keep it in place of her idols, for it was in
memory<sup><a href="#n322" id="r322" name="r322">322</a></sup> of the
son of God. Thanking him heartily she accepted it.</p>

<p class="first">Before mass one day, the captain-general had the king
come clad in his silk robe, and the chief men of the city, [to wit],
the king&rsquo;s brother and prince&rsquo;s father, whose name was
Bendara; another of the king&rsquo;s brothers, Cadaio; and certain ones
called Simiut, Sibuaia, Sisacai, Maghalibe, and many others whom I
shall not name in order not to be tedious.<sup><a href="#n323" id=

obedient to their king, and they kissed the latter&rsquo;s hand. Then
the captain had the king declare that he would always be obedient and
faithful to the king of Spagnia, and the king so swore.<sup><a href=
"#n324" id="r324" name="r324">324</a></sup> Thereupon, the captain drew
his Sword before the image of our Lady, and told the king that when
anyone so swore, he should prefer to die rather than to break such an
oath,<sup><a href="#n325" id="r325" name="r325">325</a></sup> if he
swore by that image, by the life of the emperor his sovereign, and by
his habit to be ever faithful. After the conclusion of that the captain
gave the king a red velvet chair, telling him that wherever he went he
should always have it carried before him by one of his nearest
relatives; and he showed him how it ought to be carried. The king
responded that he would do that willingly for love of him, and he told
the captain that he was making a jewel to give to him, namely, two
large earrings of gold to fasten<sup><a href="#n326" id="r326" name=

the elbows, and two other rings for the feet above the ankles, besides

<p class="first">One day the captain-general asked the king and the
other people why they did not burn their idols as they had promised
when they became Christians; and why they sacrificed so much flesh to
them. They replied that what they were doing was not for themselves,
but for a sick man who had not spoken now for four days, so that the
idols might give him health. He was the prince&rsquo;s brother, and the
bravest and wisest man in the island. The captain told them to burn
their idols and to believe in Christ, and that if the sick man were
baptized, he would quickly recover; and if that did not so happen they
could behead him [<i>i.e.</i>, the captain] then and there. Thereupon,
the king replied that he would do it, for he truly believed in Christ.
We made a procession from the square to the house of the sick man with
as much pomp as possible. There we found him in such condition that he
could neither speak nor move. We baptized him and his two wives, and x
girls. Then the captain had him asked how he felt. He spoke immediately
and said that by the grace of our Lord he felt very well. That was a
most manifest miracle [that happened] in our times. When the captain
heard him speak, he thanked God fervently. Then he made the sick man
drink some almond milk, which he had already had made for him.
Afterward he sent him a mattress, a pair of sheets, a coverlet of
yellow cloth, and a pillow. Until he recovered his health, the captain
sent him almond milk, rosewater, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167"
href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>oil of roses, and some sweet
preserves. Before five days the sick man began to walk. He had an idol
that certain old women had concealed in his house burned in the
presence of the king and all the people. He had many shrines along the
seashore destroyed,<sup><a href="#n328" id="r328" name=
"r328">328</a></sup> in which the consecrated meat was eaten. The
people themselves cried out &ldquo;Castiglia! Castiglia!&rdquo; and
destroyed<sup><a href="#n329" id="r329" name="r329">329</a></sup> those
shrines. They said that if God would lend them life, they would burn
all the idols that they could find, even if they were in the
king&rsquo;s house. Those idols are made of wood, and are hollow, and
lack the back parts. Their arms are open and their feet turned up under
them with the legs open. They have a large face with four huge tusks
like those of the wild boar; and are painted all over.</p>

<p class="first">In order that your most illustrious Lordship may know
the ceremonies that those people use in consecrating the swine, they
first sound those large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href=
"#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>gongs.<sup><a href="#n331" id=
"r331" name="r331">331</a></sup> Then three large dishes are brought
in; two with roses and with cakes of rice and millet, baked and wrapped
in leaves, and roast fish; the other with cloth of Cambaia<sup><a href=
"#n332" id="r332" name="r332">332</a></sup> and two standards made of
palm-tree cloth. One bit of cloth of Cambaia is spread on the ground.
Then two very old women come, each of whom has a bamboo trumpet in her
hand. When they have stepped upon the cloth they make obeisance to the
sun. Then they wrap the cloths about themselves. One of them puts a
kerchief with two horns on her forehead, and takes another kerchief in
her hands, and dancing and blowing upon her trumpet, she thereby calls
out to the sun. The other takes one of the standards and dances and
blows on her trumpet. They dance and call out thus for a little space,
saying many things between themselves to the sun. She with the kerchief
takes the other standard, and lets the kerchief drop, and both blowing
on their trumpets for a long time, dance about the bound hog. She with
the horns always speaks covertly to the sun, and the other answers her.
A cup of wine is presented to her of the horns, and she dancing and
repeating certain words, while the other answers her, and making
pretense four or five times of drinking the wine, sprinkles it upon the
heart of the hog. Then she immediately begins to dance again. A lance
is given to the same woman. She shaking it and repeating certain words,
while both of them continue to dance, and making motions four or five
times of thrusting the lance through the heart of the hog, with a
sudden and quick stroke, thrusts it through from one side to the other.
The wound is quickly stopped<sup><a href="#n333" id="r333" name=
"r333">333</a></sup> with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>grass. The one who has killed the
hog, taking in her mouth a lighted torch, which has been lighted
throughout that ceremony, extinguishes it.<sup><a href="#n334" id=
"r334" name="r334">334</a></sup> The other one dipping the end of her
trumpet in the blood of the hog, goes around marking with blood with
her finger first the foreheads of their husbands, and then the others;
but they never came to us. Then they divest themselves and go to eat
the contents of those dishes, and they invite only women [to eat with
them]. The hair is removed from the hog by means of fire. Thus no one
but old women consecrate the flesh of the hog, and they do not eat it
unless it is killed in this way.<sup><a href="#n335" id="r335" name=

<p class="first">Those people go naked, wearing but one piece of
palm-tree cloth about<sup><a href="#n336" id="r336" name=
"r336">336</a></sup> their privies. The males, large and small, have
their penis pierced from one side to the other near the head, with a
gold or tin bolt as large as a goose quill. In both ends of the same
bolt, some have what resembles a spur, with points upon the ends;
others are like the head of a cart nail. I very often asked many, both
old and young, to see their penis, because I could not credit it. In
the middle of the bolt is a hole, through which they urinate. The bolt
and the spurs always hold firm. They say that their women wish it so,
and that if they did otherwise they would not have communication with
them. When the men wish to have communication with their women, the
latter themselves take the penis not in the regular way and commence
very gently to introduce it [into their vagina], with the spur on top
first, and then the other part. When it is inside it takes its regular
position; and thus the penis always stays inside until it gets soft,
for otherwise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=

use of that device because they are of a weak nature. They have as many
wives as they wish, but one of them is the principal wife.<sup><a href=

went ashore, both by day and by night, every one invited him to eat and
to drink. Their viands are half cooked and very salty. They drink
frequently and copiously from the jars<sup><a href="#n338" id="r338"
name="r338">338</a></sup> through those small reeds, and one of their
meals lasts for five or six hours. The women loved us very much more
than their own men. All of the women from the age of six years and
upward, have their vaginas [<i>natura</i>] gradually opened because of
the men&rsquo;s penises.<sup><a href="#n339" id="r339" name=

<p class="first">They practice the following ceremonies when one of
their chiefs dies. First all the chief<sup><a href="#n340" id="r340"
name="r340">340</a></sup> women of the place go to the house of the
deceased. The deceased is placed in the middle of the house in a box.
Ropes are placed about the box in the manner of a palisade, to which
many branches of trees are attached. In the middle of each branch hangs
a cotton cloth like a curtained canopy. The most principal women sit
under those hangings, and are all covered with white cotton cloth, each
one by a girl who fans her with a palm-leaf fan. The other women sit
about the room sadly.<sup><a href="#n341" id="r341" name=
"r341">341</a></sup> Then there is one woman who cuts off the hair of
the deceased very slowly with a knife. Another who was the principal
wife of the deceased, lies down upon him, and places her mouth, her
hands, and her feet upon those of the deceased. When the former is
cutting off the hair, the latter weeps; and when the former finishes
the cutting, the latter sings. There are many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>porcelain jars containing fire about the room,
and myrrh, storax, and bezoin, which make a strong odor through the
house, are put on the fire. They keep the body in the house for five or
six days during those ceremonies. I believe that the body is anointed
with camphor. Then they bury the body and the same box which is shut in
a log by means of wooden nails and covered and enclosed by logs of
wood.<sup><a href="#n342" id="r342" name="r342">342</a></sup> Every
night about midnight in that city, a jet black bird as large as a crow
was wont to come, and no sooner had it thus reached the houses than it
began to screech, so that all the dogs began to howl; and that
screeching and howling would last for four or five hours,<sup><a href=

captain-general, and to say that he would send him all that he had
promised, but that he had not been able to send it to him because of
the other chief Cilapulapu, who refused to obey the king of Spagnia. He
requested the captain to send him only one boatload of men on the next
night, so that they might help him and fight against the other chief.
The captain-general decided to go thither with three boatloads. We
begged him repeatedly not to go, but he, like a good shepherd, refused
to abandon his flock. At midnight, sixty men of us set out armed with
corselets and helmets, together with the Christian king, the prince,
some of the chief men, and twenty or thirty balanguais. We reached
Matan three hours before dawn. The captain did not wish to fight then,
but sent a message to the natives by the Moro to the effect that if
they would obey the king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href=
"#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>of Spagnia, recognize the
Christian king as their sovereign, and pay us our tribute, he would be
their friend; but that if they wished otherwise, they should wait to
see how our lances wounded.<sup><a href="#n345" id="r345" name=
"r345">345</a></sup> They replied that if we had lances they had lances
of bamboo and stakes hardened with fire. [They asked us] not to proceed
to attack them at once, but to wait until morning, so that they might
have more men. They said that in order to induce us to go in search of
them; for they had dug certain pitholes between the houses in order
that we might fall into them. When morning came forty-nine of us leaped
into the water up to our thighs, and walked through water for more than
two crossbow flights before we could reach the shore. The boats could
not approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water. The other
eleven men remained behind to guard the boats. When we reached land,
those men had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one
thousand five hundred persons. When they saw us, they charged down upon
us with exceeding loud cries, two divisions on our flanks and the other
on our front. When the captain saw that, he formed us into two
divisions, and thus did we begin to fight. The musketeers and
crossbowmen shot from a distance for about a half-hour, but uselessly;
for the shots only passed through the shields which were made of thin
wood and the arms [of the bearers]. The captain cried to them,
&ldquo;Cease firing! cease firing!&rdquo; but his order was not at all
heeded. When the natives saw that we were shooting our muskets to no
purpose, crying out they determined to stand firm, but they redoubled
their shouts. When our muskets were discharged, the natives
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>would never stand still, but leaped hither and
thither, covering themselves with their shields. They shot so many
arrows at us and hurled so many bamboo spears (some of them tipped with
iron) at the captain-general, besides pointed stakes hardened with
fire, stones, and mud, that we could scarcely defend ourselves. Seeing
that the captain-general sent some men to burn their houses in order to
terrify them. When they saw their houses burning, they were roused to
greater fury. Two of our men were killed near the houses, while we
burned twenty or thirty houses. So many of them charged down upon us
that they shot the captain through the right leg with a poisoned arrow.
On that account, he ordered us to retire slowly, but the men took to
flight, except six or eight of us who remained with the captain. The
natives shot only at our legs, for the latter were bare; and so many
were the spears and stones that they hurled at us, that we could offer
no resistance. The mortars in the boats could not aid us as they were
too far away. So we continued to retire for more than a good crossbow
flight from the shore always fighting up to our knees in the water. The
natives continued to pursue us, and picking up the same spear four or
six times, hurled it at us again and again. Recognizing the captain, so
many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice,
but he always stood firmly like a good knight, together with some
others. Thus did we fight for more than one hour, refusing to retire
farther. An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain&rsquo;s face,
but the latter immediately killed him with his lance, which he left in
the Indian&rsquo;s body. Then, trying <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>to lay hand on sword,
he could draw it out but halfway, because he had been wounded in the
arm with a bamboo spear. When the natives saw that, they all hurled
themselves upon him. One of them wounded him on the left leg with a
large cutlass,<sup><a href="#n346" id="r346" name="r346">346</a></sup>
which resembles a scimitar, only being larger. That caused the captain
to fall face downward, when immediately they rushed upon him with iron
and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses, until they killed our
mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide. When they wounded
him, he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats.
Thereupon, beholding him dead, we, wounded, retreated, as best we
could, to the boats, which were already pulling off. The Christian king
would have aided us, but the captain charged him before we landed, not
to leave his balanghai, but to stay to see how we fought. When the king
learned that the captain was dead, he wept. Had it not been for that
unfortunate captain, not a single one of us would have been saved in
the boats, for while he was fighting the others retired to the boats. I
hope through [the efforts of] your most illustrious Lordship that the
fame of so noble a captain will not become effaced in our times. Among
the other virtues which he possessed, he was more constant than ever
any one else in the greatest of adversity. He endured hunger better
than all the others, and more accurately than any man in the world did
he understand sea charts<sup><a href="#n347" id="r347" name=
"r347">347</a></sup> and navigation. And that this was the truth was
seen openly, for no other had had so much natural talent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>nor
the boldness to learn how to circumnavigate the world, as he had almost
done. That battle was fought on Saturday, April twenty-seven,
1521.<sup><a href="#n348" id="r348" name="r348">348</a></sup> The
captain desired to fight on Saturday, because it was the day especially
holy to him. Eight of our men were killed with him in that
battle,<sup><a href="#n349" id="r349" name="r349">349</a></sup> and
four Indians, who had become Christians and who had come afterward to
aid us were killed by the mortars of the boats. Of the enemy, only
fifteen were killed, while many of us were wounded.</p>

the four men who had remained in the city to trade, had our merchandise
carried to the ships. Then we chose two commanders, namely, Duarte

was dead, he was not therefore free; on the contrary he [<i>i.e.</i>,
Barboza] would see <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"

were about to leave very soon, but that if he would follow his advice,
he could gain the ships and all our merchandise. Accordingly they

<p class="first">On Wednesday morning, the first of May, the Christian
king sent word to the commanders that the jewels<sup><a href="#n356"
id="r356" name="r356">356</a></sup> which he had promised to send to
the king of Spagnia were ready, and that he begged them and their other
companions to come to dine with him that morning, when he would give
them the jewels. Twenty-four men went ashore, among whom was our
astrologer, San Mart&iacute;n de Sivilla. I could not go because I was
all swollen up by a wound from a poisoned arrow which I had received in
my face. Jovan Carvaio and the constable<sup><a href="#n357" id="r357"

who had been cured by a miracle take the priest to his
house.<sup><a href="#n358" id="r358" name="r358">358</a></sup>
Consequently, they had left that place, because they suspected some
evil. Scarcely had they spoken those words when we heard loud cries and
lamentations. We immediately weighed anchor and discharging many
mortars into the houses, drew in nearer to the shore. While thus
discharging [our pieces] we saw Johan Seranno in his shirt bound and
wounded, crying to us not to fire any more, for the natives would kill

merchandise; but Johan Carvaio, his boon companion, [and others] would
not allow the boat to go ashore so that they might remain masters of
the ships.<sup><a href="#n360" id="r360" name="r360">360</a></sup> But
although Johan Serrano weeping asked us not to set sail so quickly, for
they would kill him, and said that he prayed God to ask his soul of
Johan Carvaio, his comrade, in the day of judgment, we immediately
departed. I do not know whether he is dead or alive.<sup><a href=

<td class="second">
<p class="first">In the midst of that archipelago,<sup><a href="#n377"
id="r377" name="r377">377</a></sup> at a distance of eighteen leguas
from that island of Zzubu, at the head of the other island called
Bohol, we burned the ship &ldquo;Conceptione,&rdquo; for too few men of
us were left [to work it].<sup><a href="#n378" id="r378" name=
"r378">378</a></sup> We stowed the best of its contents in the other
two ships, and the laid our course toward the south southwest, coasting
along the island called Panilongon,<sup><a href="#n379" id="r379" name=
"r379">379</a></sup> where black men like those in Etiopia live. Then
we came to a large island [Mindanao], whose king in order to make peace
with us, drew blood from his left hand marking his body, face, and the
tip of his tongue with it as a token of the closest friendship, and we
did the same. I went ashore alone with the king in order to see that
island. We had no sooner entered a river than many fishermen offered
fish to the king. Then the king removed the cloths which covered his
privies, as did some of his chiefs; and began to row while singing past
many dwellings which were upon the river. Two hours after nightfall we
reached the king&rsquo;s house. The distance from the beginning of the
river where our ships were to the king&rsquo;s house, was two leguas.
When we entered the house, we came upon many torches of cane and palm
leaves,<sup><a href="#n380" id="r380" name="r380">380</a></sup> which
were of the <i>anime</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>of which mention was made above.
Until the supper was brought in, the king with two of his chiefs and
two of his beautiful women drank the contents of a large jar of palm
wine without eating anything. I, excusing myself as I had supped, would
only drink but once. In drinking they observed all the same ceremonies
that the king of Mazaua did. Then the supper, which consisted of rice
and very salt<sup><a href="#n381" id="r381" name="r381">381</a></sup>
fish, and was contained in porcelain dishes, was brought in. They ate
their rice as if it were bread, and cook it after the following manner.
They first put in an earthen jar like our jars, a large leaf which
lines all of the jar. Then they add the water and the rice, and after
covering it allow it to boil until the rice becomes as hard as bread,
when it is taken out in pieces. Rice is cooked in the same way
throughout those districts.<sup><a href="#n382" id="r382" name=
"r382">382</a></sup> When we had eaten, the king had a reed mat and
another of palm leaves, and a leaf pillow brought in so that I might
sleep on them. The king and his two women went to sleep in a separate
place, while I slept with one of his chiefs.<sup><a href="#n383" id=
"r383" name="r383">383</a></sup> When day came and until the dinner was
brought in, I walked about that island. I saw many articles of gold in
those houses<sup><a href="#n384" id="r384" name="r384">384</a></sup>
but little food. After that we dined on rice and fish, and at the
conclusion of dinner, I asked the king by signs whether I could see the
queen. He replied that he was willing, and we went together to the
summit of a lofty hill, where the queen&rsquo;s house was located. When
I entered the house, I made a bow to the queen, and she did the same to
me, whereupon I sat down beside her. She was making a sleeping mat of
palm leaves. In the house there was hanging a number of porcelain jars
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>and four metal gongs&mdash;one of which was
larger than the second, while the other two were still
smaller&mdash;for playing upon. There were many male and female slaves
who served her. Those houses are constructed like those already
mentioned. Having taken our leave, we returned to the king&rsquo;s
house, where the king had us immediately served with refreshments of
sugarcane. The most abundant product of that island is gold. They
showed me certain large valleys,<sup><a href="#n385" id="r385" name=
"r385">385</a></sup> making me a sign that the gold there was as
abundant as the hairs of their heads, but they have no iron with which
to dig it, and they do not dare to go to the trouble [to get
it].<sup><a href="#n386" id="r386" name="r386">386</a></sup> That part
of the island belongs to the same land as Butuan and Calaghan, and lies
toward Bohol, and is bounded by Mazaua. As we shall return to that
island again, I shall say nothing further [now]. The afternoon having
waned, I desired to return to the ships. The king and the other chief
men wished to accompany me, and therefore we went in the same
balanghai.<sup><a href="#n387" id="r387" name="r387">387</a></sup> As
we were returning along the river, I saw, on the summit of a hill at
the right, three men suspended from one tree, the branches of which had
been cut away. I asked the king what was the reason for that, and he
replied that they were malefactors and robbers. Those people go naked
as do the others above mentioned. The king&rsquo;s name is Raia
Calanao.<sup><a href="#n388" id="r388" name="r388">388</a></sup> The
harbor is an excellent one. Rice, ginger, swine, goats, fowls, and
other things are to be found there. That port lies in a latitude of
eight degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred
and sixty-seven degrees<sup><a href="#n389" id="r389" name=
"r389">389</a></sup> from the line of demarcation. It is fifty leguas
from Zubu, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>and is called Chipit.<sup><a href="#n390" id=
"r390" name="r390">390</a></sup> Two days&rsquo; journey thence to the
northwest is found a large island called Lozon,<sup><a href="#n391" id=
"r391" name="r391">391</a></sup> where six or eight junks belonging to
the Lequian people go yearly.<sup><a href="#n392" id="r392" name=

cast anchor at an island not very large and almost uninhabited. The
people of that island are Moros and were banished from an island called
Burne. They go naked as do the others. They have blowpipes and small
quivers at their side, full of arrows and a poisonous herb. They have
daggers whose hafts are adorned with gold and precious gems, spears,
bucklers, and small cuirasses of buffalo horn.<sup><a href="#n393" id=

<p class="first">About twenty-five leguas to the west northwest from
the above island we found a large island, where rice, ginger, swine,
goats, fowls, figs one-half braza long and as thick as the arm
[<i>i.e.</i>, bananas] (they are excellent; and certain others are one
palmo and less in length, and are much better than all the others),
cocoanuts, camotes [<i>batate</i>], sugarcane, and roots resembling
turnips in taste, are found. Rice is cooked there under the fire in
bamboos or in wood; and it lasts better than that cooked in earthen
pots. We called that land the land of promise, because we suffered
great hunger before we found it. We were often on the point of
abandoning the ships and going ashore in order that we might not die of
hunger.<sup><a href="#n396" id="r396" name="r396">396</a></sup>

slightly in the breast with one of our knives, and upon bleeding,
touching the tip of his tongue and his forehead in token of the truest
peace, and we did the same. That island lies in a latitude of nine and
one-third degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and a longitude of one
hundred and seventy-one and one-third<sup><a href="#n397" id="r397"

<p class="first">Those people of Polaoan go naked as do the others.
Almost all<sup><a href="#n399" id="r399" name="r399">399</a></sup> of
them cultivate their fields. They have blowpipes with thick wooden
arrows more than one palmo long, with harpoon points, and others tipped
with fishbones, and poisoned with an herb; while others are tipped with
points of bamboo like harpoons and are poisoned.<sup><a href="#n400"
id="r400" name="r400">400</a></sup> At the end of the arrow they attach
a little piece of soft wood, instead of feathers. At the end of their
blowpipes they fasten a bit of iron like a spear head;<sup><a href=
"#n401" id="r401" name="r401">401</a></sup> and when they have shot all
their arrows they fight with that. They place a value on brass rings
and chains, bells, knives, and still more on copper wire for binding
their fishhooks. They have large and very tame cocks, which they do not
eat because of a certain veneration that they have for them. Sometimes
they make them fight with one another, and each one puts up a certain
amount on his cock, and the prize goes to him whose cock is the victor.
They have distilled rice wine which is stronger and better than that
made from the palm.<sup><a href="#n402" id="r402" name=

<p class="first">Ten leguas southwest of that island, we came to an
island, which, as we coasted by, seemed to us to be going upward. After
entering the port, the holy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=

Elmo&rsquo;s fire] appeared to us through the pitchy darkness. There is
a distance of fifty leguas<sup><a href="#n403" id="r403" name=
"r403">403</a></sup> from the beginning of that island to the port. On
the following day, July nine, the king of that island sent a very
beautiful prau to us, whose bow and stern were worked in gold. At the
bow flew a white and blue banner surmounted with peacock feathers. Some
men were playing on musical instruments [<i lang=
"it-1500">cinphonie</i>] and drums. Two <i>almadies</i><sup><a href=
"#n404" id="r404" name="r404">404</a></sup> came with that prau. Praus
resemble fustas, while the <i>almadies</i> are their small fishing
boats. Eight old men, who were chiefs, entered the ships and took seats
in the stern upon a carpet. They presented us with a painted wooden jar
full of betel and areca (the fruit which they chew continually), and
jessamine<sup><a href="#n405" id="r405" name="r405">405</a></sup> and
orange blossoms, a covering of yellow silk cloth, two cages full of
fowls, a couple of goats, three jarsful of distilled rice wine, and
some bundles of sugarcane. They did the same to the other ship, and
embracing us took their leave. The rice wine is as clear as water, but
so strong that it intoxicated many of our men. It is called <i lang=

<p class="first">When we reached the city, we remained about two hours
in the prau, until the arrival of two elephants with silk trappings,
and twelve men each of whom carried a porcelain jar covered with silk
in which to carry our presents. Thereupon, we mounted the elephants
while those twelve men preceded us afoot with the presents in the jars.
In this way we went to the house of the governor, where we were given a
supper of many kinds of food. During the night we slept on cotton
mattresses,<sup><a href="#n408" id="r408" name="r408">408</a></sup>
whose lining was of taffeta, and the sheets of Cambaia. Next day we
stayed in the house until noon. Then we went to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>king&rsquo;s palace upon elephants, with our
presents in front as on the preceding day. All the streets from the
governor&rsquo;s to the king&rsquo;s house were full of men with
swords, spears, and shields, for such were the king&rsquo;s orders. We
entered the courtyard of the palace mounted on the elephants. We went
up a ladder accompanied by the governor and other chiefs, and entered a
large hall full of many nobles,<sup><a href="#n409" id="r409" name=
"r409">409</a></sup> where we sat down upon a carpet with the presents
in the jars near us. At the end of that hall there is another hall
higher but somewhat smaller. It was all adorned with silk hangings, and
two windows, through which light entered the hall and hung with two
brocade curtains, opened from it. There were three hundred footsoldiers
with naked rapiers at their thighs in that hall to guard the
king.<sup><a href="#n410" id="r410" name="r410">410</a></sup> At the
end of the small hall was a large window from which a brocade curtain
was drawn aside so that we could see within it the king seated at a
table with one of his young sons chewing betel.<sup><a href="#n411" id=
"r411" name="r411">411</a></sup> No one but women were behind him. Then
a chief told us that we could not speak to the king, and that if we
wished anything, we were to tell it to him, so that he could
communicate it to one of higher rank. The latter would communicate it
to a brother of the governor who was stationed in the smaller hall, and
this man would communicate it by means of a speaking-tube through a
hole in the wall to one who was inside with the king. The chief taught
us the manner of making three obeisances to the king with our hands
clasped above the head, raising first one foot and then the other and
then kissing the hands toward him, and we did so, that being the method
of the royal obeisance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href=
"#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>We told the king that we came from
the king of Spagnia, and that the latter desired to make peace with him
and asked only for permission to trade. The king had us told that since
the king of Spagnia desired to be his friend, he was very willing to be
his, and said that we could take water and wood, and trade at our
pleasure. Then we gave him the presents, on receiving each of which he
nodded slightly. To each one of us was given some brocaded and gold
cloth and silk, which were placed upon our left shoulders, where they
were left but a moment.<sup><a href="#n412" id="r412" name=
"r412">412</a></sup> They presented us with refreshments of cloves and
cinnamon, after which the curtains were drawn to and the windows
closed. The men in the palace were all attired in cloth of gold and
silk which covered their privies, and carried daggers with gold hafts
adorned with pearls and precious gems, and they had many rings on their
hands. We returned upon the elephants to the governor&rsquo;s house,
seven men carrying the king&rsquo;s presents to us and always preceding
us. When we reached the house, they gave each one of us his present,
placing them upon our left shoulders. We gave each of those men a
couple of knives for his trouble. Nine men came to the governor&rsquo;s
house with a like number of large wooden trays from the king. Each tray
contained ten or twelve porcelain dishes full of veal, capons,
chickens, peacocks, and other animals, and fish. We supped on the
ground upon a palm mat from thirty or thirty-two different kinds of
meat besides the fish and other things. At each mouthful of food we
drank a small cupful of their distilled wine from a porcelain cup the
size of an egg. We ate rice and other sweet food <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>with
gold spoons like ours. In our sleeping quarters there during those two
nights, two torches of white wax were kept constantly alight in two
rather tall silver candlesticks, and two large lamps full of oil with
four wicks apiece and two men to snuff them continually. We went
elephant-back to the seashore, where we found two praus which took us
back to the ships. That city<sup><a href="#n413" id="r413" name=
"r413">413</a></sup> is entirely built in salt water, except the houses
of the king and certain chiefs. It contains twenty-five thousand fires
[<i>i.e.</i>, families].<sup><a href="#n414" id="r414" name=
"r414">414</a></sup> The houses are all constructed of wood and built
up from the ground on tall pillars. When the tide is high the women go
in boats through the settlement [<i>tera</i>] selling the articles
necessary to maintain life. There is a large brick wall in front of the
king&rsquo;s house with towers like a fort, in which were mounted
fifty-six bronze [<i>metalo</i>] pieces, and six of iron. During the
two days of our stay there, many pieces were discharged. That king is a
Moro and his name is Raia Siripada. He was forty years old and
corpulent. No one serves him except women who are the
daughters<sup><a href="#n415" id="r415" name="r415">415</a></sup> of
chiefs. He never goes outside of his palace, unless when he goes
hunting, and no one is allowed to talk with him except through the
speaking tube. He has x scribes, called Xiritoles,<sup><a href="#n416"
id="r416" name="r416">416</a></sup> who write down his deeds on very
thin tree bark.</p>

<p class="first">On Monday morning, July twenty-nine, we saw more than
one hundred praus divided into three squadrons and a like number of
tunguli <sup><a href="#n417" id="r417" name="r417">417</a></sup> (which
are their small boats) coming toward us. Upon catching sight of them,
imagining that there was some trickery afoot, we hoisted our sails as
quickly as possible, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223"
name="pb223">223</a>]</span>abandoning an anchor in our haste. We
expected especially that we were to be captured in between certain
junks which had anchored behind us on the preceding day. We immediately
turned upon the latter, capturing four of them and killing many
persons. Three or four of the junks sought flight by beaching. In one
of the junks which we captured was the son of the king of the island of
Lozon. He was the captain-general of the king of Burne, and came with
those junks from a large city named Laoe,<sup><a href="#n418" id="r418"
name="r418">418</a></sup> which is located at the end of that island
[<i>i.e.</i>, Borneo] toward Java Major. He had destroyed and sacked
that city because it refused to obey the king [of Burne], but the king
of Java Major instead. Giovan Carvaio, our pilot, allowed that captain
and the junks to go without our consent, for a certain sum of gold, as
we learned afterward. Had the pilot not given up the captain to the
king, the latter would have given us whatever we had asked, for that
captain was exceedingly feared throughout those regions, especially by
the heathens, as the latter are very hostile to that Moro king. In that
same port there is another city inhabited by heathens, which is larger
than that of the Moros, and built like the latter in salt water. On
that account the two peoples have daily combats together in that same
harbor. The heathen king is as powerful as the Moro king, but is not so
haughty, and could be converted easily to the Christian faith. When the
Moro king heard how we had treated the junks, he sent us a message by
one of our men who was ashore to the effect that the praus were not
coming to do us any harm, but that they were going to attack the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>heathens. As a proof of that statement, the
Moros showed him some heads of men who had been killed, which they
declared to be the heads of heathens. We sent a message to the king,
asking him to please allow two of our men who were in the city for
purposes of trade and the son of Johan Carvaio, who had been born in
the country of Verzin, to come to us, but the king refused. That was
the consequences of Johan Carvaio letting the above captain go. We kept
sixteen of the chiefest men [of the captured junks] to take them to
Spagnia, and three women in the queen&rsquo;s name, but Johan Carvaio
usurped the latter for himself.<sup><a href="#n419" id="r419" name=

<p class="first">Junks are their ships and are made in the following
manner. The bottom part is built about two palmos above the water and
is of planks fastened with wooden pegs, which are very well made; above
that they are entirely made of very large bamboos. They have a bamboo
as a counterweight. One of those junks carries as much cargo as a ship.
Their masts are of bamboo, and the sails of the bark of
trees.<sup><a href="#n420" id="r420" name="r420">420</a></sup> Their
porcelain is a sort of exceedingly white earth which is left for fifty
years under the earth before it is worked, for otherwise it would not
be fine. The father buries it for the son. If [poison] is placed in a
dish made of fine porcelain, the dish immediately breaks.<sup><a href=

is equivalent to two hundred and three cathils), of wax for 160 cathils
of bronze [<i>metalo</i>]; one bahar of salt for eighty cathils of

ships. Consequently, we entered it; but as we lacked many things for
repairing the ships, we delayed there for forty-two days. During that
time, each one of us labored hard, one at one thing and one at another.
Our greatest fatigue however was to go barefoot to the woods for wood.
In that island there are wild boars, of which we killed one which was
going by water from one island to another [by pursuing it] with the
small boat. Its head was two and one-half palmos long,<sup><a href=
"#n436" id="r436" name="r436">436</a></sup> and its teeth were large.
There are found large crocodiles, both on land and sea, oysters and
shellfish of various kinds. Among the last named we found two, the
flesh of one of which weighed twenty-six libras, and the other
forty-four.<sup><a href="#n437" id="r437" name="r437">437</a></sup> We
caught a fish, which had a head like that of a hog and two horns. Its
body consisted entirely of one bone, and on its back it resembled a
saddle; and it was small.<sup><a href="#n438" id="r438" name=

which are alive when they fall, and walk. Those leaves are quite like
those of the mulberry, but are not so long. On both sides near the
stem, which is short and pointed, they have two feet. They have no
blood, but if one touches<sup><a href="#n439" id="r439" name=

days in a box. When I opened the box, that leaf went round and round

as they refused to haul them in, we captured <span class=

wished his freedom, he was to give us, inside of seven days, four
hundred measures of rice, twenty swine, twenty goats, and one hundred
and fifty fowls. After that he presented us with cocoanuts, figs
[<i>i.e.</i>, bananas], sugarcanes, jars full of palm wine, and other
things. Seeing his liberality, we returned some of his daggers and
arquebuses to him, giving him in addition, a flag, a yellow damask
robe, and xv brazas of cloth; to his son, a cloak of blue cloth; to a
brother of the governor, a robe of green cloth and other things; and we
parted from them as friends. We turned our course back between the
island of Cagaian and the port of Cippit, and laid our course east by
south in order that we might find the islands of Malucho. We passed by
certain reefs [<i>literally</i>: small elevations] near which we found
the sea to be full of grass, although the depth was very great. When we
passed through them, it seemed as though we were entering another sea.
Leaving Chipit to the east, we found two island, Zolo and
Taghima,<sup><a href="#n442" id="r442" name="r442">442</a></sup> which

Zolo, who told him that her father had those two pearls. The king
determined to get possession of them by hook or by crook. Going one
night with five hundred praus,<sup><a href="#n444" id="r444" name=

two days, those people would have laden our ships for us, but as we had
a wind favorable for passing a point and certain islets which were near

large knives which we had taken from the governor of Pulaoan for
seventeen libras [of cinnamon]. The cinnamon tree grows to a height of
three or four cubits, and as thick as the fingers of the hand. It has
but three or four small branches and its leaves resemble those of the
laurel. Its bark is the cinnamon, and it is gathered twice per year.
The wood and leaves are as strong as the cinnamon when they are green.

two [abovementioned islands]. The pilot who still remained with us told
us that those four islands were Maluco. Therefore, we thanked God and
as an expression of our joy discharged all our artillery. It was no
wonder that we were so glad, for we had passed twenty-seven months less
two days in our search for Malucho.<sup><a href="#n461" id="r461" name=

that we found was at a depth of one or two hundred brazas,
notwithstanding the assertion of the Portuguese that that region could
not be navigated because of the numerous shoals and the dark sky as
they have imagined.<sup><a href="#n462" id="r462" name=

<p class="first">Three hours before sunset on Friday, November eight,
1521,<sup><a href="#n463" id="r463" name="r463">463</a></sup> we
entered into a harbor of an island called Tadore, and anchoring near
the shore in twenty brazas we fired all our artillery. Next day the
king came to the ships in a prau, and circled about them once. We
immediately went to meet him with the small boat, in order to show him
honor. He made us enter his prau and seat ourselves near him. He was
seated under a silk awning which sheltered him on all sides. In front
of him was one of his sons with the royal scepter, and two persons with
two gold jars to pour water on his hands, and two others with two
gilded caskets filled with their betel. The king told us that we were
welcome there, and that he had dreamt some time ago that some ships
were coming to Malucho from remote parts; and that for more assurance
he had determined to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253"
name="pb253">253</a>]</span>consult the moon,<sup><a href="#n464" id=
"r464" name="r464">464</a></sup> whereupon he had seen the ships were
coming, and that we were they. Upon the king entering our ships all
kissed his hand and then we led him to the stern. When he entered
inside there, he would not stoop, but entered from above.<sup><a href=
"#n465" id="r465" name="r465">465</a></sup> Causing him to sit down in
a red velvet chair, we clothed him in a yellow velvet robe made in the
Turkish fashion. In order to show him greater honor, we sat down on the
ground near him. Then when all were seated, the king began to speak and
said that he and all his people desired ever to be the most loyal
friends and vassals to our king of Spagnia. He received us as his
children, and we could go ashore as if in our own houses, for from that
time thenceforth, his island was to be called no more Tadore but
Castiglia, because of the great love which he bore to our king, his
sovereign. We made him a present which consisted of the robe, the
chair, a piece of delicate linen, four brazas of scarlet cloth, a piece
of brocaded silk, a piece of yellow damask, some Indian cloth
embroidered with gold and silk, a piece of <i>berania</i> (the white
linen of Cambaia), two caps, six strings of glass beads, twelve knives,
three large mirrors, six pairs of scissors, six combs, some gilded
drinking-cups,<sup><a href="#n466" id="r466" name="r466">466</a></sup>
and other articles. To his son we gave an Indian cloth of gold and
silk, a large mirror, a cap, and two knives;<sup><a href="#n467" id=
"r467" name="r467">467</a></sup> and to each of nine others&mdash;all
of them his chiefs&mdash;a silk cloth, caps, and two knives; and to
many others caps or knives. We kept giving presents until the king bade
us desist. After that he declared to us that he had nothing else except
his own life to send to the king his sovereign. We were to approach
nearer to the city, and whoever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255"
href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>came to the ships at night,
we were to kill with our muskets. In leaving the stern, the king would
never bend his head.<sup><a href="#n468" id="r468" name=
"r468">468</a></sup> When he took his leave we discharged all the guns.
That king is a Moro and about forty-five years old. He is well built
and has a royal presence,<sup><a href="#n469" id="r469" name=
"r469">469</a></sup> and is an excellent astrologer. At that time he
was clad in a shirt of the most delicate white stuff with the ends of
the sleeves embroidered in gold, and in a cloth that reached from his
waist to the ground. He was barefoot, and had a silk scarf wrapped
about his head [his head, <i>doublet in original MS.</i>], and above it
a garland of flowers. His name is Raia Sultan Manzor.<sup><a href=

was having built new, carrying the royal signature and banner; and
therefore he was the king&rsquo;s servant for a long time. He begged us
to leave him some men so that he might constantly be reminded of the
king of Spagnia. He did not ask for merchandise because the latter
would not remain with him.<sup><a href="#n474" id="r474" name=

<p class="first">In order that your most illustrious Lordship may know
the islands where cloves grow, they are five, [namely], Tarenatte,
Tadore, Mutir, Machian, and Bachian. Tarenate is the chief one, and
when its king was alive, he ruled nearly all the others. Tadore, the
one where we were, has a king. Mutir and Machian have no king but are
ruled by the people, and when the two kings of Tarenate and of Tadore
engage in war, those two islands furnish them with men. The last island
is Bachian, and it has a king. That entire province where cloves grow
is called Malucho.<sup><a href="#n475" id="r475" name=
"r475">475</a></sup> At that time it was not eight months since one
Francesco Seranno<sup><a href="#n476" id="r476" name=
"r476">476</a></sup> had died in Tarenate. [He was] a Portuguese and
the captain-general of the king of Tarenate and opposed the king of
Tadore. He did so well that he constrained the king of Tadore to give
one of his daughters to wife to the king of Tarenate, and almost all
the sons of the chiefs as hostages. The above mentioned grandson of the
king of Tadore was born to that daughter. Peace having been made
between the two kings, and when Francesco Seranno came one day to
Tadore to trade cloves, the king of Tadore had him poisoned with the
said betel leaves. He lived only four days. His king wished to have him
buried according to his law [<i>i.e.</i>, with Mahometan rites], but
three Christians who were his servants would not consent to it. He left
a son and a daughter, both young, born by a woman whom he had taken to
wife in Java Major, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259"
name="pb259">259</a>]</span>and two hundred bahars of cloves. He was a
close friend and a relative of our royal captain-general, and was the
cause of inciting the latter to undertake that enterprise, for when our
captain was at Malacha, he had written to him several times that he was
in Tarenate. As Don Manuel, then king of Portugal, refused to increase
our captain-general&rsquo;s pension by only a single testoon per month
for his merits, the latter went to Spagnia, where he had obtained
everything for which he could ask from his sacred Majesty.<sup><a href=
"#n477" id="r477" name="r477">477</a></sup> Ten days after the death of
Francesco Seranno, the king of Tarenate, by name, Raya Abuleis, having
expelled his son-in-law, the king of Bachian, was poisoned by his
daughter, the wife of the latter king, under pretext of trying to bring
about peace between the two kings. The king lingered but two days, and
left nine principal sons, whose names are Chechili Momuli, Jadore
Vunighi, Chechili de Roix, Cili Manzur, Cili Pagi, Chialin, Chechilin
Cathara, Vaiechu Serich, and Calano Ghapi.<sup><a href="#n478" id=

Tarenate, [to wit], Chechili de Roix, came to the ships clad in red
velvet. He had two praus and his men were playing upon the
abovementioned gongs. He refused to enter the ship at that time. He had
[charge of] the wife and children, and the other possessions of
Francesco Seranno. When we found out who he was, we sent a message to
the king, asking him whether we should receive Chechili de Roix, since
we were in his port, and he replied to us that we could do as we
pleased. But the son of the king, seeing that we were hesitating, moved
off somewhat from the ships. We went to him with the <span class=

immediately departed. He had a Christian Indian with him named Manuel,
the servant of one Petro Alfonso de Lorosa,<sup><a href="#n479" id=

<p class="first">Those kings have as many women as they wish, but only
one chief wife, whom all the others obey. The abovesaid king of Tadore
had a large house outside of the city, where two hundred of his chief
women lived with a like number of women to serve them. When the king
eats, he sits alone or with his chief wife in a high place like a
gallery whence he can see all the other women who sit about the
gallery; and he orders her who best pleases him to sleep with him that
night. After the king has finished eating, if he orders those women to
eat together, they do so, but if not, each one goes to eat in her own
chamber. No one is allowed to see those women without permission from
the king, and if anyone is found near the king&rsquo;s house by day or
by night, he is put to death. Every family is obliged to give the king
one or two of its daughters. That king had twenty-six children, eight
sons, and the rest daughters. Lying next that island there is a very
large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>island, called Giailolo [<i>i.e.</i>, Gilolo],
which is inhabited by Moros and heathens. Two kings are found there
among the Moros, one of them, as we were told by the king, having had
six hundred children, and the other five hundred and
twenty-five.<sup><a href="#n481" id="r481" name="r481">481</a></sup>
The heathens do not have so many women; nor do they live under so many
superstitions, but adore for all that day the first thing that they see
in the morning when they go out of their houses. The king of those
heathens, called Raya Papua, is exceedingly rich in gold, and lives in
the interior of the island. Reeds as thick around as the leg and filled
with water that is very good to drink, grow on the flinty rocks in the
island of Giaiallo.<sup><a href="#n482" id="r482" name=

<p class="first">On Tuesday, November twelve, the king had a house
built for us in the city in one day for our merchandise. We carried
almost all of our goods thither, and left three of our men to guard
them. We immediately began to trade in the following manner. For x
brazas of red cloth of very good quality, they gave us one bahar of
cloves, which is equivalent to four quintals and six libras; for
fifteen brazas of cloth of not very good quality, one quintal and one
hundred libras; for fifteen hatchets, one bahar; for thirty-five glass
drinking-cups, one bahar (the king getting them all); for seventeen
cathils of cinnabar, one bahar; for seventeen cathils of quicksilver,
one bahar; for twenty-six brazas of linen, one bahar; for twenty-five
brazas of finer linen, one bahar; for one hundred and fifty knives, one

king wished for himself. Many of those things [that we traded] were
from the abovementioned junks which we had captured. Our haste to
return to Spagnia made us dispose of our merchandise at better bargains
[to the natives] than we should have done.<sup><a href="#n485" id=

fowls, figs [<i>i.e.</i>, bananas], cocoanuts, and other kinds of food
were brought to the ships, that we were surprised. We supplied the
ships with good water, which issues forth hot [from the ground], but if
it stands for the space of an hour outside its spring, it becomes very
cold, the reason therefor being that it comes from the mountain of
cloves. This is quite the opposite from the assertion in Spagnia that
water must be carried to Maluco from distant parts.<sup><a href="#n486"

<p class="first">On Wednesday, the king sent his son, named Mossahap,
to Mutir, so that they might supply us more quickly. On that day we
told the king that we had captured certain Indians. The king thanked
God heartily, and asked us to do him the kindness to give him their
persons, so that he might send them back to their land, with five of
his own men, in order that they might make the king of Spagnia and his
fame known. Then we gave him the three women who had been captured in
the queen&rsquo;s name for the reason already advanced. Next day, we
gave the king all the prisoners, except those from Burne, for which he
thanked us fervently. Thereupon, he asked us, in order thereby to show

<p class="first">[<i>Note</i>: In the following notes, citations from
Richard Eden are made from Arber&rsquo;s reprint <i>The first three
English books on America</i> (Birmingham, 1885), from the third book,
entitled <i>The decades of the newe worlde</i>, first printed in London
in 1555; from Mosto, from <i lang="it">Il primo viaggio, intorno al
globo di Antonio Pigafetta</i>, by Andrea da Mosto (Roma, 1894), which
was published as a portion of part v of volume iii of <i lang=
"it">Raccolta di documenti e studi pubblicati dalla R. Commissione
Colombiana pel quarto centenario dalla scoperta dell&rsquo;America</i>,
appearing under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction; and
from Stanley, from his <i>First voyage round the world, by Magellan</i>
(Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1874), which was translated by
Lord Stanley in part from the longer French MS. in the <span lang=
"fr">Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale</span>, Paris, and in part from the
Amoretti publication (Milan, 1800) made from the Italian MS. in the
Biblioteca Ambrosiana.]</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r1" id="n1" name="n1">1</a></sup> The greater part of
the life of Antonio Pigafetta is shrouded in darkness. The Pigafetta
family, who resided at Venice, and was formerly of Tuscan origin, dates
back before him for several centuries. The Pigafetta escutcheon was
white above and black below with a white transverse bar running from
left to right. On the lower part were three red roses, one of them on
the bar. The old family house is still standing and shows the motto
<i lang="it">Il nest rose sans espine</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;No rose
without a thorn,&rdquo; which was probably carved in 1481, when the
house was repaired, and not by Antonio Pigafetta after his return from
his voyage as some assert. Antonio Pigafetta was born toward the close
of the fifteenth century, but the date cannot be positively fixed, some
declaring it to be 1491; but Harrisse who follows Marzari, gives the
date as 1480. It is unknown who his parents were and some have asserted
that he was a natural child, although this is evidently unfounded, as
he was received into the military order of St. John. At an early age he
probably became familiar with the sea and developed his taste for
traveling. He went to Spain with the Roman ambassador Chieregato, in
1519, but in what capacity is unknown. Hearing details of
Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s intended voyage he contrived to accompany him.
Navarrete surmises that he is the Antonio Lombardo mentioned in the
list of the captain&rsquo;s servants and volunteers who sailed on the
expedition, so called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>as his country was Lombardy. After
the return of the &ldquo;Victoria,&rdquo; he journeyed in Spain,
Portugal, and France, and returned to Italy probably in January, 1523.
The relation presented by him to C&aacute;rlos I was probably a draft
of his notes taken daily throughout the voyage. His <i>Relation</i> as
we know it was undertaken at the request of the marchioness of Mantova,
but its composition was arrested by an order from Clement VII to come
to Rome, whither he went in December, 1523, or January, 1524, meeting
Villiers l&rsquo;Isle-Adam on his journey thither. He remained in the
pope&rsquo;s service but a short time, for in April, 1524, he was back
in Venice. That same year he was granted a copyright on his
<i>Relation</i>, which he intended to print, for twenty years. Pozzo
says that he was received into the Order of St. John, October 3, 1524,
but it was probably somewhat before that date. Between the dates of
August, 1524, and August, 1530, his work was presented to Villiers
l&rsquo;Isle-Adam. Nothing further is known of him, though some say
that he fought against the Turks as late as 1536, while others have
placed his death in 1534 or 1535 and at Malta. In addition to his
<i>Relation</i> Pigafetta wrote a <i>Treatise on the art of
navigation</i>, which follows his <i>Relation</i>. This is not
presented in the present publication, notwithstanding its importance,
as being outside of the present scope. It is reproduced by Mosto. He
has sometimes been confused with Marcantonio Pigafetta (a Venetian
gentleman), the author of <i>Itinerario da Vienna a Constantinopoli</i>
(London, 1585); and wrongly called Vincenzo Antonio Pigafetta, the
&ldquo;Vincenzo&rdquo; being an error for &ldquo;vicentino,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Venetian.&rdquo; See Mosto, <i lang="it">Il primo
viaggio ... di Antonio Pigafetta</i> (Roma, 1894), pp. 13&ndash;30;

Throughout this <i>Relation</i> Pigafetta&rsquo;s spelling of proper
names is retained.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r3" id="n3" name="n3">3</a></sup> Philippe de
Villiers l&rsquo;Isle-Adam, the forty-third grand master of the Order
of the Knights of St. John (called Knights of Malta after 1530), was
born of an old and distinguished family at Beauvais, in 1464, and died
at Malta, August 21, 1534, at grief, some say, over the dissensions in
his order. He was elected grand master of his order in 1521 and in the
following year occurred his heroic defense of Rhodes with but four
thousand five hundred soldiers against the huge fleet and army of
Soliman. After six months he was compelled to surrender his stronghold
in October, and refusing Soliman&rsquo;s entreaties to remain with him,
went to Italy. In 1524 he was given the city of Viterbe by Clement VII,
where in June of 1527 he held a general chapter of his order, at which
it was decided to accept the island of Malta which had been offered by
Charles V. The gift was confirmed by the letters-patent of Charles V in
1530, and Villiers l&rsquo;Isle-Adam <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>Adam went thither in
October of that year. He was always held in high esteem for his
bravery, prudence, and piety. See Moreri&rsquo;s <i>Dictionaire</i>,
and Larousse&rsquo;s <i>Dictionnaire</i>.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r4" id="n4" name="n4">4</a></sup> The four MSS. of
Pigafetta&rsquo;s <i>Relation</i> are those known as the Ambrosian or
Italian, so called from its place of deposit, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana
in Milan; no. 5,650, conserved in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale,
Paris, in French; no. 24,224, in the same library, also in French; and
the Nancy MS. (also French) so called because it was conserved in
Nancy, France, now owned by the heirs of Sir Thomas Phillips,
Cheltenham, England. The MSS. of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale are
both shorter than the Italian MS. The Nancy MS. is said to be the most
complete of the French manuscripts. The best bibliographical account of
these four MSS. that has yet appeared is by Mosto <i lang="la">ut
supra</i>. A full bibliographical account of both the MSS. and printed
books will be given in the volume on bibliography in this series.</p>
<p>There are a number of radical differences between the Paris MS. no.
5,650 (which will be hereafter referred to simply as MS. 5,650) and the
Italian MS., these differences including paragraph structure and the
division of MS. 5,650 into various chapters, although the sequence is
on the whole identical. The most radical of the differences will be
shown in these notes. MS. 5,650 contains the following title on the
page immediately preceding the beginning of the relation proper:
&ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">Navigation and discovery of Upper Indie,
written by me, Anthoyne Pigaphete, a Venetian, and knight of
Rhodes.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r5" id="n5" name="n5">5</a></sup> The emperor Charles
V; but he was not elected to that dignity until June, 1519. Pigafetta
writing after that date is not explicit.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r6" id="n6" name="n6">6</a></sup> Francesco
Chiericati was born in Venice, in one of the most ancient and famous
families of that city, at the end of the fifteenth century. He attained
pre&euml;minence at Sienna in both civil and ecclesiastical law. Aided
by Cardinal Matteo Lang, bishop of Sion, he was received among the
prelates of the apostolic palace. Later he conducted several diplomatic
missions with great skill. He left Rome for Spain in December, 1518, on
a private mission for the pope, and especially to effect a crusade
against the Turks who were then invading Egypt and threatening
Christianity. His house at Barcelona became the meeting-place of the
savants of that day who discussed literature and science. See Mosto, p.
19, note 3.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r7" id="n7" name="n7">7</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;scholars and men of understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r8" id="n8" name="n8">8</a></sup> MS. 5,650 reads:
&ldquo;so that I might satisfy the wish of the said gentlemen and also
my own desire, so that it could be said that I had made the said voyage
and indeed been an eyewitness of the things hereafter written.&rdquo;

VII, who assumed the papacy November 19, 1523. Pigafetta was summoned
to Rome very soon after Clement&rsquo;s election, for he was in Rome
either in December, 1523, or January, 1524.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r13" id="n13" name="n13">13</a></sup> The Amoretti
edition (Milan, 1800; a wofully garbled adaptation of the Italian MS.)
wrongly ascribes this desire to Clement VII, instead of Villiers
L&rsquo;Isle-Adam. See Stanley, p. 36, note 3.</p>

reads: &ldquo;Finally, most illustrious Lordship, after all provisions
had been made and the ships were in readiness, the captain-general, a
wise and virtuous man, and one mindful of his honor, would not commence
his voyage without first making some good and suitable rules, such as
it is the approved custom to make for those who go to sea, although he
did not entirely declare the voyage that he was about to make lest
those men, through astonishment and fear, should refuse to accompany
him on the so long voyage that he had determined upon. In consideration
of the furious and violent storms that reign on the Ocean Sea where he
was about to sail, and in consideration of another reason also, namely,
that the masters and captains of the other ships in his fleet had no
liking for him (the reason for which I know not, unless because he, the
captain-general, was a Portuguese, and they Spaniards or Castilians,
who have for a long while been biased and ill-disposed toward one
another, but who, in spite of that, rendered him obedience), he made
his rules such as follow, so that his ships might not go astray or
become separated from one another during storms at sea. He published
those rules and gave them in writing to every master in the ships and
ordered them to be inviolably observed and kept, unless for urgent and
legitimate excuse, and the proof that any other action was
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r15" id="n15" name="n15">15</a></sup> A Spanish word,
meaning &ldquo;lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r16" id="n16" name="n16">16</a></sup> Mosto wrongly
derives <i>strengue</i> from the Spanish <i>trenza</i>
&ldquo;braid&rdquo; or &ldquo;twist.&rdquo; Instead it is the Spanish
word <i>estrenque</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>which denotes a large rope made
from Spanish grass hemp (<i>stipa</i>)&mdash;known to the Spaniards as
<i>esparto</i>. MS. 5,650 reads: &ldquo;Sometimes he set out a lantern;
at other times a thick rush cord which was lighted and was called
&lsquo;trenche&rsquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, &lsquo;estrenque,&rsquo;
&lsquo;rope of Spanish grass hemp&rsquo;].&rdquo; Barcio
(<i>Diccionario general etimol&oacute;gico</i>) says that the origin of
<i>estrenque</i> is unknown.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r17" id="n17" name="n17">17</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;If he wished the other ships to haul in a bonnet-sail,
which was a part of the sail attached to the mainsail, he showed three
lights. Also by three lights notwithstanding that the weather might be
favorable for making better time, it was understood that the
bonnet-sail was to be hauled in, so that the mainsail might be sooner
and easier struck and furled when bad weather came suddenly in any
squall or otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r18" id="n18" name="n18">18</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;which he had extinguished immediately after;&rdquo; and
continues: &ldquo;then showing a single light as a sign that he
intended to stop there and wait until the other ships should do as
he.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r19" id="n19" name="n19">19</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;that is to say, a rock in the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r20" id="n20" name="n20">20</a></sup> Stanley
translates the following passage wrongly. Rightly translated, it is:
&ldquo;Also when he desired the bonnet-sail to be reattached to the
sail, he showed three fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r21" id="n21" name="n21">21</a></sup> This passage is
omitted in MS. 5,650.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r22" id="n22" name="n22">22</a></sup> <i>Hora de la
modorra</i> is in Spanish that part of the night immediately preceding
the dawn. Mosto, p. 52, note 8.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r23" id="n23" name="n23">23</a></sup> <i>Contra
maestro</i> (boatswain) corresponding to the French contrema&icirc;tre
and the Spanish <i lang="es">contramaestre</i>, was formerly the third
officer of a ship&rsquo;s crew. Nochiero (French <i>nocher</i>) was the
officer next to contramaestre, although the name, according to
Littr&eacute; was applied to the master or seacaptain of certain small
craft. The <i lang="es">maestro</i> (French <i lang=
"fr">ma&icirc;tre</i>) was a sub-officer in charge of all the crew. The
pilot was next to the captain in importance. The translator or adapter
who made MS. 5,650 confuses the above officers (see following
note).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r24" id="n24" name="n24">24</a></sup> The
instructions pertaining to the different watches are as follows in MS.
5,650: &ldquo;In addition to the said rules for carrying on the art of
navigation as is fitting, and in order to avoid the dangers that may
come upon those who do not have watches set, the said captain, who was
skilled in the things required and in navigation, ordered three watches
to be set. The first was at the beginning of the night; the second at
midnight; and the third toward daybreak, which is commonly called the
&lsquo;diane&rsquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, &lsquo;morn&rsquo;] or otherwise
&lsquo;the star of dawn.&rsquo; The abovenamed watches were changed
nightly: that is to say, that he who had stood first watch stood second
the day following, while he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=
"#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>who had stood second, stood third;
and thus did they continue to change nightly. The said captain ordered
that his rules, both those of signals and of watches, be thoroughly
observed, so that their voyage might be made with the greatest of
safety. The men of the said fleet were divided into three divisions:
the first was that of the captain; the second that of the pilot or
boatswain&rsquo;s mate; and the third that of the master. The above
rules having been instituted, the captain-general determined to depart,
as follows.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r25" id="n25" name="n25">25</a></sup> See
Guillemard&rsquo;s <i>Magellan</i>, pp. 329&ndash;336, and Navarrete,
<i>Col. de viages</i>, iv, pp. 3&ndash;11, 162&ndash;188, for the
stores and equipments of the fleet and their cost. The stores carried
consisted of wine, olive oil, vinegar, fish, pork, peas and beans,
flour, garlic, cheese, honey, almonds, anchovies, raisins, prunes,
figs, sugar, quince preserves, capers, mustard, beef, and rice. The
apothecary supplies were carried in the &ldquo;Trinidad,&rdquo; and the
ecclesiastical ornaments in that ship and the &ldquo;San
Antonio.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r26" id="n26" name="n26">26</a></sup> The exact
number of men who accompanied Magalh&atilde;es is a matter of doubt. A
royal decree, dated Barcelona, May 5, 1519, conserved in the papers of
the India House of Trade in Archivo general de Indias at Sevilla, with
pressmark est. 41, caj. 6, leg. 2&ndash;25, orders that only two
hundred and thirty-five persons sail in the fleet. The same archives
contain various registers of the fleet (sec Llorens Ascensio&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">Primera vuelta al mundo</i>, Madrid, 1903), one of which
is published by Medina in his <i lang="es">Colecci&oacute;n</i> (i, p.
113). Guillemard (<i>Magellan</i>, p. 326) says that at least two
hundred and sixty-eight men went as is shown by the official lists and
&ldquo;the casual occurrence of names in the numerous and lengthy
<i lang="es">autos fiscales</i> connected with the expedition.&rdquo;
Guillemard conjectures that the total number must have been between two
hundred and seventy and two hundred and eighty. Mosto (p. 53, note 2)
says: &ldquo;Castanheda and Barros say that the crews amounted to 250
men, while Herrera says 234. Navarrete&rsquo;s lists show a total of
265 men. At least 37 were Portuguese, and in addition to them and the
Spaniards, the crews contained Genoese and Italians (thirty or more),
French (nineteen), Flemings, Germans, Sicilians, English, Corfiotes,
Malays, Negroes, Moors, Madeirans, and natives of the Azores and Canary
Islands. But seventeen are recorded from Seville, while there are many
Biscayans. (See Guillemard, <i lang="la">ut supra</i>, pp.
326&ndash;329.) The registers of men as given by Navarrete (<i lang=
"fr">Col. de viages</i>, iv, pp. 12&ndash;26) are as follows.

<p>The total number of men for the ships as above given is 235.
Navarrete made his list from the list conserved in Archivo general de
Indias, and notes of Juan Bautista Mu&ntilde;oz, and various other
sources. The obstacles in the way of a correct register were the
abbreviation of names and places, the custom prevalent of naming people
from their native town or province, and the fact that the various
registers were made between 1519 and 1525. From some of these
registers, it appears that the following men were also in the
fleet.</p>

<p>In addition there were probably others, this list being still three
short of Guillemard&rsquo;s figures, 268. Harrisse (<i>Disc. of N.
Amer.</i>, London and Paris, 1892, pp. 714 <i>et seq.</i>) gives a
partial list.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r27" id="n27" name="n27">27</a></sup> The Moorish
name of Guadalquivir (from Arabic <i>W&acirc;d-al-Kebir</i>, &ldquo;the
great river&rdquo;), superseded the Roman name of B&aelig;tis. The
Romans formed all Southern Spain into one province called B&aelig;tica
after the name of the B&aelig;tis. By the town Gioan dal Farax is meant
San Juan de Aznalfarache (from Moorish <i>Hisn al-Faradj</i>). Its
Gothic name was Osset and its Roman name Julia Constantia. It is a
favorite resort of the inhabitants of Sevilla. Cor&iacute;a was once a
Roman potters&rsquo; town and is still celebrated for its jars. San
L&uacute;car de Barrameda was named in honor of St. Luke. It was
captured from the Moors in 1264 and granted to the father of Guzman el
Bueno. It attained importance after the discovery of America because of
its good harbor. The house of Medina-Sidonia was founded by Alfonso
P&eacute;rez de Guzman, a famous captain.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r28" id="n28" name="n28">28</a></sup> The original of
this passage is obscure. The distance given (ten leagues; and both MS.
5,650 and Eden agree substantially with it) is far too short for the
distance between San Lucar and Cape St. Vincent, which is over one
hundred miles. Pigafetta may have forgotten the actual distance, or it
may have been an error of his amanuensis. It is possible to translate
as follows: &ldquo;which lies in 37 degrees of latitude, [that parallel
being] x leguas from the said port;&rdquo; for &ldquo;longui&rdquo; may
be taken as agreeing with &ldquo;gradi.&rdquo; In all rendering of
distances, the Spanish form will be used in preference to the Italian;
and the same will apply to the names of Spanish coins.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r29" id="n29" name="n29">29</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;And after passing many small villages along the said
river, we at last reached a chateau belonging to the duke of
Medinacidonia, and called Sainct Lucar, where there is a port with an
entrance into the Ocean Sea. One enters that port by the east wind, and
leaves by the west. Nearby is the cape of Sainct Vincent, which,
according to cosmography, lies in a latitude of thirty-seven degrees at
a distance of twenty miles from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>the said port. From the said
city [of Sevilla] to the said port by the river abovesaid, the distance
is thirty-five or forty miles.&rdquo; This passage might be cited as a
proof that Pigafetta did not translate or write the French version, but
that the work was done by another, who takes various liberties with his
original.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r30" id="n30" name="n30">30</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;furnish the fleet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r31" id="n31" name="n31">31</a></sup> <i>Ninguna</i>
in original, a Spanish word.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r32" id="n32" name="n32">32</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;otherwise called &lsquo;labeiche.&rsquo;&rdquo; Labech (Italian
libeccio) is simply a name for the southwest wind. This is another
instance in which the French adapter adds an explanation to the
Italian, thus explaining the Italian term <i>garbino</i>,
&ldquo;southwest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r33" id="n33" name="n33">33</a></sup> MS. 5,650 reads
wrongly: &ldquo;sixteenth.&rdquo; The so-called Genoese pilot (the
author of the &ldquo;Roteiro,&rdquo; by which name his account will be
hereafter designated, and concerning whom, see Guillemard&rsquo;s
<i>Magellan</i>, p. 145, and Mosto, p. 32, and note 4) gives the date
of departure as September 21 (with which Barros agrees) and the arrival
at Tenerife as the twenty-ninth (see Stanley, p. 1). Peter Martyr,
Gomara, and Oviedo agree with Pigafetta, while Castanheda makes the
departure in January, 1520. Hughes observes that if one keep in mind
the circumstance that the day of the arrival coincided with the day
dedicated by the Church to St. Michael, the date September 29 seems
more admissible. However, one may reconcile the two dates of the
arrival by observing that the ships stopped at Tenerife until October
2; while Herrera says that the ships fetched Monta&ntilde;a Roja (the
Monte rosso of the text) on September 29. See Mosto, p. 53, notes 4 and
5. It should be noted that Gomara and Oviedo are not entirely
trustworthy authorities, and that many times they have simply copied
from authorities, such as Maximilianus Transylvanus, who is not always
to be relied upon.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r34" id="n34" name="n34">34</a></sup> The Canaries
were known to the ancients under the names of Islands of the Blest,
Fortunate Islands, and the Hesperides. The Moors knew of them under the
name of Islands of Khaledat, but had no practical acquaintance with
them. In the fourteenth century these islands began to be known to
Europeans, especially through the Portuguese. In 1402, the Frenchman
Jean de Bethencourt went there, and shortly after began their conquest
under the auspices of the crown of Castile. In consequence of the
settlements made by Bethencourt, the islands were definitely ceded to
Spain in 1481 (see Birch&rsquo;s <i>Alboquerque</i>, London,
1875&ndash;1884, Hakluyt Society Publications, ii, p. vi). The
inhabitants of the islands were known as Guanches or Guanchinet, the
latter meaning &ldquo;men of Tenerife.&rdquo; The inhabitants of this
island, holding out longer than the others, were not subdued until
1496. See also <i>Conquest of Canaries</i> (London, 1877); and
<i>History and Description <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>of Africa</i> (London, 1896), i,
pp. 99&ndash;101: both publications of the Hakluyt Society. The island
of Tenerife was formerly called Nivana and by some the Island of Hell.
Like all the other islands of the Canaries it is volcanic in formation,
and its peak, the Teyde, is one of the largest volcanic cones known.
Its latitude is 28&deg; 15&prime;.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r35" id="n35" name="n35">35</a></sup> Guillemard
conjectures that this is Punta Roxa, located at the south end of
Tenerife.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r36" id="n36" name="n36">36</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;which is a substance needed by ships.&rdquo; Herrera says that
they waited three days at the port awaiting a caravel that was laden
with pitch for the fleet (Mosto, p. 53, note 8).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r37" id="n37" name="n37">37</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;water coming from spring or river.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r38" id="n38" name="n38">38</a></sup> Eden (p. 250)
adds to this account which he greatly abridges: &ldquo;The lyke thynge
is al&#383;o &#383;cene in the Iland of &#383;aynt Thomas, lyinge
directly vnder the Equinoctiall lyne.&rdquo; Of this island of Hierro,
Pory (<i>History and description of Africa</i>, Hakluyt Society
edition, p. 100) says: &ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">Hierro hath neither
spring nor well, but is miraculously furnished with water by a cloud
which over-spreadeth a tree, from whence distilleth so much moisture,
as sufficeth both for men and cattel. This cloud ariseth an hower or
two before the sunne, and is dissolued two howers after sunne
rising.</span>&rdquo; This is an old story and is related by Pliny and
founded upon fact &ldquo;for both in Madeira and the Canaries the
laurel and other heavy-foliaged evergreens condense abundant water from
the daily mists&rdquo; (Guillemard&rsquo;s <i>Magellan</i>, p. 149).
Gregorio Chil y Naranio (<i lang="es">Estudios hist&oacute;ricos ... de
las islas Canarias</i>, 1879) believes Pigafetta means here the island
of Palma, and that the first navigators visited only the coast and so
did not see the lake in the interior (Mosto, p. 53, note 9).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r39" id="n39" name="n39">39</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;which the sailors of the east call &lsquo;Cyroc&rsquo;&rdquo;
This is the Italian <i lang="it">sirocco</i>, which is the name for the
southeast wind instead of the south. Herrera says they left the port
October 2 (Mosto, p. 54, note 2).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r40" id="n40" name="n40">40</a></sup> Eden (p. 250)
reads incorrectly: &ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">In this coa&#383;t they
had no maner of contrary wynds but a great calme and fayre wether for
the &#383;pace of three &#383;core and tenne dayes, in the which they
came vnder the Equinoctiall lyne.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r41" id="n41" name="n41">41</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;and of those persons who have sailed there often.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r42" id="n42" name="n42">42</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;And in order that our ships might not be wrecked or
broach to (which often happens when the squalls come together).&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#r43" id="n43" name="n43">43</a></sup> This last
phrase, as well as the two following sentences are missing in MS.
5,650. The third sentence following begins: &ldquo;During the calm
weather, large fish called tiburoni,&rdquo; etc. The word <i lang=
"it">tiburoni</i>, &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; is from the Spanish <i lang=
"es">tiburon</i>, which comes from the French <i lang=
"fr">tib&eacute;ron</i> (<i lang="fr">tiburin</i>, <i lang=
"fr">tiburon</i>).&mdash;Echagaray&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Diccionario
Etimol&oacute;gico</i> (Madrid, 1889).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r44" id="n44" name="n44">44</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;The said fish are caught by means of a contrivance which
sailors call &lsquo;hame&rsquo; which is an iron fishhook.&rdquo;
<i>Hame</i> (<i>ain</i>) is the French form of the Italian <i>Amo</i>,
meaning &ldquo;fishhook.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r45" id="n45" name="n45">45</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;because of the bad weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r46" id="n46" name="n46">46</a></sup> MS. 5,650 reads
&ldquo;a quarter of an hour,&rdquo; and the same duration of time is
given by Eden (p. 250).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r47" id="n47" name="n47">47</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;It is to be noted that whenever that fire that represents the
said Saint Anselme ascends and descends the mast of a ship while in a
storm at sea, that the said ship is never wrecked.&rdquo; Herrera
(cited by Mosto, p. 54, note 5) says that St. Elmo appeared on the
masthead with a lighted candle and sometimes two during the storms
encountered along the coasts of Guinea, and that the sailors were
greatly comforted thereby, and saluted the saint as is the custom of
seamen. When he appeared, he remained a quarter of an hour; and at his
departure a great flash of light occurred which blinded all the men.
Eden (p. 250) calls it the fire of St. Helen. Continuing, Eden injects
into his abridgment of the first circumnavigation a description of St.
Elmo&rsquo;s fire by Hieronimus Cardanus in the second book of <i>De
Subtilitate</i>. He says: &ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">Of the kynde of
trewe fyer, is the fyer baule or &#383;tarre commonly cauled &#383;aynt
Helen which is &#383;umtyme &#383;eene abowt the ma&#383;tes of
&#383;hyppes, beinge of &#383;uche fyery nature that it &#383;umetyme
melteth bra&#383;en ve&#383;&#383;els, and is a token of drownyng,
fora&#383;much as this chaunceth only in great tempe&#383;tes. For the
vapoure or exhalation whereof this fyre is engendered, can not bee
dryven togyther or compacte in forme of fyre, but of a gro&#383;e
vapoure and by a great poure of wynde, and is therfore a token of
imminent perell.</span>&rdquo; The fires called after St. Peter and St.
Nicholas are on the contrary, he says, good omens, and are generally to
be seen on the cables, after a storm. Being little and swift moving
they can do no damage as they could do if massed and of slow movement.
St. Elmo&rsquo;s fire is the popular name for the atmospheric
electricity that gathers in the form of a star or brush about the
masthead of ships and on the rigging. It was sometimes accompanied by a
hissing noise and was considered as a good omen by sailors. The Greeks
who observed this phenomenon wove it into the Castor and Pollux myth;
and the French edition of Pigafetta&rsquo;s relation published by Simon
de <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>Colines has the passage (see Mosto, p. 54):
&ldquo;They saw the fires called Sainct Eline and Sainct Nicolas like
blazing torches (whom the ancients called Castor and Pollux).&rdquo;
&ldquo;Elmo&rdquo; is said by some to be a corruption of
&ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; the sister of Castor and Pollux, and the name
&ldquo;Hellene&rdquo; or &ldquo;Helen&rdquo; was often given to the
fire when only one light was visible. It is, however, more probably
derived from St. Elmo, bishop of Formine who died about 304, and who is
invoked by sailors on the Mediterranean. The phenomenon is also called
fire of &ldquo;St. Elias,&rdquo; &ldquo;St. Clara,&rdquo; &ldquo;St.
Nicolas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;composite,&rdquo; &ldquo;composant,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;corposant (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>corpus sanctum</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r48" id="n48" name="n48">48</a></sup> The second bird
mentioned is the stormy petrel (of the family <i>Larid&aelig;</i> and
genus <i>Thalassidroma</i>), which is found along all the Atlantic
coasts and on some of the Pacific. The tale of the text was current
among sailors (see Wilkes, <i>U. S. Exploring Expedition</i>, viii, pp.
402, 403). The cagassela (&ldquo;cagaselo&rdquo; in MS. 5,650) is the
<i>Stercorarius parasiticus</i>, called also the jaeger, and by sailors
&ldquo;boatswain,&rdquo; &ldquo;teaser,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dung-hunter.&rdquo; The last name arose from the belief, long
held even by scientists, that this bird fed on the dung of gulls and
terns. In reality it pursues the latter birds and compels them to
disgorge the fish that they have swallowed. The flying-fish is either a
species of <i>Exoc&oelig;tus</i>, or the <i>Scomberesox saurus</i> of
Europe and America, both of which feed in large schools and jump from
the water to escape their enemies. See <i>Riverside Natural History</i>
(Boston and New York).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r49" id="n49" name="n49">49</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;which is the collateral wind between the south and the
west;&rdquo; and below reads: &ldquo;twenty-four and one-half
degrees;&rdquo; while Eden (p. 250) reads: &ldquo;xxii degrees and a
halfe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r50" id="n50" name="n50">50</a></sup> <i>Verzino</i>,
the etymology of which is unknown (see Varthema&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i>,
Hakluyt Society edition, p. lxxviii, note, and 205 note), is the
Italian name for brazil-wood, from which Brazil, which was first
visited by Vicente Pinzon, Diego Lope, Pedro Alvares Cabral, and
Amerigo Vespucci, was named. The first names of the country were Vera
Cruz and Santa Cruz. Cape Santo Agostinho, mentioned below, lies in
8&deg; 21&acute; south latitude, and is the most eastern headland of
South America. It was the first land of that continent to be
discovered, being sighted at least as early as 1500 by Pinzon. Before
sighting the above cape, Magalh&atilde;es arrested Juan de Cartagena
for insubordination and gave the command of the &ldquo;San
Antonio&rdquo; to Antonio de Coca (see Guillemard&rsquo;s
<i>Magellan</i>, p. 153). Albo&rsquo;s log begins slightly before the
sighting of the point, his first entry being November 29. See
Burton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; in his <i>Captivity of Hans
Stade</i> (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1874). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#r51" id="n51" name="n51">51</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;veal.&rdquo; The <i>anta</i> is the tapir, once very
plentiful in South America, but now rare in the well civilized
districts. See Burton&rsquo;s <i>Captivity of Hans Stade</i>, p. viii.
Albo, however, seems to designate the llama by this name, for he says
when speaking of the stay at Bay St. Julian: &ldquo;and many Indians
came there, who are clad in certain skins of <i>antas</i>, which
resemble camels without the hump.&rdquo; (Navarrete, <i>Col. de
viages</i>, iv, p. 214).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r52" id="n52" name="n52">52</a></sup> Stanley
mistranslates the French phrase of MS. 5,650 <i>et est de la longueur
dun naveau</i>, &ldquo;and is of the length of a shuttle,&rdquo;
confusing <i>naveau</i> with <i>navette</i>, &ldquo;shuttle.&rdquo;
<i>Naveau</i> here is equivalent to <i>navet</i>, &ldquo;turnip&rdquo;
or <i>navette</i>, &ldquo;rape,&rdquo; a plant of the turnip class, as
is proved by the Italian.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r53" id="n53" name="n53">53</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;And for a king of cards, of the kind which are used to
play with in Italy, they gave me five fowls.&rdquo; The four suits of
Italian playing cards are called <i>spade</i> (&ldquo;swords&rdquo;),
<i>bastoni</i> (&ldquo;clubs&rdquo;), <i>danari</i> (literally:
&ldquo;money;&rdquo; &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo;), and <i>coppe</i>
(&ldquo;cups&rdquo;).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r54" id="n54" name="n54">54</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;five.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r55" id="n55" name="n55">55</a></sup> MS. 5,650 adds:
&ldquo;which is an astrological term. That zenith is a point in the
sky, according to astrologers, but only in the imagination, and is in a
straight line over our head, as can be seen by the treatise of the
sphere, and in Aristotle, in the first book <i>De caelo et
mondo</i>.&rdquo; By the treatise of the sphere is evidently meant the
treatise of Pigafetta which follows his relation, and which is not
reproduced here as being outside the scope of the present work. In the
flyleaf of the Italian original is the following: &ldquo;Notices
concerning the new world, with the charts of the countries discovered,
written by Antonio Pigafeta, Venetian and knight of Rodi. At the end
are added some rules for finding the longitude and latitude of places
east and west.&rdquo; In the Italian MS. this treatise occupies the
last twelve folios. Stanley translates Amoretti&rsquo;s version of the
<i>Treatise</i>, which is greatly abridged. Mosto (p. 35) conjectures
that the treatise is the fruits of his three-years&rsquo; experience
during the expedition.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r56" id="n56" name="n56">56</a></sup> Albo
(Navarrete, iv, p. 210) says that the fleet continued to coast
southwest from November 29 until arriving at St. Lucy&rsquo;s bay on
December 13 (St. Lucy&rsquo;s day). Of the coast he says: &ldquo;The
mountains are peaked and have many reefs about them. There are many

naked and trade for fishhooks, mirrors, and hawk&rsquo;s bells with
food.... We entered that place on the very day of St. Lucy, and stayed
there until the day of St. John, namely, the twenty-seventh of the said
month of December. On that day we went and took our course west
southwest, and found seven islands. To the right of them is a bay
called the bay of Los Reyes [<i>i.e.</i>, the Kings] which has a good

&ldquo;as soon as they sighted the other coast of Brazil, he steered to
the south-east [<i>sic</i>] along the coast as far as Cabo-frio, which
is in twenty-three degrees south latitude; and from this cape he
steered to the west, a matter of thirty leagues, to make the Rio de
Janeiro, which is in the same latitude as Cabo-frio, and they entered
the said river on the day of St. Lucy, which was the 13th December, in
which place they took in wood, and they remained there until the first
octave of Christmas, which was the 26th of December of the same
year.&rdquo; Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 306) says: &ldquo;Setting sail
thence [<i>i.e.</i>, from Tenerife], the first land sighted was the
cape of the shoals of Ambas. They descended the coast as far as the

seek for her luck: however, she directed her looks to the cabin of the
master, and saw a nail, of a finger&rsquo;s length, and went and took
it as something valuable and new, and hid it in her hair, for otherwise
she would not have been able to conceal it, because she was naked, and,
bending forwards, she went away; and the captain and I saw this
mystery.&rdquo; The matter between the words &ldquo;length&rdquo; and
&ldquo;naked&rdquo; is taken from MS. 24,224 (wrongly declared by
Stanley to be the copy of his travels presented to the regent Louise by
Pigafetta, the conclusion being based on the fact that some of the
details are softened down), as Stanley considered the incident as told
in MS. 5,650, the Italian MS. and the first French edition, as unfit
for publication. Stanley cites the following (in the original) from the
edition of 1536 which omits the above story: &ldquo;At the first land
at which we stopped, some female slaves whom we had brought in the
ships from other countries and who were heavy with child, were taken
with the pains of childbirth. Consequently, they went alone out of the
ships, went ashore, and after having given birth, returned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=

their arms.&rdquo; He also cites the following passage from the first
French printed edition, which also narrates the above story of the
girl: &ldquo;At the first coast that we passed, some slave women gave
birth. When they were in travail, they left the boat, after which they
immediately returned, and nursed their children.&rdquo; Stanley adds
that this story of the slave women is improbable, as women were not
allowed to come aboard ship.</p>

Magalh&atilde;es left Rio de Janeiro December 26, proceeding to the
cape Santa Mar&iacute;a and the river which was called St. Christopher.
There they remained until February 2, 1520. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p.
211) also mentions the river which he calls the &ldquo;river of
Sol&iacute;s.&rdquo; The ships sent to look for a strait through the
river were gone two days, and a careful exploration of the mouth of the
river was made. Brito (Navarrete, iv, pp. 306, 307) says: &ldquo;They
left that place [i.e., Rio de Janeiro] and coasted along shore until
they reached the river called Sol&iacute;s, where Fernando Magallanes
thought that he could find a strait. They stayed there forty days.
Magallanes ordered the ship &lsquo;Santiago&rsquo; to sail forward for
about 50 leguas to see whether there was any passage. Not finding a
passage, he crossed the river which is about 25 leguas wide and found
the [opposite] coast which runs northeast and southwest.&rdquo; For

death of Amerigo Vespucci in 1512. In October, 1515, he sailed in
command of an expedition in search of a southwest passage to India. He
discovered Rio de la Plata which he explored as far as the region of
the Charrua tribe, by whom he and some of his men were killed and eaten
before September, 1516. The remnant of the expedition was conducted

&ldquo;geese&rdquo; were penguins. Albo, Herrera, and others, also
mention the &ldquo;sea-wolves and ducks.&rdquo; Kohl (<i>Zeitschrift

where the ships were laden with the seals and penguins is probably
Desvelos Bay, but it is more probably Puerto Deseado (&ldquo;Port
Desire;&rdquo; see Mosto, p. 57, note 2). Drake also secured fresh

called San Julian, where we entered the last day of March, and where we
stayed until the day of St. Bartholomew. The said port lies in a
latitude of 49 and two-thirds degrees. We pitched the ships in that
port.&rdquo; Other writers give slightly different locations (see
Mosto, p. 57, note 5). Antonio Brito, the Portuguese, whose MS. is
preserved in the Torre do Tombo at Lisbon, writes in 1523 to the king
of Portugal certain news obtained from some of the men of the
&ldquo;Trinidad.&rdquo; His information as might be expected, is at
times faulty. Of Port St. Julian, he says: &ldquo;They coasted along
shore until they reached a river called San Juan where they wintered

dress in certain skins of the <i>anta</i>, which resemble camels
without the hump. They have certain bows made from cane, which are very
small and resemble turkish bows. The arrows also resemble Turkish
arrows, and are tipped with flint instead of iron. Those Indians are
very prudent, swift runners, and very well-built and well-appearing
men.&rdquo; (Navarrete, iv, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=

&ldquo;His hair was short and colored white,&rdquo; but this
translation is borne out by neither the Italian MS. nor MS. 5,650.
Guillemard presents a picture of a Patagonian, as does also Wilkes
(<i>Narrative of U. S. Exploring Expedition</i>, 1838&ndash;1842), i,
facing p. 95. The latter describes Indians, whom the officers of the
expedition thought to be Patagonians, and who were taller than average
Europeans, as follows: &ldquo;They had good figures and pleasant
looking countenances, low foreheads, and high cheekbones, with broad
faces, the lower part projecting; their hair was course and cut short
on the crown leaving a narrow border of hair hanging down; over this
they wore a kind of cap or band of skin or woolen yarn. The front teeth
of all of them were very much worn, more apparent, however, in the old
than in the young. On one foot they wore a rude skin sandal. Many of
them had their faces painted in red and black stripes, with clay, soot,
and ashes. Their whole appearance, together with their inflamed and
sore eyes, was filthy and disgusting.&rdquo; They showed that they had
had previous communication with white men. Their food was fish and
shellfish, and they carried bows and arrows and had dogs. Brinton
(<i>American Race</i>, New York, 1891) says that &ldquo;The Patagonians
call themselves Chonek or Tzoneca, or Inaken (men, people), and by
their Pampean neighbors are referred to as Tehuel-Che,
southerners.&rdquo; Many of them are &ldquo;from six to six feet four
inches in height, and built in proportion. In color they are a reddish
brown, and have aquiline noses and good foreheads.&rdquo; Ramon Lista
(<i lang="es">Viage al pais de los Tehuel-Ches</i>) gives the average
height of the Patagonians as 1.854 m., hence the early accounts of
their great stature are greatly exaggerated (Mosto, p. 57, note 6). See
also the description of the Patagonians in the &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo;

Turkey, Bulgaria, Roumania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Germany. Their
ancestral home was probably in northwestern India, whence they
emigrated in successive waves. In many countries extreme and harsh
measures were taken against them, especially in Germany, where they had
appeared as early as 1417. They were never allowed a foothold in
France, but have become a significant part of the population in Russia,
Hungary, and Spain. In the latter country, where they are called
Git&aacute;nos (Egyptians), in spite of many severe laws passed against
them until the reign of C&aacute;rlos III, they continued, more
fortunate than the Jews, to thrive. They are mentioned by Cervantes in
his <i>Don Quixote</i> (pt. i, chap, xxx), but the name Git&aacute;no

Magalh&atilde;es subdued the mutiny by the aid of the foreigners with
him. Mendoza was killed by Espinosa the chief constable of the fleet,
and Gaspar Quesada was beheaded and quartered. Alvaro de Mesquita,
Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s cousin, is wrongly reported to have been given
command of one of the ships of those killed, but the command of the
&ldquo;San Antonio&rdquo; that had previously been given to Antonio de
Coca, after Magalh&atilde;es had deprived Cartagena of it, had been
given him before the real outbreak of the mutiny. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p>The narrative of the mutiny as given by Navarrete (<i lang="fr">Col.
de viages</i>, iv, pp. 34&ndash;38) which was compiled mainly from
documents presented in the same volume and from Herrera, is as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;March 31, the eve of Palm Sunday, Magallanes entered the port
of San Julian, where he intended to winter, and consequently ordered
the rations to be served by measure. In view of that and of the
barrenness and cold of the country, the men asked Magallanes by various
arguments to increase the rations or turn back, since there was no hope
of finding the end of that country or any strait. But Magallanes
replied that he would either die or accomplish what he had promised;
that the king had ordered the voyage which he was to accomplish; and
that he had to sail until he found that land or some strait which must
surely exist; that in regard to the food, they had no reason to
complain, since that bay had an abundance of good fish, good water,
many game birds, and quantities of wood, and that bread and wine had
not failed them, nor would fail them if they would abide by the rule
regarding rations. Among other observations, he exhorted and begged
them not to be found wanting in the valorous spirit which the Castilian
nation had manifested and showed daily in greater affairs; and offering
them corresponding rewards in the king&rsquo;s name. By such means did
he quiet the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;April 1, Palm Sunday, Magallanes summoned all his captains,
officers, and pilots to go ashore to hear mass and afterward to dine in
his ship. Alvaro de la Mezquita, Antonio de Coca, and all the men went
to hear mass. Louis de Mendoza, Gaspar de Quesada, and Juan de
Cartagena (the latter because he was a prisoner in Quesada&rsquo;s
keeping) did not go, however; and Alvaro de la Mezquita alone went to
dine with Magallanes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the night, Gaspar de Quesada and Juan de Cartagena
with about thirty armed men of the ship &lsquo;Concepcion&rsquo; went
to the &lsquo;San Antonio,&rsquo; where Quesada requested that the
captain, Alvaro de la Mezquita, be surrendered to him, and told the
crew of the ship to seize it, as they had already done with the
&lsquo;Concepcion&rsquo; and &lsquo;Victoria.&rsquo; [He said] that
they already knew how Magallanes had treated and was treating them,
because they had asked him to fulfil the king&rsquo;s orders; that they
were lost men; and that they should help him make another request of
Magallanes, and if necessary, seize him. Juan de Elorriaga, the master
of the &lsquo;San Antonio,&rsquo; spoke in favor of his captain, Alvaro
de la Mezquita, saying to Gaspar de Quesada: &lsquo;I summon you, in
God&rsquo;s name and that of the king, Don C&aacute;rlos, to go to your
ship, for the present is no time to go through the ships with armed
men; and I also summon you to release our captain.&rsquo; Thereupon
Quesada replied: &lsquo;Must our deed remain unaccomplished because of
this madman?&rsquo; and drawing his dagger stabbed him four times in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>the arm, thus overawing the men. Mezquita was
kept prisoner, Elorriaga was cared for, Cartagena went to the ship
&lsquo;Concepcion,&rsquo; while Quesada remained in the &lsquo;San
Antonio.&rsquo; Thus were Quesada, Cartagena, and Mendoza masters of
the three ships, &lsquo;San Antonio,&rsquo; &lsquo;Concepcion,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Victoria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereupon, they sent a message to Magallanes to the effect
that they held three ships and the small boats of all five at their
disposal in order to require him to fulfil his Majesty&rsquo;s
provisions. They said that they had done that in order that he might no
longer illtreat them as he had done thitherto. If he would agree to
fulfil his Majesty&rsquo;s orders, they would obey his commands, and
[said] that if they had thitherto treated him as a superior, they would
thenceforth treat him as a master, and would be most respectful to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magallanes sent word to them to come to his ship, where he
would hear them and do what was proper. They answered that they did not
dare come lest he illtreat them, but that he should go to the ship
&lsquo;San Antonio,&rsquo; where they would all assemble and decide
definitely on what the king&rsquo;s orders commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magallanes believing that boldness was more useful than
meekness in the face of such actions, determined to employ craft and
force together. He kept the small boat of the ship &lsquo;San
Antonio&rsquo; which was used for those negotiations, at his ship; and
sent the alguacil, Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, in the skiff belonging to
his ship, to the &lsquo;Victoria,&rsquo; with six men armed secretly
and a letter for the treasurer, Luis de Mendoza, in which he told the
latter to come to the flagship. While the treasurer was reading the
letter and smiling as if to say &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t catch me that
way,&rsquo; Espinosa stabbed him in the throat, while another sailor
stabbed him at the same instant on the head so that he fell dead.
Magallanes, being a man with foresight, sent a boat under command of
Duarte Barbosa, sobresaliente of the &lsquo;Trinidad&rsquo; with
fifteen armed men, who entering the &lsquo;Victoria&rsquo; flung the
banner to the breeze without any resistance. That happened on April 2.
Then the &lsquo;Victoria&rsquo; approached the flagship, and they
together immediately approached the &lsquo;Santiago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the following day, the &lsquo;San Antonio&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Concepcion&rsquo; which were held by Quesada and Cartagena tried
to put to sea, but it was necessary for them to pass close to the
flagship which stood farthest out. The &lsquo;San Antonio&rsquo; raised
two anchors, and being in danger with one, Quesada determined to free
Alvaro de la Mezquita, whom he held a prisoner in his ship, in order to
send him to Magallanes to arrange peace between them. Mezquita,
however, told him that nothing would be obtained. Finally, they
arranged that when they set sail, Mezquita should station himself
forward and ask Magallanes as they approached his ship, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>not
to fire and that they would anchor provided affairs would be settled
favorably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before setting sail in the &lsquo;San Antonio,&rsquo; where
they were endangered, as it was night and the crew were asleep, the
ship dragged and ran foul of the flagship. The latter discharged some
large and small shots and men leaped aboard the &lsquo;San
Antonio&rsquo; crying, &lsquo;For whom are you?&rsquo; they responding,
&lsquo;For the king, our sovereign, and your Grace,&rsquo; surrendered
to Magallanes. The latter seized Quesada, the accountant, Antonio de
Coca, and other sobresalientes who had gone to the &lsquo;San
Antonio&rsquo; with Quesada. Then he sent to the
&lsquo;Concepcion&rsquo; for Juan de Cartagena and imprisoned him with
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day Magallanes ordered the body of Mendoza taken ashore
and had it quartered, and Mendoza cried as a traitor. On the seventh,
he ordered Gaspar de Quesada beheaded and quartered with a like cry.
That was done by Quesada&rsquo;s own follower and sobresaliente, Luis
de Molino, in order to save himself from hanging, for that sentence had
been passed on him. Magallanes sentenced Juan de Cartagena and the lay
priest, Pedro Sanchez de la Reina, who had been active in causing the
men to mutiny, to be marooned in that country. He pardoned more than
forty men who merited death, as they were needed to work the ships, and
so that he might not excite hard feelings by the severity of the
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brito&rsquo;s account of the mutiny (Navarrete, iv, p. 307) is very
brief and unsatisfactory: &ldquo;In that port the captains began to ask
him where he was taking them, especially one Juan de Cartagena, who
said that he had a royal cedula naming him as associate with
Magallanes, as Rui Falero would also have been, had he been there. Then
they tried to rise against Magallanes and kill him, and go back to
Castilla or to Rodas. From that point they went to the river of Santa
Cruz, where they endeavored to put their plan in execution. But when
Magallanes discovered their ill-considered attempt, for the captains
said that they would kill him or take him prisoner, he ordered his ship
armed and Juan de Cartagena arrested. As soon as the other captains saw
their chief arrested they thought no longer of prosecuting their
attempt. Magallanes, however, seized them all, for most of the crew
were in his favor. He sent the merino or alguacil to kill Luis de
Mendoza with his dagger, for the latter refused to be arrested; while
he had another named Gaspar Quesada beheaded. When they set sail, he
left Juan de Cartagena together with a secular priest ashore at a place
where there were no inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Correa (Stanley, pp. 247&ndash;250) gives a different and imperfect
account of the meeting.</p>
<p>Cf. with these accounts the one given by Guillemard
(<i>Magellan</i>), pp. 162&ndash;174. When the &ldquo;San
Antonio&rdquo; deserted, Esteban <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308"
href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>Gomez is said to have rescued
Cartagena and the priest. Jo&atilde;o Serr&atilde;o (after the loss of
the &ldquo;Santiago&rdquo;) was given command of the
&ldquo;Concepcion,&rdquo; Mesquita of the &ldquo;San Antonio,&rdquo;
and Duarte Barbosa of the &ldquo;Victoria,&rdquo; all Portuguese
(Guillemard, <i>ut supra</i>, p. 179). It is rather singular that Sir
Francis Drake should also have faced a mutiny in this same port, where
Thomas Doughty was executed. That the history of
Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s expedition was generally known is evident from
the following: &ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">The next day after, being
the twentieth of June, wee harboured ourselues againe in a very good
harborough, called by Magellan <i>Port S. Julian</i>, where we found a
gibbet standing upon the maine, which we supposed to be the place where
<i>Magellan</i> did execution upon some of his disobedient and
rebellious company.</span>&rdquo; <i>World encompassed</i> (Hakluyt
Society edition), p. 234.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r120" id="n120" name="n120">120</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;twenty-five leagues.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r121" id="n121" name="n121">121</a></sup> Instead of
this last phrase, MS. 5,650 reads: &ldquo;and very little of
that.&rdquo; The account of the shipwreck and rescue as given here is
very confusing and inadequate. Cf. Guillemard, <i>ut supra</i>, pp.
175&ndash;179, and Navarrete, iv, pp. 38, 39. One man was lost, namely,
the negro slave of Jo&atilde;o Serr&atilde;o. The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo;
(Stanley, p. 4) gives the briefest mention of it. Brito (Navarrete, iv,
p. 307) says: &ldquo;After this [<i>i.e.</i>, the mutiny], they
wintered for three months; and Magallanes again ordered the ship
&lsquo;Santiago&rsquo; to go ahead in order to explore. The ship was
wrecked but all of its crew were saved.&rdquo; Correa&rsquo;s account
(Stanley, p. 250) is very short, and mentions that only the hull of the
vessel was lost.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r122" id="n122" name="n122">122</a></sup> Mosto (p.
60, note 3) derives this word from the Spanish <i>mejillon</i>, a
variety of cockle, which he thinks may be the <i>Mytilus</i> or common
mussel.</p>

&ldquo;by His grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r126" id="n126" name="n126">126</a></sup> MS. 5,650
omits these last two words. The Italian form <i>braccio</i> is retained
in view of these words; for the Spanish <i>braza</i> is a measure about
equivalent to the English fathom, while the <i>braccio</i>, although
varying in different cities, is near three palmos (spans) in length.
The term is, however, translated <i>brasse</i> (&ldquo;fathom&rdquo;)
in MS. 5,650. Mosto (p. 60, note 8), conjectures this fish to be the
<i>Eliginus maclovinus</i>. Of this fish, Theodore <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>Gill, the well-known ichthyologist, says in a
letter of May 22, 1905: &ldquo;The Italian editor gave a shrewd guess
in the suggestion that the fish in question was what was formerly
called <i>Eliginus maclovinus</i>. The only vulgar name that I have
been able to find for it is &lsquo;robalo,&rsquo; and this name is
applied to it by the Spanish-speaking people of both sides of South
America. Like most popular names, however, it is very misleading.
&lsquo;Robalo&rsquo; is the Spanish name for the European bass, which
is nearly related to our striped bass or rock bass. To that fish the
robalo of South America has no affinity or real resemblance, and
belongs to a very different family peculiar to the southern
hemisphere&mdash;the <i>Nototheniids</i>. The so-called <i>Eliginus
maclovinus</i> (properly, <i>Eliginops maclovinus</i>) is the most
common and widely distributed species and probably the one obtained by
the fleet of Magalh&atilde;es.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r127" id="n127" name="n127">127</a></sup> Of the
river Santa Cruz and the stay there, Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 215) says:
&ldquo;We left that place [<i>i.e.</i>, Port San Julian] on the 24th of
the said month [of August] and coasted along to the southwest by west.
About 30 leguas farther on, we found a river named Santa Cruz, which we
entered on the 26th of the same month. We stayed there until the day of
San Lucas, the 18th of the month of October. We caught many fish there
and got wood and water. That coast extends northeast by east and
southwest by west, and is an excellent coast with good
indentations.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, p. 4) places
the river Santa Cruz twenty leagues from San Julian and in about
50&deg;. That narrative says that the four remaining boats continued to
pick up the wreckage of the &ldquo;Santiago&rdquo; until September 18.
The name Santa Cruz was said to have been given to the river because
they entered it on September 14, the day of the exaltation of the holy
cross (see Stanley, p. 4, note 4, and Mosto, p. 60, note 7), but Kohl
(Mosto, <i>ut supra</i>) attributes the name to Jo&atilde;o
Serr&atilde;o who was near that river on May 3, 1520, the day on which
the church celebrates the feast of the finding of the holy cross.
Navarrete (iv, p. 41) cites Herrera as authority for an eclipse of the
sun that happened while at this river on October 11, 1520. Guillemard
(<i>ut supra</i>, pp. 187, 188) is disinclined to believe the report,
although he mentions an annular eclipse of the sun on October 20, 1520,
which was however not visible in Patagonia. Navarrete (<i>ut supra</i>)
says that Magalh&atilde;es gave instructions to his captains here
&ldquo;saying that he would follow those coasts until finding a strait
or the end of that continent, even if he had to go to a latitude of
75&deg;; that before abandoning that enterprise, the ships might be
twice unrigged; and that after that he would go in search of Maluco
toward the east and east northeast, by way of the cape of Buena
Esperanza and the island of San Lorenzo.&rdquo; <span class=

that the channel &ldquo;at some places has a width of three leagues,
and two, and one, and in some places half a league.&rdquo; Transylvanus
(<span class="sc">Vol. I</span>, p. 320) gives the width as two, three,
five, or ten Italian miles; Gomara, two leagues or so; Barros, one
league at the mouth, and the strait, from a musket or cannon shot to
one and one and one-half leagues; Castanheda, at the mouth as wide as
two ships close together, then opening up to one league; Peter Martyr,

old Spanish word is &ldquo;pro&iacute;s,&rdquo; which signifies both
the thing to which the ship is moored ashore, and the rope by which it
is moored to the shore.</p>

passage is as follows in MS. 5,650: &ldquo;The said strait was a
circular place surrounded with mountains (as I have said), and the
majority of the sailors thought that there was no exit from it into the
said Pacific Sea. But the captain-general declared that there was
another strait which led out, and that he knew that well, for he had
seen it on a marine chart of the king of Portugal. That map had been
made by a renowned sailor and pilot, named Martin de Boesme. The said
captain sent two of his ships forward&mdash;one named the &lsquo;Sainct
Anthoine,&rsquo; and the other the &lsquo;Conception&rsquo;&mdash;in
order that they might look for and discover the exit from the said

"pb311">311</a>]</span>acquainted with Columbus. In 1484 he was chosen
geographer of Diego Cam&rsquo;s expedition to Western Africa. On his
return, he received the order of knighthood in the military order of
Christ of Portugal; after which he went to the island of Fayal in the
Azores where he became interested in colonization and agriculture, and
married the daughter of the governor. In 1491 he returned to Germany,
where he lived at Nuremberg until 1493, and where, at the request of
his townsmen, he constructed an immense globe on the information of
Ptolemy, Strabo, and others, which contains many errors (see facsimile
in Guillemard), In 1493 he returned to Lisbon, and in 1494 to Fayal,
where he remained until 1506, when he went to Lisbon. Many myths sprung
up about him, such that he had visited America before Columbus and the
straits of Magellan before Magalh&atilde;es, the latter of whom he may
have known at Lisbon. See Rose, <i>New Biographical Dictionary</i>
(London, 1848); <i>Grande Encyclop&eacute;die</i> (Paris, Lamirault et
Cie.); and Guillemard, pp. 73, 74.</p>
<p>See Guillemard (<i>ut supra</i>, pp. 189&ndash;198) for a discussion
of knowledge regarding the existence of a strait to the south of the
American continent, prior to Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s discovery and
passage of it. Guillemard, after weighing the evidence for and against,
decides that there may have been a &ldquo;more or less inexact
knowledge of the existence of some antarctic break &ldquo;that would
allow access to the eastern world.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#r141" id="n141" name="n141">141</a></sup> Esteban
Gomez was an experienced Portuguese navigator and pilot with ambitions
only less than those of Magalh&atilde;es, his kinsman (Guillemard, p.
203). His desertion occurred probably <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>in the first part of
November, and was perhaps directly due to pique at what he considered
lack of appreciation from Magalh&atilde;es. Conspiring with
Ger&oacute;nimo Guerra, the notary, who was elected captain of the
&ldquo;San Antonio&rdquo; they made off with that ship, and after
imprisoning Alvaro de Mezquita, returned to Spain, anchoring at Sevilla
May 6, 1521. There Gomez was imprisoned after the return of the
&ldquo;Victoria,&rdquo; but was liberated, and in 1524 proposed an
expedition to discover a northwest passage. An expedition having been
fitted out by C&aacute;rlos I, he coasted Florida and the eastern
coast, as far as Cape Cod, and returned to Spain in 1525. See <i>Grande
Encyclop&eacute;die</i>; Navarrete, iv, pp. 42&ndash;45, and
201&ndash;208; and Guillemard, <i>ut supra</i>, pp. 203&ndash;205.</p>
<p>Brito&rsquo;s story of the exploration of the strait and the loss of
the &ldquo;San Antonio&rdquo; (Navarrete, iv, pp. 307, 308) is as
follows: &ldquo;They left that place [<i>i.e.</i>, the river of Santa
Cruz] on October 20, and went to enter a strait of which they had no
knowledge. The entrance of the strait extends for about 15 leguas; and
after they had entered, it seemed to them that it was all land-locked,
and they accordingly anchored there. Magallanes sent a Portuguese pilot
named Juan Carballo ashore with orders to ascend a mountain in order to
ascertain whether there was any outlet. Carballo returned saying that
it appeared land-locked to him. Thereupon Magallanes ordered the ships
&lsquo;San Antonio&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Concepcion&rsquo; to go in
advance in order to explore the strait. After having gone ahead for
about 30 leguas, they returned to tell Magallanes that the river went
farther but that they could not tell where it would take them. Upon
receiving that information Magallanes weighed anchor with all three
ships, and advanced along the strait until reaching the point to which
the others had explored. Then he ordered the &lsquo;San Antonio&rsquo;
of which Alvaro de Mezquito, his cousin, was captain, and Esteban
Gomez, a Portuguese pilot, to go ahead and explore a southern channel
that opened in the strait. That ship did not return to the others and
it is not known whether it returned to Castilla or whether it was
wrecked. Magallanes proceeded with his remaining ships until he found
an exit.&rdquo; Correa&rsquo;s account of the desertion of the
&ldquo;San Antonio&rdquo; is as usual with him, inadequate, and
evidently based on hearsay evidence (see Stanley, p. 250).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r142" id="n142" name="n142">142</a></sup> Literally
&ldquo;brother;&rdquo; but to be understood probably as the expression
<i>cugino germano</i>, &ldquo;cousin german.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r143" id="n143" name="n143">143</a></sup> MS. 5,650
begins this sentence as follows: &ldquo;But that ship lost its time,
for the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r144" id="n144" name="n144">144</a></sup> Guillemard
(p. 206) conjectures from the records of Albo, Pigafetta, and Herrera
that the river of Sardines is Port Gallant which is located on the
Brunswick Peninsula, opposite the Charles Islands. Albo (Navarrete, iv,
p. 215) says that after taking the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313"
href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>course to the northwest they
sailed about 15 leagues before anchoring.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r145" id="n145" name="n145">145</a></sup> Albo
(Navarrete, iv, p. 216) says that the two capes at the exit of the
strait were called Fermosa and Deseado, this latter being Cape Pillar
(see Guillemard, map facing p. 198).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r146" id="n146" name="n146">146</a></sup> MS. 5,650
adds: &ldquo;which were on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r147" id="n147" name="n147">147</a></sup> Jo&atilde;o
Serr&atilde;o, the brother of Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s staunchest
friend Francisco Serr&atilde;o, and a firm supporter of the great
navigator. Pigafetta errs in calling him a Spaniard (see p. 183),
though he may have become a naturalized Spaniard, since the register
speaks of him as a citizen of Sevilla. One document (Navarrete, iv, p.
155) calls him a Portuguese pilot, and Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) a
Castilian. He was an experienced navigator and captain, and had served
under Vasco da Gama, Almeida, and Albuquerque. Vasco da Gama (on his
second voyage, 1502&ndash;1503) made him captain of the ship
&ldquo;Pomposa&rdquo; which was built in Mozambique where he was left
to attend to Portuguese affairs. On this expedition he saw the coast of
Brazil for the first time, for Vasco da Gama&rsquo;s fleet, ere
doubling the Cape of Good Hope, crossed to the Brazilian coast, which
they followed as far as Cape Santo Agostinho. He fought bravely in the
battle of Cananor under Almeida (March 16, 1506, in which
Magalh&atilde;es also participated). He was chief captain of three
caravels in August, 1510, in Eastern water, and was in the Java seas in
1512, but must have returned to Portugal soon after that, for he was
there in 1513; although he seems to have been appointed clerk at the
fortress of Calicut in the latter year. He embarked with
Magalh&atilde;es as captain and pilot of the &ldquo;Santiago,&rdquo;
but after the wreck of that vessel near port San Julian was given
command of the &ldquo;Concepcion,&rdquo; in which he later explored the
strait. Failing to dissuade Magalh&atilde;es from attacking the natives
of Matan, he became commander, with Duarte Barbosa, of the fleet at
Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s death, and was murdered by the Cebuans after
the treacherous banquet given by them to the fleet. See Guillemard
(<i>ut supra</i>), and Stanley&rsquo;s <i>Three voyages of Vasco da
Gama</i> (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1869).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r148" id="n148" name="n148">148</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads as follows: &ldquo;Such was the method ordered by the captain
from the beginning, in order that the ship that happened to become
separated from the others might rejoin the fleet.&rdquo; Then it adds:
&ldquo;Thereupon the crew of the said ship did what the captain had
ordered them and more, for they set two banners with their
letters,&rdquo; etc.</p>

the nights in the strait were not longer than five hours.</p>

reads: &ldquo;I do not believe that there is a more beautiful country

the strait, in <span class="sc">Vol. I,</span> pp. 264&ndash;265; that
of Transylvanus, <span class="sc">Vol. I,</span> pp. 319&ndash;321; and
that in <i>World encompassed</i> (Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 236,
237 (this last account also mentioning the difficulty of finding water
sufficiently shallow for anchoring). The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley,
p. 31) says that the strait was called the &ldquo;Strait of Victoria,
because the ship &lsquo;Victoria&rsquo; was the first that had seen it:
some called it the Strait of Magalhaens because our captain was named
Fernando de Magalhaens.&rdquo; Castanheda says that Magalh&atilde;es
gave it the name of &ldquo;bay of All Saints&rdquo; because it was
discovered on November 1; and San Martin in his reply to
Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s request for opinions regarding the continuance
of the expedition calls it &ldquo;channel of All Saints:&rdquo; but
this name was first applied to only one gulf or one branch and later
extended to the entire channel. This name is found in the instructions
given for the expedition of Sebastian Cabot in 1527, and in the map
made that same year at Sevilla by the Englishman Robert Thorne.
Sarmiento de Gamboa petitioned Felipe II that it be called
&ldquo;strait of the Mother of God.&rdquo; It was also called
&ldquo;strait of Martin Behaim.&rdquo; The anonymous Portuguese
(Stanley, p. 31) says that the strait is 400 miles long. The
&ldquo;Roterio&rdquo; (Stanley, pp. 7, 8) says that it is 100 leagues
in length, and that in traversing it, they &ldquo;sailed as long as it
was daylight, and anchored when it was night.&rdquo; Transylvanus
(<span class="sc">Vol. I,</span> p. 320) gives the length as 100
Spanish miles; Oviedo, 100 or 110 leagues; Herrera, 100 leagues, and
twenty days to navigate; Gomara, 110 to 120 leagues; Peter Martyr, 110
leagues. See Mosto, p. 60, note 10, and p. 62, note 2; and <i>ante</i>,

<p>In the above list, <i lang="xx">chen</i> corresponds in the Italian
MS. to <i lang="xx">ehen</i>, the equivalent of &ldquo;no;&rdquo;
<i>theu</i> is &ldquo;ship&rdquo; in the above, and &ldquo;snow&rdquo;
in the Italian; <i lang="it">courire</i> (the equivalent of <i lang=
"it">covrire</i> or <i lang="it">coprire</i>, &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;)
in the Italian, becomes <i lang="it">courir</i> (&ldquo;to run&rdquo;)
in MS. 5,650. All are to be regarded as errors of the French. Certain
words are left in Italian in MS. 5,650, which are as follows: <i lang=
"it">la copa</i>; <i lang="it">alcalcagno</i>; (Italian MS. <i lang=
"it">al calcagno</i>); <i lang="it">homo squerzo</i> (Italian MS.
<i lang="it">sguerco</i>); <i lang="fr">a la pignate</i> (Italian MS.

MS. <i lang="it">al seruzo ucelo</i>); and <i lang="it">alcocinare</i>
(Italian MS. <i lang="it">al co&ccedil;inare</i>). Stanley offers this
as proof that MS. 5,650 was written by Pigafetta, and not translated
from his Italian, but it furnishes no evidence that Pigafetta even saw
the French version of his relation. It must be remembered that Stanley
did not himself see the Italian MS. but only the Amoretti mutilation of
it (from which, and from MS. 5,650, he reproduces the vocabulary,
without English translation); and hence bases his observations on that
and the conjectures of its editor. Stanley points out the fact that
Amoretti has omitted several words of this list, but they are all in
the Italian MS. A sad blunder has been made by Stanley in his
transcription of <i lang="fr">La pouldre dherbe qui mangent</i> whose
Patagonian equivalent is <i lang="xx">capac</i>. He transcribes as
follows: <i lang="fr">la pouldre d&rsquo;herbe</i> with Patagonian
equivalent <i lang="xx">qui</i> (which it is to be noted is only the
wrong form of the French relative), and <i>mangent</i> with Patagonian
equivalent <i lang="xx">capac</i>, explaining <i>mangent</i> in a
footnote as &ldquo;Food, the root used as bread.&rdquo; Stanley also
makes the following mistranscriptions: <i lang="it">orescho</i> for
<i lang="it">oresche</i> (&ldquo;nostrils&rdquo;); <i lang=
"it">canneghin</i> for <i lang="it">caimeghin</i> (&ldquo;palm of the

(&ldquo;black&rdquo;); and <i lang="it">ixecoles</i> for <i lang=
"it">jrocoles</i> (&ldquo;to cook&rdquo;). Amoretti has also made many
errors (see Stanley&rsquo;s <i>First Voyage</i>, pp. 62, 63). Mosto,
who is on the whole a faithful transcriber, has <i lang=
"xx">sacancos</i> as the Patagonian equivalent of <i lang="it">a li
testiculi</i>; <i lang="xx">om jani</i> for <i lang="it">a li sui</i>,
the correct forms of the latter being <i lang="xx">jani</i> and
<i lang="it">a li sui oui</i>; and <i lang="xx">tcrechai</i> for the
equivalent of &ldquo;red cloth.&rdquo; Eden (p. 252) gives only the
following words: &ldquo;breade, Capar: water, Oli: redde clothe,
Cherecai: red colour, Cheiche: blacke colour, Amel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mosto (p. 63, note 8) gives the following words from the

<p>Brinton (<i>American Race</i>, p. 328) cites Ramon Lista (<i lang=
"es">Mis exploraciones y descubr&igrave;mientos en Patagonia</i>,
Buenos Ayres, 1880) in proof that the language of the Patagonians has
undergone but slight change since the time of Pigafetta. See also lists
of words in Brinton (<i>ut supra</i>), p. 364, from the Patagonian and
Fuegian languages. The vocabularies given by Horatio Hale
(Wilkes&rsquo;s <i>U. S. Exploring Expedition</i>, 1838&ndash;1842,
Philadelphia, 1846, viii, pp. 651&ndash;656) bear no resemblance to
Pigafetta&rsquo;s vocabulary. Hale says that guttural sounds are

first chart, representing the straits of Magellan (see p. 86). The
cardinal points in all of Pigafetta&rsquo;s charts are the reverse of
the ordinary, the north being below and the south above. MS. 5,650
precedes this chart (which there occupies folio 21a) by the words:
&ldquo;Below is depicted the strait of Patagonie.&rdquo; Immediately
following this chart in the Italian MS. (folio 15a) is the chart of the
<i>Ysole Infortunate</i> (&ldquo;Unfortunate Isles;&rdquo; see p. 92).
These islands are shown in MS. 5,650 on folio 23a, with the following

<p><sup><a href="#r166" id="n166" name="n166">166</a></sup> A curious
coincidence in view of Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s answer to Esteban Gomez
at a council called in the strait to discuss the continuance of the
voyage that &ldquo;although he had to eat the cowhide wrappings of the
yardarms, he would still persevere and discover what he had promised
the emperor&rdquo; (Navarrete, iv, p. 43; cited from Herrera). At that
council Andr&eacute; de San Martin, pilot in the &ldquo;San
Antonio,&rdquo; advised that they continue explorations until the
middle of January, 1521, and then return to Spain; and urged that no
farther southward descent be made, and that navigation along so
dangerous coasts be only by day, in order that the crew might have some
rest (Navarrete, iv, pp. 45&ndash;49).</p>

northwest for 9,858 miles, the equator was reached. At the line
(&ldquo;Roteiro,&rdquo; Stanley, p. 9), Magalh&atilde;es changed the

anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31), says that the Unfortunate
Islands were met before the line was reached and were eight hundred
miles distant from one another. One was called St. Peter (in 18&deg;)
and the other the island of Tiburones (in 14&deg;). Transylvanus
(<span class="sc">Vol. I</span>, p. 321), Herrera, and Oviedo, say that
the three vessels stopped two days at those islands for supplies, but
Albo&rsquo;s journal (Navarrete, iv, p. 218) indicates that no stop was
made there. The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, p. 9), gives the
latitude of these islands as 18&deg; or 19&deg; and 13&deg; or 14&deg;.
Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 218) says that the first was discovered January
24 in 16&deg; 15&acute;, and was called San Pablo, because that was the
date of St. Paul&rsquo;s conversion; and the island of Tiburones was
discovered February 4, in 10&deg; 40&acute;, at a distance of 9&deg;
(<i>sic</i>) from the former. Eden (p. 253) says that the second island
lay in 5&deg;. These two islands were probably Puka-puka (the
<span lang="nl">Honden Eyland</span> of the Dutch atlases) of the
Tuamotu group, located in latitude <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319"
href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>14&deg; 45&acute; south, and
longitude 138&deg; 48&acute; west; and Flint Island of the Manihiki
group, located in latitude 11&deg; 20&acute; south and longitude

former contains a population of over four hundred. See <i>ante</i>,

<p><sup><a href="#r172" id="n172" name="n172">172</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;now at the stern, now at the windward side, or
otherwise.&rdquo; Amoretti changes this passage completely, reading:
&ldquo;According to our measurement of the distance that we made with
the chain astern, we ran from sixty to seventy leagues daily.&rdquo;
Many basing themselves on this passage of Amoretti, have believed that
the log was in use at the time of the first circumnavigation. Dr.
Breusing (<i>Die Catena a poppa bei Pigafetta und die Logge</i>, in
&ldquo;Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Erdkunde zu Berlin,&rdquo;
1869, iv, pp. 107&ndash;115) believes that the &ldquo;stern chain
(<i>catena poppa</i>) is not the log properly so-called, but an
instrument for determining the angle of the ship&rsquo;s leeway, an
opinion accepted also by Gelcich in his <i lang="it">La scoperta
d&rsquo;America e Cristoforo Colombo nella letteratura moderna</i>
(Gorizia, 1890). L&rsquo;Vzielle (<i lang="it">Studi bibliogr. e biogr.
sulla storia della geogr. in Italia</i>, Roma, 1875, part ii,
introduction, pp. 294&ndash;296), combats that opinion, as well as the
idea that the log is meant. The difficulty of the passage, he says,
hinges on the word <i>ho</i> and whether it is interpreted as a verb or
a conjunction. If it be a conjunction then the passage, means
&ldquo;estimating by sight, the rate of the ship from the &lsquo;bow
catena,&rsquo; or at the stern<span class="corr" id="xd21e14031" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> (&lsquo;catena&rsquo; being a beam
perpendicular to the ship&rsquo;s axis at the point near the bow where
it begins to curve inward; that is, at such a point that from that
place to the stern, the direction of the apparent way is parallel to
the longitudinal axis of the ship) his ship made fifty, sixty, or
seventy leagues.&rdquo; One might suppose, if <i>ho</i> be regarded as
a verb, that Pigafetta called <i lang="it">catena</i> a cross beam of
the stern (the passage reading &ldquo;the catena that was at the
stern&rdquo;); or that the disjunctive <i>ho</i>, &ldquo;or&rdquo; is
used in place of <i>e</i>, &ldquo;and,&rdquo; and that Pigafetta,
dividing the distance between the stern and the bow catena by the time
necessary for a fixed point of the sea to pass from the elevation of
the bow to that of the stern, thus deduced the ship&rsquo;s rate. See
Mosto, p. 66, note<a id="xd21e14046" name="xd21e14046"></a> 1.
L&rsquo;Vzielli&rsquo;s opinion is the most probable, for although the
log is mentioned by Purchas as early as 1607, its use did not become
general until 1620. An instrument used to measure the rates of vessels
is mentioned as early as 1577, but it was very deficient.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r173" id="n173" name="n173">173</a></sup> The
&ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, p. 6) says that this cape, which he
calls &ldquo;cape of the virgins&rdquo; was discovered on October 21,
1520, and lay in latitude about 52&deg; south. Barros says that it was
discovered on October 20; and Transylvanus and Oviedo, on November 27.

and Nubecula minor) and the constellation of the Southern Cross or
Crux. The Magellanic clouds resemble portions of the milky way,
Nubecula major being visible to the naked eye in strong moonlight and
covering about two hundred times the moon&rsquo;s surface, while the
Nubecula minor, although visible to the naked eye, disappears in full
moonlight, and covers an area only one-fourth that of the former. They
were first observed by the Arabians. The Portuguese pilots probably
called them at first &ldquo;clouds of the cape.&rdquo; (Mosto, p. 66,
note 2). The Southern Cross, which resembles a lute rather than a
cross, was first erected into a constellation by Royer in 1679,
although often spoken of before as a cross. Only one of its five
principal stars belongs to the first magnitude. The cross is only
6&deg; in extent north and south and less than that east and west.</p>
<p>The second chart of the plate at p. 92 represents the Ladrones
Islands and occurs in the Italian MS. at this point (folio 16b). This

Japan, while Sumbdit Pradit may be the island of Antilia, called
&ldquo;Septe citade&rdquo; on Martin Behaim&rsquo;s globe (Mosto, p.
67, note 5). The locations given by Pigafetta prove that they did not
see them, but that he writes only from vague reports. Europe first
learned of Japan, near the end of the thirteenth century, through Marco
Polo, who had been told in China fabulous tales of the wealth of
Zipangu. This word is derived by Marco Polo from the Chinese
Dschi-pen-Ku&euml; or Dschi-pon, which the Japanese have transformed
into Nippon or Nihon. See <i>Travels of Marco Polo</i>, book iii, ch.

traveled from the equator. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) says:

&ldquo;Suluan&rdquo; by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 220). It is a small
island southeast of Samar. See <i>ante</i>, note 196. Dr. David P.
Barrows (<i>Census of the Philippines</i>, Washington, 1905, i, p.
413), says that the men from Suluan &ldquo;were perhaps not typical of
the rest of the population which Magellan found sparsely scattered
about the coasts of the central islands, but ... were almost certainly
of the same stock from which the present Visayan people are in the main
descended.&rdquo; These natives had probably come, he says, &ldquo;in
successively extending settlements, up the west coast of Mindanao from
the Sulu archipelago. &lsquo;Sul&uacute;an&rsquo; itself means

<i>Aguada</i>, &ldquo;watering-place&rdquo;) &ldquo;where we took on
water and wood, that island being very free of shoals&rdquo; (see

Jomonjol, or Malh&oacute;n. Its greatest dimensions are ten miles from
northwest to southeast, and five miles from northeast to southwest. It
is eleven miles southwest from the nearest point in Samar. It is called

word in the Italian MS. Mosto, citing Boerio (<i>Dizion.
veneziano</i>), says of <i>rizali</i>: &ldquo;<i>Rizzagio</i> or
<i>rizzagno</i>, &lsquo;sweepnet&rsquo; a fine thickly woven net, which
when thrown into rivers by the fisherman, opens, and when near the
bottom, closes, and covers and encloses the fish. <i>Rizzagio</i> is
also called that contrivance or net, made in the manner of an inverted
cone, with a barrel hoop attached to the circumference as a selvage. It
has a hole underneath, through which if the eels in the ponds slyly
enter the net, there is no danger of their escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fish are caught in the Philippines by various devices&mdash;in
favorable situations by traps, weirs, corrals of bamboo set along the
shore in shallow waters. Various kinds of nets and seines, the hook and
line, and also the spear, are also used. See <i>Census of the

reads: &ldquo;Hiunanghar.&rdquo; Stanley has mistranscribed
&ldquo;Huinanghar.&rdquo; It is difficult to identify the four islands
of Cenalo, Hiunanghan, Ibusson, and Abarien with certainty. Mosto (p.
71, notes) suggests that they may be Dinagat, Cabugan, Gibuson, and
Cabalari&aacute;n. The first three are evidently correct, as those
islands would naturally be sighted in the course followed. The last
island is shown in Pigafetta&rsquo;s chart to be north of
Malh&oacute;n, and the probability is that he names and locates it
merely from hearsay, and that they did not see it. Its position seems
to indicate Manicani rather than Cabalari&aacute;n.</p>
<p>After this paragraph in the Italian MS. (folio 21a) follows the
chart of the islands of Pozzon, Ticobon, Polon, Baibai and Ceilon
(together forming the island of Leyte), Gatighan, Bohol, and Mazzana
(<i>sic</i>) (<i>q.v.</i>, p. 112). This chart in MS. 5,650 (on folio

island called Seilani [<i>i.e.</i>, Leyte] which is inhabited and has
gold in it. We coasted along it and took our course to the west
southwest in order to strike a small island, which is inhabited and
called Mazava. The people there are very friendly. <span class=

the west southwest were pointed out to us from that island, which are
said to possess gold in abundance. They showed us how it was obtained.
They found pieces as large as chickpeas and beans. Masava lies in
latitude 9 and two-thirds degrees north.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, p. 11) says: &ldquo;They ran on to
another island twenty leagues from that from which they sailed
[<i>i.e.</i>, Malh&oacute;n], and came to anchor at another island,
which is named Macangor [<i>i.e.</i>, Masaua], which is nine degrees;

<p><sup><a href="#r227" id="n227" name="n227">227</a></sup> This

speechless, and told the captain, through the slave, that one of those
armed men was worth a hundred of his own men. The captain answered that
that was a fact, and that he had brought two hundred men in each ship,

&ldquo;whereat the Kynge marualed greatly, and &#383;ayde to th[e]
interpretoure (who was a &#383;laue borne in Malacha) that one of

Chinese at early as 2634 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, and first
applied to navigation in the third or fourth century <span class=

Europe through the Arabs who learned of it from the Chinese. It is

Their fashion of drinking is as follows. First they lift their hands
toward the sky, and then take with the right hand the vessel from which
they drink, while extending the fist of the left hand toward the
people. The king did that to me, and extended his fist toward me, so
that I thought that he was going to strike me. But I did the same to
him, and in such wise did we banquet and afterwards sup with him using
that ceremony and others.&rdquo; See Spencer&rsquo;s <i>Ceremonial

&ldquo;Satighan.&rdquo; The names of the five islands as given by Eden
are: &ldquo;Zeilon, Bohol, Canghu, Barbai, and Catighan.&rdquo; These
are the islands of Leite, Bohol, Canigao (west of Leyte), the northern
part of Leyte (today the name of a town, hamlet and inlet in Leyte),
and possibly Apit or Himuquitan, or one of the other nearby islands on
the west coast of Leyte. See chart of these islands on p. 112.</p>
<p>Albo (Navarrete, iv, pp. 220, 221) says: &ldquo;We left Mazava and
went north toward the island of Seilani, after which we ran along the
said island to the northwest as far as 10 degrees. There we saw three
rocky islands, and turned our course west for about 10 leguas where we
came upon two islets. We stayed there that night and in the morning
went toward the south southwest for about 12 leguas, as far as 10 and
one-third degrees. At that point we entered a channel between two
islands, one of which is called Matan and the other Subu. Subu, as well
as the islands of Mazava and Suluan extend north by east and south by
west. Between Subu and Seilani we spied a very lofty land lying to the
north, which is called Baibai. It is said to contain considerable gold
and to be well stocked with food, and so great an extent of land that
its limits are unknown. From Mazava, Seilani, and Subu, on the course
followed toward the south, look out for the many shoals, which are very
bad. On that account a canoe which was guiding us along that course,
refused to go ahead. From the beginning of the channel of Subu and
Matan, we turned west by a middle channel and reached the city of Subu.
There we anchored and made peace, and the people there gave us rice,
millet, and meat. We stayed there for a considerable time. The king and
queen of that place and many of the inhabitants readily became
Christians.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, p. 11) says that
the king of Macangar (<i>i.e.</i>, Mazaua) conducted the Spaniards
&ldquo;a matter of thirty leagues to another island named Cabo
[<i>i.e.</i>, Ceb&uacute;], which is in ten degrees, and in this island
Fernando de Magalh&atilde;es did what he pleased with the consent of

(Navarrete, iv, p. 308): &ldquo;After that, after passing amid many
islands, they reached one called Mazaba, which lies in 9 degrees. The
king of Mazaba conducted them to another large island called
Zub&oacute;.&rdquo;</p>

1503 and 1510, and the Portuguese built a fortified factory there in
1513 which was destroyed by the governor in 1525 to avoid its falling
into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. The English established a factory in the
city in 1616, which was captured in 1766 by Haidar Ali; but after a
further series of capture and recapture, the city and district was
permanently turned over to the British (1792). See Stanley&rsquo;s

<p>Malacca, or more correctly M&acirc;laka is the name of an ancient
territory and city, which was probably first settled by Javanese, and
is possibly derived from &ldquo;Malayu&rdquo; meaning in Javanese
&ldquo;to run&rdquo; or &ldquo;fugitive.&rdquo; At an early period
Malacca fell under the sway of the Siamese. The city, located on both
sides of the Malacca River, and only one hundred and thirty miles
northwest of Singapore (which has usurped the great volume of trade
once centering at Malacca) was founded about 1250 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> The first European to visit the city was Varthema,
about the year 1505. It was captured by the Portuguese under
Albuquerque in 1511, and they held it (1580&ndash;1640 under Spanish
control) until 1641 when it was captured by the Dutch, who had
unsuccessfully besieged it, with the aid of the king of Jahor, in 1606.
The English obtained possession of it in 1795, and still hold it,
although the Dutch possessed it from 1818&ndash;1825. For descriptions
and history of Malacca, see the following Hakluyt Society publications:
Stanley&rsquo;s <i>East Africa and Malabar</i> (London, 1866), pp.

<p>The terms India Major (Greater India) and India Minor (Lesser India)
are differently applied by different authors. Schiltbergen applied the
term Lesser India to the northern portion of the peninsula on this side
of the Ganges, while the southern portion of the peninsula was termed
Greater India. Marco Polo&rsquo;s Lesser India extended from Makran to
and including the Coromandel coast, and his Greater India extended from
the Coromandel coast to Cochin China, while Middle India was Abyssinia.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>Mosto wrongly identifies India Major with the
present Indian empire. See Telfer&rsquo;s <i>Johann Schiltberger</i>
(Hakluyt Society publications, 1879). Friar Jordanus (<i>Wonders of the
East</i>, Hakluyt Society edition, London, 1863), describes (pp.
11&ndash;45) India the Less, India the Greater, and India Tertia. Yule
points out that Jordanus&rsquo;s Lesser India embraces Sindh, and
probably Mekran, and India along the coast as far as some point
immediately north of Malabar. Greater India extends from Malabar very
indefinitely to the eastward, for he makes it include Champa. India
Tertia is the east of Africa below Abyssinia. Thus Jordanus just
reverses the Lesser and Greater Indias of Marco Polo. Ramusio who gives
the <i>Summary of Kingdoms</i> of an old Portuguese geographer, ends
First India at Mangalore, and Second India at the Ganges. Benjamin of
Tudela speaks of &ldquo;Middle India which is called Aden.&rdquo; Conti
divides India into three parts: the first extending from Persia to the
Indus, the second from the Indus to the Ganges, and the third all the
land beyond. Pliny discusses whether Mekran and other lands belonged to
India or Ariana.</p>

all the idols of his country burned and set up a cross in their place,

and raised toward the heaven. The captain showed the king how he was to

the hand, and they walked to the platform. At his baptism the captain
told the king that he would call him Dom Charles, after the emperor his
sovereign. He named the prince Dom Fernand, after the brother of the
said emperor, and the king of Mazzaua, Jehan. He gave the name of
Christofle to the Moro, while he called each of the others by names
according to his fancy. Thus before the mass fifty men [<i>sic</i>: but
an error of the French adapter for five hundred] were baptized. At the
conclusion of mass, the captain invited the king and the others of his
chief men to dine with him, but he would not accept. However, he
accompanied the captain to the shore, where, at his arrival, the ships
discharged all the artillery. Then embracing they took leave of one

<p><sup><a href="#r325" id="n325" name="n325">325</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads from this point: &ldquo;Then they swore, and thus the captain
caused the king to swear by that image, by the life of the emperor his
sovereign, and by his habit, to ever remain faithful and subject to the
emperor,&rdquo; thus ascribing this oath to the king instead of to
Magalh&atilde;es. The words &ldquo;by his habit&rdquo; can refer only
to Magalh&atilde;es, who wore that of Santiago, and not to any habit
worn by the barbaric ruler of Ceb&uacute;.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#r330" id="n330" name="n330">330</a></sup> There is a
strange difference between the Italian MS. and MS. 5,650 in regard to
these names. The latter reads to this point: &ldquo;There are a number
of villages in that island, whose names and those of their chiefs are
as follows: Cinghapola, Cilaton, Ciguibucan, Cimaningha, Cimaticat, and
Cicambul; another, Mandaui, and its chief and seignior, Lambuzzan;
another Cot-cot, and its chief, Acibagalen; another, Puzzo, and its
chief, Apanoan; another, Lalan, and its chief, Theteu; another,
Lulutan, and its chief, Tapan [Amoretti, followed by Stanley, says
Japau, and Mosto, Iapan]; another Cilumay; and also Lubucun.&rdquo;
Amoretti, who places this list after the disastrous battle and
consequent treachery of the Cebuans, and Stanley, have &ldquo;Lubucin:
its chief is Cilumai.&rdquo; Mandaui is Mandaue; Lalan may be Liloan;
Cot-cot is on the east coast; Lubucun may be Lub&uacute;, but Mosto (p.
78, note 3) conjectures it to be Lambusan. An examination of the Nancy
MS. may reveal the source of this difference.</p>

out, showing that the writer or adapter of that MS. had at first
intended to narrate the custom that is given in the Italian MS.</p>

present. Cf. Loarca&rsquo;s description of burial and mourning customs
among the Visayans, <span class="sc">Vol. V</span>, pp. 129, 135,

<p><sup><a href="#r343" id="n343" name="n343">343</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;five or six hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r344" id="n344" name="n344">344</a></sup> Eden in
describing the island of Matan confuses the Pigafetta narrative. He
says: &ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">Not farre from this Ilande of Zubut,
is the Hand of Mathan, who&#383;e inhabitauntes v&#383;e maruelous
ceremonies in theyr &#383;acrifices to the &#383;oone and burying the
deade. They were rynges of gold abowt theyr priuie members.&rdquo; In
the description of the battle in Matan, Eden says that each of the
three divisions of the islanders contained &ldquo;two thou&#383;and and
fiftie men armed with bowes, arrowes, dartes and iauelins hardened at
the poyntes with fyer.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r345" id="n345" name="n345">345</a></sup> To this
point the Italian MS. and MS. 5,650 agree approximately. The story of
the battle in the latter MS., however, is much abridged and much less
graphic. It is as follows: &ldquo;They replied that they had bamboo
spears and stakes burned and hardened in the fire, and that we could
attack them when we wished. At daybreak, forty-nine of us leaped into
the water, in the place whither we had thus gone, at a distance of more
than three [<i>sic</i>] crossbow flights before we could reach shore,
for the boats could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339"
name="pb339">339</a>]</span>not approach nearer because of the rocks
and reefs which were in the water. Thus we reached land, and attacked
them. They were arranged in three divisions, of more than one thousand
five hundred persons. We shot many arrows at them from a distance, but
it was in vain, for they received them on their shields. They leaped
hither and thither in such a way that scarce could we wound one of
them. On the other hand, our artillery in the boats was so far away
from us that it could not aid us. Those people seeing that, and that
the captain had had some of their houses burned in order to inspire
them with terror, and having become more enraged, threw so many iron
pointed spears at us, and shot so many arrows even at the captain
himself that we could defend ourselves with difficulty. Finally, having
been driven by them quite down to the shore, and while our captain was
fighting bravely although wounded in the leg with an arrow, one of
those Indians hurled a poisoned bamboo lance into his face which laid
him stiff and dead. Then they pressed upon us so closely that we were
forced to retire to our boats and to leave the dead body of the
captain-general, with our other killed.&rdquo; The eulogy on the dead
commander is approximately the same in both MSS., except at the end,
where MS. 5,650 reads: &ldquo;Eight of our men died there with him, and
four Indians, who had become Christians. Of the enemy fifteen were
killed by the artillery of the ships, which had at last come to our
aid, while many of us were wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) says of the stay at Ceb&uacute; and
the death of Magalh&atilde;es: &ldquo;They stayed there about one
month, and the majority of the people and the king became Christians.
The king of Zub&oacute; ordered the kings of the other islands to come
to him, but inasmuch as two of them refused to come, Magallanes, as
soon as he learned it, resolved to go to fight with them, and went to
an island called Math&aacute;. He set fire to a village, and not
content with that, set out for a large settlement, where he, his
servant, and five Castilians were killed in combat with the savages.
The others, seeing their captain dead, went back to their
boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup><a href="#r348" id="n348" name="n348">348</a></sup> The
&ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, p. 12) dates the battle April 28. The
account of the battle is as follows: &ldquo;Fernan de Magalh&atilde;es
desired that the other kings, neighbours to this one, should become
subject to this who had become Christian: and these did not choose to
yield such obedience. Fernan de Magalh&atilde;es seeing that, got ready
one night with his boats, and burned the villages of those who would
not yield the said obedience; and a matter of ten or twelve days after
this was done, he sent to a village about <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>half a league from
that which he had burned, which is named Matam, and which is also an
island, and ordered them to send him at once three goats, three pigs,
three loads of rice, and three loads of millet for provisions for the
ships; they replied that for each article which he sent to ask them
three of, they would send to him by twos, and if he was satisfied with
this they would at once comply, if not, it might be as he pleased, but
that they would not give it. Because they did not choose to grant what
he demanded of them, Fernan de Magalh&atilde;es ordered three boats to
be equipped with a matter of fifty or sixty men, and went against the
said place, which was on the 28th day of April, in the morning; there
they found many people, who might well be as many as three thousand or
four thousand men, who fought with such a good will that the said
Fernan de Magalh&atilde;es was killed there, with six of his men, in
the year 1521.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r349" id="n349" name="n349">349</a></sup> Navarrete
(iv, pp. 65, 66) gives the names of the men killed with
Magalh&atilde;es on April 27 as follows: Christ&oacute;bal Rabelo, then
captain of the &ldquo;Victoria;&rdquo; Francisco Espinosa, a sailor;
Anton Gallego, a common seaman; Juan de Torres, sobresaliente and
soldier; Rodrigo Nieto, servant of Juan de Cartagena; Pedro Gomez,
servant of Gonzalo Espinosa; and Anton de Escovar, sobresaliente,
wounded but died April 29.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#r351" id="n351" name="n351">351</a></sup> MS. 5,650
gives this name as Duart Bobase, although lower it is spelled Barbase.
Duarte or Odoardo Barbosa, the son of Diogo Barbosa, who after serving
in Portugal, became alcaide of the Sevilla arsenal, was born at Lisbon
at the end of the fifteenth century. He spent the years 1501&ndash;1516
in the Orient, the result of that stay being his <i lang="pt">Livro
emque d&agrave; rela&ccedil;&atilde;o do que viu e ouviu no
Oriente</i>, which was first published at Lisbon in 1813 in vol. vii of
<i lang="pt">Collec&ccedil;ao de noticias para a historia et geographia
das na&ccedil;&otilde;es ultramarinas</i>, and its translation by
Stanley, <i>A description of the coasts of East Africa and Malabar</i>
(Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1866). He became a clerk in the
Portuguese factory at Cananor under his uncle Gil Fernandez Barbosa,
and became so expert in the Malabar language that he was said to speak
it even better than the natives. On account of his facility in the
language he had been appointed commissioner by Nuno da Cunha to
negotiate peace with the Zamorin. He was commissioned in 1515 to
oversee the construction of some galleys by Alboquerque. While at
Sevilla, Magalh&atilde;es lived in the household of Diogo Barbosa,
where he married Duarte&rsquo;s sister Beatriz. Duarte embarked on the
&ldquo;Trinidad&rdquo; as a sobresaliente, and it was he who captured
the &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo; from the mutineers at Port St. Julian, after
which he became captain of that vessel. Failing to recover
Magalh&atilde;es body from the natives of Mact&aacute;n, he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>himself slain at Ceb&uacute; at the fatal
banquet May 1, 1521. Besides the above book, which is a most valuable
contribution to early Oriental affairs, there is extant in the Torre do
Tombo a letter written by him from Cananor, January 12, 1513,
complaining of the Portuguese excesses. See Guillemard&rsquo;s
<i>Magellan</i>; Stanley&rsquo;s <i>Vasco da Gama</i>; Birch&rsquo;s
<i>Alboquerque</i>; and Hoefer&rsquo;s <i>Nouvelle Biographie
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> (Paris, 1855)</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r352" id="n352" name="n352">352</a></sup> See
<i>ante</i>, note 147.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r353" id="n353" name="n353">353</a></sup>
Magalh&atilde;es married Beatriz Barbosa, daughter of Diogo Barbosa in
Sevilla, probably in the year 1517. One son Rodrigo was born of the
union, who was about six months old at the time of the departure.
Rodrigo died in September, 1521, and in the March following Beatriz
died. See Guillemard, <i>ut supra</i>, pp. 89&ndash;91, 322.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r354" id="n354" name="n354">354</a></sup> MS. 5,650
adds: &ldquo;and to advise the Christian king.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r355" id="n355" name="n355">355</a></sup> Mosto
transcribes this word wrongly as <i>facente</i>, &ldquo;busy.&rdquo;
MS. 5,650 reads: &ldquo;wiser and more affectionate than
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r356" id="n356" name="n356">356</a></sup> MS. 5,650
adds: &ldquo;and presents.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r357" id="n357" name="n357">357</a></sup> The
constable was Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, who was left behind with the
&ldquo;Trinidad&rdquo; and was one of the four survivors of that
ill-fated vessel, returning to Spain long after.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r358" id="n358" name="n358">358</a></sup> This
sentence is confused in MS. 5,650, reading: <i lang="fr-1500">jehan

<p><sup><a href="#r359" id="n359" name="n359">359</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;for we would kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r360" id="n360" name="n360">360</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;But Jehan Carvaie, his comrade, and others refused, for
fear lest they would not remain masters there if the boat went
ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In regard to Jo&atilde;o Serr&atilde;o&rsquo;s death, Brito
(Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says: &ldquo;As soon as the men in the ships
saw that slaughter, they hoisted their anchors, and tried to set sail
in order to return to Burneo. At that juncture, the savages brought
Juan Serrano, one of those whom they wished to ransom, and asked two
guns and two bahars of copper for him, besides some Brittanias or
linens such as they carried in the ships as merchandise of trade and
barter. Serrano told them to take him to the ship and he would give
them what they asked, but they, on the contrary, insisted that those
things be taken ashore. But [the men in the ships] fearing another act
of treachery like the past, set sail, and abandoned that man there, and
nothing more was heard of him.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#r361" id="n361" name="n361">361</a></sup> The
&ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, p. 13) says nothing about the banquet,
but says that the men, twenty-eight in number, counting the two
captains, went ashore to ask pilots to Borneo, whereupon the natives,
who had determined upon their course of action attacked and killed
them. Peter Martyr (Mosto, p. 81, note 5) asserts that the violation of
the women by the sailors was the cause of the massacre. Concerning the
number killed, Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that thirty-five or
thirty-six men went ashore, and Castanheda and Gomara say thirty, the
last asserting that a like number were made slaves, of whom eight were
sold in China. Peter Martyr places the number of the slain at twelve.
Navarrete (iv, pp. 66, 67) gives the names of those massacred as
follows:</p>

<p><sup><a href="#r373" id="n373" name="n373">373</a></sup> Tinapay
(used also by the Bicols to denote any kind of bread) denotes a kind of
cake or loaf made with flour and baked about the size of a
chocolate-cup saucer. Two of these are put together before baking with
some sugar between. The word is extended also to wheat bread and to the
hosts. See Encarnaci&oacute;n&rsquo;s <i>Diccionario</i>.</p>

Amoretti&rsquo;s conjectured reading of <i>sonaglio</i>
(&ldquo;hawk&rsquo;s-bell&rdquo;) for <i>conaglio</i> (see Mosto, p.
83), proves correct from the Visayan dictionaries.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r375" id="n375" name="n375">375</a></sup>
<i>Baloto</i> signifies a canoe dug out of a single log. One of twenty
varas in length is termed <i>bilis</i>, while the hull alone is called
<i>dal&aacute;mas</i>.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r376" id="n376" name="n376">376</a></sup> Most of the
words of Pigafetta&rsquo;s Visayan vocabulary can be distinguished in
the dictionaries of that language, although <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>it
is necessary to make allowance at times for Pigafetta&rsquo;s Italian
phonetic rendering. Following is a list of the words that can be
distinguished from <i>Diccionario bisaya-espa&ntilde;ol y
espa&ntilde;ol-bisaya</i> (Manila, 1885), by Juan F&eacute;lix de la
Encarnaci&oacute;n, O.S.A. (Recollect); and <i>Diccionario
Hispano-bisaya y bisaya-espa&ntilde;ol</i> (Manila, 1895) by Antonio
Sanchez de la Rosa, O.S.F. See also <i>Pocket dictionary of the
English, Spanish and Visayan languages</i> (Cebu, 1900) by H. M. Cohen;
and Mallat&rsquo;s <i>Les Philippines</i> (Paris, 1846), ii, pp.
175&ndash;238. The words queried in the following list are simply
offered as conjectural equivalents.</p>

<p>Some of the words present difficulties however, due probably to
error on Pigafetta&rsquo;s part and the obstacles in the method of
communication between peoples the genius of whose respective languages

the ships on leaving Ceb&uacute;: &ldquo;We left Subu and sailed
southwest to a latitude of 9 and three-fourths degrees, between the end
of Subu and an island called Bohol. Toward the western end of Subu lies
another island, by name, Panilongo, which is inhabited by blacks. That
island and Subu contain gold and considerable ginger. The former lies
in 9 and one-third degrees and Subu in 10 and one-third degrees.
Accordingly we left that channel and went 10 leguas south and anchored
in the island of Bohol. There we made two ships of the three, burning
the third, because we had no men. The last-named island lies in 9 and
one-half degrees. We left Bohol and sailed southwest toward Quipit, and
anchored at that settlement on the right hand side of a river. On the
northwest and open side are two islets which lie in 8 and one-half
degrees. We could get no food there, for the people had none, but we
made peace with them. That island of Quipit contains a quantity of
gold, ginger, and cinnamon. Accordingly, we determined to go in search
of food. The distance from the headland of Quipit to the first islands
is about 112 leguas. It and the islands lie in an east by north and
south by west direction; and this island [<i>i.e.</i>, Mindanao]
extends quite generally east and west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, p. 14) calls the port of Quipit
(which is located on the northeastern coast of Mindanao) Capyam or
Quype. Carvalho gave the boat of the burned ship to the inhabitants of
that place. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that they learned the
location of Borneo at Mindanao. Quipit becomes Gibith in Transylvanus,
Chipico in Peter Martyr, and Quepindo in Barros (see Mosto, p. 84, note

Quipit] and sailed west southwest, southwest, and west, until we came
to an island containing very few inhabitants and called Quagayan. We
anchored in the northern part of that island, where we asked for the
location of the island of Poluan, in order to get provisions of rice,
for that island contains it in abundance, and many ships are laden
there for other districts. Accordingly we sailed west northwest and

<p><sup><a href="#r398" id="n398" name="n398">398</a></sup> Occurrences
at Palawan are given as follows by Albo (Navarrete, iv, pp. 221, 222):
&ldquo;Then we sailed north by east along the coast [of Palawan] until
we reached a village called Saocao, where we made peace. Its
inhabitants were Moros. We went to another village of Cafres, where we
bartered for a considerable quantity of rice, and consequently laid in
a good supply of provisions. That coast extends northeast and
southwest. The headland of its northeastern part lies in 9 and
one-third degrees, and that of the southwestern part in 8 and one-third
degrees. Then on returning to the southwest quite to the headland of
this island, we found an island near which is a bay. In this course and
along Poluan many shoals are found. This headland lies east and west
with Quipit and northeast by east and southwest by west with
Quagayan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, pp. 15&ndash;17) gives a fuller
account of occurrences at Palawan. At the first settlement at which
they attempt to land, the natives prove hostile, whereupon they go
toward another island, but contrary weather compelling them to anchor
near Palawan, they are invited ashore on that island by the people of
another village. There one of the soldiers, Joam de Campos, lands alone
in order to get provisions. Being received kindly at this port, named
Dyguasam (perhaps Puerto Princesa), the people set about preparing
provisions for the strangers. Then going to another nearby village,
where Carvalho makes peace with the chief, provisions of rice, goats,
and swine are bought. At the latter village, a Portuguese-speaking
negro who has been baptized at the Moluccas, is met, who promises
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>to guide them to Borneo, but he fails them at
the last moment. Capturing a prau and three Moros near the former
village, they are guided to Borneo. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says
that the two ships remained a month in Palawan, &ldquo;a rich country,
where they got new directions about Burneo, and captured two men to
guide them there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup><a href="#r419" id="n419" name="n419">419</a></sup> The journey
to Borneo, events there, and a description of Borneo are thus described
by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 222): &ldquo;We sailed from Poluan to
Borney. Coasting the above named island [<i>i.e.</i>, Poluan] to its
southwest headland, we discovered an island with a shoal on its eastern
side, and which lies in 7 and one-half degrees, so that we had to
deviate to the west for about fifteen leguas. Then we sailed southwest
coasting along the island of Borney to a city of the same name. You
must needs know that the land must be approached closely, for there are
many shoals outside, and one must keep the sounding line in constant
use, for it is a harsh coast. Borney is a large city with a very large
bay. Both inside and outside of it are many shoals, so that a native
pilot of that place is necessary. We remained there for a considerable
number of days, and commenced to trade there and made firm friendship.
But later, many canoes, in number 260, were equipped to capture us and
came upon us. When we saw them, we left hurriedly, and sailed out of
the bay, whereupon we saw some junks coming. We went to them and
captured one, in which was a son of the king of Luzon. The latter is a
very large island. The captain afterward let him go [<i>i.e.</i>, the
prince of Luz&oacute;n] without asking advice of anyone. Borney it a
large island which yields cinnamon, mirabolans, and camphor,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>the last named of which is much esteemed in
these lands, and it is said that when people die they are embalmed with
it. Borney (that is, the port of Borney) lies in a latitude of 5
degrees and 25 minutes, and a longitude of 201 degrees and 5 minutes
from the line of demarcation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, pp. 17&ndash;20) says that while
on the way to Borneo, the ships anchor at islands which they call the
islets of St. Paul (now, the Mantanani Islands&mdash;Guillemard,
<i>Magellan</i>, p. 269) at a distance of two and one-half or three
leagues from Borneo. Proceeding past a lofty mountain (Kina
Balu&mdash;Guillemard) in Borneo, they coast that island to the port of
Borneo. Anchoring in that port, the Moro pilots captured at Palawan are
sent ashore with one of the crew, and on reaching the city of Borneo,
they are taken before the Shahbender of Borneo. The two ships draw in
closer to the city and establish trade with the natives. Gonzalo Gomez
Espinosa is chosen ambassador to the king to whom he takes a present.
After a stay of twenty-three days in Borneo, the men in the ships
fearing treachery from the evolutions of a number of praus and junks,
attack and capture one of the latter with twenty-seven men. Next
morning the junk commanded by the son of the king of Luzon and ninety
men, are captured. Of the seven men ashore the king sends two to the
ships, but retains the others, whereupon the ships leave, taking with
them fourteen men and three women of those captured in the junks. While
sailing back over their downward course, the &ldquo;Trinidad&rdquo;
grounds on a point of the island of Borneo, where it remains for four
hours until swung clear by the tide.</p>
<p>Brito in his account (Navarrete, iv, pp. 309, 310) says that the
Borneans fear at first lest the strangers be Portuguese and that their
object is conquest, but finally being reassured by Espinosa who takes a
present to the king, pilots are promised as far as Mindanao. During
their stay of a month at Borneo, two Greeks desert the ships. Three
others, among them Carvalho&rsquo;s son, are ashore when the fear of
attack instigated by the two Greeks leads the two ships to attack the
Borneans, and the five men are left behind on the island.</p>
<p>The island of Borneo, the largest island (properly so-called) in the
world, is mentioned first by Varthema (<i>Travels</i>, Hakluyt Society
edition), pp. 246&ndash;248. See also Crawfurd&rsquo;s

outskirts of the Orient. They are made of earth, which is kept for more
than fifty years buried in the earth, in order to refine it, and which

a Spaniard or Portuguese, he would not have written as he did
concerning the Mahometan laws, as he would have been better informed.
Notwithstanding the fact that Stanley was a convert to Islamism and a
student of that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355"

been introduced into Borneo, as the rites there being far from their

place. For instance, that the law was not strictly observed there is
seen from the fact recorded by Pigafetta that they used the intoxicant
arrack.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r429" id="n429" name="n429">429</a></sup> MS. 5,650
says simply that the camphor exudes in small drops. The Malay camphor
tree (<i>dipterocarpus</i> or <i>Dryabalanops camphora</i>) is
confined, so far as known, to a few parts of the islands of Sumatra and
Borneo, where it is very abundant. The oil (both fluid and solid) is
found in the body of the tree where the sap should be, but not in all
trees. The Malay name for camphor is a slight corruption of the
Sanskrit one &ldquo;karpura,&rdquo; and to distinguish it from the
camphor of China and Japan, the word Barus is annexed (the name of the
seaport of the western coast of Sumatra, whence camphor was chiefly
exported from that island). The Malay variety is higher priced than the
Chinese. See Crawfurd&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, p. 81.</p>

pearl oysters of the Philippine Islands are found along the coasts of
Paragua, Mindanao, and in the Sulu Archipelago, especially in the last
named, where many very valuable pearls are found. These fisheries are
said to rank with the famous fisheries of Ceylon and the Persian Gulf.
The mother-of-pearl of the shells is more valuable than the pearls. The
Sultan of Jol&oacute; claims the fisheries as his own and rents them
out, but always has trouble with the lessees, and his ownership is
disputed by the datos. The pearl fishery has figured in a treaty
between that sultan and the United States government. See <i>Affairs of

(<i>Census of the Philippines</i>, i, p. 416) &ldquo;suggests a

stronger taste and fragrance is found in Zamboanga, Caraga, and the
mountain districts of Misamis, than that of Ceylon, although containing
a bitter element that depreciates its value, but which can be
eliminated by cultivation. Many of the old writers describe the plant
and its cultivation, one of the earliest being Varthema (Hakluyt

Batolaque, the first of which Mosto (p. 91, note 3) conjectures to be
Sibago, and the second (note 4), part of the southern portion of
Mindanao. The first conjecture is probably correct if we take
Albo&rsquo;s word that the two ships turned to the southeast after
passing the island Sibuco; and the fact that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>main

to the second.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#r455" id="n455" name="n455">455</a></sup> It is just
such acts as this bit of lawlessness, together with the unprovoked

<p><sup><a href="#r456" id="n456" name="n456">456</a></sup> These
islands are of the Carcaralong or Karkaralong group south of Mindanao.
Mosto conjectures Cabaluzao (Cabulazao on the chart) to be the island
of Kabalusu, and that of Lipan, to be Lipang. Valentyn&rsquo;s <i lang=

between pp. 36 and 37, shows a group of islands at about this location
with the names Lirong (Lipan ?), Karkelang, Cabroewang Noessa (Nuza ?),
Karkarotang, and Karotta.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r457" id="n457" name="n457">457</a></sup> At this
point in the Italian MS. occur two charts: 1. On folio 51a, the islands
of Cauiao, Cabiao, Cabulazao, Lipan, Cheava, Camanuca, Cheai, Nuza, and
Sanghir (<i>q.v.</i>, p. 242); in MS. 5,650 shown on folio 65b,
preceded by the words: &ldquo;Chart of the islands of Sanghir
etc.&rdquo; 2. On folio 51b, the islands of Cheama, Carachita, Para,
Zangalura, Ciau, Paghinzara, Talaut, Zoar, and Meau (<i>q.v.</i> p.
246); in MS. 5,650, on folio 66b, preceded by the words: &ldquo;Chart
of the islands of Meau, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanghir (now Sanguir) is called Sanguin by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p.
223), and by Castanheda (Mosto, p. 92, note 1).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r458" id="n458" name="n458">458</a></sup> Of these
islands (some of them in the Talantse group) Cheama is Kima; Carachita
is Karakitang; Para still retains that name, or is called Pala;
Zanghalura is Sangalong or Sangaluan; Ciau is Siao or Sian; Paghinzara
(so called by Albo, <i>ut supra</i>) figures on Valentyn&rsquo;s map
(<i>ut supra</i>, note 457) as Pangasare, though the same island seems
also to be called Tagulanda, so that Guillemard is right in his
identification of this island; it is identified with the island of
Roang by the British Admiralty map of 1890, while Mosto conjectures
that it may be the island of Biaro. See Guillemard&rsquo;s
<i>Magellan</i>, map, facing p. 226; and Mosto, p. 92, notes
2&ndash;7.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r459" id="n459" name="n459">459</a></sup> MS. 5,650

by Albo) and Meau may be the islands of Meyo and Tifore. See Guillemard
(<i>ut supra</i>), and Mosto, p. 92, notes 8&ndash;10. The geography of
the islands of the East India groups has not yet been set forth in a
detailed and masterly manner, or definite proportions given to it,
although it is a subject that merits enthusiastic research and

<p>Albo&rsquo;s narrative (Navarrete, iv, pp. 222&ndash;224) of the
events of the two ships from the time they leave Borneo to the arrival
at the Moluccas is as follows: &ldquo;We left Borney, and returned by
the road whence we had come, and consequently took the channel between
the headland of the island of Borney and Poluan. Turning west
[<i>sic</i>] we went toward the island of Quagayan, and thus we went by
that same route in search of the island of Quipit toward the south. On
this course between Quipit and Cagayan, we saw to the southward an
island called Solo, where many very large pearls are to be found. The
king of that island is said to have a pearl as large as an egg. That
island lies in a latitude of 6 degrees. While on that course, we came
across three small islets and farther on we met an island called
Tagima, where many pearls are said to be found. The latter island lies
northeast by east and southwest by west with Solo. Tagima lies in a
latitude of 6 and five-sixths degrees, and is located opposite the
headland of Quipit. Many islets lie between those two islands, and one
must take to the open as he approaches Quipit. The abovenamed headland
lies in 7 and one-fourth degrees, and extends southeast and west
northwest with Poluan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thence we coasted the island of Quipit going toward the
south. Turning east by south we sailed toward certain rocky islets.
Along the coast many settlements are passed, where considerable
excellent cinnamon grows, and for which we traded. That coast also
produces a quantity of ginger. Then we sailed northeast until we saw a
gulf, whereupon we turned southeast until we saw a large island. There
is a very large settlement extending from that point to the eastern
headland of the island of Quipit, and at the headland of the said
island. Considerable gold is obtained there from a very large river.
That headland lies 91 and one-half degrees from the meridian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left Quipit for Maluco and turned southeast, where we saw
an island called Sibuco. Then we turned south southeast, where we saw
another island called Viramo Batolaque, continuing along that same
course to the head of that island. Then we saw another island called
Candicar, and sailed eastward between <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>the two islands until
we reached a point some distance ahead, and at that place we entered a
channel between Candicar and another island called Sarangani. We
anchored at the latter island and took a pilot for Maluco. Those two
islands lie in 4 and two-thirds degrees, while the headland of Quipit
lies in 7 and one-fourth degrees, the headland of Sibuco in 6 degrees
south latitude, and the headland of Virano Batolaque in 5 degrees. From
the headland of Quipit and Candicar, the course is north northwest and
south southeast without meeting any headland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left Sarangani and sailed south by east until we reached
the right side of an island called Sanguin. Between the two islands lie
a number of islets lying toward the west. Sanguin lies in 3 and
two-thirds degrees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Sanguin we sailed south by east to an island called
Sian. Between those islands lie many rocky islets. The latter island
lies in exactly 3 degrees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sailed south by west to an island called Paginsara, which
lies in 10 and one-sixth degrees. The course from that island to
Sarangani is north by east and south by west and all those islands are
sighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Paginsara we sailed south by east until we reached a
position midway between two islets which lie northeast and southwest
from one another. The one to the northeast is called Suar and the other
Mean. The first lies in 1 degree 45 minutes and the other in 1 and
one-half degrees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sailed south southeast from Mean, until we sighted the
islands of the Malucos. Then we turned east and entered a channel
between Mare and Tidori, where we anchored. We were received there with
the utmost friendliness and established a firm peace. We built a house
ashore in order to trade with those people, and abode there many days
until the ships were laden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, pp. 20&ndash;23) says that after
leaving Borneo, a small junk laden with cocoanuts was overhauled and
captured, and that shortly after the ships were careened for repairs in
the port of St. Mary of August (see <i>ante</i>, note 435). Steering
southwest on again setting sail, they come to the island of Fagajam
(Cagayan) and that of Seloque (Solo or Jol&oacute;), where they learn
that pearls are abundant. Next they reach Quipe (Quipit), running
between it and the island of Tamgym (Tagima). &ldquo;And always running
along the coast of the said island, and going thus, they fell in with a
parao laden with sago in loaves, which is bread made of a tree which is
named cajare, which the people of that country eat as bread. This parao
carried twenty-one men, and the chief of them had been in Maluco in the
house of Francisco Serram, and having gone further along this island
they arrived in sight of some islands <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb361" href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>which are named
Semrryn.&rdquo; A guide to Maluco is bargained for, but after
arrangements are concluded he attempts to play false, whereupon he and
some others are captured. The natives attempt pursuit but are unable to
overtake the two ships. Next day sighting an island, and a calm coming
upon them, while the currents drew the vessels in toward shore, the old
pilot escapes. Continuing they sight &ldquo;three high mountains
belonging to a nation of people whom they call the Salabos
[Celebes?],&rdquo; and shortly after desiring to take water at a small
island, they are deterred by one of their native pilots, who assures
them that the people are hostile. &ldquo;While still in this
neighborhood, they saw the islands themselves of Maluco, and for
rejoicing they fired all the artillery, and they arrived at the island
on the 8th of November of 1521, so that they spent from Seville to
Maluco two years, two months and twenty-eight days, for they sailed on
the 10th of August of 1519.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) places the distance from
the Ladrones to the Moluccas at 1,000 miles, the archipelago of St.
Lazarus &ldquo;where there occur many islands&rdquo; intervening.</p>
<p>At this point in the Italian MS. are found two charts, as follows:
1. On folio 52b, a chart of the islands of Hiri, Tarenate, Mastara, and
Giailonlo (<i>q.v.</i>, p. 250), with the inscription &ldquo;All the
islands shown in this book are in the other hemisphere, at the
antipodes;&rdquo; probably the same chart appears on folio 73b of MS.
5,650 preceded by the words (in a different hand than most of that
MS.): &ldquo;Here follow the cloves.&rdquo; 2. On folio 53a, a chart
entitled &ldquo;Maluco,&rdquo; showing the islands Tadore, Mare,
Pulongha, Mutir, and Machiam (<i>q.v.</i>, <span class="sc">Vol.

cent of the freight or of the lading space of the ship allowed the

Magalh&atilde;es and Falero at Barcelona, May 8, 1519. The amounts (see

<p><sup><a href="#r472" id="n472" name="n472">472</a></sup> Not nephew,
as translated by Stanley (p. 126), as is shown later by the context.
MS. 5,650 spells his name &ldquo;Calanoghapi.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r473" id="n473" name="n473">473</a></sup> The
remainder of this sentence is not in MS. 5,650.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r474" id="n474" name="n474">474</a></sup> In MS.
5,650 this is changed considerably, reading: &ldquo;And because he did
not have enough merchandise to furnish our ships, he told us that he
would go to an island called Bacchian,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r475" id="n475" name="n475">475</a></sup> Leonardo de
Argensola (<span class="sc">Vol. XVI</span>, p. 221) derives Maluco
from the word &ldquo;Moloc&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;the capital.&rdquo;
Crawfurd <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>says that the derivation and meaning of the word
is unknown, although said to be that of a people and place in Gilolo.
It has been applied as a collective name to all the islands of their
district, but it is correct of only the five mentioned by Pigafetta
(for whose ancient names, see <span class="sc">Vol. XVI</span>, p.
221). Varthema (<i>Travels</i>, Hakluyt Society edition, pp. 245, 246),
gives a slight account of the district under the name of the
&ldquo;island of Monoch, where the cloves grow,&rdquo; which
Magalh&atilde;es showed to C&aacute;rlos I (Guillemard&rsquo;s
<i>Magellan</i>, p. 102). Barbosa gives the first authentic account of
the five Moluccas (which he names) in his <i>East African and Malabar
Coasts</i> (Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 201, 202, 219, 220. See also
Crawfurd&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, pp. 283&ndash;285.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r476" id="n476" name="n476">476</a></sup> Francisco
Serr&atilde;o, brother of Jo&atilde;o Serr&atilde;o, was
Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s most intimate friend, and they had been close
companions in the stirring years of early Portuguese operations in far
eastern waters. In 1509, Serr&atilde;o sailed on the fleet sent by
Almeida to reconnoiter Malacca. Having been sent ashore with a large
force, he was attacked by the Malays and only the prompt assistance
headed by Magalh&atilde;es saved him. In January, 1510, while returning
from the expedition, he suffered shipwreck. In 1511 he was sent as
captain of one of three ships under Antonio d&rsquo; Abreu to the
Moluccas for purposes of exploration and trade, but the expedition
failed to reach the islands, going only as far as the islands of Banda.
On this expedition, Serr&atilde;o&rsquo;s ship was abandoned as
unseaworthy, and the junk bought in its stead was wrecked on an island.
Here pirates landing, Serr&atilde;o and his men took possession of
their boats and thus reached Amboina in safety. The opportunity
offering, Serr&atilde;o went to Ternate, where he espoused the cause of
that king against the king of Tidore, by the latter of whom he was
finally poisoned about the time of Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s death. A
number of letters passed between Magalh&atilde;es and Serr&atilde;o,
during the years spent by the latter in Ternate, and Magalh&atilde;es
made use of them to persuade C&aacute;rlos I to undertake the
expedition. See Guillemard&rsquo;s <i>Magellan</i>.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r477" id="n477" name="n477">477</a></sup> See
Navarrete, iv, and Guillemard&rsquo;s <i>Magellan</i> for details
regarding Magalh&atilde;es&rsquo;s negotiations with Manoel of Portugal
and his subsequent denaturalization. The testoon (tost&atilde;o,
tost&otilde;es) is a Portuguese silver coin. It was first struck in the
fifteenth century (Hazlitt&rsquo;s <i>Coinage of European
Continent</i>).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r478" id="n478" name="n478">478</a></sup> It is
impossible to be sure of the correct form of these names. MS. 5,650
gives them as follows: &ldquo;Checchily Momoly, Tadore Vimghi,
Checchily de Roix, Cili Manzur, Cilli Paggi, Chialin, Checchilin
Catara, Vaiechuserich, and Colano Ghappi.&rdquo; Amoretti (followed by
Stanley) makes these names &ldquo;Chechili-Momuli, Jadore Vunghi,
Chechilideroix, Cilimanzur, Cilipagi, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>Chialinchechilin,
Cataravajecu, Serich, and Calanopagi.&rdquo; Mosto gives the names as
in the present edition with the exception of the sixth and seventh
which he gives as &ldquo;Chialin Chechilin&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Cathara.&rdquo; <i>Checheli</i> (<i>Chechelin</i>) and possibly
<i>Cili</i>, denotes the title <i>Cachil</i> (&ldquo;noble&rdquo;).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r479" id="n479" name="n479">479</a></sup> Called by
Barros &ldquo;Jo&atilde;o de Lourosa, a man disloyal to his country
(Mosto, p. 94, note 5). The &ldquo;Roteiro&rdquo; (Stanley, pp. 23,
24), says that this man was found in the island of Targatell (Ternate)
and that letters were sent him, asking him &ldquo;to come and speak
with them, to which he replied that he did not dare, because the king
of the country forbade it.&rdquo; However, permission is secured from
the king and Lorosa comes to the ships. An extract from a letter from
the Indies (<span class="sc">Vol. I</span>, p. 299) says that Lorosa
was taken prisoner. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 305) merely mentions the
fact that he had left with the Spaniards. He remained with the
&ldquo;Trinidad,&rdquo; and was promptly executed by the Portuguese
when he fell into their hands (see Guillemard&rsquo;s <i>Magellan</i>,
p. 303).</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r480" id="n480" name="n480">480</a></sup> MS. 5,650
adds: &ldquo;hearing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r481" id="n481" name="n481">481</a></sup> In Eden:
&ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">&#383;ixe hundreth and
fiftie.</span>&rdquo; The native name of Gilolo is Bato-tsima (also
called Almahera), and the island belongs to the Netherlands, being
included in the residency of Ternate. The population, estimated at
120,000, consists of Malays and Alfuros (pagans; a word apparently
formed from the Arabic article <i>al</i> and <i>fora</i>,
&ldquo;without,&rdquo; and applied by the Portuguese to natives outside
of their authority) the latter probably representing the pre-Malayan
populations, and inhabiting the central portion of the island.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r482" id="n482" name="n482">482</a></sup> Eden (p.
227), translating from Oviedo, mentions canes &ldquo;<span lang=
"en-1500">as bygge as a mans legge in the knee and three &#383;pannes

bamboo.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r483" id="n483" name="n483">483</a></sup> MS. 5,650
reads: &ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">for ten aunes of cloth [dyed with]
munjeet.</span>&rdquo; Guzerati or Guzerat (Gujerat, Gugerat, Goojerat,
Gujrat) one of the old provinces of India, of which the Kattywar
peninsula forms the western part, was a dependency of the Affgh&acirc;n
or Gh&ocirc;ri empire of Hindostan until the end of the fourteenth
century. It became an independent kingdom in 1408. See Badger&rsquo;s
introduction to Varthema&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i> (Hakluyt Society
edition), p. lviii. Foster&rsquo;s <i>Embassy of Sir Thomas Roe</i>
(Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1899), says of Guzerat (pp. 539,
540): &ldquo;<span lang="en-1500">Guzratt. A goodly Kingdom enclosing
the bay of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=

[Ahmad&aacute;b&aacute;d]. It Conteynes the Citty and Gouerment of
Cambaya, the bewty of India, the Territorie and Citty of Surat, and
Barooch [Broach]. It is watered with many goodly Riuers, as that of
Cambaya [the M&aacute;hi], falsely supposed to be Indus, the Riuer of
Narbadah, falling into the Sea at Barooch, that of Suratt, and diuers
others. It trades to the Red Sea, to Achyn, and many
places.</span>&rdquo; Its ports were important centers of trade.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r484" id="n484" name="n484">484</a></sup> This item

the prices of various oriental products in Barbosa&rsquo;s <i>East

221&ndash;223.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#r486" id="n486" name="n486">486</a></sup> Probably it
was because of this belief that the ships intended to take in water
near Celebes, &ldquo;because they feared that in Maluco they would not
be allowed to take it in&rdquo; (see the &ldquo;Roteiro,&rdquo;
Stanley, p. 22).</p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
