This meaning is not without interest to you, Gentle Reader;\r\nfor the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color\r\nline. I pray you, then, receive my little book in all charity, studying\r\nmy words with me, forgiving mistake and foible for sake of the faith\r\nand passion that is in me, and seeking the grain of truth hidden there.\r\n\r\nI have sought here to sketch, in vague, uncertain outline, the\r\nspiritual world in which ten thousand thousand Americans live and\r\nstrive. First, in two chapters I have tried to show what Emancipation\r\nmeant to them, and what was its aftermath. In a third chapter I have\r\npointed out the slow rise of personal leadership, and criticized\r\ncandidly the leader who bears the chief burden of his race to-day.\r\nThen, in two other chapters I have sketched in swift outline the two\r\nworlds within and without the Veil, and thus have come to the central\r\nproblem of training men for life. Venturing now into deeper detail, I\r\nhave in two chapters studied the struggles of the massed millions of\r\nthe black peasantry, and in another have sought to make clear the\r\npresent relations of the sons of master and man. Leaving, then, the\r\nwhite world, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may\r\nview faintly its deeper recesses,\xe2\x80\x94the meaning of its religion, the\r\npassion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls. All\r\nthis I have ended with a tale twice told but seldom written, and a\r\nchapter of song.\r\n\r\nSome of these thoughts of mine have seen the light before in other\r\nguise. For kindly consenting to their republication here, in altered\r\nand extended form, I must thank the publishers of the Atlantic Monthly,\r\nThe World\xe2\x80\x99s Work, the Dial, The New World, and the Annals of the\r\nAmerican Academy of Political and Social Science. Before each chapter,\r\nas now printed, stands a bar of the Sorrow Songs,\xe2\x80\x94some echo of haunting\r\nmelody from the only American music which welled up from black souls in\r\nthe dark past. And, finally, need I add that I who speak here am bone\r\nof the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?\r\n\r\nW.E.B Du B.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlanta, Ga., Feb. 1, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nOf Our Spiritual Strivings\r\n\r\nO water, voice of my heart, crying in the sand,\r\n    All night long crying with a mournful cry,\r\nAs I lie and listen, and cannot understand\r\n        The voice of my heart in my side or the voice of the sea,\r\n    O water, crying for rest, is it I, is it I?\r\n        All night long the water is crying to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnresting water, there shall never be rest\r\n    Till the last moon droop and the last tide fail,\r\nAnd the fire of the end begin to burn in the west;\r\n        And the heart shall be weary and wonder and cry like the sea,\r\n    All life long crying without avail,\r\n        As the water all night long is crying to me.\r\n\r\nARTHUR SYMONS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween me and the other world there is ever an unasked question:\r\nunasked by some through feelings of delicacy; by others through the\r\ndifficulty of rightly framing it. All, nevertheless, flutter round it.\r\nThey approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way, eye me curiously or\r\ncompassionately, and then, instead of saying directly, How does it feel\r\nto be a problem? they say, I know an excellent colored man in my town;\r\nor, I fought at Mechanicsville; or, Do not these Southern outrages make\r\nyour blood boil? At these I smile, or am interested, or reduce the\r\nboiling to a simmer, as the occasion may require. To the real question,\r\nHow does it feel to be a problem? I answer seldom a word.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, being a problem is a strange experience,\xe2\x80\x94peculiar even for one\r\nwho has never been anything else, save perhaps in babyhood and in\r\nEurope. It is in the early days of rollicking boyhood that the\r\nrevelation first bursts upon one, all in a day, as it were. I remember\r\nwell when the shadow swept across me. I was a little thing, away up in\r\nthe hills of New England, where the dark Housatonic winds between\r\nHoosac and Taghkanic to the sea. In a wee wooden schoolhouse, something\r\nput it into the boys\xe2\x80\x99 and girls\xe2\x80\x99 heads to buy gorgeous\r\nvisiting-cards\xe2\x80\x94ten cents a package\xe2\x80\x94and exchange. The exchange was\r\nmerry, till one girl, a tall newcomer, refused my card,\xe2\x80\x94refused it\r\nperemptorily, with a glance. Then it dawned upon me with a certain\r\nsuddenness that I was different from the others; or like, mayhap, in\r\nheart and life and longing, but shut out from their world by a vast\r\nveil. I had thereafter no desire to tear down that veil, to creep\r\nthrough; I held all beyond it in common contempt, and lived above it in\r\na region of blue sky and great wandering shadows. That sky was bluest\r\nwhen I could beat my mates at examination-time, or beat them at a\r\nfoot-race, or even beat their stringy heads. Alas, with the years all\r\nthis fine contempt began to fade; for the words I longed for, and all\r\ntheir dazzling opportunities, were theirs, not mine. But they should\r\nnot keep these prizes, I said; some, all, I would wrest from them. Just\r\nhow I would do it I could never decide: by reading law, by healing the\r\nsick, by telling the wonderful tales that swam in my head,\xe2\x80\x94some way.\r\nWith other black boys the strife was not so fiercely sunny: their youth\r\nshrunk into tasteless sycophancy, or into silent hatred of the pale\r\nworld about them and mocking distrust of everything white; or wasted\r\nitself in a bitter cry, Why did God make me an outcast and a stranger\r\nin mine own house? The shades of the prison-house closed round about us\r\nall: walls strait and stubborn to the whitest, but relentlessly narrow,\r\ntall, and unscalable to sons of night who must plod darkly on in\r\nresignation, or beat unavailing palms against the stone, or steadily,\r\nhalf hopelessly, watch the streak of blue above.\r\n\r\nAfter the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and\r\nMongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and\r\ngifted with second-sight in this American world,\xe2\x80\x94a world which yields\r\nhim no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through\r\nthe revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this\r\ndouble-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\xe2\x80\x99s self\r\nthrough the eyes of others, of measuring one\xe2\x80\x99s soul by the tape of a\r\nworld that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his\r\ntwoness,\xe2\x80\x94an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two\r\nunreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose\r\ndogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\r\n\r\nThe history of the American Negro is the history of this strife,\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nlonging to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into\r\na better and truer self. In this merging he wishes neither of the older\r\nselves to be lost. He would not Africanize America, for America has too\r\nmuch to teach the world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul\r\nin a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a\r\nmessage for the world. He simply wishes to make it possible for a man\r\nto be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon\r\nby his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the end of his striving: to be a co-worker in the\r\nkingdom of culture, to escape both death and isolation, to husband and\r\nuse his best powers and his latent genius. These powers of body and\r\nmind have in the past been strangely wasted, dispersed, or forgotten.\r\nThe shadow of a mighty Negro past flits through the tale of Ethiopia\r\nthe Shadowy and of Egypt the Sphinx. Through history, the powers of\r\nsingle black men flash here and there like falling stars, and die\r\nsometimes before the world has rightly gauged their brightness. Here in\r\nAmerica, in the few days since Emancipation, the black man\xe2\x80\x99s turning\r\nhither and thither in hesitant and doubtful striving has often made his\r\nvery strength to lose effectiveness, to seem like absence of power,\r\nlike weakness. And yet it is not weakness,\xe2\x80\x94it is the contradiction of\r\ndouble aims. The double-aimed struggle of the black artisan\xe2\x80\x94on the one\r\nhand to escape white contempt for a nation of mere hewers of wood and\r\ndrawers of water, and on the other hand to plough and nail and dig for\r\na poverty-stricken horde\xe2\x80\x94could only result in making him a poor\r\ncraftsman, for he had but half a heart in either cause. By the poverty\r\nand ignorance of his people, the Negro minister or doctor was tempted\r\ntoward quackery and demagogy; and by the criticism of the other world,\r\ntoward ideals that made him ashamed of his lowly tasks. The would-be\r\nblack savant was confronted by the paradox that the knowledge his\r\npeople needed was a twice-told tale to his white neighbors, while the\r\nknowledge which would teach the white world was Greek to his own flesh\r\nand blood. The innate love of harmony and beauty that set the ruder\r\nsouls of his people a-dancing and a-singing raised but confusion and\r\ndoubt in the soul of the black artist; for the beauty revealed to him\r\nwas the soul-beauty of a race which his larger audience despised, and\r\nhe could not articulate the message of another people. This waste of\r\ndouble aims, this seeking to satisfy two unreconciled ideals, has\r\nwrought sad havoc with the courage and faith and deeds of ten thousand\r\nthousand people,\xe2\x80\x94has sent them often wooing false gods and invoking\r\nfalse means of salvation, and at times has even seemed about to make\r\nthem ashamed of themselves.\r\n\r\nAway back in the days of bondage they thought to see in one divine\r\nevent the end of all doubt and disappointment; few men ever worshipped\r\nFreedom with half such unquestioning faith as did the American Negro\r\nfor two centuries. To him, so far as he thought and dreamed, slavery\r\nwas indeed the sum of all villainies, the cause of all sorrow, the root\r\nof all prejudice; Emancipation was the key to a promised land of\r\nsweeter beauty than ever stretched before the eyes of wearied\r\nIsraelites. In song and exhortation swelled one refrain\xe2\x80\x94Liberty; in his\r\ntears and curses the God he implored had Freedom in his right hand. At\r\nlast it came,\xe2\x80\x94suddenly, fearfully, like a dream. With one wild carnival\r\nof blood and passion came the message in his own plaintive cadences:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShout, O children!\r\nShout, you\xe2\x80\x99re free!\r\nFor God has bought your liberty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nYears have passed away since then,\xe2\x80\x94ten, twenty, forty; forty years of\r\nnational life, forty years of renewal and development, and yet the\r\nswarthy spectre sits in its accustomed seat at the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s feast. In\r\nvain do we cry to this our vastest social problem:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake any shape but that, and my firm nerves\r\nShall never tremble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nation has not yet found peace from its sins; the freedman has not\r\nyet found in freedom his promised land. Whatever of good may have come\r\nin these years of change, the shadow of a deep disappointment rests\r\nupon the Negro people,\xe2\x80\x94a disappointment all the more bitter because the\r\nunattained ideal was unbounded save by the simple ignorance of a lowly\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe first decade was merely a prolongation of the vain search for\r\nfreedom, the boon that seemed ever barely to elude their grasp,\xe2\x80\x94like a\r\ntantalizing will-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-wisp, maddening and misleading the headless\r\nhost. The holocaust of war, the terrors of the Ku-Klux Klan, the lies\r\nof carpet-baggers, the disorganization of industry, and the\r\ncontradictory advice of friends and foes, left the bewildered serf with\r\nno new watchword beyond the old cry for freedom. As the time flew,\r\nhowever, he began to grasp a new idea. The ideal of liberty demanded\r\nfor its attainment powerful means, and these the Fifteenth Amendment\r\ngave him. The ballot, which before he had looked upon as a visible sign\r\nof freedom, he now regarded as the chief means of gaining and\r\nperfecting the liberty with which war had partially endowed him. And\r\nwhy not? Had not votes made war and emancipated millions? Had not votes\r\nenfranchised the freedmen? Was anything impossible to a power that had\r\ndone all this? A million black men started with renewed zeal to vote\r\nthemselves into the kingdom. So the decade flew away, the revolution of\r\n1876 came, and left the half-free serf weary, wondering, but still\r\ninspired. Slowly but steadily, in the following years, a new vision\r\nbegan gradually to replace the dream of political power,\xe2\x80\x94a powerful\r\nmovement, the rise of another ideal to guide the unguided, another\r\npillar of fire by night after a clouded day. It was the ideal of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbook-learning\xe2\x80\x9d; the curiosity, born of compulsory ignorance, to know\r\nand test the power of the cabalistic letters of the white man, the\r\nlonging to know. Here at last seemed to have been discovered the\r\nmountain path to Canaan; longer than the highway of Emancipation and\r\nlaw, steep and rugged, but straight, leading to heights high enough to\r\noverlook life.\r\n\r\nUp the new path the advance guard toiled, slowly, heavily, doggedly;\r\nonly those who have watched and guided the faltering feet, the misty\r\nminds, the dull understandings, of the dark pupils of these schools\r\nknow how faithfully, how piteously, this people strove to learn. It was\r\nweary work. The cold statistician wrote down the inches of progress\r\nhere and there, noted also where here and there a foot had slipped or\r\nsome one had fallen. To the tired climbers, the horizon was ever dark,\r\nthe mists were often cold, the Canaan was always dim and far away. If,\r\nhowever, the vistas disclosed as yet no goal, no resting-place, little\r\nbut flattery and criticism, the journey at least gave leisure for\r\nreflection and self-examination; it changed the child of Emancipation\r\nto the youth with dawning self-consciousness, self-realization,\r\nself-respect. In those sombre forests of his striving his own soul rose\r\nbefore him, and he saw himself,\xe2\x80\x94darkly as through a veil; and yet he\r\nsaw in himself some faint revelation of his power, of his mission. He\r\nbegan to have a dim feeling that, to attain his place in the world, he\r\nmust be himself, and not another. For the first time he sought to\r\nanalyze the burden he bore upon his back, that dead-weight of social\r\ndegradation partially masked behind a half-named Negro problem. He felt\r\nhis poverty; without a cent, without a home, without land, tools, or\r\nsavings, he had entered into competition with rich, landed, skilled\r\nneighbors. To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of\r\ndollars is the very bottom of hardships. He felt the weight of his\r\nignorance,\xe2\x80\x94not simply of letters, but of life, of business, of the\r\nhumanities; the accumulated sloth and shirking and awkwardness of\r\ndecades and centuries shackled his hands and feet. Nor was his burden\r\nall poverty and ignorance. The red stain of bastardy, which two\r\ncenturies of systematic legal defilement of Negro women had stamped\r\nupon his race, meant not only the loss of ancient African chastity, but\r\nalso the hereditary weight of a mass of corruption from white\r\nadulterers, threatening almost the obliteration of the Negro home.\r\n\r\nA people thus handicapped ought not to be asked to race with the world,\r\nbut rather allowed to give all its time and thought to its own social\r\nproblems. But alas! while sociologists gleefully count his bastards and\r\nhis prostitutes, the very soul of the toiling, sweating black man is\r\ndarkened by the shadow of a vast despair. Men call the shadow\r\nprejudice, and learnedly explain it as the natural defence of culture\r\nagainst barbarism, learning against ignorance, purity against crime,\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9chigher\xe2\x80\x9d against the \xe2\x80\x9clower\xe2\x80\x9d races. To which the Negro cries Amen!\r\nand swears that to so much of this strange prejudice as is founded on\r\njust homage to civilization, culture, righteousness, and progress, he\r\nhumbly bows and meekly does obeisance. But before that nameless\r\nprejudice that leaps beyond all this he stands helpless, dismayed, and\r\nwell-nigh speechless; before that personal disrespect and mockery, the\r\nridicule and systematic humiliation, the distortion of fact and wanton\r\nlicense of fancy, the cynical ignoring of the better and the boisterous\r\nwelcoming of the worse, the all-pervading desire to inculcate disdain\r\nfor everything black, from Toussaint to the devil,\xe2\x80\x94before this there\r\nrises a sickening despair that would disarm and discourage any nation\r\nsave that black host to whom \xe2\x80\x9cdiscouragement\xe2\x80\x9d is an unwritten word.\r\n\r\nBut the facing of so vast a prejudice could not but bring the\r\ninevitable self-questioning, self-disparagement, and lowering of ideals\r\nwhich ever accompany repression and breed in an atmosphere of contempt\r\nand hate. Whisperings and portents came home upon the four winds: Lo!\r\nwe are diseased and dying, cried the dark hosts; we cannot write, our\r\nvoting is vain; what need of education, since we must always cook and\r\nserve? And the Nation echoed and enforced this self-criticism, saying:\r\nBe content to be servants, and nothing more; what need of higher\r\nculture for half-men? Away with the black man\xe2\x80\x99s ballot, by force or\r\nfraud,\xe2\x80\x94and behold the suicide of a race! Nevertheless, out of the evil\r\ncame something of good,\xe2\x80\x94the more careful adjustment of education to\r\nreal life, the clearer perception of the Negroes\xe2\x80\x99 social\r\nresponsibilities, and the sobering realization of the meaning of\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nSo dawned the time of _Sturm und Drang:_ storm and stress to-day rocks\r\nour little boat on the mad waters of the world-sea; there is within and\r\nwithout the sound of conflict, the burning of body and rending of soul;\r\ninspiration strives with doubt, and faith with vain questionings. The\r\nbright ideals of the past,\xe2\x80\x94physical freedom, political power, the\r\ntraining of brains and the training of hands,\xe2\x80\x94all these in turn have\r\nwaxed and waned, until even the last grows dim and overcast. Are they\r\nall wrong,\xe2\x80\x94all false? No, not that, but each alone was over-simple and\r\nincomplete,\xe2\x80\x94the dreams of a credulous race-childhood, or the fond\r\nimaginings of the other world which does not know and does not want to\r\nknow our power. To be really true, all these ideals must be melted and\r\nwelded into one. The training of the schools we need to-day more than\r\never,\xe2\x80\x94the training of deft hands, quick eyes and ears, and above all\r\nthe broader, deeper, higher culture of gifted minds and pure hearts.\r\nThe power of the ballot we need in sheer self-defence,\xe2\x80\x94else what shall\r\nsave us from a second slavery? Freedom, too, the long-sought, we still\r\nseek,\xe2\x80\x94the freedom of life and limb, the freedom to work and think, the\r\nfreedom to love and aspire. Work, culture, liberty,\xe2\x80\x94all these we need,\r\nnot singly but together, not successively but together, each growing\r\nand aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims\r\nbefore the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained through\r\nthe unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and developing the\r\ntraits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or contempt for\r\nother races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of\r\nthe American Republic, in order that some day on American soil two\r\nworld-races may give each to each those characteristics both so sadly\r\nlack. We the darker ones come even now not altogether empty-handed:\r\nthere are to-day no truer exponents of the pure human spirit of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence than the American Negroes; there is no true\r\nAmerican music but the wild sweet melodies of the Negro slave; the\r\nAmerican fairy tales and folklore are Indian and African; and, all in\r\nall, we black men seem the sole oasis of simple faith and reverence in\r\na dusty desert of dollars and smartness. Will America be poorer if she\r\nreplace her brutal dyspeptic blundering with light-hearted but\r\ndetermined Negro humility? or her coarse and cruel wit with loving\r\njovial good-humor? or her vulgar music with the soul of the Sorrow\r\nSongs?\r\n\r\nMerely a concrete test of the underlying principles of the great\r\nrepublic is the Negro Problem, and the spiritual striving of the\r\nfreedmen\xe2\x80\x99s sons is the travail of souls whose burden is almost beyond\r\nthe measure of their strength, but who bear it in the name of an\r\nhistoric race, in the name of this the land of their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 fathers,\r\nand in the name of human opportunity.\r\n\r\nAnd now what I have briefly sketched in large outline let me on coming\r\npages tell again in many ways, with loving emphasis and deeper detail,\r\nthat men may listen to the striving in the souls of black folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nOf the Dawn of Freedom\r\n\r\nCareless seems the great Avenger;\r\n    History\xe2\x80\x99s lessons but record\r\nOne death-grapple in the darkness\r\n    \xe2\x80\x99Twixt old systems and the Word;\r\nTruth forever on the scaffold,\r\n    Wrong forever on the throne;\r\nYet that scaffold sways the future,\r\n    And behind the dim unknown\r\nStandeth God within the shadow\r\n    Keeping watch above His own.\r\n\r\nLOWELL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the\r\ncolor-line,\xe2\x80\x94the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in\r\nAsia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea. It was a phase\r\nof this problem that caused the Civil War; and however much they who\r\nmarched South and North in 1861 may have fixed on the technical points,\r\nof union and local autonomy as a shibboleth, all nevertheless knew, as\r\nwe know, that the question of Negro slavery was the real cause of the\r\nconflict. Curious it was, too, how this deeper question ever forced\r\nitself to the surface despite effort and disclaimer. No sooner had\r\nNorthern armies touched Southern soil than this old question, newly\r\nguised, sprang from the earth,\xe2\x80\x94What shall be done with Negroes?\r\nPeremptory military commands this way and that, could not answer the\r\nquery; the Emancipation Proclamation seemed but to broaden and\r\nintensify the difficulties; and the War Amendments made the Negro\r\nproblems of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is the aim of this essay to study the period of history from 1861 to\r\n1872 so far as it relates to the American Negro. In effect, this tale\r\nof the dawn of Freedom is an account of that government of men called\r\nthe Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau,\xe2\x80\x94one of the most singular and interesting of the\r\nattempts made by a great nation to grapple with vast problems of race\r\nand social condition.\r\n\r\nThe war has naught to do with slaves, cried Congress, the President,\r\nand the Nation; and yet no sooner had the armies, East and West,\r\npenetrated Virginia and Tennessee than fugitive slaves appeared within\r\ntheir lines. They came at night, when the flickering camp-fires shone\r\nlike vast unsteady stars along the black horizon: old men and thin,\r\nwith gray and tufted hair; women with frightened eyes, dragging\r\nwhimpering hungry children; men and girls, stalwart and gaunt,\xe2\x80\x94a horde\r\nof starving vagabonds, homeless, helpless, and pitiable, in their dark\r\ndistress. Two methods of treating these newcomers seemed equally\r\nlogical to opposite sorts of minds. Ben Butler, in Virginia, quickly\r\ndeclared slave property contraband of war, and put the fugitives to\r\nwork; while Fremont, in Missouri, declared the slaves free under\r\nmartial law. Butler\xe2\x80\x99s action was approved, but Fremont\xe2\x80\x99s was hastily\r\ncountermanded, and his successor, Halleck, saw things differently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHereafter,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded, \xe2\x80\x9cno slaves should be allowed to come into\r\nyour lines at all; if any come without your knowledge, when owners call\r\nfor them deliver them.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a policy was difficult to enforce; some of\r\nthe black refugees declared themselves freemen, others showed that\r\ntheir masters had deserted them, and still others were captured with\r\nforts and plantations. Evidently, too, slaves were a source of strength\r\nto the Confederacy, and were being used as laborers and producers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey constitute a military resource,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Secretary Cameron, late in\r\n1861; \xe2\x80\x9cand being such, that they should not be turned over to the enemy\r\nis too plain to discuss.\xe2\x80\x9d So gradually the tone of the army chiefs\r\nchanged; Congress forbade the rendition of fugitives, and Butler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccontrabands\xe2\x80\x9d were welcomed as military laborers. This complicated\r\nrather than solved the problem, for now the scattering fugitives became\r\na steady stream, which flowed faster as the armies marched.\r\n\r\nThen the long-headed man with care-chiselled face who sat in the White\r\nHouse saw the inevitable, and emancipated the slaves of rebels on New\r\nYear\xe2\x80\x99s, 1863. A month later Congress called earnestly for the Negro\r\nsoldiers whom the act of July, 1862, had half grudgingly allowed to\r\nenlist. Thus the barriers were levelled and the deed was done. The\r\nstream of fugitives swelled to a flood, and anxious army officers kept\r\ninquiring: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must be done with slaves, arriving almost daily? Are\r\nwe to find food and shelter for women and children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a Pierce of Boston who pointed out the way, and thus became in a\r\nsense the founder of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau. He was a firm friend of\r\nSecretary Chase; and when, in 1861, the care of slaves and abandoned\r\nlands devolved upon the Treasury officials, Pierce was specially\r\ndetailed from the ranks to study the conditions. First, he cared for\r\nthe refugees at Fortress Monroe; and then, after Sherman had captured\r\nHilton Head, Pierce was sent there to found his Port Royal experiment\r\nof making free workingmen out of slaves. Before his experiment was\r\nbarely started, however, the problem of the fugitives had assumed such\r\nproportions that it was taken from the hands of the over-burdened\r\nTreasury Department and given to the army officials. Already centres of\r\nmassed freedmen were forming at Fortress Monroe, Washington, New\r\nOrleans, Vicksburg and Corinth, Columbus, Ky., and Cairo, Ill., as well\r\nas at Port Royal. Army chaplains found here new and fruitful fields;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csuperintendents of contrabands\xe2\x80\x9d multiplied, and some attempt at\r\nsystematic work was made by enlisting the able-bodied men and giving\r\nwork to the others.\r\n\r\nThen came the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Aid societies, born of the touching appeals\r\nfrom Pierce and from these other centres of distress. There was the\r\nAmerican Missionary Association, sprung from the Amistad, and now\r\nfull-grown for work; the various church organizations, the National\r\nFreedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Relief Association, the American Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Union, the\r\nWestern Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Aid Commission,\xe2\x80\x94in all fifty or more active\r\norganizations, which sent clothes, money, school-books, and teachers\r\nsouthward. All they did was needed, for the destitution of the freedmen\r\nwas often reported as \xe2\x80\x9ctoo appalling for belief,\xe2\x80\x9d and the situation was\r\ndaily growing worse rather than better.\r\n\r\nAnd daily, too, it seemed more plain that this was no ordinary matter\r\nof temporary relief, but a national crisis; for here loomed a labor\r\nproblem of vast dimensions. Masses of Negroes stood idle, or, if they\r\nworked spasmodically, were never sure of pay; and if perchance they\r\nreceived pay, squandered the new thing thoughtlessly. In these and\r\nother ways were camp-life and the new liberty demoralizing the\r\nfreedmen. The broader economic organization thus clearly demanded\r\nsprang up here and there as accident and local conditions determined.\r\nHere it was that Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s Port Royal plan of leased plantations and\r\nguided workmen pointed out the rough way. In Washington the military\r\ngovernor, at the urgent appeal of the superintendent, opened\r\nconfiscated estates to the cultivation of the fugitives, and there in\r\nthe shadow of the dome gathered black farm villages. General Dix gave\r\nover estates to the freedmen of Fortress Monroe, and so on, South and\r\nWest. The government and benevolent societies furnished the means of\r\ncultivation, and the Negro turned again slowly to work. The systems of\r\ncontrol, thus started, rapidly grew, here and there, into strange\r\nlittle governments, like that of General Banks in Louisiana, with its\r\nninety thousand black subjects, its fifty thousand guided laborers, and\r\nits annual budget of one hundred thousand dollars and more. It made out\r\nfour thousand pay-rolls a year, registered all freedmen, inquired into\r\ngrievances and redressed them, laid and collected taxes, and\r\nestablished a system of public schools. So, too, Colonel Eaton, the\r\nsuperintendent of Tennessee and Arkansas, ruled over one hundred\r\nthousand freedmen, leased and cultivated seven thousand acres of cotton\r\nland, and fed ten thousand paupers a year. In South Carolina was\r\nGeneral Saxton, with his deep interest in black folk. He succeeded\r\nPierce and the Treasury officials, and sold forfeited estates, leased\r\nabandoned plantations, encouraged schools, and received from Sherman,\r\nafter that terribly picturesque march to the sea, thousands of the\r\nwretched camp followers.\r\n\r\nThree characteristic things one might have seen in Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s raid\r\nthrough Georgia, which threw the new situation in shadowy relief: the\r\nConqueror, the Conquered, and the Negro. Some see all significance in\r\nthe grim front of the destroyer, and some in the bitter sufferers of\r\nthe Lost Cause. But to me neither soldier nor fugitive speaks with so\r\ndeep a meaning as that dark human cloud that clung like remorse on the\r\nrear of those swift columns, swelling at times to half their size,\r\nalmost engulfing and choking them. In vain were they ordered back, in\r\nvain were bridges hewn from beneath their feet; on they trudged and\r\nwrithed and surged, until they rolled into Savannah, a starved and\r\nnaked horde of tens of thousands. There too came the characteristic\r\nmilitary remedy: \xe2\x80\x9cThe islands from Charleston south, the abandoned\r\nrice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and\r\nthe country bordering the St. John\xe2\x80\x99s River, Florida, are reserved and\r\nset apart for the settlement of Negroes now made free by act of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo read the celebrated \xe2\x80\x9cField-order Number Fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these experiments, orders, and systems were bound to attract and\r\nperplex the government and the nation. Directly after the Emancipation\r\nProclamation, Representative Eliot had introduced a bill creating a\r\nBureau of Emancipation; but it was never reported. The following June a\r\ncommittee of inquiry, appointed by the Secretary of War, reported in\r\nfavor of a temporary bureau for the \xe2\x80\x9cimprovement, protection, and\r\nemployment of refugee freedmen,\xe2\x80\x9d on much the same lines as were\r\nafterwards followed. Petitions came in to President Lincoln from\r\ndistinguished citizens and organizations, strongly urging a\r\ncomprehensive and unified plan of dealing with the freedmen, under a\r\nbureau which should be \xe2\x80\x9ccharged with the study of plans and execution\r\nof measures for easily guiding, and in every way judiciously and\r\nhumanely aiding, the passage of our emancipated and yet to be\r\nemancipated blacks from the old condition of forced labor to their new\r\nstate of voluntary industry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome half-hearted steps were taken to accomplish this, in part, by\r\nputting the whole matter again in charge of the special Treasury\r\nagents. Laws of 1863 and 1864 directed them to take charge of and lease\r\nabandoned lands for periods not exceeding twelve months, and to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprovide in such leases, or otherwise, for the employment and general\r\nwelfare\xe2\x80\x9d of the freedmen. Most of the army officers greeted this as a\r\nwelcome relief from perplexing \xe2\x80\x9cNegro affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d and Secretary\r\nFessenden, July 29, 1864, issued an excellent system of regulations,\r\nwhich were afterward closely followed by General Howard. Under Treasury\r\nagents, large quantities of land were leased in the Mississippi Valley,\r\nand many Negroes were employed; but in August, 1864, the new\r\nregulations were suspended for reasons of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic policy,\xe2\x80\x9d and the army\r\nwas again in control.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Congress had turned its attention to the subject; and in\r\nMarch the House passed a bill by a majority of two establishing a\r\nBureau for Freedmen in the War Department. Charles Sumner, who had\r\ncharge of the bill in the Senate, argued that freedmen and abandoned\r\nlands ought to be under the same department, and reported a substitute\r\nfor the House bill attaching the Bureau to the Treasury Department.\r\nThis bill passed, but too late for action by the House. The debates\r\nwandered over the whole policy of the administration and the general\r\nquestion of slavery, without touching very closely the specific merits\r\nof the measure in hand. Then the national election took place; and the\r\nadministration, with a vote of renewed confidence from the country,\r\naddressed itself to the matter more seriously. A conference between the\r\ntwo branches of Congress agreed upon a carefully drawn measure which\r\ncontained the chief provisions of Sumner\xe2\x80\x99s bill, but made the proposed\r\norganization a department independent of both the War and the Treasury\r\nofficials. The bill was conservative, giving the new department\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgeneral superintendence of all freedmen.\xe2\x80\x9d Its purpose was to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cestablish regulations\xe2\x80\x9d for them, protect them, lease them lands,\r\nadjust their wages, and appear in civil and military courts as their\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnext friend.\xe2\x80\x9d There were many limitations attached to the powers thus\r\ngranted, and the organization was made permanent. Nevertheless, the\r\nSenate defeated the bill, and a new conference committee was appointed.\r\nThis committee reported a new bill, February 28, which was whirled\r\nthrough just as the session closed, and became the act of 1865\r\nestablishing in the War Department a \xe2\x80\x9cBureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and\r\nAbandoned Lands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last compromise was a hasty bit of legislation, vague and\r\nuncertain in outline. A Bureau was created, \xe2\x80\x9cto continue during the\r\npresent War of Rebellion, and for one year thereafter,\xe2\x80\x9d to which was\r\ngiven \xe2\x80\x9cthe supervision and management of all abandoned lands and the\r\ncontrol of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen,\xe2\x80\x9d under \xe2\x80\x9csuch\r\nrules and regulations as may be presented by the head of the Bureau and\r\napproved by the President.\xe2\x80\x9d A Commissioner, appointed by the President\r\nand Senate, was to control the Bureau, with an office force not\r\nexceeding ten clerks. The President might also appoint assistant\r\ncommissioners in the seceded States, and to all these offices military\r\nofficials might be detailed at regular pay. The Secretary of War could\r\nissue rations, clothing, and fuel to the destitute, and all abandoned\r\nproperty was placed in the hands of the Bureau for eventual lease and\r\nsale to ex-slaves in forty-acre parcels.\r\n\r\nThus did the United States government definitely assume charge of the\r\nemancipated Negro as the ward of the nation. It was a tremendous\r\nundertaking. Here at a stroke of the pen was erected a government of\r\nmillions of men,\xe2\x80\x94and not ordinary men either, but black men emasculated\r\nby a peculiarly complete system of slavery, centuries old; and now,\r\nsuddenly, violently, they come into a new birthright, at a time of war\r\nand passion, in the midst of the stricken and embittered population of\r\ntheir former masters. Any man might well have hesitated to assume\r\ncharge of such a work, with vast responsibilities, indefinite powers,\r\nand limited resources. Probably no one but a soldier would have\r\nanswered such a call promptly; and, indeed, no one but a soldier could\r\nbe called, for Congress had appropriated no money for salaries and\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nLess than a month after the weary Emancipator passed to his rest, his\r\nsuccessor assigned Major-Gen. Oliver O. Howard to duty as Commissioner\r\nof the new Bureau. He was a Maine man, then only thirty-five years of\r\nage. He had marched with Sherman to the sea, had fought well at\r\nGettysburg, and but the year before had been assigned to the command of\r\nthe Department of Tennessee. An honest man, with too much faith in\r\nhuman nature, little aptitude for business and intricate detail, he had\r\nhad large opportunity of becoming acquainted at first hand with much of\r\nthe work before him. And of that work it has been truly said that \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\napproximately correct history of civilization can ever be written which\r\ndoes not throw out in bold relief, as one of the great landmarks of\r\npolitical and social progress, the organization and administration of\r\nthe Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 1865, Howard was appointed; and he assumed the duties of his\r\noffice promptly on the 15th, and began examining the field of work. A\r\ncurious mess he looked upon: little despotisms, communistic\r\nexperiments, slavery, peonage, business speculations, organized\r\ncharity, unorganized almsgiving,\xe2\x80\x94all reeling on under the guise of\r\nhelping the freedmen, and all enshrined in the smoke and blood of the\r\nwar and the cursing and silence of angry men. On May 19 the new\r\ngovernment\xe2\x80\x94for a government it really was\xe2\x80\x94issued its constitution;\r\ncommissioners were to be appointed in each of the seceded states, who\r\nwere to take charge of \xe2\x80\x9call subjects relating to refugees and\r\nfreedmen,\xe2\x80\x9d and all relief and rations were to be given by their consent\r\nalone. The Bureau invited continued cooperation with benevolent\r\nsocieties, and declared: \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be the object of all commissioners to\r\nintroduce practicable systems of compensated labor,\xe2\x80\x9d and to establish\r\nschools. Forthwith nine assistant commissioners were appointed. They\r\nwere to hasten to their fields of work; seek gradually to close relief\r\nestablishments, and make the destitute self-supporting; act as courts\r\nof law where there were no courts, or where Negroes were not recognized\r\nin them as free; establish the institution of marriage among ex-slaves,\r\nand keep records; see that freedmen were free to choose their\r\nemployers, and help in making fair contracts for them; and finally, the\r\ncircular said: \xe2\x80\x9cSimple good faith, for which we hope on all hands for\r\nthose concerned in the passing away of slavery, will especially relieve\r\nthe assistant commissioners in the discharge of their duties toward the\r\nfreedmen, as well as promote the general welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the work thus started, and the general system and local\r\norganization in some measure begun, than two grave difficulties\r\nappeared which changed largely the theory and outcome of Bureau work.\r\nFirst, there were the abandoned lands of the South. It had long been\r\nthe more or less definitely expressed theory of the North that all the\r\nchief problems of Emancipation might be settled by establishing the\r\nslaves on the forfeited lands of their masters,\xe2\x80\x94a sort of poetic\r\njustice, said some. But this poetry done into solemn prose meant either\r\nwholesale confiscation of private property in the South, or vast\r\nappropriations. Now Congress had not appropriated a cent, and no sooner\r\ndid the proclamations of general amnesty appear than the eight hundred\r\nthousand acres of abandoned lands in the hands of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau\r\nmelted quickly away. The second difficulty lay in perfecting the local\r\norganization of the Bureau throughout the wide field of work. Making a\r\nnew machine and sending out officials of duly ascertained fitness for a\r\ngreat work of social reform is no child\xe2\x80\x99s task; but this task was even\r\nharder, for a new central organization had to be fitted on a\r\nheterogeneous and confused but already existing system of relief and\r\ncontrol of ex-slaves; and the agents available for this work must be\r\nsought for in an army still busy with war operations,\xe2\x80\x94men in the very\r\nnature of the case ill fitted for delicate social work,\xe2\x80\x94or among the\r\nquestionable camp followers of an invading host. Thus, after a year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, vigorously as it was pushed, the problem looked even more\r\ndifficult to grasp and solve than at the beginning. Nevertheless, three\r\nthings that year\xe2\x80\x99s work did, well worth the doing: it relieved a vast\r\namount of physical suffering; it transported seven thousand fugitives\r\nfrom congested centres back to the farm; and, best of all, it\r\ninaugurated the crusade of the New England schoolma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\n\r\nThe annals of this Ninth Crusade are yet to be written,\xe2\x80\x94the tale of a\r\nmission that seemed to our age far more quixotic than the quest of St.\r\nLouis seemed to his. Behind the mists of ruin and rapine waved the\r\ncalico dresses of women who dared, and after the hoarse mouthings of\r\nthe field guns rang the rhythm of the alphabet. Rich and poor they\r\nwere, serious and curious. Bereaved now of a father, now of a brother,\r\nnow of more than these, they came seeking a life work in planting New\r\nEngland schoolhouses among the white and black of the South. They did\r\ntheir work well. In that first year they taught one hundred thousand\r\nsouls, and more.\r\n\r\nEvidently, Congress must soon legislate again on the hastily organized\r\nBureau, which had so quickly grown into wide significance and vast\r\npossibilities. An institution such as that was well-nigh as difficult\r\nto end as to begin. Early in 1866 Congress took up the matter, when\r\nSenator Trumbull, of Illinois, introduced a bill to extend the Bureau\r\nand enlarge its powers. This measure received, at the hands of\r\nCongress, far more thorough discussion and attention than its\r\npredecessor. The war cloud had thinned enough to allow a clearer\r\nconception of the work of Emancipation. The champions of the bill\r\nargued that the strengthening of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau was still a\r\nmilitary necessity; that it was needed for the proper carrying out of\r\nthe Thirteenth Amendment, and was a work of sheer justice to the\r\nex-slave, at a trifling cost to the government. The opponents of the\r\nmeasure declared that the war was over, and the necessity for war\r\nmeasures past; that the Bureau, by reason of its extraordinary powers,\r\nwas clearly unconstitutional in time of peace, and was destined to\r\nirritate the South and pauperize the freedmen, at a final cost of\r\npossibly hundreds of millions. These two arguments were unanswered, and\r\nindeed unanswerable: the one that the extraordinary powers of the\r\nBureau threatened the civil rights of all citizens; and the other that\r\nthe government must have power to do what manifestly must be done, and\r\nthat present abandonment of the freedmen meant their practical\r\nreenslavement. The bill which finally passed enlarged and made\r\npermanent the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau. It was promptly vetoed by President\r\nJohnson as \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutional,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cextrajudicial,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nfailed of passage over the veto. Meantime, however, the breach between\r\nCongress and the President began to broaden, and a modified form of the\r\nlost bill was finally passed over the President\xe2\x80\x99s second veto, July 16.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1866 gave the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau its final form,\xe2\x80\x94the form by\r\nwhich it will be known to posterity and judged of men. It extended the\r\nexistence of the Bureau to July, 1868; it authorized additional\r\nassistant commissioners, the retention of army officers mustered out of\r\nregular service, the sale of certain forfeited lands to freedmen on\r\nnominal terms, the sale of Confederate public property for Negro\r\nschools, and a wider field of judicial interpretation and cognizance.\r\nThe government of the unreconstructed South was thus put very largely\r\nin the hands of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, especially as in many cases the\r\ndepartmental military commander was now made also assistant\r\ncommissioner. It was thus that the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau became a\r\nfull-fledged government of men. It made laws, executed them and\r\ninterpreted them; it laid and collected taxes, defined and punished\r\ncrime, maintained and used military force, and dictated such measures\r\nas it thought necessary and proper for the accomplishment of its varied\r\nends. Naturally, all these powers were not exercised continuously nor\r\nto their fullest extent; and yet, as General Howard has said, \xe2\x80\x9cscarcely\r\nany subject that has to be legislated upon in civil society failed, at\r\none time or another, to demand the action of this singular Bureau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo understand and criticise intelligently so vast a work, one must not\r\nforget an instant the drift of things in the later sixties. Lee had\r\nsurrendered, Lincoln was dead, and Johnson and Congress were at\r\nloggerheads; the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted, the Fourteenth\r\npending, and the Fifteenth declared in force in 1870. Guerrilla\r\nraiding, the ever-present flickering after-flame of war, was spending\r\nits forces against the Negroes, and all the Southern land was awakening\r\nas from some wild dream to poverty and social revolution. In a time of\r\nperfect calm, amid willing neighbors and streaming wealth, the social\r\nuplifting of four million slaves to an assured and self-sustaining\r\nplace in the body politic and economic would have been a herculean\r\ntask; but when to the inherent difficulties of so delicate and nice a\r\nsocial operation were added the spite and hate of conflict, the hell of\r\nwar; when suspicion and cruelty were rife, and gaunt Hunger wept beside\r\nBereavement,\xe2\x80\x94in such a case, the work of any instrument of social\r\nregeneration was in large part foredoomed to failure. The very name of\r\nthe Bureau stood for a thing in the South which for two centuries and\r\nbetter men had refused even to argue,\xe2\x80\x94that life amid free Negroes was\r\nsimply unthinkable, the maddest of experiments.\r\n\r\nThe agents that the Bureau could command varied all the way from\r\nunselfish philanthropists to narrow-minded busybodies and thieves; and\r\neven though it be true that the average was far better than the worst,\r\nit was the occasional fly that helped spoil the ointment.\r\n\r\nThen amid all crouched the freed slave, bewildered between friend and\r\nfoe. He had emerged from slavery,\xe2\x80\x94not the worst slavery in the world,\r\nnot a slavery that made all life unbearable, rather a slavery that had\r\nhere and there something of kindliness, fidelity, and happiness,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwithal slavery, which, so far as human aspiration and desert were\r\nconcerned, classed the black man and the ox together. And the Negro\r\nknew full well that, whatever their deeper convictions may have been,\r\nSouthern men had fought with desperate energy to perpetuate this\r\nslavery under which the black masses, with half-articulate thought, had\r\nwrithed and shivered. They welcomed freedom with a cry. They shrank\r\nfrom the master who still strove for their chains; they fled to the\r\nfriends that had freed them, even though those friends stood ready to\r\nuse them as a club for driving the recalcitrant South back into\r\nloyalty. So the cleft between the white and black South grew. Idle to\r\nsay it never should have been; it was as inevitable as its results were\r\npitiable. Curiously incongruous elements were left arrayed against each\r\nother,\xe2\x80\x94the North, the government, the carpet-bagger, and the slave,\r\nhere; and there, all the South that was white, whether gentleman or\r\nvagabond, honest man or rascal, lawless murderer or martyr to duty.\r\n\r\nThus it is doubly difficult to write of this period calmly, so intense\r\nwas the feeling, so mighty the human passions that swayed and blinded\r\nmen. Amid it all, two figures ever stand to typify that day to coming\r\nages,\xe2\x80\x94the one, a gray-haired gentleman, whose fathers had quit\r\nthemselves like men, whose sons lay in nameless graves; who bowed to\r\nthe evil of slavery because its abolition threatened untold ill to all;\r\nwho stood at last, in the evening of life, a blighted, ruined form,\r\nwith hate in his eyes;\xe2\x80\x94and the other, a form hovering dark and\r\nmother-like, her awful face black with the mists of centuries, had\r\naforetime quailed at that white master\xe2\x80\x99s command, had bent in love over\r\nthe cradles of his sons and daughters, and closed in death the sunken\r\neyes of his wife,\xe2\x80\x94aye, too, at his behest had laid herself low to his\r\nlust, and borne a tawny man-child to the world, only to see her dark\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s limbs scattered to the winds by midnight marauders riding after\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdamned Niggers.\xe2\x80\x9d These were the saddest sights of that woful day; and\r\nno man clasped the hands of these two passing figures of the\r\npresent-past; but, hating, they went to their long home, and, hating,\r\ntheir children\xe2\x80\x99s children live today.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the field of work for the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau; and since,\r\nwith some hesitation, it was continued by the act of 1868 until 1869,\r\nlet us look upon four years of its work as a whole. There were, in\r\n1868, nine hundred Bureau officials scattered from Washington to Texas,\r\nruling, directly and indirectly, many millions of men. The deeds of\r\nthese rulers fall mainly under seven heads: the relief of physical\r\nsuffering, the overseeing of the beginnings of free labor, the buying\r\nand selling of land, the establishment of schools, the paying of\r\nbounties, the administration of justice, and the financiering of all\r\nthese activities.\r\n\r\nUp to June, 1869, over half a million patients had been treated by\r\nBureau physicians and surgeons, and sixty hospitals and asylums had\r\nbeen in operation. In fifty months twenty-one million free rations were\r\ndistributed at a cost of over four million dollars. Next came the\r\ndifficult question of labor. First, thirty thousand black men were\r\ntransported from the refuges and relief stations back to the farms,\r\nback to the critical trial of a new way of working. Plain instructions\r\nwent out from Washington: the laborers must be free to choose their\r\nemployers, no fixed rate of wages was prescribed, and there was to be\r\nno peonage or forced labor. So far, so good; but where local agents\r\ndiffered _toto c\xc3\xa6lo_ in capacity and character, where the _personnel_\r\nwas continually changing, the outcome was necessarily varied. The\r\nlargest element of success lay in the fact that the majority of the\r\nfreedmen were willing, even eager, to work. So labor contracts were\r\nwritten,\xe2\x80\x94fifty thousand in a single State,\xe2\x80\x94laborers advised, wages\r\nguaranteed, and employers supplied. In truth, the organization became a\r\nvast labor bureau,\xe2\x80\x94not perfect, indeed, notably defective here and\r\nthere, but on the whole successful beyond the dreams of thoughtful men.\r\nThe two great obstacles which confronted the officials were the tyrant\r\nand the idler,\xe2\x80\x94the slaveholder who was determined to perpetuate slavery\r\nunder another name; and, the freedman who regarded freedom as perpetual\r\nrest,\xe2\x80\x94the Devil and the Deep Sea.\r\n\r\nIn the work of establishing the Negroes as peasant proprietors, the\r\nBureau was from the first handicapped and at last absolutely checked.\r\nSomething was done, and larger things were planned; abandoned lands\r\nwere leased so long as they remained in the hands of the Bureau, and a\r\ntotal revenue of nearly half a million dollars derived from black\r\ntenants. Some other lands to which the nation had gained title were\r\nsold on easy terms, and public lands were opened for settlement to the\r\nvery few freedmen who had tools and capital. But the vision of \xe2\x80\x9cforty\r\nacres and a mule\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the righteous and reasonable ambition to become a\r\nlandholder, which the nation had all but categorically promised the\r\nfreedmen\xe2\x80\x94was destined in most cases to bitter disappointment. And those\r\nmen of marvellous hindsight who are today seeking to preach the Negro\r\nback to the present peonage of the soil know well, or ought to know,\r\nthat the opportunity of binding the Negro peasant willingly to the soil\r\nwas lost on that day when the Commissioner of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau had\r\nto go to South Carolina and tell the weeping freedmen, after their\r\nyears of toil, that their land was not theirs, that there was a\r\nmistake\xe2\x80\x94somewhere. If by 1874 the Georgia Negro alone owned three\r\nhundred and fifty thousand acres of land, it was by grace of his thrift\r\nrather than by bounty of the government.\r\n\r\nThe greatest success of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau lay in the planting of\r\nthe free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary\r\neducation among all classes in the South. It not only called the\r\nschool-mistresses through the benevolent agencies and built them\r\nschoolhouses, but it helped discover and support such apostles of human\r\nculture as Edmund Ware, Samuel Armstrong, and Erastus Cravath. The\r\nopposition to Negro education in the South was at first bitter, and\r\nshowed itself in ashes, insult, and blood; for the South believed an\r\neducated Negro to be a dangerous Negro. And the South was not wholly\r\nwrong; for education among all kinds of men always has had, and always\r\nwill have, an element of danger and revolution, of dissatisfaction and\r\ndiscontent. Nevertheless, men strive to know. Perhaps some inkling of\r\nthis paradox, even in the unquiet days of the Bureau, helped the\r\nbayonets allay an opposition to human training which still to-day lies\r\nsmouldering in the South, but not flaming. Fisk, Atlanta, Howard, and\r\nHampton were founded in these days, and six million dollars were\r\nexpended for educational work, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\r\nof which the freedmen themselves gave of their poverty.\r\n\r\nSuch contributions, together with the buying of land and various other\r\nenterprises, showed that the ex-slave was handling some free capital\r\nalready. The chief initial source of this was labor in the army, and\r\nhis pay and bounty as a soldier. Payments to Negro soldiers were at\r\nfirst complicated by the ignorance of the recipients, and the fact that\r\nthe quotas of colored regiments from Northern States were largely\r\nfilled by recruits from the South, unknown to their fellow soldiers.\r\nConsequently, payments were accompanied by such frauds that Congress,\r\nby joint resolution in 1867, put the whole matter in the hands of the\r\nFreedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau. In two years six million dollars was thus\r\ndistributed to five thousand claimants, and in the end the sum exceeded\r\neight million dollars. Even in this system fraud was frequent; but\r\nstill the work put needed capital in the hands of practical paupers,\r\nand some, at least, was well spent.\r\n\r\nThe most perplexing and least successful part of the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s work lay\r\nin the exercise of its judicial functions. The regular Bureau court\r\nconsisted of one representative of the employer, one of the Negro, and\r\none of the Bureau. If the Bureau could have maintained a perfectly\r\njudicial attitude, this arrangement would have been ideal, and must in\r\ntime have gained confidence; but the nature of its other activities and\r\nthe character of its _personnel_ prejudiced the Bureau in favor of the\r\nblack litigants, and led without doubt to much injustice and annoyance.\r\nOn the other hand, to leave the Negro in the hands of Southern courts\r\nwas impossible. In a distracted land where slavery had hardly fallen,\r\nto keep the strong from wanton abuse of the weak, and the weak from\r\ngloating insolently over the half-shorn strength of the strong, was a\r\nthankless, hopeless task. The former masters of the land were\r\nperemptorily ordered about, seized, and imprisoned, and punished over\r\nand again, with scant courtesy from army officers. The former slaves\r\nwere intimidated, beaten, raped, and butchered by angry and revengeful\r\nmen. Bureau courts tended to become centres simply for punishing\r\nwhites, while the regular civil courts tended to become solely\r\ninstitutions for perpetuating the slavery of blacks. Almost every law\r\nand method ingenuity could devise was employed by the legislatures to\r\nreduce the Negroes to serfdom,\xe2\x80\x94to make them the slaves of the State, if\r\nnot of individual owners; while the Bureau officials too often were\r\nfound striving to put the \xe2\x80\x9cbottom rail on top,\xe2\x80\x9d and gave the freedmen a\r\npower and independence which they could not yet use. It is all well\r\nenough for us of another generation to wax wise with advice to those\r\nwho bore the burden in the heat of the day. It is full easy now to see\r\nthat the man who lost home, fortune, and family at a stroke, and saw\r\nhis land ruled by \xe2\x80\x9cmules and niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d was really benefited by the\r\npassing of slavery. It is not difficult now to say to the young\r\nfreedman, cheated and cuffed about who has seen his father\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nbeaten to a jelly and his own mother namelessly assaulted, that the\r\nmeek shall inherit the earth. Above all, nothing is more convenient\r\nthan to heap on the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau all the evils of that evil day,\r\nand damn it utterly for every mistake and blunder that was made.\r\n\r\nAll this is easy, but it is neither sensible nor just. Someone had\r\nblundered, but that was long before Oliver Howard was born; there was\r\ncriminal aggression and heedless neglect, but without some system of\r\ncontrol there would have been far more than there was. Had that control\r\nbeen from within, the Negro would have been re-enslaved, to all intents\r\nand purposes. Coming as the control did from without, perfect men and\r\nmethods would have bettered all things; and even with imperfect agents\r\nand questionable methods, the work accomplished was not undeserving of\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\nuch was the dawn of Freedom; such was the work of the\r\nFreedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, which, summed up in brief, may be epitomized thus:\r\nfor some fifteen million dollars, beside the sums spent before 1865,\r\nand the dole of benevolent societies, this Bureau set going a system of\r\nfree labor, established a beginning of peasant proprietorship, secured\r\nthe recognition of black freedmen before courts of law, and founded the\r\nfree common school in the South. On the other hand, it failed to begin\r\nthe establishment of good-will between ex-masters and freedmen, to\r\nguard its work wholly from paternalistic methods which discouraged\r\nself-reliance, and to carry out to any considerable extent its implied\r\npromises to furnish the freedmen with land. Its successes were the\r\nresult of hard work, supplemented by the aid of philanthropists and the\r\neager striving of black men. Its failures were the result of bad local\r\nagents, the inherent difficulties of the work, and national neglect.\r\n\r\nSuch an institution, from its wide powers, great responsibilities,\r\nlarge control of moneys, and generally conspicuous position, was\r\nnaturally open to repeated and bitter attack. It sustained a searching\r\nCongressional investigation at the instance of Fernando Wood in 1870.\r\nIts archives and few remaining functions were with blunt discourtesy\r\ntransferred from Howard\xe2\x80\x99s control, in his absence, to the supervision\r\nof Secretary of War Belknap in 1872, on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation.\r\nFinally, in consequence of grave intimations of wrong-doing made by the\r\nSecretary and his subordinates, General Howard was court-martialed in\r\n1874. In both of these trials the Commissioner of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau\r\nwas officially exonerated from any wilful misdoing, and his work\r\ncommended. Nevertheless, many unpleasant things were brought to\r\nlight,\xe2\x80\x94the methods of transacting the business of the Bureau were\r\nfaulty; several cases of defalcation were proved, and other frauds\r\nstrongly suspected; there were some business transactions which savored\r\nof dangerous speculation, if not dishonesty; and around it all lay the\r\nsmirch of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bank.\r\n\r\nMorally and practically, the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bank was part of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBureau, although it had no legal connection with it. With the prestige\r\nof the government back of it, and a directing board of unusual\r\nrespectability and national reputation, this banking institution had\r\nmade a remarkable start in the development of that thrift among black\r\nfolk which slavery had kept them from knowing. Then in one sad day came\r\nthe crash,\xe2\x80\x94all the hard-earned dollars of the freedmen disappeared; but\r\nthat was the least of the loss,\xe2\x80\x94all the faith in saving went too, and\r\nmuch of the faith in men; and that was a loss that a Nation which\r\nto-day sneers at Negro shiftlessness has never yet made good. Not even\r\nten additional years of slavery could have done so much to throttle the\r\nthrift of the freedmen as the mismanagement and bankruptcy of the\r\nseries of savings banks chartered by the Nation for their especial aid.\r\nWhere all the blame should rest, it is hard to say; whether the Bureau\r\nand the Bank died chiefly by reason of the blows of its selfish friends\r\nor the dark machinations of its foes, perhaps even time will never\r\nreveal, for here lies unwritten history.\r\n\r\nOf the foes without the Bureau, the bitterest were those who attacked\r\nnot so much its conduct or policy under the law as the necessity for\r\nany such institution at all. Such attacks came primarily from the\r\nBorder States and the South; and they were summed up by Senator Davis,\r\nof Kentucky, when he moved to entitle the act of 1866 a bill \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\npromote strife and conflict between the white and black races\xe2\x80\xa6 by a\r\ngrant of unconstitutional power.\xe2\x80\x9d The argument gathered tremendous\r\nstrength South and North; but its very strength was its weakness. For,\r\nargued the plain common-sense of the nation, if it is unconstitutional,\r\nunpractical, and futile for the nation to stand guardian over its\r\nhelpless wards, then there is left but one alternative,\xe2\x80\x94to make those\r\nwards their own guardians by arming them with the ballot. Moreover, the\r\npath of the practical politician pointed the same way; for, argued this\r\nopportunist, if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with white\r\nvotes, we certainly can with black votes. So justice and force joined\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe alternative thus offered the nation was not between full and\r\nrestricted Negro suffrage; else every sensible man, black and white,\r\nwould easily have chosen the latter. It was rather a choice between\r\nsuffrage and slavery, after endless blood and gold had flowed to sweep\r\nhuman bondage away. Not a single Southern legislature stood ready to\r\nadmit a Negro, under any conditions, to the polls; not a single\r\nSouthern legislature believed free Negro labor was possible without a\r\nsystem of restrictions that took all its freedom away; there was\r\nscarcely a white man in the South who did not honestly regard\r\nEmancipation as a crime, and its practical nullification as a duty. In\r\nsuch a situation, the granting of the ballot to the black man was a\r\nnecessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race,\r\nand the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of\r\nthe war. Thus Negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race\r\nfeud. And some felt gratitude toward the race thus sacrificed in its\r\nswaddling clothes on the altar of national integrity; and some felt and\r\nfeel only indifference and contempt.\r\n\r\nHad political exigencies been less pressing, the opposition to\r\ngovernment guardianship of Negroes less bitter, and the attachment to\r\nthe slave system less strong, the social seer can well imagine a far\r\nbetter policy,\xe2\x80\x94a permanent Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, with a national system of\r\nNegro schools; a carefully supervised employment and labor office; a\r\nsystem of impartial protection before the regular courts; and such\r\ninstitutions for social betterment as savings-banks, land and building\r\nassociations, and social settlements. All this vast expenditure of\r\nmoney and brains might have formed a great school of prospective\r\ncitizenship, and solved in a way we have not yet solved the most\r\nperplexing and persistent of the Negro problems.\r\n\r\nThat such an institution was unthinkable in 1870 was due in part to\r\ncertain acts of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau itself. It came to regard its\r\nwork as merely temporary, and Negro suffrage as a final answer to all\r\npresent perplexities. The political ambition of many of its agents and\r\n_prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s_ led it far afield into questionable activities, until the\r\nSouth, nursing its own deep prejudices, came easily to ignore all the\r\ngood deeds of the Bureau and hate its very name with perfect hatred. So\r\nthe Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau died, and its child was the Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe passing of a great human institution before its work is done, like\r\nthe untimely passing of a single soul, but leaves a legacy of striving\r\nfor other men. The legacy of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau is the heavy\r\nheritage of this generation. To-day, when new and vaster problems are\r\ndestined to strain every fibre of the national mind and soul, would it\r\nnot be well to count this legacy honestly and carefully? For this much\r\nall men know: despite compromise, war, and struggle, the Negro is not\r\nfree. In the backwoods of the Gulf States, for miles and miles, he may\r\nnot leave the plantation of his birth; in well-nigh the whole rural\r\nSouth the black farmers are peons, bound by law and custom to an\r\neconomic slavery, from which the only escape is death or the\r\npenitentiary. In the most cultured sections and cities of the South the\r\nNegroes are a segregated servile caste, with restricted rights and\r\nprivileges. Before the courts, both in law and custom, they stand on a\r\ndifferent and peculiar basis. Taxation without representation is the\r\nrule of their political life. And the result of all this is, and in\r\nnature must have been, lawlessness and crime. That is the large legacy\r\nof the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, the work it did not do because it could not.\r\n\r\nI have seen a land right merry with the sun, where children sing, and\r\nrolling hills lie like passioned women wanton with harvest. And there\r\nin the King\xe2\x80\x99s Highways sat and sits a figure veiled and bowed, by which\r\nthe traveller\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps hasten as they go. On the tainted air broods\r\nfear. Three centuries\xe2\x80\x99 thought has been the raising and unveiling of\r\nthat bowed human heart, and now behold a century new for the duty and\r\nthe deed. The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the\r\ncolor-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nOf Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others\r\n\r\nFrom birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned!\r\n******\r\nHereditary bondsmen! Know ye not\r\nWho would be free themselves must strike the blow?\r\n\r\nBYRON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nEasily the most striking thing in the history of the American Negro\r\nsince 1876 is the ascendancy of Mr. Booker T. Washington. It began at\r\nthe time when war memories and ideals were rapidly passing; a day of\r\nastonishing commercial development was dawning; a sense of doubt and\r\nhesitation overtook the freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s sons,\xe2\x80\x94then it was that his leading\r\nbegan. Mr. Washington came, with a simple definite programme, at the\r\npsychological moment when the nation was a little ashamed of having\r\nbestowed so much sentiment on Negroes, and was concentrating its\r\nenergies on Dollars. His programme of industrial education,\r\nconciliation of the South, and submission and silence as to civil and\r\npolitical rights, was not wholly original; the Free Negroes from 1830\r\nup to war-time had striven to build industrial schools, and the\r\nAmerican Missionary Association had from the first taught various\r\ntrades; and Price and others had sought a way of honorable alliance\r\nwith the best of the Southerners. But Mr. Washington first indissolubly\r\nlinked these things; he put enthusiasm, unlimited energy, and perfect\r\nfaith into his programme, and changed it from a by-path into a\r\nveritable Way of Life. And the tale of the methods by which he did this\r\nis a fascinating study of human life.\r\n\r\nIt startled the nation to hear a Negro advocating such a programme\r\nafter many decades of bitter complaint; it startled and won the\r\napplause of the South, it interested and won the admiration of the\r\nNorth; and after a confused murmur of protest, it silenced if it did\r\nnot convert the Negroes themselves.\r\n\r\nTo gain the sympathy and cooperation of the various elements comprising\r\nthe white South was Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s first task; and this, at the time\r\nTuskegee was founded, seemed, for a black man, well-nigh impossible.\r\nAnd yet ten years later it was done in the word spoken at Atlanta: \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nall things purely social we can be as separate as the five fingers, and\r\nyet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAtlanta Compromise\xe2\x80\x9d is by all odds the most notable thing in Mr.\r\nWashington\xe2\x80\x99s career. The South interpreted it in different ways: the\r\nradicals received it as a complete surrender of the demand for civil\r\nand political equality; the conservatives, as a generously conceived\r\nworking basis for mutual understanding. So both approved it, and to-day\r\nits author is certainly the most distinguished Southerner since\r\nJefferson Davis, and the one with the largest personal following.\r\n\r\nNext to this achievement comes Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s work in gaining place\r\nand consideration in the North. Others less shrewd and tactful had\r\nformerly essayed to sit on these two stools and had fallen between\r\nthem; but as Mr. Washington knew the heart of the South from birth and\r\ntraining, so by singular insight he intuitively grasped the spirit of\r\nthe age which was dominating the North. And so thoroughly did he learn\r\nthe speech and thought of triumphant commercialism, and the ideals of\r\nmaterial prosperity, that the picture of a lone black boy poring over a\r\nFrench grammar amid the weeds and dirt of a neglected home soon seemed\r\nto him the acme of absurdities. One wonders what Socrates and St.\r\nFrancis of Assisi would say to this.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this very singleness of vision and thorough oneness with his\r\nage is a mark of the successful man. It is as though Nature must needs\r\nmake men narrow in order to give them force. So Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s cult\r\nhas gained unquestioning followers, his work has wonderfully prospered,\r\nhis friends are legion, and his enemies are confounded. To-day he\r\nstands as the one recognized spokesman of his ten million fellows, and\r\none of the most notable figures in a nation of seventy millions. One\r\nhesitates, therefore, to criticise a life which, beginning with so\r\nlittle, has done so much. And yet the time is come when one may speak\r\nin all sincerity and utter courtesy of the mistakes and shortcomings of\r\nMr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s career, as well as of his triumphs, without being\r\nthought captious or envious, and without forgetting that it is easier\r\nto do ill than well in the world.\r\n\r\nThe criticism that has hitherto met Mr. Washington has not always been\r\nof this broad character. In the South especially has he had to walk\r\nwarily to avoid the harshest judgments,\xe2\x80\x94and naturally so, for he is\r\ndealing with the one subject of deepest sensitiveness to that section.\r\nTwice\xe2\x80\x94once when at the Chicago celebration of the Spanish-American War\r\nhe alluded to the color-prejudice that is \xe2\x80\x9ceating away the vitals of\r\nthe South,\xe2\x80\x9d and once when he dined with President Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x94has the\r\nresulting Southern criticism been violent enough to threaten seriously\r\nhis popularity. In the North the feeling has several times forced\r\nitself into words, that Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s counsels of submission\r\noverlooked certain elements of true manhood, and that his educational\r\nprogramme was unnecessarily narrow. Usually, however, such criticism\r\nhas not found open expression, although, too, the spiritual sons of the\r\nAbolitionists have not been prepared to acknowledge that the schools\r\nfounded before Tuskegee, by men of broad ideals and self-sacrificing\r\nspirit, were wholly failures or worthy of ridicule. While, then,\r\ncriticism has not failed to follow Mr. Washington, yet the prevailing\r\npublic opinion of the land has been but too willing to deliver the\r\nsolution of a wearisome problem into his hands, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cIf that is\r\nall you and your race ask, take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong his own people, however, Mr. Washington has encountered the\r\nstrongest and most lasting opposition, amounting at times to\r\nbitterness, and even today continuing strong and insistent even though\r\nlargely silenced in outward expression by the public opinion of the\r\nnation. Some of this opposition is, of course, mere envy; the\r\ndisappointment of displaced demagogues and the spite of narrow minds.\r\nBut aside from this, there is among educated and thoughtful colored men\r\nin all parts of the land a feeling of deep regret, sorrow, and\r\napprehension at the wide currency and ascendancy which some of Mr.\r\nWashington\xe2\x80\x99s theories have gained. These same men admire his sincerity\r\nof purpose, and are willing to forgive much to honest endeavor which is\r\ndoing something worth the doing. They cooperate with Mr. Washington as\r\nfar as they conscientiously can; and, indeed, it is no ordinary tribute\r\nto this man\xe2\x80\x99s tact and power that, steering as he must between so many\r\ndiverse interests and opinions, he so largely retains the respect of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBut the hushing of the criticism of honest opponents is a dangerous\r\nthing. It leads some of the best of the critics to unfortunate silence\r\nand paralysis of effort, and others to burst into speech so\r\npassionately and intemperately as to lose listeners. Honest and earnest\r\ncriticism from those whose interests are most nearly touched,\xe2\x80\x94criticism\r\nof writers by readers,\xe2\x80\x94this is the soul of democracy and the safeguard\r\nof modern society. If the best of the American Negroes receive by outer\r\npressure a leader whom they had not recognized before, manifestly there\r\nis here a certain palpable gain. Yet there is also irreparable loss,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nloss of that peculiarly valuable education which a group receives when\r\nby search and criticism it finds and commissions its own leaders. The\r\nway in which this is done is at once the most elementary and the nicest\r\nproblem of social growth. History is but the record of such\r\ngroup-leadership; and yet how infinitely changeful is its type and\r\ncharacter! And of all types and kinds, what can be more instructive\r\nthan the leadership of a group within a group?\xe2\x80\x94that curious double\r\nmovement where real progress may be negative and actual advance be\r\nrelative retrogression. All this is the social student\xe2\x80\x99s inspiration\r\nand despair.\r\n\r\nNow in the past the American Negro has had instructive experience in\r\nthe choosing of group leaders, founding thus a peculiar dynasty which\r\nin the light of present conditions is worth while studying. When sticks\r\nand stones and beasts form the sole environment of a people, their\r\nattitude is largely one of determined opposition to and conquest of\r\nnatural forces. But when to earth and brute is added an environment of\r\nmen and ideas, then the attitude of the imprisoned group may take three\r\nmain forms,\xe2\x80\x94a feeling of revolt and revenge; an attempt to adjust all\r\nthought and action to the will of the greater group; or, finally, a\r\ndetermined effort at self-realization and self-development despite\r\nenvironing opinion. The influence of all of these attitudes at various\r\ntimes can be traced in the history of the American Negro, and in the\r\nevolution of his successive leaders.\r\n\r\nBefore 1750, while the fire of African freedom still burned in the\r\nveins of the slaves, there was in all leadership or attempted\r\nleadership but the one motive of revolt and revenge,\xe2\x80\x94typified in the\r\nterrible Maroons, the Danish blacks, and Cato of Stono, and veiling all\r\nthe Americas in fear of insurrection. The liberalizing tendencies of\r\nthe latter half of the eighteenth century brought, along with kindlier\r\nrelations between black and white, thoughts of ultimate adjustment and\r\nassimilation. Such aspiration was especially voiced in the earnest\r\nsongs of Phyllis, in the martyrdom of Attucks, the fighting of Salem\r\nand Poor, the intellectual accomplishments of Banneker and Derham, and\r\nthe political demands of the Cuffes.\r\n\r\nStern financial and social stress after the war cooled much of the\r\nprevious humanitarian ardor. The disappointment and impatience of the\r\nNegroes at the persistence of slavery and serfdom voiced itself in two\r\nmovements. The slaves in the South, aroused undoubtedly by vague rumors\r\nof the Haytian revolt, made three fierce attempts at insurrection,\xe2\x80\x94in\r\n1800 under Gabriel in Virginia, in 1822 under Vesey in Carolina, and in\r\n1831 again in Virginia under the terrible Nat Turner. In the Free\r\nStates, on the other hand, a new and curious attempt at\r\nself-development was made. In Philadelphia and New York\r\ncolor-prescription led to a withdrawal of Negro communicants from white\r\nchurches and the formation of a peculiar socio-religious institution\r\namong the Negroes known as the African Church,\xe2\x80\x94an organization still\r\nliving and controlling in its various branches over a million of men.\r\n\r\nWalker\xe2\x80\x99s wild appeal against the trend of the times showed how the\r\nworld was changing after the coming of the cotton-gin. By 1830 slavery\r\nseemed hopelessly fastened on the South, and the slaves thoroughly\r\ncowed into submission. The free Negroes of the North, inspired by the\r\nmulatto immigrants from the West Indies, began to change the basis of\r\ntheir demands; they recognized the slavery of slaves, but insisted that\r\nthey themselves were freemen, and sought assimilation and amalgamation\r\nwith the nation on the same terms with other men. Thus, Forten and\r\nPurvis of Philadelphia, Shad of Wilmington, Du Bois of New Haven,\r\nBarbadoes of Boston, and others, strove singly and together as men,\r\nthey said, not as slaves; as \xe2\x80\x9cpeople of color,\xe2\x80\x9d not as \xe2\x80\x9cNegroes.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ntrend of the times, however, refused them recognition save in\r\nindividual and exceptional cases, considered them as one with all the\r\ndespised blacks, and they soon found themselves striving to keep even\r\nthe rights they formerly had of voting and working and moving as\r\nfreemen. Schemes of migration and colonization arose among them; but\r\nthese they refused to entertain, and they eventually turned to the\r\nAbolition movement as a final refuge.\r\n\r\nHere, led by Remond, Nell, Wells-Brown, and Douglass, a new period of\r\nself-assertion and self-development dawned. To be sure, ultimate\r\nfreedom and assimilation was the ideal before the leaders, but the\r\nassertion of the manhood rights of the Negro by himself was the main\r\nreliance, and John Brown\xe2\x80\x99s raid was the extreme of its logic. After the\r\nwar and emancipation, the great form of Frederick Douglass, the\r\ngreatest of American Negro leaders, still led the host. Self-assertion,\r\nespecially in political lines, was the main programme, and behind\r\nDouglass came Elliot, Bruce, and Langston, and the Reconstruction\r\npoliticians, and, less conspicuous but of greater social significance,\r\nAlexander Crummell and Bishop Daniel Payne.\r\n\r\nThen came the Revolution of 1876, the suppression of the Negro votes,\r\nthe changing and shifting of ideals, and the seeking of new lights in\r\nthe great night. Douglass, in his old age, still bravely stood for the\r\nideals of his early manhood,\xe2\x80\x94ultimate assimilation _through_\r\nself-assertion, and on no other terms. For a time Price arose as a new\r\nleader, destined, it seemed, not to give up, but to re-state the old\r\nideals in a form less repugnant to the white South. But he passed away\r\nin his prime. Then came the new leader. Nearly all the former ones had\r\nbecome leaders by the silent suffrage of their fellows, had sought to\r\nlead their own people alone, and were usually, save Douglass, little\r\nknown outside their race. But Booker T. Washington arose as essentially\r\nthe leader not of one race but of two,\xe2\x80\x94a compromiser between the South,\r\nthe North, and the Negro. Naturally the Negroes resented, at first\r\nbitterly, signs of compromise which surrendered their civil and\r\npolitical rights, even though this was to be exchanged for larger\r\nchances of economic development. The rich and dominating North,\r\nhowever, was not only weary of the race problem, but was investing\r\nlargely in Southern enterprises, and welcomed any method of peaceful\r\ncooperation. Thus, by national opinion, the Negroes began to recognize\r\nMr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s leadership; and the voice of criticism was hushed.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington represents in Negro thought the old attitude of\r\nadjustment and submission; but adjustment at such a peculiar time as to\r\nmake his programme unique. This is an age of unusual economic\r\ndevelopment, and Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s programme naturally takes an economic\r\ncast, becoming a gospel of Work and Money to such an extent as\r\napparently almost completely to overshadow the higher aims of life.\r\nMoreover, this is an age when the more advanced races are coming in\r\ncloser contact with the less developed races, and the race-feeling is\r\ntherefore intensified; and Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s programme practically\r\naccepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races. Again, in our own\r\nland, the reaction from the sentiment of war time has given impetus to\r\nrace-prejudice against Negroes, and Mr. Washington withdraws many of\r\nthe high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens. In other\r\nperiods of intensified prejudice all the Negro\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to\r\nself-assertion has been called forth; at this period a policy of\r\nsubmission is advocated. In the history of nearly all other races and\r\npeoples the doctrine preached at such crises has been that manly\r\nself-respect is worth more than lands and houses, and that a people who\r\nvoluntarily surrender such respect, or cease striving for it, are not\r\nworth civilizing.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, it has been claimed that the Negro can survive only\r\nthrough submission. Mr. Washington distinctly asks that black people\r\ngive up, at least for the present, three things,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFirst, political power,\r\n\r\nSecond, insistence on civil rights,\r\n\r\nThird, higher education of Negro youth,\xe2\x80\x94and concentrate all their\r\nenergies on industrial education, and accumulation of wealth, and the\r\nconciliation of the South. This policy has been courageously and\r\ninsistently advocated for over fifteen years, and has been triumphant\r\nfor perhaps ten years. As a result of this tender of the palm-branch,\r\nwhat has been the return? In these years there have occurred:\r\n\r\n1. The disfranchisement of the Negro.\r\n\r\n2. The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for the\r\nNegro.\r\n\r\n3. The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher\r\ntraining of the Negro.\r\n\r\nThese movements are not, to be sure, direct results of Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nteachings; but his propaganda has, without a shadow of doubt, helped\r\ntheir speedier accomplishment. The question then comes: Is it possible,\r\nand probable, that nine millions of men can make effective progress in\r\neconomic lines if they are deprived of political rights, made a servile\r\ncaste, and allowed only the most meagre chance for developing their\r\nexceptional men? If history and reason give any distinct answer to\r\nthese questions, it is an emphatic _No_. And Mr. Washington thus faces\r\nthe triple paradox of his career:\r\n\r\n1. He is striving nobly to make Negro artisans business men and\r\nproperty-owners; but it is utterly impossible, under modern competitive\r\nmethods, for workingmen and property-owners to defend their rights and\r\nexist without the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n2. He insists on thrift and self-respect, but at the same time counsels\r\na silent submission to civic inferiority such as is bound to sap the\r\nmanhood of any race in the long run.\r\n\r\n3. He advocates common-school and industrial training, and depreciates\r\ninstitutions of higher learning; but neither the Negro common-schools,\r\nnor Tuskegee itself, could remain open a day were it not for teachers\r\ntrained in Negro colleges, or trained by their graduates.\r\n\r\nThis triple paradox in Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s position is the object of\r\ncriticism by two classes of colored Americans. One class is spiritually\r\ndescended from Toussaint the Savior, through Gabriel, Vesey, and\r\nTurner, and they represent the attitude of revolt and revenge; they\r\nhate the white South blindly and distrust the white race generally, and\r\nso far as they agree on definite action, think that the Negro\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nhope lies in emigration beyond the borders of the United States. And\r\nyet, by the irony of fate, nothing has more effectually made this\r\nprogramme seem hopeless than the recent course of the United States\r\ntoward weaker and darker peoples in the West Indies, Hawaii, and the\r\nPhilippines,\xe2\x80\x94for where in the world may we go and be safe from lying\r\nand brute force?\r\n\r\nThe other class of Negroes who cannot agree with Mr. Washington has\r\nhitherto said little aloud. They deprecate the sight of scattered\r\ncounsels, of internal disagreement; and especially they dislike making\r\ntheir just criticism of a useful and earnest man an excuse for a\r\ngeneral discharge of venom from small-minded opponents. Nevertheless,\r\nthe questions involved are so fundamental and serious that it is\r\ndifficult to see how men like the Grimkes, Kelly Miller, J. W. E.\r\nBowen, and other representatives of this group, can much longer be\r\nsilent. Such men feel in conscience bound to ask of this nation three\r\nthings:\r\n\r\n1. The right to vote.\r\n\r\n2. Civic equality.\r\n\r\n3. The education of youth according to ability. They acknowledge Mr.\r\nWashington\xe2\x80\x99s invaluable service in counselling patience and courtesy in\r\nsuch demands; they do not ask that ignorant black men vote when\r\nignorant whites are debarred, or that any reasonable restrictions in\r\nthe suffrage should not be applied; they know that the low social level\r\nof the mass of the race is responsible for much discrimination against\r\nit, but they also know, and the nation knows, that relentless\r\ncolor-prejudice is more often a cause than a result of the Negro\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndegradation; they seek the abatement of this relic of barbarism, and\r\nnot its systematic encouragement and pampering by all agencies of\r\nsocial power from the Associated Press to the Church of Christ. They\r\nadvocate, with Mr. Washington, a broad system of Negro common schools\r\nsupplemented by thorough industrial training; but they are surprised\r\nthat a man of Mr. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s insight cannot see that no such\r\neducational system ever has rested or can rest on any other basis than\r\nthat of the well-equipped college and university, and they insist that\r\nthere is a demand for a few such institutions throughout the South to\r\ntrain the best of the Negro youth as teachers, professional men, and\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nThis group of men honor Mr. Washington for his attitude of conciliation\r\ntoward the white South; they accept the \xe2\x80\x9cAtlanta Compromise\xe2\x80\x9d in its\r\nbroadest interpretation; they recognize, with him, many signs of\r\npromise, many men of high purpose and fair judgment, in this section;\r\nthey know that no easy task has been laid upon a region already\r\ntottering under heavy burdens. But, nevertheless, they insist that the\r\nway to truth and right lies in straightforward honesty, not in\r\nindiscriminate flattery; in praising those of the South who do well and\r\ncriticising uncompromisingly those who do ill; in taking advantage of\r\nthe opportunities at hand and urging their fellows to do the same, but\r\nat the same time in remembering that only a firm adherence to their\r\nhigher ideals and aspirations will ever keep those ideals within the\r\nrealm of possibility. They do not expect that the free right to vote,\r\nto enjoy civic rights, and to be educated, will come in a moment; they\r\ndo not expect to see the bias and prejudices of years disappear at the\r\nblast of a trumpet; but they are absolutely certain that the way for a\r\npeople to gain their reasonable rights is not by voluntarily throwing\r\nthem away and insisting that they do not want them; that the way for a\r\npeople to gain respect is not by continually belittling and ridiculing\r\nthemselves; that, on the contrary, Negroes must insist continually, in\r\nseason and out of season, that voting is necessary to modern manhood,\r\nthat color discrimination is barbarism, and that black boys need\r\neducation as well as white boys.\r\n\r\nIn failing thus to state plainly and unequivocally the legitimate\r\ndemands of their people, even at the cost of opposing an honored\r\nleader, the thinking classes of American Negroes would shirk a heavy\r\nresponsibility,\xe2\x80\x94a responsibility to themselves, a responsibility to the\r\nstruggling masses, a responsibility to the darker races of men whose\r\nfuture depends so largely on this American experiment, but especially a\r\nresponsibility to this nation,\xe2\x80\x94this common Fatherland. It is wrong to\r\nencourage a man or a people in evil-doing; it is wrong to aid and abet\r\na national crime simply because it is unpopular not to do so. The\r\ngrowing spirit of kindliness and reconciliation between the North and\r\nSouth after the frightful difference of a generation ago ought to be a\r\nsource of deep congratulation to all, and especially to those whose\r\nmistreatment caused the war; but if that reconciliation is to be marked\r\nby the industrial slavery and civic death of those same black men, with\r\npermanent legislation into a position of inferiority, then those black\r\nmen, if they are really men, are called upon by every consideration of\r\npatriotism and loyalty to oppose such a course by all civilized\r\nmethods, even though such opposition involves disagreement with Mr.\r\nBooker T. Washington. We have no right to sit silently by while the\r\ninevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our children,\r\nblack and white.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is the duty of black men to judge the South discriminatingly.\r\nThe present generation of Southerners are not responsible for the past,\r\nand they should not be blindly hated or blamed for it. Furthermore, to\r\nno class is the indiscriminate endorsement of the recent course of the\r\nSouth toward Negroes more nauseating than to the best thought of the\r\nSouth. The South is not \xe2\x80\x9csolid\xe2\x80\x99; it is a land in the ferment of social\r\nchange, wherein forces of all kinds are fighting for supremacy; and to\r\npraise the ill the South is today perpetrating is just as wrong as to\r\ncondemn the good. Discriminating and broad-minded criticism is what the\r\nSouth needs,\xe2\x80\x94needs it for the sake of her own white sons and daughters,\r\nand for the insurance of robust, healthy mental and moral development.\r\n\r\nToday even the attitude of the Southern whites toward the blacks is\r\nnot, as so many assume, in all cases the same; the ignorant Southerner\r\nhates the Negro, the workingmen fear his competition, the money-makers\r\nwish to use him as a laborer, some of the educated see a menace in his\r\nupward development, while others\xe2\x80\x94usually the sons of the masters\xe2\x80\x94wish\r\nto help him to rise. National opinion has enabled this last class to\r\nmaintain the Negro common schools, and to protect the Negro partially\r\nin property, life, and limb. Through the pressure of the money-makers,\r\nthe Negro is in danger of being reduced to semi-slavery, especially in\r\nthe country districts; the workingmen, and those of the educated who\r\nfear the Negro, have united to disfranchise him, and some have urged\r\nhis deportation; while the passions of the ignorant are easily aroused\r\nto lynch and abuse any black man. To praise this intricate whirl of\r\nthought and prejudice is nonsense; to inveigh indiscriminately against\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe South\xe2\x80\x9d is unjust; but to use the same breath in praising Governor\r\nAycock, exposing Senator Morgan, arguing with Mr. Thomas Nelson Page,\r\nand denouncing Senator Ben Tillman, is not only sane, but the\r\nimperative duty of thinking black men.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to Mr. Washington not to acknowledge that in several\r\ninstances he has opposed movements in the South which were unjust to\r\nthe Negro; he sent memorials to the Louisiana and Alabama\r\nconstitutional conventions, he has spoken against lynching, and in\r\nother ways has openly or silently set his influence against sinister\r\nschemes and unfortunate happenings. Notwithstanding this, it is equally\r\ntrue to assert that on the whole the distinct impression left by Mr.\r\nWashington\xe2\x80\x99s propaganda is, first, that the South is justified in its\r\npresent attitude toward the Negro because of the Negro\xe2\x80\x99s degradation;\r\nsecondly, that the prime cause of the Negro\xe2\x80\x99s failure to rise more\r\nquickly is his wrong education in the past; and, thirdly, that his\r\nfuture rise depends primarily on his own efforts. Each of these\r\npropositions is a dangerous half-truth. The supplementary truths must\r\nnever be lost sight of: first, slavery and race-prejudice are potent if\r\nnot sufficient causes of the Negro\xe2\x80\x99s position; second, industrial and\r\ncommon-school training were necessarily slow in planting because they\r\nhad to await the black teachers trained by higher institutions,\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nbeing extremely doubtful if any essentially different development was\r\npossible, and certainly a Tuskegee was unthinkable before 1880; and,\r\nthird, while it is a great truth to say that the Negro must strive and\r\nstrive mightily to help himself, it is equally true that unless his\r\nstriving be not simply seconded, but rather aroused and encouraged, by\r\nthe initiative of the richer and wiser environing group, he cannot hope\r\nfor great success.\r\n\r\nIn his failure to realize and impress this last point, Mr. Washington\r\nis especially to be criticised. His doctrine has tended to make the\r\nwhites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the\r\nNegro\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic\r\nspectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the\r\nhands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting\r\nthese great wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe South ought to be led, by candid and honest criticism, to assert\r\nher better self and do her full duty to the race she has cruelly\r\nwronged and is still wronging. The North\xe2\x80\x94her co-partner in guilt\xe2\x80\x94cannot\r\nsalve her conscience by plastering it with gold. We cannot settle this\r\nproblem by diplomacy and suaveness, by \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d alone. If worse come to\r\nworst, can the moral fibre of this country survive the slow throttling\r\nand murder of nine millions of men?\r\n\r\nThe black men of America have a duty to perform, a duty stern and\r\ndelicate,\xe2\x80\x94a forward movement to oppose a part of the work of their\r\ngreatest leader. So far as Mr. Washington preaches Thrift, Patience,\r\nand Industrial Training for the masses, we must hold up his hands and\r\nstrive with him, rejoicing in his honors and glorying in the strength\r\nof this Joshua called of God and of man to lead the headless host. But\r\nso far as Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice, North or South, does\r\nnot rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, belittles the\r\nemasculating effects of caste distinctions, and opposes the higher\r\ntraining and ambition of our brighter minds,\xe2\x80\x94so far as he, the South,\r\nor the Nation, does this,\xe2\x80\x94we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them.\r\nBy every civilized and peaceful method we must strive for the rights\r\nwhich the world accords to men, clinging unwaveringly to those great\r\nwords which the sons of the Fathers would fain forget: \xe2\x80\x9cWe hold these\r\ntruths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they\r\nare endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that\r\namong these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nOf the Meaning of Progress\r\n\r\nWillst Du Deine Macht verk\xc3\xbcnden,\r\nW\xc3\xa4hle sie die frei von S\xc3\xbcnden,\r\nSteh\xe2\x80\x99n in Deinem ew\xe2\x80\x99gen Haus!\r\nDeine Geister sende aus!\r\nDie Unsterblichen, die Reinen,\r\nDie nicht f\xc3\xbchlen, die nicht weinen!\r\nNicht die zarte Jungfrau w\xc3\xa4hle,\r\nNicht der Hirtin weiche Seele!\r\n\r\nSCHILLER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time I taught school in the hills of Tennessee, where the\r\nbroad dark vale of the Mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet\r\nthe Alleghanies. I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought\r\nthat Tennessee\xe2\x80\x94beyond the Veil\xe2\x80\x94was theirs alone, and in vacation time\r\nthey sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county\r\nschool-commissioners. Young and happy, I too went, and I shall not soon\r\nforget that summer, seventeen years ago.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 Institute at the county-seat; and there\r\ndistinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers\r\nfractions and spelling and other mysteries,\xe2\x80\x94white teachers in the\r\nmorning, Negroes at night. A picnic now and then, and a supper, and the\r\nrough world was softened by laughter and song. I remember how\xe2\x80\x94 But I\r\nwander.\r\n\r\nThere came a day when all the teachers left the Institute and began the\r\nhunt for schools. I learn from hearsay (for my mother was mortally\r\nafraid of firearms) that the hunting of ducks and bears and men is\r\nwonderfully interesting, but I am sure that the man who has never\r\nhunted a country school has something to learn of the pleasures of the\r\nchase. I see now the white, hot roads lazily rise and fall and wind\r\nbefore me under the burning July sun; I feel the deep weariness of\r\nheart and limb as ten, eight, six miles stretch relentlessly ahead; I\r\nfeel my heart sink heavily as I hear again and again, \xe2\x80\x9cGot a teacher?\r\nYes.\xe2\x80\x9d So I walked on and on\xe2\x80\x94horses were too expensive\xe2\x80\x94until I had\r\nwandered beyond railways, beyond stage lines, to a land of \xe2\x80\x9cvarmints\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand rattlesnakes, where the coming of a stranger was an event, and men\r\nlived and died in the shadow of one blue hill.\r\n\r\nSprinkled over hill and dale lay cabins and farmhouses, shut out from\r\nthe world by the forests and the rolling hills toward the east. There I\r\nfound at last a little school. Josie told me of it; she was a thin,\r\nhomely girl of twenty, with a dark-brown face and thick, hard hair. I\r\nhad crossed the stream at Watertown, and rested under the great\r\nwillows; then I had gone to the little cabin in the lot where Josie was\r\nresting on her way to town. The gaunt farmer made me welcome, and\r\nJosie, hearing my errand, told me anxiously that they wanted a school\r\nover the hill; that but once since the war had a teacher been there;\r\nthat she herself longed to learn,\xe2\x80\x94and thus she ran on, talking fast and\r\nloud, with much earnestness and energy.\r\n\r\nNext morning I crossed the tall round hill, lingered to look at the\r\nblue and yellow mountains stretching toward the Carolinas, then plunged\r\ninto the wood, and came out at Josie\xe2\x80\x99s home. It was a dull frame\r\ncottage with four rooms, perched just below the brow of the hill, amid\r\npeach-trees. The father was a quiet, simple soul, calmly ignorant, with\r\nno touch of vulgarity. The mother was different,\xe2\x80\x94strong, bustling, and\r\nenergetic, with a quick, restless tongue, and an ambition to live \xe2\x80\x9clike\r\nfolks.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a crowd of children. Two boys had gone away. There\r\nremained two growing girls; a shy midget of eight; John, tall, awkward,\r\nand eighteen; Jim, younger, quicker, and better looking; and two babies\r\nof indefinite age. Then there was Josie herself. She seemed to be the\r\ncentre of the family: always busy at service, or at home, or\r\nberry-picking; a little nervous and inclined to scold, like her mother,\r\nyet faithful, too, like her father. She had about her a certain\r\nfineness, the shadow of an unconscious moral heroism that would\r\nwillingly give all of life to make life broader, deeper, and fuller for\r\nher and hers. I saw much of this family afterwards, and grew to love\r\nthem for their honest efforts to be decent and comfortable, and for\r\ntheir knowledge of their own ignorance. There was with them no\r\naffectation. The mother would scold the father for being so \xe2\x80\x9ceasy\xe2\x80\x99;\r\nJosie would roundly berate the boys for carelessness; and all knew that\r\nit was a hard thing to dig a living out of a rocky side-hill.\r\n\r\nI secured the school. I remember the day I rode horseback out to the\r\ncommissioner\xe2\x80\x99s house with a pleasant young white fellow who wanted the\r\nwhite school. The road ran down the bed of a stream; the sun laughed\r\nand the water jingled, and we rode on. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncommissioner,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98come in. Have a seat. Yes, that certificate will do.\r\nStay to dinner. What do you want a month?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is\r\nlucky\xe2\x80\x99; but even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate\r\nfirst, then I\xe2\x80\x94alone.\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse was a log hut, where Colonel Wheeler used to shelter\r\nhis corn. It sat in a lot behind a rail fence and thorn bushes, near\r\nthe sweetest of springs. There was an entrance where a door once was,\r\nand within, a massive rickety fireplace; great chinks between the logs\r\nserved as windows. Furniture was scarce. A pale blackboard crouched in\r\nthe corner. My desk was made of three boards, reinforced at critical\r\npoints, and my chair, borrowed from the landlady, had to be returned\r\nevery night. Seats for the children\xe2\x80\x94these puzzled me much. I was\r\nhaunted by a New England vision of neat little desks and chairs, but,\r\nalas! the reality was rough plank benches without backs, and at times\r\nwithout legs. They had the one virtue of making naps\r\ndangerous,\xe2\x80\x94possibly fatal, for the floor was not to be trusted.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot morning late in July when the school opened. I trembled\r\nwhen I heard the patter of little feet down the dusty road, and saw the\r\ngrowing row of dark solemn faces and bright eager eyes facing me. First\r\ncame Josie and her brothers and sisters. The longing to know, to be a\r\nstudent in the great school at Nashville, hovered like a star above\r\nthis child-woman amid her work and worry, and she studied doggedly.\r\nThere were the Dowells from their farm over toward Alexandria,\xe2\x80\x94Fanny,\r\nwith her smooth black face and wondering eyes; Martha, brown and dull;\r\nthe pretty girl-wife of a brother, and the younger brood.\r\n\r\nThere were the Burkes,\xe2\x80\x94two brown and yellow lads, and a tiny\r\nhaughty-eyed girl. Fat Reuben\xe2\x80\x99s little chubby girl came, with golden\r\nface and old-gold hair, faithful and solemn. \xe2\x80\x99Thenie was on hand\r\nearly,\xe2\x80\x94a jolly, ugly, good-hearted girl, who slyly dipped snuff and\r\nlooked after her little bow-legged brother. When her mother could spare\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x99Tildy came,\xe2\x80\x94a midnight beauty, with starry eyes and tapering\r\nlimbs; and her brother, correspondingly homely. And then the big\r\nboys,\xe2\x80\x94the hulking Lawrences; the lazy Neills, unfathered sons of mother\r\nand daughter; Hickman, with a stoop in his shoulders; and the rest.\r\n\r\nThere they sat, nearly thirty of them, on the rough benches, their\r\nfaces shading from a pale cream to a deep brown, the little feet bare\r\nand swinging, the eyes full of expectation, with here and there a\r\ntwinkle of mischief, and the hands grasping Webster\xe2\x80\x99s blue-black\r\nspelling-book. I loved my school, and the fine faith the children had\r\nin the wisdom of their teacher was truly marvellous. We read and\r\nspelled together, wrote a little, picked flowers, sang, and listened to\r\nstories of the world beyond the hill. At times the school would dwindle\r\naway, and I would start out. I would visit Mun Eddings, who lived in\r\ntwo very dirty rooms, and ask why little Lugene, whose flaming face\r\nseemed ever ablaze with the dark-red hair uncombed, was absent all last\r\nweek, or why I missed so often the inimitable rags of Mack and Ed. Then\r\nthe father, who worked Colonel Wheeler\xe2\x80\x99s farm on shares, would tell me\r\nhow the crops needed the boys; and the thin, slovenly mother, whose\r\nface was pretty when washed, assured me that Lugene must mind the baby.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ll start them again next week.\xe2\x80\x9d When the Lawrences stopped, I\r\nknew that the doubts of the old folks about book-learning had conquered\r\nagain, and so, toiling up the hill, and getting as far into the cabin\r\nas possible, I put Cicero \xe2\x80\x9cpro Archia Poeta\xe2\x80\x9d into the simplest English\r\nwith local applications, and usually convinced them\xe2\x80\x94for a week or so.\r\n\r\nOn Friday nights I often went home with some of the children,\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\r\nto Doc Burke\xe2\x80\x99s farm. He was a great, loud, thin Black, ever working,\r\nand trying to buy the seventy-five acres of hill and dale where he\r\nlived; but people said that he would surely fail, and the \xe2\x80\x9cwhite folks\r\nwould get it all.\xe2\x80\x9d His wife was a magnificent Amazon, with saffron face\r\nand shining hair, uncorseted and barefooted, and the children were\r\nstrong and beautiful. They lived in a one-and-a-half-room cabin in the\r\nhollow of the farm, near the spring. The front room was full of great\r\nfat white beds, scrupulously neat; and there were bad chromos on the\r\nwalls, and a tired centre-table. In the tiny back kitchen I was often\r\ninvited to \xe2\x80\x9ctake out and help\xe2\x80\x9d myself to fried chicken and wheat\r\nbiscuit, \xe2\x80\x9cmeat\xe2\x80\x9d and corn pone, string-beans and berries. At first I\r\nused to be a little alarmed at the approach of bedtime in the one lone\r\nbedroom, but embarrassment was very deftly avoided. First, all the\r\nchildren nodded and slept, and were stowed away in one great pile of\r\ngoose feathers; next, the mother and the father discreetly slipped away\r\nto the kitchen while I went to bed; then, blowing out the dim light,\r\nthey retired in the dark. In the morning all were up and away before I\r\nthought of awaking. Across the road, where fat Reuben lived, they all\r\nwent outdoors while the teacher retired, because they did not boast the\r\nluxury of a kitchen.\r\n\r\nI liked to stay with the Dowells, for they had four rooms and plenty of\r\ngood country fare. Uncle Bird had a small, rough farm, all woods and\r\nhills, miles from the big road; but he was full of tales,\xe2\x80\x94he preached\r\nnow and then,\xe2\x80\x94and with his children, berries, horses, and wheat he was\r\nhappy and prosperous. Often, to keep the peace, I must go where life\r\nwas less lovely; for instance, \xe2\x80\x99Tildy\xe2\x80\x99s mother was incorrigibly dirty,\r\nReuben\xe2\x80\x99s larder was limited seriously, and herds of untamed insects\r\nwandered over the Eddingses\xe2\x80\x99 beds. Best of all I loved to go to\r\nJosie\xe2\x80\x99s, and sit on the porch, eating peaches, while the mother bustled\r\nand talked: how Josie had bought the sewing-machine; how Josie worked\r\nat service in winter, but that four dollars a month was \xe2\x80\x9cmighty little\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwages; how Josie longed to go away to school, but that it \xe2\x80\x9clooked like\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthey never could get far enough ahead to let her; how the crops failed\r\nand the well was yet unfinished; and, finally, how \xe2\x80\x9cmean\xe2\x80\x9d some of the\r\nwhite folks were.\r\n\r\nFor two summers I lived in this little world; it was dull and humdrum.\r\nThe girls looked at the hill in wistful longing, and the boys fretted\r\nand haunted Alexandria. Alexandria was \xe2\x80\x9ctown,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a straggling, lazy\r\nvillage of houses, churches, and shops, and an aristocracy of Toms,\r\nDicks, and Captains. Cuddled on the hill to the north was the village\r\nof the colored folks, who lived in three- or four-room unpainted\r\ncottages, some neat and homelike, and some dirty. The dwellings were\r\nscattered rather aimlessly, but they centred about the twin temples of\r\nthe hamlet, the Methodist, and the Hard-Shell Baptist churches. These,\r\nin turn, leaned gingerly on a sad-colored schoolhouse. Hither my little\r\nworld wended its crooked way on Sunday to meet other worlds, and\r\ngossip, and wonder, and make the weekly sacrifice with frenzied priest\r\nat the altar of the \xe2\x80\x9cold-time religion.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the soft melody and\r\nmighty cadences of Negro song fluttered and thundered.\r\n\r\nI have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it;\r\nand yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness,\r\nsprung from common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a\r\ncommon hardship in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all,\r\nfrom the sight of the Veil that hung between us and Opportunity. All\r\nthis caused us to think some thoughts together; but these, when ripe\r\nfor speech, were spoken in various languages. Those whose eyes\r\ntwenty-five and more years before had seen \xe2\x80\x9cthe glory of the coming of\r\nthe Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d saw in every present hindrance or help a dark fatalism bound\r\nto bring all things right in His own good time. The mass of those to\r\nwhom slavery was a dim recollection of childhood found the world a\r\npuzzling thing: it asked little of them, and they answered with little,\r\nand yet it ridiculed their offering. Such a paradox they could not\r\nunderstand, and therefore sank into listless indifference, or\r\nshiftlessness, or reckless bravado. There were, however, some\xe2\x80\x94such as\r\nJosie, Jim, and Ben\xe2\x80\x94to whom War, Hell, and Slavery were but childhood\r\ntales, whose young appetites had been whetted to an edge by school and\r\nstory and half-awakened thought. Ill could they be content, born\r\nwithout and beyond the World. And their weak wings beat against their\r\nbarriers,\xe2\x80\x94barriers of caste, of youth, of life; at last, in dangerous\r\nmoments, against everything that opposed even a whim.\r\n\r\nThe ten years that follow youth, the years when first the realization\r\ncomes that life is leading somewhere,\xe2\x80\x94these were the years that passed\r\nafter I left my little school. When they were past, I came by chance\r\nonce more to the walls of Fisk University, to the halls of the chapel\r\nof melody. As I lingered there in the joy and pain of meeting old\r\nschool-friends, there swept over me a sudden longing to pass again\r\nbeyond the blue hill, and to see the homes and the school of other\r\ndays, and to learn how life had gone with my school-children; and I\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nJosie was dead, and the gray-haired mother said simply, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had a\r\nheap of trouble since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been away.\xe2\x80\x9d I had feared for Jim. With a\r\ncultured parentage and a social caste to uphold him, he might have made\r\na venturesome merchant or a West Point cadet. But here he was, angry\r\nwith life and reckless; and when Fanner Durham charged him with\r\nstealing wheat, the old man had to ride fast to escape the stones which\r\nthe furious fool hurled after him. They told Jim to run away; but he\r\nwould not run, and the constable came that afternoon. It grieved Josie,\r\nand great awkward John walked nine miles every day to see his little\r\nbrother through the bars of Lebanon jail. At last the two came back\r\ntogether in the dark night. The mother cooked supper, and Josie emptied\r\nher purse, and the boys stole away. Josie grew thin and silent, yet\r\nworked the more. The hill became steep for the quiet old father, and\r\nwith the boys away there was little to do in the valley. Josie helped\r\nthem to sell the old farm, and they moved nearer town. Brother Dennis,\r\nthe carpenter, built a new house with six rooms; Josie toiled a year in\r\nNashville, and brought back ninety dollars to furnish the house and\r\nchange it to a home.\r\n\r\nWhen the spring came, and the birds twittered, and the stream ran proud\r\nand full, little sister Lizzie, bold and thoughtless, flushed with the\r\npassion of youth, bestowed herself on the tempter, and brought home a\r\nnameless child. Josie shivered and worked on, with the vision of\r\nschooldays all fled, with a face wan and tired,\xe2\x80\x94worked until, on a\r\nsummer\xe2\x80\x99s day, some one married another; then Josie crept to her mother\r\nlike a hurt child, and slept\xe2\x80\x94and sleeps.\r\n\r\nI paused to scent the breeze as I entered the valley. The Lawrences\r\nhave gone,\xe2\x80\x94father and son forever,\xe2\x80\x94and the other son lazily digs in the\r\nearth to live. A new young widow rents out their cabin to fat Reuben.\r\nReuben is a Baptist preacher now, but I fear as lazy as ever, though\r\nhis cabin has three rooms; and little Ella has grown into a bouncing\r\nwoman, and is ploughing corn on the hot hillside. There are babies\r\na-plenty, and one half-witted girl. Across the valley is a house I did\r\nnot know before, and there I found, rocking one baby and expecting\r\nanother, one of my schoolgirls, a daughter of Uncle Bird Dowell. She\r\nlooked somewhat worried with her new duties, but soon bristled into\r\npride over her neat cabin and the tale of her thrifty husband, and the\r\nhorse and cow, and the farm they were planning to buy.\r\n\r\nMy log schoolhouse was gone. In its place stood Progress; and Progress,\r\nI understand, is necessarily ugly. The crazy foundation stones still\r\nmarked the former site of my poor little cabin, and not far away, on\r\nsix weary boulders, perched a jaunty board house, perhaps twenty by\r\nthirty feet, with three windows and a door that locked. Some of the\r\nwindow-glass was broken, and part of an old iron stove lay mournfully\r\nunder the house. I peeped through the window half reverently, and found\r\nthings that were more familiar. The blackboard had grown by about two\r\nfeet, and the seats were still without backs. The county owns the lot\r\nnow, I hear, and every year there is a session of school. As I sat by\r\nthe spring and looked on the Old and the New I felt glad, very glad,\r\nand yet\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAfter two long drinks I started on. There was the great double\r\nlog-house on the corner. I remembered the broken, blighted family that\r\nused to live there. The strong, hard face of the mother, with its\r\nwilderness of hair, rose before me. She had driven her husband away,\r\nand while I taught school a strange man lived there, big and jovial,\r\nand people talked. I felt sure that Ben and \xe2\x80\x99Tildy would come to naught\r\nfrom such a home. But this is an odd world; for Ben is a busy farmer in\r\nSmith County, \xe2\x80\x9cdoing well, too,\xe2\x80\x9d they say, and he had cared for little\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tildy until last spring, when a lover married her. A hard life the lad\r\nhad led, toiling for meat, and laughed at because he was homely and\r\ncrooked. There was Sam Carlon, an impudent old skinflint, who had\r\ndefinite notions about \xe2\x80\x9cniggers,\xe2\x80\x9d and hired Ben a summer and would not\r\npay him. Then the hungry boy gathered his sacks together, and in broad\r\ndaylight went into Carlon\xe2\x80\x99s corn; and when the hard-fisted farmer set\r\nupon him, the angry boy flew at him like a beast. Doc Burke saved a\r\nmurder and a lynching that day.\r\n\r\nThe story reminded me again of the Burkes, and an impatience seized me\r\nto know who won in the battle, Doc or the seventy-five acres. For it is\r\na hard thing to make a farm out of nothing, even in fifteen years. So I\r\nhurried on, thinking of the Burkes. They used to have a certain\r\nmagnificent barbarism about them that I liked. They were never vulgar,\r\nnever immoral, but rather rough and primitive, with an\r\nunconventionality that spent itself in loud guffaws, slaps on the back,\r\nand naps in the corner. I hurried by the cottage of the misborn Neill\r\nboys. It was empty, and they were grown into fat, lazy farm-hands. I\r\nsaw the home of the Hickmans, but Albert, with his stooping shoulders,\r\nhad passed from the world. Then I came to the Burkes\xe2\x80\x99 gate and peered\r\nthrough; the enclosure looked rough and untrimmed, and yet there were\r\nthe same fences around the old farm save to the left, where lay\r\ntwenty-five other acres. And lo! the cabin in the hollow had climbed\r\nthe hill and swollen to a half-finished six-room cottage.\r\n\r\nThe Burkes held a hundred acres, but they were still in debt. Indeed,\r\nthe gaunt father who toiled night and day would scarcely be happy out\r\nof debt, being so used to it. Some day he must stop, for his massive\r\nframe is showing decline. The mother wore shoes, but the lion-like\r\nphysique of other days was broken. The children had grown up. Rob, the\r\nimage of his father, was loud and rough with laughter. Birdie, my\r\nschool baby of six, had grown to a picture of maiden beauty, tall and\r\ntawny. \xe2\x80\x9cEdgar is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, with head half bowed,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98gone to\r\nwork in Nashville; he and his father couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Doc, the boy born since the time of my school, took me horseback\r\ndown the creek next morning toward Farmer Dowell\xe2\x80\x99s. The road and the\r\nstream were battling for mastery, and the stream had the better of it.\r\nWe splashed and waded, and the merry boy, perched behind me, chattered\r\nand laughed. He showed me where Simon Thompson had bought a bit of\r\nground and a home; but his daughter Lana, a plump, brown, slow girl,\r\nwas not there. She had married a man and a farm twenty miles away. We\r\nwound on down the stream till we came to a gate that I did not\r\nrecognize, but the boy insisted that it was \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Bird\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d The farm\r\nwas fat with the growing crop. In that little valley was a strange\r\nstillness as I rode up; for death and marriage had stolen youth and\r\nleft age and childhood there. We sat and talked that night after the\r\nchores were done. Uncle Bird was grayer, and his eyes did not see so\r\nwell, but he was still jovial. We talked of the acres bought,\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nhundred and twenty-five,\xe2\x80\x94of the new guest-chamber added, of Martha\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarrying. Then we talked of death: Fanny and Fred were gone; a shadow\r\nhung over the other daughter, and when it lifted she was to go to\r\nNashville to school. At last we spoke of the neighbors, and as night\r\nfell, Uncle Bird told me how, on a night like that, \xe2\x80\x99Thenie came\r\nwandering back to her home over yonder, to escape the blows of her\r\nhusband. And next morning she died in the home that her little\r\nbow-legged brother, working and saving, had bought for their widowed\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nMy journey was done, and behind me lay hill and dale, and Life and\r\nDeath. How shall man measure Progress there where the dark-faced Josie\r\nlies? How many heartfuls of sorrow shall balance a bushel of wheat? How\r\nhard a thing is life to the lowly, and yet how human and real! And all\r\nthis life and love and strife and failure,\xe2\x80\x94is it the twilight of\r\nnightfall or the flush of some faint-dawning day?\r\n\r\nThus sadly musing, I rode to Nashville in the Jim Crow car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nOf the Wings of Atalanta\r\n\r\nO black boy of Atlanta!\r\n    But half was spoken;\r\nThe slave\xe2\x80\x99s chains and the master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    Alike are broken;\r\nThe one curse of the races\r\n    Held both in tether;\r\nThey are rising\xe2\x80\x94all are rising\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    The black and white together.\r\n\r\nWHITTIER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth of the North, yet north of the South, lies the City of a Hundred\r\nHills, peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the\r\nfuture. I have seen her in the morning, when the first flush of day had\r\nhalf-roused her; she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of Georgia;\r\nthen the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys, the tinkle of bell\r\nand scream of whistle broke the silence, the rattle and roar of busy\r\nlife slowly gathered and swelled, until the seething whirl of the city\r\nseemed a strange thing in a sleepy land.\r\n\r\nOnce, they say, even Atlanta slept dull and drowsy at the foot-hills of\r\nthe Alleghanies, until the iron baptism of war awakened her with its\r\nsullen waters, aroused and maddened her, and left her listening to the\r\nsea. And the sea cried to the hills and the hills answered the sea,\r\ntill the city rose like a widow and cast away her weeds, and toiled for\r\nher daily bread; toiled steadily, toiled cunningly,\xe2\x80\x94perhaps with some\r\nbitterness, with a touch, of _r\xc3\xa9clame_,\xe2\x80\x94and yet with real earnestness,\r\nand real sweat.\r\n\r\nIt is a hard thing to live haunted by the ghost of an untrue dream; to\r\nsee the wide vision of empire fade into real ashes and dirt; to feel\r\nthe pang of the conquered, and yet know that with all the Bad that fell\r\non one black day, something was vanquished that deserved to live,\r\nsomething killed that in justice had not dared to die; to know that\r\nwith the Right that triumphed, triumphed something of Wrong, something\r\nsordid and mean, something less than the broadest and best. All this is\r\nbitter hard; and many a man and city and people have found in it excuse\r\nfor sulking, and brooding, and listless waiting.\r\n\r\nSuch are not men of the sturdier make; they of Atlanta turned\r\nresolutely toward the future; and that future held aloft vistas of\r\npurple and gold:\xe2\x80\x94Atlanta, Queen of the cotton kingdom; Atlanta, Gateway\r\nto the Land of the Sun; Atlanta, the new Lachesis, spinner of web and\r\nwoof for the world. So the city crowned her hundred hills with\r\nfactories, and stored her shops with cunning handiwork, and stretched\r\nlong iron ways to greet the busy Mercury in his coming. And the Nation\r\ntalked of her striving.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Atlanta was not christened for the winged maiden of dull\r\nBoeotia; you know the tale,\xe2\x80\x94how swarthy Atalanta, tall and wild, would\r\nmarry only him who out-raced her; and how the wily Hippomenes laid\r\nthree apples of gold in the way. She fled like a shadow, paused,\r\nstartled over the first apple, but even as he stretched his hand, fled\r\nagain; hovered over the second, then, slipping from his hot grasp, flew\r\nover river, vale, and hill; but as she lingered over the third, his\r\narms fell round her, and looking on each other, the blazing passion of\r\ntheir love profaned the sanctuary of Love, and they were cursed. If\r\nAtlanta be not named for Atalanta, she ought to have been.\r\n\r\nAtalanta is not the first or the last maiden whom greed of gold has led\r\nto defile the temple of Love; and not maids alone, but men in the race\r\nof life, sink from the high and generous ideals of youth to the\r\ngambler\xe2\x80\x99s code of the Bourse; and in all our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s striving is not\r\nthe Gospel of Work befouled by the Gospel of Pay? So common is this\r\nthat one-half think it normal; so unquestioned, that we almost fear to\r\nquestion if the end of racing is not gold, if the aim of man is not\r\nrightly to be rich. And if this is the fault of America, how dire a\r\ndanger lies before a new land and a new city, lest Atlanta, stooping\r\nfor mere gold, shall find that gold accursed!\r\n\r\nIt was no maiden\xe2\x80\x99s idle whim that started this hard racing; a fearful\r\nwilderness lay about the feet of that city after the War,\xe2\x80\x94feudalism,\r\npoverty, the rise of the Third Estate, serfdom, the re-birth of Law and\r\nOrder, and above and between all, the Veil of Race. How heavy a journey\r\nfor weary feet! what wings must Atalanta have to flit over all this\r\nhollow and hill, through sour wood and sullen water, and by the red\r\nwaste of sun-baked clay! How fleet must Atalanta be if she will not be\r\ntempted by gold to profane the Sanctuary!\r\n\r\nThe Sanctuary of our fathers has, to be sure, few Gods,\xe2\x80\x94some sneer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9call too few.\xe2\x80\x9d There is the thrifty Mercury of New England, Pluto of\r\nthe North, and Ceres of the West; and there, too, is the half-forgotten\r\nApollo of the South, under whose aegis the maiden ran,\xe2\x80\x94and as she ran\r\nshe forgot him, even as there in Boeotia Venus was forgot. She forgot\r\nthe old ideal of the Southern gentleman,\xe2\x80\x94that new-world heir of the\r\ngrace and courtliness of patrician, knight, and noble; forgot his honor\r\nwith his foibles, his kindliness with his carelessness, and stooped to\r\napples of gold,\xe2\x80\x94to men busier and sharper, thriftier and more\r\nunscrupulous. Golden apples are beautiful\xe2\x80\x94I remember the lawless days\r\nof boyhood, when orchards in crimson and gold tempted me over fence and\r\nfield\xe2\x80\x94and, too, the merchant who has dethroned the planter is no\r\ndespicable parvenu. Work and wealth are the mighty levers to lift this\r\nold new land; thrift and toil and saving are the highways to new hopes\r\nand new possibilities; and yet the warning is needed lest the wily\r\nHippomenes tempt Atalanta to thinking that golden apples are the goal\r\nof racing, and not mere incidents by the way.\r\n\r\nAtlanta must not lead the South to dream of material prosperity as the\r\ntouchstone of all success; already the fatal might of this idea is\r\nbeginning to spread; it is replacing the finer type of Southerner with\r\nvulgar money-getters; it is burying the sweeter beauties of Southern\r\nlife beneath pretence and ostentation. For every social ill the panacea\r\nof Wealth has been urged,\xe2\x80\x94wealth to overthrow the remains of the slave\r\nfeudalism; wealth to raise the \xe2\x80\x9ccracker\xe2\x80\x9d Third Estate; wealth to employ\r\nthe black serfs, and the prospect of wealth to keep them working;\r\nwealth as the end and aim of politics, and as the legal tender for law\r\nand order; and, finally, instead of Truth, Beauty, and Goodness, wealth\r\nas the ideal of the Public School.\r\n\r\nNot only is this true in the world which Atlanta typifies, but it is\r\nthreatening to be true of a world beneath and beyond that world,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nBlack World beyond the Veil. Today it makes little difference to\r\nAtlanta, to the South, what the Negro thinks or dreams or wills. In the\r\nsoul-life of the land he is to-day, and naturally will long remain,\r\nunthought of, half forgotten; and yet when he does come to think and\r\nwill and do for himself,\xe2\x80\x94and let no man dream that day will never\r\ncome,\xe2\x80\x94then the part he plays will not be one of sudden learning, but\r\nwords and thoughts he has been taught to lisp in his race-childhood.\r\nTo-day the ferment of his striving toward self-realization is to the\r\nstrife of the white world like a wheel within a wheel: beyond the Veil\r\nare smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the led, of\r\nserfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through all, the\r\nVeil of Race. Few know of these problems, few who know notice them; and\r\nyet there they are, awaiting student, artist, and seer,\xe2\x80\x94a field for\r\nsomebody sometime to discover. Hither has the temptation of Hippomenes\r\npenetrated; already in this smaller world, which now indirectly and\r\nanon directly must influence the larger for good or ill, the habit is\r\nforming of interpreting the world in dollars. The old leaders of Negro\r\nopinion, in the little groups where there is a Negro social\r\nconsciousness, are being replaced by new; neither the black preacher\r\nnor the black teacher leads as he did two decades ago. Into their\r\nplaces are pushing the farmers and gardeners, the well-paid porters and\r\nartisans, the business-men,\xe2\x80\x94all those with property and money. And with\r\nall this change, so curiously parallel to that of the Other-world, goes\r\ntoo the same inevitable change in ideals. The South laments to-day the\r\nslow, steady disappearance of a certain type of Negro,\xe2\x80\x94the faithful,\r\ncourteous slave of other days, with his incorruptible honesty and\r\ndignified humility. He is passing away just as surely as the old type\r\nof Southern gentleman is passing, and from not dissimilar causes,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsudden transformation of a fair far-off ideal of Freedom into the hard\r\nreality of bread-winning and the consequent deification of Bread.\r\n\r\nIn the Black World, the Preacher and Teacher embodied once the ideals\r\nof this people\xe2\x80\x94the strife for another and a juster world, the vague\r\ndream of righteousness, the mystery of knowing; but to-day the danger\r\nis that these ideals, with their simple beauty and weird inspiration,\r\nwill suddenly sink to a question of cash and a lust for gold. Here\r\nstands this black young Atalanta, girding herself for the race that\r\nmust be run; and if her eyes be still toward the hills and sky as in\r\nthe days of old, then we may look for noble running; but what if some\r\nruthless or wily or even thoughtless Hippomenes lay golden apples\r\nbefore her? What if the Negro people be wooed from a strife for\r\nrighteousness, from a love of knowing, to regard dollars as the be-all\r\nand end-all of life? What if to the Mammonism of America be added the\r\nrising Mammonism of the re-born South, and the Mammonism of this South\r\nbe reinforced by the budding Mammonism of its half-wakened black\r\nmillions? Whither, then, is the new-world quest of Goodness and Beauty\r\nand Truth gone glimmering? Must this, and that fair flower of Freedom\r\nwhich, despite the jeers of latter-day striplings, sprung from our\r\nfathers\xe2\x80\x99 blood, must that too degenerate into a dusty quest of\r\ngold,\xe2\x80\x94into lawless lust with Hippomenes?\r\n\r\nThe hundred hills of Atlanta are not all crowned with factories. On\r\none, toward the west, the setting sun throws three buildings in bold\r\nrelief against the sky. The beauty of the group lies in its simple\r\nunity:\xe2\x80\x94a broad lawn of green rising from the red street and mingled\r\nroses and peaches; north and south, two plain and stately halls; and in\r\nthe midst, half hidden in ivy, a larger building, boldly graceful,\r\nsparingly decorated, and with one low spire. It is a restful group,\r\n\xe2\x80\x94one never looks for more; it is all here, all intelligible. There I\r\nlive, and there I hear from day to day the low hum of restful life. In\r\nwinter\xe2\x80\x99s twilight, when the red sun glows, I can see the dark figures\r\npass between the halls to the music of the night-bell. In the morning,\r\nwhen the sun is golden, the clang of the day-bell brings the hurry and\r\nlaughter of three hundred young hearts from hall and street, and from\r\nthe busy city below,\xe2\x80\x94children all dark and heavy-haired,\xe2\x80\x94to join their\r\nclear young voices in the music of the morning sacrifice. In a\r\nhalf-dozen class-rooms they gather then,\xe2\x80\x94here to follow the love-song\r\nof Dido, here to listen to the tale of Troy divine; there to wander\r\namong the stars, there to wander among men and nations,\xe2\x80\x94and elsewhere\r\nother well-worn ways of knowing this queer world. Nothing new, no\r\ntime-saving devices,\xe2\x80\x94simply old time-glorified methods of delving for\r\nTruth, and searching out the hidden beauties of life, and learning the\r\ngood of living. The riddle of existence is the college curriculum that\r\nwas laid before the Pharaohs, that was taught in the groves by Plato,\r\nthat formed the _trivium_ and _quadrivium_, and is to-day laid before\r\nthe freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s sons by Atlanta University. And this course of study\r\nwill not change; its methods will grow more deft and effectual, its\r\ncontent richer by toil of scholar and sight of seer; but the true\r\ncollege will ever have one goal,\xe2\x80\x94not to earn meat, but to know the end\r\nand aim of that life which meat nourishes.\r\n\r\nThe vision of life that rises before these dark eyes has in it nothing\r\nmean or selfish. Not at Oxford or at Leipsic, not at Yale or Columbia,\r\nis there an air of higher resolve or more unfettered striving; the\r\ndetermination to realize for men, both black and white, the broadest\r\npossibilities of life, to seek the better and the best, to spread with\r\ntheir own hands the Gospel of Sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x94all this is the burden of\r\ntheir talk and dream. Here, amid a wide desert of caste and\r\nproscription, amid the heart-hurting slights and jars and vagaries of a\r\ndeep race-dislike, lies this green oasis, where hot anger cools, and\r\nthe bitterness of disappointment is sweetened by the springs and\r\nbreezes of Parnassus; and here men may lie and listen, and learn of a\r\nfuture fuller than the past, and hear the voice of Time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThey made their mistakes, those who planted Fisk and Howard and Atlanta\r\nbefore the smoke of battle had lifted; they made their mistakes, but\r\nthose mistakes were not the things at which we lately laughed somewhat\r\nuproariously. They were right when they sought to found a new\r\neducational system upon the University: where, forsooth, shall we\r\nground knowledge save on the broadest and deepest knowledge? The roots\r\nof the tree, rather than the leaves, are the sources of its life; and\r\nfrom the dawn of history, from Academus to Cambridge, the culture of\r\nthe University has been the broad foundation-stone on which is built\r\nthe kindergarten\xe2\x80\x99s A B C.\r\n\r\nBut these builders did make a mistake in minimizing the gravity of the\r\nproblem before them; in thinking it a matter of years and decades; in\r\ntherefore building quickly and laying their foundation carelessly, and\r\nlowering the standard of knowing, until they had scattered haphazard\r\nthrough the South some dozen poorly equipped high schools and miscalled\r\nthem universities. They forgot, too, just as their successors are\r\nforgetting, the rule of inequality:\xe2\x80\x94that of the million black youth,\r\nsome were fitted to know and some to dig; that some had the talent and\r\ncapacity of university men, and some the talent and capacity of\r\nblacksmiths; and that true training meant neither that all should be\r\ncollege men nor all artisans, but that the one should be made a\r\nmissionary of culture to an untaught people, and the other a free\r\nworkman among serfs. And to seek to make the blacksmith a scholar is\r\nalmost as silly as the more modern scheme of making the scholar a\r\nblacksmith; almost, but not quite.\r\n\r\nThe function of the university is not simply to teach bread-winning, or\r\nto furnish teachers for the public schools or to be a centre of polite\r\nsociety; it is, above all, to be the organ of that fine adjustment\r\nbetween real life and the growing knowledge of life, an adjustment\r\nwhich forms the secret of civilization. Such an institution the South\r\nof to-day sorely needs. She has religion, earnest, bigoted:\xe2\x80\x94religion\r\nthat on both sides the Veil often omits the sixth, seventh, and eighth\r\ncommandments, but substitutes a dozen supplementary ones. She has, as\r\nAtlanta shows, growing thrift and love of toil; but she lacks that\r\nbroad knowledge of what the world knows and knew of human living and\r\ndoing, which she may apply to the thousand problems of real life to-day\r\nconfronting her. The need of the South is knowledge and culture,\xe2\x80\x94not in\r\ndainty limited quantity, as before the war, but in broad busy abundance\r\nin the world of work; and until she has this, not all the Apples of\r\nHesperides, be they golden and bejewelled, can save her from the curse\r\nof the Boeotian lovers.\r\n\r\nThe Wings of Atalanta are the coming universities of the South. They\r\nalone can bear the maiden past the temptation of golden fruit. They\r\nwill not guide her flying feet away from the cotton and gold; for\xe2\x80\x94ah,\r\nthoughtful Hippomenes!\xe2\x80\x94do not the apples lie in the very Way of Life?\r\nBut they will guide her over and beyond them, and leave her kneeling in\r\nthe Sanctuary of Truth and Freedom and broad Humanity, virgin and\r\nundefiled. Sadly did the Old South err in human education, despising\r\nthe education of the masses, and niggardly in the support of colleges.\r\nHer ancient university foundations dwindled and withered under the foul\r\nbreath of slavery; and even since the war they have fought a failing\r\nfight for life in the tainted air of social unrest and commercial\r\nselfishness, stunted by the death of criticism, and starving for lack\r\nof broadly cultured men. And if this is the white South\xe2\x80\x99s need and\r\ndanger, how much heavier the danger and need of the freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s sons!\r\nhow pressing here the need of broad ideals and true culture, the\r\nconservation of soul from sordid aims and petty passions! Let us build\r\nthe Southern university\xe2\x80\x94William and Mary, Trinity, Georgia, Texas,\r\nTulane, Vanderbilt, and the others\xe2\x80\x94fit to live; let us build, too, the\r\nNegro universities:\xe2\x80\x94Fisk, whose foundation was ever broad; Howard, at\r\nthe heart of the Nation; Atlanta at Atlanta, whose ideal of scholarship\r\nhas been held above the temptation of numbers. Why not here, and\r\nperhaps elsewhere, plant deeply and for all time centres of learning\r\nand living, colleges that yearly would send into the life of the South\r\na few white men and a few black men of broad culture, catholic\r\ntolerance, and trained ability, joining their hands to other hands, and\r\ngiving to this squabble of the Races a decent and dignified peace?\r\n\r\nPatience, Humility, Manners, and Taste, common schools and\r\nkindergartens, industrial and technical schools, literature and\r\ntolerance,\xe2\x80\x94all these spring from knowledge and culture, the children of\r\nthe university. So must men and nations build, not otherwise, not\r\nupside down.\r\n\r\nTeach workers to work,\xe2\x80\x94a wise saying; wise when applied to German boys\r\nand American girls; wiser when said of Negro boys, for they have less\r\nknowledge of working and none to teach them. Teach thinkers to think,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nneeded knowledge in a day of loose and careless logic; and they whose\r\nlot is gravest must have the carefulest training to think aright. If\r\nthese things are so, how foolish to ask what is the best education for\r\none or seven or sixty million souls! shall we teach them trades, or\r\ntrain them in liberal arts? Neither and both: teach the workers to work\r\nand the thinkers to think; make carpenters of carpenters, and\r\nphilosophers of philosophers, and fops of fools. Nor can we pause here.\r\nWe are training not isolated men but a living group of men,\xe2\x80\x94nay, a\r\ngroup within a group. And the final product of our training must be\r\nneither a psychologist nor a brickmason, but a man. And to make men, we\r\nmust have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living,\xe2\x80\x94not sordid\r\nmoney-getting, not apples of gold. The worker must work for the glory\r\nof his handiwork, not simply for pay; the thinker must think for truth,\r\nnot for fame. And all this is gained only by human strife and longing;\r\nby ceaseless training and education; by founding Right on righteousness\r\nand Truth on the unhampered search for Truth; by founding the common\r\nschool on the university, and the industrial school on the common\r\nschool; and weaving thus a system, not a distortion, and bringing a\r\nbirth, not an abortion.\r\n\r\nWhen night falls on the City of a Hundred Hills, a wind gathers itself\r\nfrom the seas and comes murmuring westward. And at its bidding, the\r\nsmoke of the drowsy factories sweeps down upon the mighty city and\r\ncovers it like a pall, while yonder at the University the stars twinkle\r\nabove Stone Hall. And they say that yon gray mist is the tunic of\r\nAtalanta pausing over her golden apples. Fly, my maiden, fly, for\r\nyonder comes Hippomenes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nOf the Training of Black Men\r\n\r\nWhy, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,\r\nAnd naked on the Air of Heaven ride,\r\n    Were\xe2\x80\x99t not a Shame\xe2\x80\x94were\xe2\x80\x99t not a Shame for him\r\nIn this clay carcase crippled to abide?\r\n\r\nOMAR KHAYY\xc3\x81M (FITZGERALD).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the shimmering swirl of waters where many, many thoughts ago the\r\nslave-ship first saw the square tower of Jamestown, have flowed down to\r\nour day three streams of thinking: one swollen from the larger world\r\nhere and overseas, saying, the multiplying of human wants in\r\nculture-lands calls for the world-wide cooperation of men in satisfying\r\nthem. Hence arises a new human unity, pulling the ends of earth nearer,\r\nand all men, black, yellow, and white. The larger humanity strives to\r\nfeel in this contact of living Nations and sleeping hordes a thrill of\r\nnew life in the world, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the contact of Life and Sleep be\r\nDeath, shame on such Life.\xe2\x80\x9d To be sure, behind this thought lurks the\r\nafterthought of force and dominion,\xe2\x80\x94the making of brown men to delve\r\nwhen the temptation of beads and red calico cloys.\r\n\r\nThe second thought streaming from the death-ship and the curving river\r\nis the thought of the older South,\xe2\x80\x94the sincere and passionate belief\r\nthat somewhere between men and cattle, God created a _tertium quid_,\r\nand called it a Negro,\xe2\x80\x94a clownish, simple creature, at times even\r\nlovable within its limitations, but straitly foreordained to walk\r\nwithin the Veil. To be sure, behind the thought lurks the\r\nafterthought,\xe2\x80\x94some of them with favoring chance might become men, but\r\nin sheer self-defence we dare not let them, and we build about them\r\nwalls so high, and hang between them and the light a veil so thick,\r\nthat they shall not even think of breaking through.\r\n\r\nAnd last of all there trickles down that third and darker thought,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nthought of the things themselves, the confused, half-conscious mutter\r\nof men who are black and whitened, crying \xe2\x80\x9cLiberty, Freedom,\r\nOpportunity\xe2\x80\x94vouchsafe to us, O boastful World, the chance of living\r\nmen!\xe2\x80\x9d To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought,\xe2\x80\x94suppose,\r\nafter all, the World is right and we are less than men? Suppose this\r\nmad impulse within is all wrong, some mock mirage from the untrue?\r\n\r\nSo here we stand among thoughts of human unity, even through conquest\r\nand slavery; the inferiority of black men, even if forced by fraud; a\r\nshriek in the night for the freedom of men who themselves are not yet\r\nsure of their right to demand it. This is the tangle of thought and\r\nafterthought wherein we are called to solve the problem of training men\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nBehind all its curiousness, so attractive alike to sage and\r\n_dilettante_, lie its dim dangers, throwing across us shadows at once\r\ngrotesque and awful. Plain it is to us that what the world seeks\r\nthrough desert and wild we have within our threshold,\xe2\x80\x94a stalwart\r\nlaboring force, suited to the semi-tropics; if, deaf to the voice of\r\nthe Zeitgeist, we refuse to use and develop these men, we risk poverty\r\nand loss. If, on the other hand, seized by the brutal afterthought, we\r\ndebauch the race thus caught in our talons, selfishly sucking their\r\nblood and brains in the future as in the past, what shall save us from\r\nnational decadence? Only that saner selfishness, which Education\r\nteaches, can find the rights of all in the whirl of work.\r\n\r\nAgain, we may decry the color-prejudice of the South, yet it remains a\r\nheavy fact. Such curious kinks of the human mind exist and must be\r\nreckoned with soberly. They cannot be laughed away, nor always\r\nsuccessfully stormed at, nor easily abolished by act of legislature.\r\nAnd yet they must not be encouraged by being let alone. They must be\r\nrecognized as facts, but unpleasant facts; things that stand in the way\r\nof civilization and religion and common decency. They can be met in but\r\none way,\xe2\x80\x94by the breadth and broadening of human reason, by catholicity\r\nof taste and culture. And so, too, the native ambition and aspiration\r\nof men, even though they be black, backward, and ungraceful, must not\r\nlightly be dealt with. To stimulate wildly weak and untrained minds is\r\nto play with mighty fires; to flout their striving idly is to welcome a\r\nharvest of brutish crime and shameless lethargy in our very laps. The\r\nguiding of thought and the deft coordination of deed is at once the\r\npath of honor and humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in this great question of reconciling three vast and partially\r\ncontradictory streams of thought, the one panacea of Education leaps to\r\nthe lips of all:\xe2\x80\x94such human training as will best use the labor of all\r\nmen without enslaving or brutalizing; such training as will give us\r\npoise to encourage the prejudices that bulwark society, and to stamp\r\nout those that in sheer barbarity deafen us to the wail of prisoned\r\nsouls within the Veil, and the mounting fury of shackled men.\r\n\r\nBut when we have vaguely said that Education will set this tangle\r\nstraight, what have we uttered but a truism? Training for life teaches\r\nliving; but what training for the profitable living together of black\r\nmen and white? A hundred and fifty years ago our task would have seemed\r\neasier. Then Dr. Johnson blandly assured us that education was needful\r\nsolely for the embellishments of life, and was useless for ordinary\r\nvermin. To-day we have climbed to heights where we would open at least\r\nthe outer courts of knowledge to all, display its treasures to many,\r\nand select the few to whom its mystery of Truth is revealed, not wholly\r\nby birth or the accidents of the stock market, but at least in part\r\naccording to deftness and aim, talent and character. This programme,\r\nhowever, we are sorely puzzled in carrying out through that part of the\r\nland where the blight of slavery fell hardest, and where we are dealing\r\nwith two backward peoples. To make here in human education that ever\r\nnecessary combination of the permanent and the contingent\xe2\x80\x94of the ideal\r\nand the practical in workable equilibrium\xe2\x80\x94has been there, as it ever\r\nmust be in every age and place, a matter of infinite experiment and\r\nfrequent mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn rough approximation we may point out four varying decades of work in\r\nSouthern education since the Civil War. From the close of the war until\r\n1876, was the period of uncertain groping and temporary relief. There\r\nwere army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBureau in chaotic disarrangement seeking system and co-operation. Then\r\nfollowed ten years of constructive definite effort toward the building\r\nof complete school systems in the South. Normal schools and colleges\r\nwere founded for the freedmen, and teachers trained there to man the\r\npublic schools. There was the inevitable tendency of war to\r\nunderestimate the prejudices of the master and the ignorance of the\r\nslave, and all seemed clear sailing out of the wreckage of the storm.\r\nMeantime, starting in this decade yet especially developing from 1885\r\nto 1895, began the industrial revolution of the South. The land saw\r\nglimpses of a new destiny and the stirring of new ideals. The\r\neducational system striving to complete itself saw new obstacles and a\r\nfield of work ever broader and deeper. The Negro colleges, hurriedly\r\nfounded, were inadequately equipped, illogically distributed, and of\r\nvarying efficiency and grade; the normal and high schools were doing\r\nlittle more than common-school work, and the common schools were\r\ntraining but a third of the children who ought to be in them, and\r\ntraining these too often poorly. At the same time the white South, by\r\nreason of its sudden conversion from the slavery ideal, by so much the\r\nmore became set and strengthened in its racial prejudice, and\r\ncrystallized it into harsh law and harsher custom; while the marvellous\r\npushing forward of the poor white daily threatened to take even bread\r\nand butter from the mouths of the heavily handicapped sons of the\r\nfreedmen. In the midst, then, of the larger problem of Negro education\r\nsprang up the more practical question of work, the inevitable economic\r\nquandary that faces a people in the transition from slavery to freedom,\r\nand especially those who make that change amid hate and prejudice,\r\nlawlessness and ruthless competition.\r\n\r\nThe industrial school springing to notice in this decade, but coming to\r\nfull recognition in the decade beginning with 1895, was the proffered\r\nanswer to this combined educational and economic crisis, and an answer\r\nof singular wisdom and timeliness. From the very first in nearly all\r\nthe schools some attention had been given to training in handiwork, but\r\nnow was this training first raised to a dignity that brought it in\r\ndirect touch with the South\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent industrial development, and\r\ngiven an emphasis which reminded black folk that before the Temple of\r\nKnowledge swing the Gates of Toil.\r\n\r\nYet after all they are but gates, and when turning our eyes from the\r\ntemporary and the contingent in the Negro problem to the broader\r\nquestion of the permanent uplifting and civilization of black men in\r\nAmerica, we have a right to inquire, as this enthusiasm for material\r\nadvancement mounts to its height, if after all the industrial school is\r\nthe final and sufficient answer in the training of the Negro race; and\r\nto ask gently, but in all sincerity, the ever-recurring query of the\r\nages, Is not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment? And\r\nmen ask this to-day all the more eagerly because of sinister signs in\r\nrecent educational movements. The tendency is here, born of slavery and\r\nquickened to renewed life by the crazy imperialism of the day, to\r\nregard human beings as among the material resources of a land to be\r\ntrained with an eye single to future dividends. Race-prejudices, which\r\nkeep brown and black men in their \xe2\x80\x9cplaces,\xe2\x80\x9d we are coming to regard as\r\nuseful allies with such a theory, no matter how much they may dull the\r\nambition and sicken the hearts of struggling human beings. And above\r\nall, we daily hear that an education that encourages aspiration, that\r\nsets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character\r\nrather than bread-winning, is the privilege of white men and the danger\r\nand delusion of black.\r\n\r\nEspecially has criticism been directed against the former educational\r\nefforts to aid the Negro. In the four periods I have mentioned, we find\r\nfirst, boundless, planless enthusiasm and sacrifice; then the\r\npreparation of teachers for a vast public-school system; then the\r\nlaunching and expansion of that school system amid increasing\r\ndifficulties; and finally the training of workmen for the new and\r\ngrowing industries. This development has been sharply ridiculed as a\r\nlogical anomaly and flat reversal of nature. Soothly we have been told\r\nthat first industrial and manual training should have taught the Negro\r\nto work, then simple schools should have taught him to read and write,\r\nand finally, after years, high and normal schools could have completed\r\nthe system, as intelligence and wealth demanded.\r\n\r\nThat a system logically so complete was historically impossible, it\r\nneeds but a little thought to prove. Progress in human affairs is more\r\noften a pull than a push, a surging forward of the exceptional man, and\r\nthe lifting of his duller brethren slowly and painfully to his\r\nvantage-ground. Thus it was no accident that gave birth to universities\r\ncenturies before the common schools, that made fair Harvard the first\r\nflower of our wilderness. So in the South: the mass of the freedmen at\r\nthe end of the war lacked the intelligence so necessary to modern\r\nworkingmen. They must first have the common school to teach them to\r\nread, write, and cipher; and they must have higher schools to teach\r\nteachers for the common schools. The white teachers who flocked South\r\nwent to establish such a common-school system. Few held the idea of\r\nfounding colleges; most of them at first would have laughed at the\r\nidea. But they faced, as all men since them have faced, that central\r\nparadox of the South,\xe2\x80\x94the social separation of the races. At that time\r\nit was the sudden volcanic rupture of nearly all relations between\r\nblack and white, in work and government and family life. Since then a\r\nnew adjustment of relations in economic and political affairs has grown\r\nup,\xe2\x80\x94an adjustment subtle and difficult to grasp, yet singularly\r\ningenious, which leaves still that frightful chasm at the color-line\r\nacross which men pass at their peril. Thus, then and now, there stand\r\nin the South two separate worlds; and separate not simply in the higher\r\nrealms of social intercourse, but also in church and school, on railway\r\nand street-car, in hotels and theatres, in streets and city sections,\r\nin books and newspapers, in asylums and jails, in hospitals and\r\ngraveyards. There is still enough of contact for large economic and\r\ngroup cooperation, but the separation is so thorough and deep that it\r\nabsolutely precludes for the present between the races anything like\r\nthat sympathetic and effective group-training and leadership of the one\r\nby the other, such as the American Negro and all backward peoples must\r\nhave for effectual progress.\r\n\r\nThis the missionaries of \xe2\x80\x9968 soon saw; and if effective industrial and\r\ntrade schools were impracticable before the establishment of a\r\ncommon-school system, just as certainly no adequate common schools\r\ncould be founded until there were teachers to teach them. Southern\r\nwhites would not teach them; Northern whites in sufficient numbers\r\ncould not be had. If the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself, and\r\nthe most effective help that could be given him was the establishment\r\nof schools to train Negro teachers. This conclusion was slowly but\r\nsurely reached by every student of the situation until simultaneously,\r\nin widely separated regions, without consultation or systematic plan,\r\nthere arose a series of institutions designed to furnish teachers for\r\nthe untaught. Above the sneers of critics at the obvious defects of\r\nthis procedure must ever stand its one crushing rejoinder: in a single\r\ngeneration they put thirty thousand black teachers in the South; they\r\nwiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black people of the\r\nland, and they made Tuskegee possible.\r\n\r\nSuch higher training-schools tended naturally to deepen broader\r\ndevelopment: at first they were common and grammar schools, then some\r\nbecame high schools. And finally, by 1900, some thirty-four had one\r\nyear or more of studies of college grade. This development was reached\r\nwith different degrees of speed in different institutions: Hampton is\r\nstill a high school, while Fisk University started her college in 1871,\r\nand Spelman Seminary about 1896. In all cases the aim was identical,\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nmaintain the standards of the lower training by giving teachers and\r\nleaders the best practicable training; and above all, to furnish the\r\nblack world with adequate standards of human culture and lofty ideals\r\nof life. It was not enough that the teachers of teachers should be\r\ntrained in technical normal methods; they must also, so far as\r\npossible, be broad-minded, cultured men and women, to scatter\r\ncivilization among a people whose ignorance was not simply of letters,\r\nbut of life itself.\r\n\r\nIt can thus be seen that the work of education in the South began with\r\nhigher institutions of training, which threw off as their foliage\r\ncommon schools, and later industrial schools, and at the same time\r\nstrove to shoot their roots ever deeper toward college and university\r\ntraining. That this was an inevitable and necessary development, sooner\r\nor later, goes without saying; but there has been, and still is, a\r\nquestion in many minds if the natural growth was not forced, and if the\r\nhigher training was not either overdone or done with cheap and unsound\r\nmethods. Among white Southerners this feeling is widespread and\r\npositive. A prominent Southern journal voiced this in a recent\r\neditorial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe experiment that has been made to give the colored students\r\nclassical training has not been satisfactory. Even though many were\r\nable to pursue the course, most of them did so in a parrot-like way,\r\nlearning what was taught, but not seeming to appropriate the truth and\r\nimport of their instruction, and graduating without sensible aim or\r\nvaluable occupation for their future. The whole scheme has proved a\r\nwaste of time, efforts, and the money of the state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile most fair-minded men would recognize this as extreme and\r\noverdrawn, still without doubt many are asking, Are there a sufficient\r\nnumber of Negroes ready for college training to warrant the\r\nundertaking? Are not too many students prematurely forced into this\r\nwork? Does it not have the effect of dissatisfying the young Negro with\r\nhis environment? And do these graduates succeed in real life? Such\r\nnatural questions cannot be evaded, nor on the other hand must a Nation\r\nnaturally skeptical as to Negro ability assume an unfavorable answer\r\nwithout careful inquiry and patient openness to conviction. We must not\r\nforget that most Americans answer all queries regarding the Negro a\r\npriori, and that the least that human courtesy can do is to listen to\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the higher education of the Negro would be the last to\r\ndeny the incompleteness and glaring defects of the present system: too\r\nmany institutions have attempted to do college work, the work in some\r\ncases has not been thoroughly done, and quantity rather than quality\r\nhas sometimes been sought. But all this can be said of higher education\r\nthroughout the land; it is the almost inevitable incident of\r\neducational growth, and leaves the deeper question of the legitimate\r\ndemand for the higher training of Negroes untouched. And this latter\r\nquestion can be settled in but one way,\xe2\x80\x94by a first-hand study of the\r\nfacts. If we leave out of view all institutions which have not actually\r\ngraduated students from a course higher than that of a New England high\r\nschool, even though they be called colleges; if then we take the\r\nthirty-four remaining institutions, we may clear up many\r\nmisapprehensions by asking searchingly, What kind of institutions are\r\nthey? what do they teach? and what sort of men do they graduate?\r\n\r\nAnd first we may say that this type of college, including Atlanta,\r\nFisk, and Howard, Wilberforce and Claflin, Shaw, and the rest, is\r\npeculiar, almost unique. Through the shining trees that whisper before\r\nme as I write, I catch glimpses of a boulder of New England granite,\r\ncovering a grave, which graduates of Atlanta University have placed\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGRATEFUL MEMORY OF THEIR FORMER TEACHER AND FRIEND AND OF THE\r\nUNSELFISH LIFE HE LIVED, AND THE NOBLE WORK HE WROUGHT; THAT THEY,\r\nTHEIR CHILDREN, AND THEIR CHILDREN\xe2\x80\x99S CHILDREN MIGHT BE BLESSED.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the gift of New England to the freed Negro: not alms, but a\r\nfriend; not cash, but character. It was not and is not money these\r\nseething millions want, but love and sympathy, the pulse of hearts\r\nbeating with red blood;\xe2\x80\x94a gift which to-day only their own kindred and\r\nrace can bring to the masses, but which once saintly souls brought to\r\ntheir favored children in the crusade of the sixties, that finest thing\r\nin American history, and one of the few things untainted by sordid\r\ngreed and cheap vainglory. The teachers in these institutions came not\r\nto keep the Negroes in their place, but to raise them out of the\r\ndefilement of the places where slavery had wallowed them. The colleges\r\nthey founded were social settlements; homes where the best of the sons\r\nof the freedmen came in close and sympathetic touch with the best\r\ntraditions of New England. They lived and ate together, studied and\r\nworked, hoped and harkened in the dawning light. In actual formal\r\ncontent their curriculum was doubtless old-fashioned, but in\r\neducational power it was supreme, for it was the contact of living\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nFrom such schools about two thousand Negroes have gone forth with the\r\nbachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree. The number in itself is enough to put at rest the\r\nargument that too large a proportion of Negroes are receiving higher\r\ntraining. If the ratio to population of all Negro students throughout\r\nthe land, in both college and secondary training, be counted,\r\nCommissioner Harris assures us \xe2\x80\x9cit must be increased to five times its\r\npresent average\xe2\x80\x9d to equal the average of the land.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the ability of Negro students in any appreciable\r\nnumbers to master a modern college course would have been difficult to\r\nprove. To-day it is proved by the fact that four hundred Negroes, many\r\nof whom have been reported as brilliant students, have received the\r\nbachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree from Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, and seventy other\r\nleading colleges. Here we have, then, nearly twenty-five hundred Negro\r\ngraduates, of whom the crucial query must be made, How far did their\r\ntraining fit them for life? It is of course extremely difficult to\r\ncollect satisfactory data on such a point,\xe2\x80\x94difficult to reach the men,\r\nto get trustworthy testimony, and to gauge that testimony by any\r\ngenerally acceptable criterion of success. In 1900, the Conference at\r\nAtlanta University undertook to study these graduates, and published\r\nthe results. First they sought to know what these graduates were doing,\r\nand succeeded in getting answers from nearly two-thirds of the living.\r\nThe direct testimony was in almost all cases corroborated by the\r\nreports of the colleges where they graduated, so that in the main the\r\nreports were worthy of credence. Fifty-three per cent of these\r\ngraduates were teachers,\xe2\x80\x94presidents of institutions, heads of normal\r\nschools, principals of city school-systems, and the like. Seventeen per\r\ncent were clergymen; another seventeen per cent were in the\r\nprofessions, chiefly as physicians. Over six per cent were merchants,\r\nfarmers, and artisans, and four per cent were in the government\r\ncivil-service. Granting even that a considerable proportion of the\r\nthird unheard from are unsuccessful, this is a record of usefulness.\r\nPersonally I know many hundreds of these graduates, and have\r\ncorresponded with more than a thousand; through others I have followed\r\ncarefully the life-work of scores; I have taught some of them and some\r\nof the pupils whom they have taught, lived in homes which they have\r\nbuilded, and looked at life through their eyes. Comparing them as a\r\nclass with my fellow students in New England and in Europe, I cannot\r\nhesitate in saying that nowhere have I met men and women with a broader\r\nspirit of helpfulness, with deeper devotion to their life-work, or with\r\nmore consecrated determination to succeed in the face of bitter\r\ndifficulties than among Negro college-bred men. They have, to be sure,\r\ntheir proportion of ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-wells, their pedants and lettered fools,\r\nbut they have a surprisingly small proportion of them; they have not\r\nthat culture of manner which we instinctively associate with university\r\nmen, forgetting that in reality it is the heritage from cultured homes,\r\nand that no people a generation removed from slavery can escape a\r\ncertain unpleasant rawness and gaucherie, despite the best of training.\r\n\r\nWith all their larger vision and deeper sensibility, these men have\r\nusually been conservative, careful leaders. They have seldom been\r\nagitators, have withstood the temptation to head the mob, and have\r\nworked steadily and faithfully in a thousand communities in the South.\r\nAs teachers, they have given the South a commendable system of city\r\nschools and large numbers of private normal-schools and academies.\r\nColored college-bred men have worked side by side with white college\r\ngraduates at Hampton; almost from the beginning the backbone of\r\nTuskegee\xe2\x80\x99s teaching force has been formed of graduates from Fisk and\r\nAtlanta. And to-day the institute is filled with college graduates,\r\nfrom the energetic wife of the principal down to the teacher of\r\nagriculture, including nearly half of the executive council and a\r\nmajority of the heads of departments. In the professions, college men\r\nare slowly but surely leavening the Negro church, are healing and\r\npreventing the devastations of disease, and beginning to furnish legal\r\nprotection for the liberty and property of the toiling masses. All this\r\nis needful work. Who would do it if Negroes did not? How could Negroes\r\ndo it if they were not trained carefully for it? If white people need\r\ncolleges to furnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, do black\r\npeople need nothing of the sort?\r\n\r\nIf it is true that there are an appreciable number of Negro youth in\r\nthe land capable by character and talent to receive that higher\r\ntraining, the end of which is culture, and if the two and a half\r\nthousand who have had something of this training in the past have in\r\nthe main proved themselves useful to their race and generation, the\r\nquestion then comes, What place in the future development of the South\r\nought the Negro college and college-bred man to occupy? That the\r\npresent social separation and acute race-sensitiveness must eventually\r\nyield to the influences of culture, as the South grows civilized, is\r\nclear. But such transformation calls for singular wisdom and patience.\r\nIf, while the healing of this vast sore is progressing, the races are\r\nto live for many years side by side, united in economic effort, obeying\r\na common government, sensitive to mutual thought and feeling, yet\r\nsubtly and silently separate in many matters of deeper human\r\nintimacy,\xe2\x80\x94if this unusual and dangerous development is to progress amid\r\npeace and order, mutual respect and growing intelligence, it will call\r\nfor social surgery at once the delicatest and nicest in modern history.\r\nIt will demand broad-minded, upright men, both white and black, and in\r\nits final accomplishment American civilization will triumph. So far as\r\nwhite men are concerned, this fact is to-day being recognized in the\r\nSouth, and a happy renaissance of university education seems imminent.\r\nBut the very voices that cry hail to this good work are, strange to\r\nrelate, largely silent or antagonistic to the higher education of the\r\nNegro.\r\n\r\nStrange to relate! for this is certain, no secure civilization can be\r\nbuilt in the South with the Negro as an ignorant, turbulent\r\nproletariat. Suppose we seek to remedy this by making them laborers and\r\nnothing more: they are not fools, they have tasted of the Tree of Life,\r\nand they will not cease to think, will not cease attempting to read the\r\nriddle of the world. By taking away their best equipped teachers and\r\nleaders, by slamming the door of opportunity in the faces of their\r\nbolder and brighter minds, will you make them satisfied with their lot?\r\nor will you not rather transfer their leading from the hands of men\r\ntaught to think to the hands of untrained demagogues? We ought not to\r\nforget that despite the pressure of poverty, and despite the active\r\ndiscouragement and even ridicule of friends, the demand for higher\r\ntraining steadily increases among Negro youth: there were, in the years\r\nfrom 1875 to 1880, 22 Negro graduates from Northern colleges; from 1885\r\nto 1890 there were 43, and from 1895 to 1900, nearly 100 graduates.\r\nFrom Southern Negro colleges there were, in the same three periods,\r\n143, 413, and over 500 graduates. Here, then, is the plain thirst for\r\ntraining; by refusing to give this Talented Tenth the key to knowledge,\r\ncan any sane man imagine that they will lightly lay aside their\r\nyearning and contentedly become hewers of wood and drawers of water?\r\n\r\nNo. The dangerously clear logic of the Negro\xe2\x80\x99s position will more and\r\nmore loudly assert itself in that day when increasing wealth and more\r\nintricate social organization preclude the South from being, as it so\r\nlargely is, simply an armed camp for intimidating black folk. Such\r\nwaste of energy cannot be spared if the South is to catch up with\r\ncivilization. And as the black third of the land grows in thrift and\r\nskill, unless skilfully guided in its larger philosophy, it must more\r\nand more brood over the red past and the creeping, crooked present,\r\nuntil it grasps a gospel of revolt and revenge and throws its new-found\r\nenergies athwart the current of advance. Even to-day the masses of the\r\nNegroes see all too clearly the anomalies of their position and the\r\nmoral crookedness of yours. You may marshal strong indictments against\r\nthem, but their counter-cries, lacking though they be in formal logic,\r\nhave burning truths within them which you may not wholly ignore, O\r\nSouthern Gentlemen! If you deplore their presence here, they ask, Who\r\nbrought us? When you cry, Deliver us from the vision of intermarriage,\r\nthey answer that legal marriage is infinitely better than systematic\r\nconcubinage and prostitution. And if in just fury you accuse their\r\nvagabonds of violating women, they also in fury quite as just may\r\nreply: The rape which your gentlemen have done against helpless black\r\nwomen in defiance of your own laws is written on the foreheads of two\r\nmillions of mulattoes, and written in ineffaceable blood. And finally,\r\nwhen you fasten crime upon this race as its peculiar trait, they answer\r\nthat slavery was the arch-crime, and lynching and lawlessness its twin\r\nabortions; that color and race are not crimes, and yet it is they which\r\nin this land receive most unceasing condemnation, North, East, South,\r\nand West.\r\n\r\nI will not say such arguments are wholly justified,\xe2\x80\x94I will not insist\r\nthat there is no other side to the shield; but I do say that of the\r\nnine millions of Negroes in this nation, there is scarcely one out of\r\nthe cradle to whom these arguments do not daily present themselves in\r\nthe guise of terrible truth. I insist that the question of the future\r\nis how best to keep these millions from brooding over the wrongs of the\r\npast and the difficulties of the present, so that all their energies\r\nmay be bent toward a cheerful striving and cooperation with their white\r\nneighbors toward a larger, juster, and fuller future. That one wise\r\nmethod of doing this lies in the closer knitting of the Negro to the\r\ngreat industrial possibilities of the South is a great truth. And this\r\nthe common schools and the manual training and trade schools are\r\nworking to accomplish. But these alone are not enough. The foundations\r\nof knowledge in this race, as in others, must be sunk deep in the\r\ncollege and university if we would build a solid, permanent structure.\r\nInternal problems of social advance must inevitably come, \xe2\x80\x94problems of\r\nwork and wages, of families and homes, of morals and the true valuing\r\nof the things of life; and all these and other inevitable problems of\r\ncivilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for himself, by\r\nreason of his isolation; and can there be any possible solution other\r\nthan by study and thought and an appeal to the rich experience of the\r\npast? Is there not, with such a group and in such a crisis, infinitely\r\nmore danger to be apprehended from half-trained minds and shallow\r\nthinking than from over-education and over-refinement? Surely we have\r\nwit enough to found a Negro college so manned and equipped as to steer\r\nsuccessfully between the _dilettante_ and the fool. We shall hardly\r\ninduce black men to believe that if their stomachs be full, it matters\r\nlittle about their brains. They already dimly perceive that the paths\r\nof peace winding between honest toil and dignified manhood call for the\r\nguidance of skilled thinkers, the loving, reverent comradeship between\r\nthe black lowly and the black men emancipated by training and culture.\r\n\r\nThe function of the Negro college, then, is clear: it must maintain the\r\nstandards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of\r\nthe Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact\r\nand cooperation. And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men.\r\nAbove our modern socialism, and out of the worship of the mass, must\r\npersist and evolve that higher individualism which the centres of\r\nculture protect; there must come a loftier respect for the sovereign\r\nhuman soul that seeks to know itself and the world about it; that seeks\r\na freedom for expansion and self-development; that will love and hate\r\nand labor in its own way, untrammeled alike by old and new. Such souls\r\naforetime have inspired and guided worlds, and if we be not wholly\r\nbewitched by our Rhinegold, they shall again. Herein the longing of\r\nblack men must have respect: the rich and bitter depth of their\r\nexperience, the unknown treasures of their inner life, the strange\r\nrendings of nature they have seen, may give the world new points of\r\nview and make their loving, living, and doing precious to all human\r\nhearts. And to themselves in these the days that try their souls, the\r\nchance to soar in the dim blue air above the smoke is to their finer\r\nspirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black.\r\n\r\nI sit with Shakespeare and he winces not. Across the color line I move\r\narm in arm with Balzac and Dumas, where smiling men and welcoming women\r\nglide in gilded halls. From out the caves of evening that swing between\r\nthe strong-limbed earth and the tracery of the stars, I summon\r\nAristotle and Aurelius and what soul I will, and they come all\r\ngraciously with no scorn nor condescension. So, wed with Truth, I dwell\r\nabove the Veil. Is this the life you grudge us, O knightly America? Is\r\nthis the life you long to change into the dull red hideousness of\r\nGeorgia? Are you so afraid lest peering from this high Pisgah, between\r\nPhilistine and Amalekite, we sight the Promised Land?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nOf the Black Belt\r\n\r\nI am black but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,\r\nAs the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.\r\nLook not upon me, because I am black,\r\nBecause the sun hath looked upon me:\r\nMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s children were angry with me;\r\nThey made me the keeper of the vineyards;\r\nBut mine own vineyard have I not kept.\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF SOLOMON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of the North the train thundered, and we woke to see the crimson\r\nsoil of Georgia stretching away bare and monotonous right and left.\r\nHere and there lay straggling, unlovely villages, and lean men loafed\r\nleisurely at the depots; then again came the stretch of pines and clay.\r\nYet we did not nod, nor weary of the scene; for this is historic\r\nground. Right across our track, three hundred and sixty years ago,\r\nwandered the cavalcade of Hernando de Soto, looking for gold and the\r\nGreat Sea; and he and his foot-sore captives disappeared yonder in the\r\ngrim forests to the west. Here sits Atlanta, the city of a hundred\r\nhills, with something Western, something Southern, and something quite\r\nits own, in its busy life. Just this side Atlanta is the land of the\r\nCherokees and to the southwest, not far from where Sam Hose was\r\ncrucified, you may stand on a spot which is to-day the centre of the\r\nNegro problem,\xe2\x80\x94the centre of those nine million men who are America\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndark heritage from slavery and the slave-trade.\r\n\r\nNot only is Georgia thus the geographical focus of our Negro\r\npopulation, but in many other respects, both now and yesterday, the\r\nNegro problems have seemed to be centered in this State. No other State\r\nin the Union can count a million Negroes among its citizens,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npopulation as large as the slave population of the whole Union in 1800;\r\nno other State fought so long and strenuously to gather this host of\r\nAfricans. Oglethorpe thought slavery against law and gospel; but the\r\ncircumstances which gave Georgia its first inhabitants were not\r\ncalculated to furnish citizens over-nice in their ideas about rum and\r\nslaves. Despite the prohibitions of the trustees, these Georgians, like\r\nsome of their descendants, proceeded to take the law into their own\r\nhands; and so pliant were the judges, and so flagrant the smuggling,\r\nand so earnest were the prayers of Whitefield, that by the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century all restrictions were swept away, and the\r\nslave-trade went merrily on for fifty years and more.\r\n\r\nDown in Darien, where the Delegal riots took place some summers ago,\r\nthere used to come a strong protest against slavery from the Scotch\r\nHighlanders; and the Moravians of Ebenezer did not like the system. But\r\nnot till the Haytian Terror of Toussaint was the trade in men even\r\nchecked; while the national statute of 1808 did not suffice to stop it.\r\nHow the Africans poured in!\xe2\x80\x94fifty thousand between 1790 and 1810, and\r\nthen, from Virginia and from smugglers, two thousand a year for many\r\nyears more. So the thirty thousand Negroes of Georgia in 1790 doubled\r\nin a decade,\xe2\x80\x94were over a hundred thousand in 1810, had reached two\r\nhundred thousand in 1820, and half a million at the time of the war.\r\nThus like a snake the black population writhed upward.\r\n\r\nBut we must hasten on our journey. This that we pass as we near Atlanta\r\nis the ancient land of the Cherokees,\xe2\x80\x94that brave Indian nation which\r\nstrove so long for its fatherland, until Fate and the United States\r\nGovernment drove them beyond the Mississippi. If you wish to ride with\r\nme you must come into the \xe2\x80\x9cJim Crow Car.\xe2\x80\x9d There will be no\r\nobjection,\xe2\x80\x94already four other white men, and a little white girl with\r\nher nurse, are in there. Usually the races are mixed in there; but the\r\nwhite coach is all white. Of course this car is not so good as the\r\nother, but it is fairly clean and comfortable. The discomfort lies\r\nchiefly in the hearts of those four black men yonder\xe2\x80\x94and in mine.\r\n\r\nWe rumble south in quite a business-like way. The bare red clay and\r\npines of Northern Georgia begin to disappear, and in their place\r\nappears a rich rolling land, luxuriant, and here and there well tilled.\r\nThis is the land of the Creek Indians; and a hard time the Georgians\r\nhad to seize it. The towns grow more frequent and more interesting, and\r\nbrand-new cotton mills rise on every side. Below Macon the world grows\r\ndarker; for now we approach the Black Belt,\xe2\x80\x94that strange land of\r\nshadows, at which even slaves paled in the past, and whence come now\r\nonly faint and half-intelligible murmurs to the world beyond. The \xe2\x80\x9cJim\r\nCrow Car\xe2\x80\x9d grows larger and a shade better; three rough field-hands and\r\ntwo or three white loafers accompany us, and the newsboy still spreads\r\nhis wares at one end. The sun is setting, but we can see the great\r\ncotton country as we enter it,\xe2\x80\x94the soil now dark and fertile, now thin\r\nand gray, with fruit-trees and dilapidated buildings,\xe2\x80\x94all the way to\r\nAlbany.\r\n\r\nAt Albany, in the heart of the Black Belt, we stop. Two hundred miles\r\nsouth of Atlanta, two hundred miles west of the Atlantic, and one\r\nhundred miles north of the Great Gulf lies Dougherty County, with ten\r\nthousand Negroes and two thousand whites. The Flint River winds down\r\nfrom Andersonville, and, turning suddenly at Albany, the county-seat,\r\nhurries on to join the Chattahoochee and the sea. Andrew Jackson knew\r\nthe Flint well, and marched across it once to avenge the Indian\r\nMassacre at Fort Mims. That was in 1814, not long before the battle of\r\nNew Orleans; and by the Creek treaty that followed this campaign, all\r\nDougherty County, and much other rich land, was ceded to Georgia.\r\nStill, settlers fought shy of this land, for the Indians were all\r\nabout, and they were unpleasant neighbors in those days. The panic of\r\n1837, which Jackson bequeathed to Van Buren, turned the planters from\r\nthe impoverished lands of Virginia, the Carolinas, and east Georgia,\r\ntoward the West. The Indians were removed to Indian Territory, and\r\nsettlers poured into these coveted lands to retrieve their broken\r\nfortunes. For a radius of a hundred miles about Albany, stretched a\r\ngreat fertile land, luxuriant with forests of pine, oak, ash, hickory,\r\nand poplar; hot with the sun and damp with the rich black swamp-land;\r\nand here the corner-stone of the Cotton Kingdom was laid.\r\n\r\nAlbany is to-day a wide-streeted, placid, Southern town, with a broad\r\nsweep of stores and saloons, and flanking rows of homes,\xe2\x80\x94whites usually\r\nto the north, and blacks to the south. Six days in the week the town\r\nlooks decidedly too small for itself, and takes frequent and prolonged\r\nnaps. But on Saturday suddenly the whole county disgorges itself upon\r\nthe place, and a perfect flood of black peasantry pours through the\r\nstreets, fills the stores, blocks the sidewalks, chokes the\r\nthoroughfares, and takes full possession of the town. They are black,\r\nsturdy, uncouth country folk, good-natured and simple, talkative to a\r\ndegree, and yet far more silent and brooding than the crowds of the\r\nRhine-pfalz, or Naples, or Cracow. They drink considerable quantities\r\nof whiskey, but do not get very drunk; they talk and laugh loudly at\r\ntimes, but seldom quarrel or fight. They walk up and down the streets,\r\nmeet and gossip with friends, stare at the shop windows, buy coffee,\r\ncheap candy, and clothes, and at dusk drive home\xe2\x80\x94happy? well no, not\r\nexactly happy, but much happier than as though they had not come.\r\n\r\nThus Albany is a real capital,\xe2\x80\x94a typical Southern county town, the\r\ncentre of the life of ten thousand souls; their point of contact with\r\nthe outer world, their centre of news and gossip, their market for\r\nbuying and selling, borrowing and lending, their fountain of justice\r\nand law. Once upon a time we knew country life so well and city life so\r\nlittle, that we illustrated city life as that of a closely crowded\r\ncountry district. Now the world has well-nigh forgotten what the\r\ncountry is, and we must imagine a little city of black people scattered\r\nfar and wide over three hundred lonesome square miles of land, without\r\ntrain or trolley, in the midst of cotton and corn, and wide patches of\r\nsand and gloomy soil.\r\n\r\nIt gets pretty hot in Southern Georgia in July,\xe2\x80\x94a sort of dull,\r\ndetermined heat that seems quite independent of the sun; so it took us\r\nsome days to muster courage enough to leave the porch and venture out\r\non the long country roads, that we might see this unknown world.\r\nFinally we started. It was about ten in the morning, bright with a\r\nfaint breeze, and we jogged leisurely southward in the valley of the\r\nFlint. We passed the scattered box-like cabins of the brickyard hands,\r\nand the long tenement-row facetiously called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ark,\xe2\x80\x9d and were soon\r\nin the open country, and on the confines of the great plantations of\r\nother days. There is the \xe2\x80\x9cJoe Fields place\xe2\x80\x9d; a rough old fellow was he,\r\nand had killed many a \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\xe2\x80\x9d in his day. Twelve miles his plantation\r\nused to run,\xe2\x80\x94a regular barony. It is nearly all gone now; only\r\nstraggling bits belong to the family, and the rest has passed to Jews\r\nand Negroes. Even the bits which are left are heavily mortgaged, and,\r\nlike the rest of the land, tilled by tenants. Here is one of them\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x94a tall brown man, a hard worker and a hard drinker, illiterate,\r\nbut versed in farmlore, as his nodding crops declare. This\r\ndistressingly new board house is his, and he has just moved out of\r\nyonder moss-grown cabin with its one square room.\r\n\r\nFrom the curtains in Benton\xe2\x80\x99s house, down the road, a dark comely face\r\nis staring at the strangers; for passing carriages are not every-day\r\noccurrences here. Benton is an intelligent yellow man with a good-sized\r\nfamily, and manages a plantation blasted by the war and now the broken\r\nstaff of the widow. He might be well-to-do, they say; but he carouses\r\ntoo much in Albany. And the half-desolate spirit of neglect born of the\r\nvery soil seems to have settled on these acres. In times past there\r\nwere cotton-gins and machinery here; but they have rotted away.\r\n\r\nThe whole land seems forlorn and forsaken. Here are the remnants of the\r\nvast plantations of the Sheldons, the Pellots, and the Rensons; but the\r\nsouls of them are passed. The houses lie in half ruin, or have wholly\r\ndisappeared; the fences have flown, and the families are wandering in\r\nthe world. Strange vicissitudes have met these whilom masters. Yonder\r\nstretch the wide acres of Bildad Reasor; he died in war-time, but the\r\nupstart overseer hastened to wed the widow. Then he went, and his\r\nneighbors too, and now only the black tenant remains; but the\r\nshadow-hand of the master\xe2\x80\x99s grand-nephew or cousin or creditor\r\nstretches out of the gray distance to collect the rack-rent\r\nremorselessly, and so the land is uncared-for and poor. Only black\r\ntenants can stand such a system, and they only because they must. Ten\r\nmiles we have ridden to-day and have seen no white face.\r\n\r\nA resistless feeling of depression falls slowly upon us, despite the\r\ngaudy sunshine and the green cottonfields. This, then, is the Cotton\r\nKingdom,\xe2\x80\x94the shadow of a marvellous dream. And where is the King?\r\nPerhaps this is he,\xe2\x80\x94the sweating ploughman, tilling his eighty acres\r\nwith two lean mules, and fighting a hard battle with debt. So we sit\r\nmusing, until, as we turn a corner on the sandy road, there comes a\r\nfairer scene suddenly in view,\xe2\x80\x94a neat cottage snugly ensconced by the\r\nroad, and near it a little store. A tall bronzed man rises from the\r\nporch as we hail him, and comes out to our carriage. He is six feet in\r\nheight, with a sober face that smiles gravely. He walks too straight to\r\nbe a tenant,\xe2\x80\x94yes, he owns two hundred and forty acres. \xe2\x80\x9cThe land is run\r\ndown since the boom-days of eighteen hundred and fifty,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains,\r\nand cotton is low. Three black tenants live on his place, and in his\r\nlittle store he keeps a small stock of tobacco, snuff, soap, and soda,\r\nfor the neighborhood. Here is his gin-house with new machinery just\r\ninstalled. Three hundred bales of cotton went through it last year. Two\r\nchildren he has sent away to school. Yes, he says sadly, he is getting\r\non, but cotton is down to four cents; I know how Debt sits staring at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWherever the King may be, the parks and palaces of the Cotton Kingdom\r\nhave not wholly disappeared. We plunge even now into great groves of\r\noak and towering pine, with an undergrowth of myrtle and shrubbery.\r\nThis was the \xe2\x80\x9chome-house\xe2\x80\x9d of the Thompsons,\xe2\x80\x94slave-barons who drove\r\ntheir coach and four in the merry past. All is silence now, and ashes,\r\nand tangled weeds. The owner put his whole fortune into the rising\r\ncotton industry of the fifties, and with the falling prices of the\r\neighties he packed up and stole away. Yonder is another grove, with\r\nunkempt lawn, great magnolias, and grass-grown paths. The Big House\r\nstands in half-ruin, its great front door staring blankly at the\r\nstreet, and the back part grotesquely restored for its black tenant. A\r\nshabby, well-built Negro he is, unlucky and irresolute. He digs hard to\r\npay rent to the white girl who owns the remnant of the place. She\r\nmarried a policeman, and lives in Savannah.\r\n\r\nNow and again we come to churches. Here is one now,\xe2\x80\x94Shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s, they\r\ncall it,\xe2\x80\x94a great whitewashed barn of a thing, perched on stilts of\r\nstone, and looking for all the world as though it were just resting\r\nhere a moment and might be expected to waddle off down the road at\r\nalmost any time. And yet it is the centre of a hundred cabin homes; and\r\nsometimes, of a Sunday, five hundred persons from far and near gather\r\nhere and talk and eat and sing. There is a schoolhouse near,\xe2\x80\x94a very\r\nairy, empty shed; but even this is an improvement, for usually the\r\nschool is held in the church. The churches vary from log-huts to those\r\nlike Shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s, and the schools from nothing to this little house that\r\nsits demurely on the county line. It is a tiny plank-house, perhaps ten\r\nby twenty, and has within a double row of rough unplaned benches,\r\nresting mostly on legs, sometimes on boxes. Opposite the door is a\r\nsquare home-made desk. In one corner are the ruins of a stove, and in\r\nthe other a dim blackboard. It is the cheerfulest schoolhouse I have\r\nseen in Dougherty, save in town. Back of the schoolhouse is a\r\nlodgehouse two stories high and not quite finished. Societies meet\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x94societies \xe2\x80\x9cto care for the sick and bury the dead\xe2\x80\x99; and these\r\nsocieties grow and flourish.\r\n\r\nWe had come to the boundaries of Dougherty, and were about to turn west\r\nalong the county-line, when all these sights were pointed out to us by\r\na kindly old man, black, white-haired, and seventy. Forty-five years he\r\nhad lived here, and now supports himself and his old wife by the help\r\nof the steer tethered yonder and the charity of his black neighbors. He\r\nshows us the farm of the Hills just across the county line in Baker,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwidow and two strapping sons, who raised ten bales (one need not add\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccotton\xe2\x80\x9d down here) last year. There are fences and pigs and cows, and\r\nthe soft-voiced, velvet-skinned young Memnon, who sauntered\r\nhalf-bashfully over to greet the strangers, is proud of his home. We\r\nturn now to the west along the county line. Great dismantled trunks of\r\npines tower above the green cottonfields, cracking their naked gnarled\r\nfingers toward the border of living forest beyond. There is little\r\nbeauty in this region, only a sort of crude abandon that suggests\r\npower,\xe2\x80\x94a naked grandeur, as it were. The houses are bare and straight;\r\nthere are no hammocks or easy-chairs, and few flowers. So when, as here\r\nat Rawdon\xe2\x80\x99s, one sees a vine clinging to a little porch, and home-like\r\nwindows peeping over the fences, one takes a long breath. I think I\r\nnever before quite realized the place of the Fence in civilization.\r\nThis is the Land of the Unfenced, where crouch on either hand scores of\r\nugly one-room cabins, cheerless and dirty. Here lies the Negro problem\r\nin its naked dirt and penury. And here are no fences. But now and then\r\nthe crisscross rails or straight palings break into view, and then we\r\nknow a touch of culture is near. Of course Harrison Gohagen,\xe2\x80\x94a quiet\r\nyellow man, young, smooth-faced, and diligent,\xe2\x80\x94of course he is lord of\r\nsome hundred acres, and we expect to see a vision of well-kept rooms\r\nand fat beds and laughing children. For has he not fine fences? And\r\nthose over yonder, why should they build fences on the rack-rented\r\nland? It will only increase their rent.\r\n\r\nOn we wind, through sand and pines and glimpses of old plantations,\r\ntill there creeps into sight a cluster of buildings,\xe2\x80\x94wood and brick,\r\nmills and houses, and scattered cabins. It seemed quite a village. As\r\nit came nearer and nearer, however, the aspect changed: the buildings\r\nwere rotten, the bricks were falling out, the mills were silent, and\r\nthe store was closed. Only in the cabins appeared now and then a bit of\r\nlazy life. I could imagine the place under some weird spell, and was\r\nhalf-minded to search out the princess. An old ragged black man,\r\nhonest, simple, and improvident, told us the tale. The Wizard of the\r\nNorth\xe2\x80\x94the Capitalist\xe2\x80\x94had rushed down in the seventies to woo this coy\r\ndark soil. He bought a square mile or more, and for a time the\r\nfield-hands sang, the gins groaned, and the mills buzzed. Then came a\r\nchange. The agent\xe2\x80\x99s son embezzled the funds and ran off with them. Then\r\nthe agent himself disappeared. Finally the new agent stole even the\r\nbooks, and the company in wrath closed its business and its houses,\r\nrefused to sell, and let houses and furniture and machinery rust and\r\nrot. So the Waters-Loring plantation was stilled by the spell of\r\ndishonesty, and stands like some gaunt rebuke to a scarred land.\r\n\r\nSomehow that plantation ended our day\xe2\x80\x99s journey; for I could not shake\r\noff the influence of that silent scene. Back toward town we glided,\r\npast the straight and thread-like pines, past a dark tree-dotted pond\r\nwhere the air was heavy with a dead sweet perfume. White slender-legged\r\ncurlews flitted by us, and the garnet blooms of the cotton looked gay\r\nagainst the green and purple stalks. A peasant girl was hoeing in the\r\nfield, white-turbaned and black-limbed. All this we saw, but the spell\r\nstill lay upon us.\r\n\r\nHow curious a land is this,\xe2\x80\x94how full of untold story, of tragedy and\r\nlaughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic\r\npast, and big with future promise! This is the Black Belt of Georgia.\r\nDougherty County is the west end of the Black Belt, and men once called\r\nit the Egypt of the Confederacy. It is full of historic interest. First\r\nthere is the Swamp, to the west, where the Chickasawhatchee flows\r\nsullenly southward. The shadow of an old plantation lies at its edge,\r\nforlorn and dark. Then comes the pool; pendent gray moss and brackish\r\nwaters appear, and forests filled with wildfowl. In one place the wood\r\nis on fire, smouldering in dull red anger; but nobody minds. Then the\r\nswamp grows beautiful; a raised road, built by chained Negro convicts,\r\ndips down into it, and forms a way walled and almost covered in living\r\ngreen. Spreading trees spring from a prodigal luxuriance of\r\nundergrowth; great dark green shadows fade into the black background,\r\nuntil all is one mass of tangled semi-tropical foliage, marvellous in\r\nits weird savage splendor. Once we crossed a black silent stream, where\r\nthe sad trees and writhing creepers, all glinting fiery yellow and\r\ngreen, seemed like some vast cathedral,\xe2\x80\x94some green Milan builded of\r\nwildwood. And as I crossed, I seemed to see again that fierce tragedy\r\nof seventy years ago. Osceola, the Indian-Negro chieftain, had risen in\r\nthe swamps of Florida, vowing vengeance. His war-cry reached the red\r\nCreeks of Dougherty, and their war-cry rang from the Chattahoochee to\r\nthe sea. Men and women and children fled and fell before them as they\r\nswept into Dougherty. In yonder shadows a dark and hideously painted\r\nwarrior glided stealthily on,\xe2\x80\x94another and another, until three hundred\r\nhad crept into the treacherous swamp. Then the false slime closing\r\nabout them called the white men from the east. Waist-deep, they fought\r\nbeneath the tall trees, until the war-cry was hushed and the Indians\r\nglided back into the west. Small wonder the wood is red.\r\n\r\nThen came the black slaves. Day after day the clank of chained feet\r\nmarching from Virginia and Carolina to Georgia was heard in these rich\r\nswamp lands. Day after day the songs of the callous, the wail of the\r\nmotherless, and the muttered curses of the wretched echoed from the\r\nFlint to the Chickasawhatchee, until by 1860 there had risen in West\r\nDougherty perhaps the richest slave kingdom the modern world ever knew.\r\nA hundred and fifty barons commanded the labor of nearly six thousand\r\nNegroes, held sway over farms with ninety thousand acres tilled land,\r\nvalued even in times of cheap soil at three millions of dollars. Twenty\r\nthousand bales of ginned cotton went yearly to England, New and Old;\r\nand men that came there bankrupt made money and grew rich. In a single\r\ndecade the cotton output increased four-fold and the value of lands was\r\ntripled. It was the heyday of the _nouveau riche_, and a life of\r\ncareless extravagance among the masters. Four and six bobtailed\r\nthoroughbreds rolled their coaches to town; open hospitality and gay\r\nentertainment were the rule. Parks and groves were laid out, rich with\r\nflower and vine, and in the midst stood the low wide-halled \xe2\x80\x9cbig\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d with its porch and columns and great fireplaces.\r\n\r\nAnd yet with all this there was something sordid, something forced,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncertain feverish unrest and recklessness; for was not all this show and\r\ntinsel built upon a groan? \xe2\x80\x9cThis land was a little Hell,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nragged, brown, and grave-faced man to me. We were seated near a\r\nroadside blacksmith shop, and behind was the bare ruin of some master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhome. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen niggers drop dead in the furrow, but they were kicked\r\naside, and the plough never stopped. Down in the guard-house, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhere the blood ran.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith such foundations a kingdom must in time sway and fall. The masters\r\nmoved to Macon and Augusta, and left only the irresponsible overseers\r\non the land. And the result is such ruin as this, the Lloyd\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chome-place\xe2\x80\x99:\xe2\x80\x94great waving oaks, a spread of lawn, myrtles and\r\nchestnuts, all ragged and wild; a solitary gate-post standing where\r\nonce was a castle entrance; an old rusty anvil lying amid rotting\r\nbellows and wood in the ruins of a blacksmith shop; a wide rambling old\r\nmansion, brown and dingy, filled now with the grandchildren of the\r\nslaves who once waited on its tables; while the family of the master\r\nhas dwindled to two lone women, who live in Macon and feed hungrily off\r\nthe remnants of an earldom. So we ride on, past phantom gates and\r\nfalling homes,\xe2\x80\x94past the once flourishing farms of the Smiths, the\r\nGandys, and the Lagores,\xe2\x80\x94and find all dilapidated and half ruined, even\r\nthere where a solitary white woman, a relic of other days, sits alone\r\nin state among miles of Negroes and rides to town in her ancient coach\r\neach day.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the Egypt of the Confederacy,\xe2\x80\x94the rich granary whence\r\npotatoes and corn and cotton poured out to the famished and ragged\r\nConfederate troops as they battled for a cause lost long before 1861.\r\nSheltered and secure, it became the place of refuge for families,\r\nwealth, and slaves. Yet even then the hard ruthless rape of the land\r\nbegan to tell. The red-clay sub-soil already had begun to peer above\r\nthe loam. The harder the slaves were driven the more careless and fatal\r\nwas their farming. Then came the revolution of war and Emancipation,\r\nthe bewilderment of Reconstruction,\xe2\x80\x94and now, what is the Egypt of the\r\nConfederacy, and what meaning has it for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s weal or woe?\r\n\r\nIt is a land of rapid contrasts and of curiously mingled hope and pain.\r\nHere sits a pretty blue-eyed quadroon hiding her bare feet; she was\r\nmarried only last week, and yonder in the field is her dark young\r\nhusband, hoeing to support her, at thirty cents a day without board.\r\nAcross the way is Gatesby, brown and tall, lord of two thousand acres\r\nshrewdly won and held. There is a store conducted by his black son, a\r\nblacksmith shop, and a ginnery. Five miles below here is a town owned\r\nand controlled by one white New Englander. He owns almost a Rhode\r\nIsland county, with thousands of acres and hundreds of black laborers.\r\nTheir cabins look better than most, and the farm, with machinery and\r\nfertilizers, is much more business-like than any in the county,\r\nalthough the manager drives hard bargains in wages. When now we turn\r\nand look five miles above, there on the edge of town are five houses of\r\nprostitutes,\xe2\x80\x94two of blacks and three of whites; and in one of the\r\nhouses of the whites a worthless black boy was harbored too openly two\r\nyears ago; so he was hanged for rape. And here, too, is the high\r\nwhitewashed fence of the \xe2\x80\x9cstockade,\xe2\x80\x9d as the county prison is called;\r\nthe white folks say it is ever full of black criminals,\xe2\x80\x94the black folks\r\nsay that only colored boys are sent to jail, and they not because they\r\nare guilty, but because the State needs criminals to eke out its income\r\nby their forced labor.\r\n\r\nImmigrants are heirs of the slave baron in Dougherty; and as we ride\r\nwestward, by wide stretching cornfields and stubby orchards of peach\r\nand pear, we see on all sides within the circle of dark forest a Land\r\nof Canaan. Here and there are tales of projects for money-getting, born\r\nin the swift days of Reconstruction,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98improvement\xe2\x80\x99 companies, wine\r\ncompanies, mills and factories; most failed, and foreigners fell heir.\r\nIt is a beautiful land, this Dougherty, west of the Flint. The forests\r\nare wonderful, the solemn pines have disappeared, and this is the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOakey Woods,\xe2\x80\x9d with its wealth of hickories, beeches, oaks and\r\npalmettos. But a pall of debt hangs over the beautiful land; the\r\nmerchants are in debt to the wholesalers, the planters are in debt to\r\nthe merchants, the tenants owe the planters, and laborers bow and bend\r\nbeneath the burden of it all. Here and there a man has raised his head\r\nabove these murky waters. We passed one fenced stock-farm with grass\r\nand grazing cattle, that looked very home-like after endless corn and\r\ncotton. Here and there are black free-holders: there is the gaunt\r\ndull-black Jackson, with his hundred acres. \xe2\x80\x9cI says, \xe2\x80\x98Look up! If you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look up you can\xe2\x80\x99t get up,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d remarks Jackson, philosophically. And\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s gotten up. Dark Carter\xe2\x80\x99s neat barns would do credit to New\r\nEngland. His master helped him to get a start, but when the black man\r\ndied last fall the master\xe2\x80\x99s sons immediately laid claim to the estate.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd them white folks will get it, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said my yellow gossip.\r\n\r\nI turn from these well-tended acres with a comfortable feeling that the\r\nNegro is rising. Even then, however, the fields, as we proceed, begin\r\nto redden and the trees disappear. Rows of old cabins appear filled\r\nwith renters and laborers,\xe2\x80\x94cheerless, bare, and dirty, for the most\r\npart, although here and there the very age and decay makes the scene\r\npicturesque. A young black fellow greets us. He is twenty-two, and just\r\nmarried. Until last year he had good luck renting; then cotton fell,\r\nand the sheriff seized and sold all he had. So he moved here, where the\r\nrent is higher, the land poorer, and the owner inflexible; he rents a\r\nforty-dollar mule for twenty dollars a year. Poor lad!\xe2\x80\x94a slave at\r\ntwenty-two. This plantation, owned now by a foreigner, was a part of\r\nthe famous Bolton estate. After the war it was for many years worked by\r\ngangs of Negro convicts,\xe2\x80\x94and black convicts then were even more\r\nplentiful than now; it was a way of making Negroes work, and the\r\nquestion of guilt was a minor one. Hard tales of cruelty and\r\nmistreatment of the chained freemen are told, but the county\r\nauthorities were deaf until the free-labor market was nearly ruined by\r\nwholesale migration. Then they took the convicts from the plantations,\r\nbut not until one of the fairest regions of the \xe2\x80\x9cOakey Woods\xe2\x80\x9d had been\r\nruined and ravished into a red waste, out of which only a Yankee or an\r\nimmigrant could squeeze more blood from debt-cursed tenants.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Luke Black, slow, dull, and discouraged, shuffles to our\r\ncarriage and talks hopelessly. Why should he strive? Every year finds\r\nhim deeper in debt. How strange that Georgia, the world-heralded refuge\r\nof poor debtors, should bind her own to sloth and misfortune as\r\nruthlessly as ever England did! The poor land groans with its\r\nbirth-pains, and brings forth scarcely a hundred pounds of cotton to\r\nthe acre, where fifty years ago it yielded eight times as much. Of his\r\nmeagre yield the tenant pays from a quarter to a third in rent, and\r\nmost of the rest in interest on food and supplies bought on credit.\r\nTwenty years yonder sunken-cheeked, old black man has labored under\r\nthat system, and now, turned day-laborer, is supporting his wife and\r\nboarding himself on his wages of a dollar and a half a week, received\r\nonly part of the year.\r\n\r\nThe Bolton convict farm formerly included the neighboring plantation.\r\nHere it was that the convicts were lodged in the great log prison still\r\nstanding. A dismal place it still remains, with rows of ugly huts\r\nfilled with surly ignorant tenants. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat rent do you pay here?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ninquired. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x94what is it, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll we make,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sam.\r\nIt is a depressing place,\xe2\x80\x94bare, unshaded, with no charm of past\r\nassociation, only a memory of forced human toil,\xe2\x80\x94now, then, and before\r\nthe war. They are not happy, these black men whom we meet throughout\r\nthis region. There is little of the joyous abandon and playfulness\r\nwhich we are wont to associate with the plantation Negro. At best, the\r\nnatural good-nature is edged with complaint or has changed into\r\nsullenness and gloom. And now and then it blazes forth in veiled but\r\nhot anger. I remember one big red-eyed black whom we met by the\r\nroadside. Forty-five years he had labored on this farm, beginning with\r\nnothing, and still having nothing. To be sure, he had given four\r\nchildren a common-school training, and perhaps if the new fence-law had\r\nnot allowed unfenced crops in West Dougherty he might have raised a\r\nlittle stock and kept ahead. As it is, he is hopelessly in debt,\r\ndisappointed, and embittered. He stopped us to inquire after the black\r\nboy in Albany, whom it was said a policeman had shot and killed for\r\nloud talking on the sidewalk. And then he said slowly: \xe2\x80\x9cLet a white man\r\ntouch me, and he dies; I don\xe2\x80\x99t boast this,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it around loud,\r\nor before the children,\xe2\x80\x94but I mean it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them whip my father\r\nand my old mother in them cotton-rows till the blood ran; by\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and we\r\npassed on.\r\n\r\nNow Sears, whom we met next lolling under the chubby oak-trees, was of\r\nquite different fibre. Happy?\xe2\x80\x94Well, yes; he laughed and flipped\r\npebbles, and thought the world was as it was. He had worked here twelve\r\nyears and has nothing but a mortgaged mule. Children? Yes, seven; but\r\nthey hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been to school this year,\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford books and\r\nclothes, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t spare their work. There go part of them to the\r\nfields now,\xe2\x80\x94three big boys astride mules, and a strapping girl with\r\nbare brown legs. Careless ignorance and laziness here, fierce hate and\r\nvindictiveness there;\xe2\x80\x94these are the extremes of the Negro problem which\r\nwe met that day, and we scarce knew which we preferred.\r\n\r\nHere and there we meet distinct characters quite out of the ordinary.\r\nOne came out of a piece of newly cleared ground, making a wide detour\r\nto avoid the snakes. He was an old, hollow-cheeked man, with a drawn\r\nand characterful brown face. He had a sort of self-contained quaintness\r\nand rough humor impossible to describe; a certain cynical earnestness\r\nthat puzzled one. \xe2\x80\x9cThe niggers were jealous of me over on the other\r\nplace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand so me and the old woman begged this piece of\r\nwoods, and I cleared it up myself. Made nothing for two years, but I\r\nreckon I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a crop now.\xe2\x80\x9d The cotton looked tall and rich, and we\r\npraised it. He curtsied low, and then bowed almost to the ground, with\r\nan imperturbable gravity that seemed almost suspicious. Then he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cMy mule died last week,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a calamity in this land equal to a\r\ndevastating fire in town,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98but a white man loaned me another.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\r\nadded, eyeing us, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I gets along with white folks.\xe2\x80\x9d We turned the\r\nconversation. \xe2\x80\x9cBears? deer?\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, I should say there\r\nwere,\xe2\x80\x9d and he let fly a string of brave oaths, as he told hunting-tales\r\nof the swamp. We left him standing still in the middle of the road\r\nlooking after us, and yet apparently not noticing us.\r\n\r\nThe Whistle place, which includes his bit of land, was bought soon\r\nafter the war by an English syndicate, the \xe2\x80\x9cDixie Cotton and Corn\r\nCompany.\xe2\x80\x9d A marvellous deal of style their factor put on, with his\r\nservants and coach-and-six; so much so that the concern soon landed in\r\ninextricable bankruptcy. Nobody lives in the old house now, but a man\r\ncomes each winter out of the North and collects his high rents. I know\r\nnot which are the more touching,\xe2\x80\x94such old empty houses, or the homes of\r\nthe masters\xe2\x80\x99 sons. Sad and bitter tales lie hidden back of those white\r\ndoors,\xe2\x80\x94tales of poverty, of struggle, of disappointment. A revolution\r\nsuch as that of \xe2\x80\x9963 is a terrible thing; they that rose rich in the\r\nmorning often slept in paupers\xe2\x80\x99 beds. Beggars and vulgar speculators\r\nrose to rule over them, and their children went astray. See yonder\r\nsad-colored house, with its cabins and fences and glad crops! It is not\r\nglad within; last month the prodigal son of the struggling father wrote\r\nhome from the city for money. Money! Where was it to come from? And so\r\nthe son rose in the night and killed his baby, and killed his wife, and\r\nshot himself dead. And the world passed on.\r\n\r\nI remember wheeling around a bend in the road beside a graceful bit of\r\nforest and a singing brook. A long low house faced us, with porch and\r\nflying pillars, great oaken door, and a broad lawn shining in the\r\nevening sun. But the window-panes were gone, the pillars were\r\nworm-eaten, and the moss-grown roof was falling in. Half curiously I\r\npeered through the unhinged door, and saw where, on the wall across the\r\nhall, was written in once gay letters a faded \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite a contrast to the southwestern part of Dougherty County is the\r\nnorthwest. Soberly timbered in oak and pine, it has none of that\r\nhalf-tropical luxuriance of the southwest. Then, too, there are fewer\r\nsigns of a romantic past, and more of systematic modern land-grabbing\r\nand money-getting. White people are more in evidence here, and farmer\r\nand hired labor replace to some extent the absentee landlord and\r\nrack-rented tenant. The crops have neither the luxuriance of the richer\r\nland nor the signs of neglect so often seen, and there were fences and\r\nmeadows here and there. Most of this land was poor, and beneath the\r\nnotice of the slave-baron, before the war. Since then his poor\r\nrelations and foreign immigrants have seized it. The returns of the\r\nfarmer are too small to allow much for wages, and yet he will not sell\r\noff small farms. There is the Negro Sanford; he has worked fourteen\r\nyears as overseer on the Ladson place, and \xe2\x80\x9cpaid out enough for\r\nfertilizers to have bought a farm,\xe2\x80\x9d but the owner will not sell off a\r\nfew acres.\r\n\r\nTwo children\xe2\x80\x94a boy and a girl\xe2\x80\x94are hoeing sturdily in the fields on the\r\nfarm where Corliss works. He is smooth-faced and brown, and is fencing\r\nup his pigs. He used to run a successful cotton-gin, but the Cotton\r\nSeed Oil Trust has forced the price of ginning so low that he says it\r\nhardly pays him. He points out a stately old house over the way as the\r\nhome of \xe2\x80\x9cPa Willis.\xe2\x80\x9d We eagerly ride over, for \xe2\x80\x9cPa Willis\xe2\x80\x9d was the tall\r\nand powerful black Moses who led the Negroes for a generation, and led\r\nthem well. He was a Baptist preacher, and when he died, two thousand\r\nblack people followed him to the grave; and now they preach his funeral\r\nsermon each year. His widow lives here,\xe2\x80\x94a weazened, sharp-featured\r\nlittle woman, who curtsied quaintly as we greeted her. Further on lives\r\nJack Delson, the most prosperous Negro farmer in the county. It is a\r\njoy to meet him,\xe2\x80\x94a great broad-shouldered, handsome black man,\r\nintelligent and jovial. Six hundred and fifty acres he owns, and has\r\neleven black tenants. A neat and tidy home nestled in a flower-garden,\r\nand a little store stands beside it.\r\n\r\nWe pass the Munson place, where a plucky white widow is renting and\r\nstruggling; and the eleven hundred acres of the Sennet plantation, with\r\nits Negro overseer. Then the character of the farms begins to change.\r\nNearly all the lands belong to Russian Jews; the overseers are white,\r\nand the cabins are bare board-houses scattered here and there. The\r\nrents are high, and day-laborers and \xe2\x80\x9ccontract\xe2\x80\x9d hands abound. It is a\r\nkeen, hard struggle for living here, and few have time to talk. Tired\r\nwith the long ride, we gladly drive into Gillonsville. It is a silent\r\ncluster of farmhouses standing on the crossroads, with one of its\r\nstores closed and the other kept by a Negro preacher. They tell great\r\ntales of busy times at Gillonsville before all the railroads came to\r\nAlbany; now it is chiefly a memory. Riding down the street, we stop at\r\nthe preacher\xe2\x80\x99s and seat ourselves before the door. It was one of those\r\nscenes one cannot soon forget:\xe2\x80\x94a wide, low, little house, whose\r\nmotherly roof reached over and sheltered a snug little porch. There we\r\nsat, after the long hot drive, drinking cool water,\xe2\x80\x94the talkative\r\nlittle storekeeper who is my daily companion; the silent old black\r\nwoman patching pantaloons and saying never a word; the ragged picture\r\nof helpless misfortune who called in just to see the preacher; and\r\nfinally the neat matronly preacher\xe2\x80\x99s wife, plump, yellow, and\r\nintelligent. \xe2\x80\x9cOwn land?\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, only this house.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nshe added quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did buy seven hundred acres across up yonder,\r\nand paid for it; but they cheated us out of it. Sells was the owner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSells!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the ragged misfortune, who was leaning against the\r\nbalustrade and listening, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a regular cheat. I worked for him\r\nthirty-seven days this spring, and he paid me in cardboard checks which\r\nwere to be cashed at the end of the month. But he never cashed\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x94kept putting me off. Then the sheriff came and took my mule and\r\ncorn and furniture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFurniture? But furniture is exempt from seizure\r\nby law.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he took it just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hard-faced man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nOf the Quest of the Golden Fleece\r\n\r\nBut the Brute said in his breast, \xe2\x80\x9cTill the mills I grind have ceased,\r\nThe riches shall be dust of dust, dry ashes be the feast!\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOn the strong and cunning few\r\n    Cynic favors I will strew;\r\nI will stuff their maw with overplus until their spirit dies;\r\n    From the patient and the low\r\n    I will take the joys they know;\r\n    They shall hunger after vanities and still an-hungered go.\r\nMadness shall be on the people, ghastly jealousies arise;\r\nBrother\xe2\x80\x99s blood shall cry on brother up the dead and empty skies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a cotton-field white with harvest,\xe2\x80\x94its golden fleece\r\nhovering above the black earth like a silvery cloud edged with dark\r\ngreen, its bold white signals waving like the foam of billows from\r\nCarolina to Texas across that Black and human Sea? I have sometimes\r\nhalf suspected that here the winged ram Chrysomallus left that Fleece\r\nafter which Jason and his Argonauts went vaguely wandering into the\r\nshadowy East three thousand years ago; and certainly one might frame a\r\npretty and not far-fetched analogy of witchery and dragons\xe2\x80\x99 teeth, and\r\nblood and armed men, between the ancient and the modern quest of the\r\nGolden Fleece in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nAnd now the golden fleece is found; not only found, but, in its\r\nbirthplace, woven. For the hum of the cotton-mills is the newest and\r\nmost significant thing in the New South to-day. All through the\r\nCarolinas and Georgia, away down to Mexico, rise these gaunt red\r\nbuildings, bare and homely, and yet so busy and noisy withal that they\r\nscarce seem to belong to the slow and sleepy land. Perhaps they sprang\r\nfrom dragons\xe2\x80\x99 teeth. So the Cotton Kingdom still lives; the world still\r\nbows beneath her sceptre. Even the markets that once defied the parvenu\r\nhave crept one by one across the seas, and then slowly and reluctantly,\r\nbut surely, have started toward the Black Belt.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there are those who wag their heads knowingly and tell us\r\nthat the capital of the Cotton Kingdom has moved from the Black to the\r\nWhite Belt,\xe2\x80\x94that the Negro of to-day raises not more than half of the\r\ncotton crop. Such men forget that the cotton crop has doubled, and more\r\nthan doubled, since the era of slavery, and that, even granting their\r\ncontention, the Negro is still supreme in a Cotton Kingdom larger than\r\nthat on which the Confederacy builded its hopes. So the Negro forms\r\nto-day one of the chief figures in a great world-industry; and this,\r\nfor its own sake, and in the light of historic interest, makes the\r\nfield-hands of the cotton country worth studying.\r\n\r\nWe seldom study the condition of the Negro to-day honestly and\r\ncarefully. It is so much easier to assume that we know it all. Or\r\nperhaps, having already reached conclusions in our own minds, we are\r\nloth to have them disturbed by facts. And yet how little we really know\r\nof these millions,\xe2\x80\x94of their daily lives and longings, of their homely\r\njoys and sorrows, of their real shortcomings and the meaning of their\r\ncrimes! All this we can only learn by intimate contact with the masses,\r\nand not by wholesale arguments covering millions separate in time and\r\nspace, and differing widely in training and culture. To-day, then, my\r\nreader, let us turn our faces to the Black Belt of Georgia and seek\r\nsimply to know the condition of the black farm-laborers of one county\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHere in 1890 lived ten thousand Negroes and two thousand whites. The\r\ncountry is rich, yet the people are poor. The keynote of the Black Belt\r\nis debt; not commercial credit, but debt in the sense of continued\r\ninability on the part of the mass of the population to make income\r\ncover expense. This is the direct heritage of the South from the\r\nwasteful economies of the slave _r\xc3\xa9gime;_ but it was emphasized and\r\nbrought to a crisis by the Emancipation of the slaves. In 1860,\r\nDougherty County had six thousand slaves, worth at least two and a half\r\nmillions of dollars; its farms were estimated at three millions,\xe2\x80\x94making\r\nfive and a half millions of property, the value of which depended\r\nlargely on the slave system, and on the speculative demand for land\r\nonce marvellously rich but already partially devitalized by careless\r\nand exhaustive culture. The war then meant a financial crash; in place\r\nof the five and a half millions of 1860, there remained in 1870 only\r\nfarms valued at less than two millions. With this came increased\r\ncompetition in cotton culture from the rich lands of Texas; a steady\r\nfall in the normal price of cotton followed, from about fourteen cents\r\na pound in 1860 until it reached four cents in 1898. Such a financial\r\nrevolution was it that involved the owners of the cotton-belt in debt.\r\nAnd if things went ill with the master, how fared it with the man?\r\n\r\nThe plantations of Dougherty County in slavery days were not as\r\nimposing and aristocratic as those of Virginia. The Big House was\r\nsmaller and usually one-storied, and sat very near the slave cabins.\r\nSometimes these cabins stretched off on either side like wings;\r\nsometimes only on one side, forming a double row, or edging the road\r\nthat turned into the plantation from the main thoroughfare. The form\r\nand disposition of the laborers\xe2\x80\x99 cabins throughout the Black Belt is\r\nto-day the same as in slavery days. Some live in the self-same cabins,\r\nothers in cabins rebuilt on the sites of the old. All are sprinkled in\r\nlittle groups over the face of the land, centering about some\r\ndilapidated Big House where the head-tenant or agent lives. The general\r\ncharacter and arrangement of these dwellings remains on the whole\r\nunaltered. There were in the county, outside the corporate town of\r\nAlbany, about fifteen hundred Negro families in 1898. Out of all these,\r\nonly a single family occupied a house with seven rooms; only fourteen\r\nhave five rooms or more. The mass live in one- and two-room homes.\r\n\r\nThe size and arrangements of a people\xe2\x80\x99s homes are no unfair index of\r\ntheir condition. If, then, we inquire more carefully into these Negro\r\nhomes, we find much that is unsatisfactory. All over the face of the\r\nland is the one-room cabin,\xe2\x80\x94now standing in the shadow of the Big\r\nHouse, now staring at the dusty road, now rising dark and sombre amid\r\nthe green of the cotton-fields. It is nearly always old and bare, built\r\nof rough boards, and neither plastered nor ceiled. Light and\r\nventilation are supplied by the single door and by the square hole in\r\nthe wall with its wooden shutter. There is no glass, porch, or\r\nornamentation without. Within is a fireplace, black and smoky, and\r\nusually unsteady with age. A bed or two, a table, a wooden chest, and a\r\nfew chairs compose the furniture; while a stray show-bill or a\r\nnewspaper makes up the decorations for the walls. Now and then one may\r\nfind such a cabin kept scrupulously neat, with merry steaming\r\nfireplaces and hospitable door; but the majority are dirty and\r\ndilapidated, smelling of eating and sleeping, poorly ventilated, and\r\nanything but homes.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the cabins are crowded. We have come to associate crowding\r\nwith homes in cities almost exclusively. This is primarily because we\r\nhave so little accurate knowledge of country life. Here in Dougherty\r\nCounty one may find families of eight and ten occupying one or two\r\nrooms, and for every ten rooms of house accommodation for the Negroes\r\nthere are twenty-five persons. The worst tenement abominations of New\r\nYork do not have above twenty-two persons for every ten rooms. Of\r\ncourse, one small, close room in a city, without a yard, is in many\r\nrespects worse than the larger single country room. In other respects\r\nit is better; it has glass windows, a decent chimney, and a trustworthy\r\nfloor. The single great advantage of the Negro peasant is that he may\r\nspend most of his life outside his hovel, in the open fields.\r\n\r\nThere are four chief causes of these wretched homes: First, long custom\r\nborn of slavery has assigned such homes to Negroes; white laborers\r\nwould be offered better accommodations, and might, for that and similar\r\nreasons, give better work. Secondly, the Negroes, used to such\r\naccommodations, do not as a rule demand better; they do not know what\r\nbetter houses mean. Thirdly, the landlords as a class have not yet come\r\nto realize that it is a good business investment to raise the standard\r\nof living among labor by slow and judicious methods; that a Negro\r\nlaborer who demands three rooms and fifty cents a day would give more\r\nefficient work and leave a larger profit than a discouraged toiler\r\nherding his family in one room and working for thirty cents. Lastly,\r\namong such conditions of life there are few incentives to make the\r\nlaborer become a better farmer. If he is ambitious, he moves to town or\r\ntries other labor; as a tenant-farmer his outlook is almost hopeless,\r\nand following it as a makeshift, he takes the house that is given him\r\nwithout protest.\r\n\r\nIn such homes, then, these Negro peasants live. The families are both\r\nsmall and large; there are many single tenants,\xe2\x80\x94widows and bachelors,\r\nand remnants of broken groups. The system of labor and the size of the\r\nhouses both tend to the breaking up of family groups: the grown\r\nchildren go away as contract hands or migrate to town, the sister goes\r\ninto service; and so one finds many families with hosts of babies, and\r\nmany newly married couples, but comparatively few families with\r\nhalf-grown and grown sons and daughters. The average size of Negro\r\nfamilies has undoubtedly decreased since the war, primarily from\r\neconomic stress. In Russia over a third of the bridegrooms and over\r\nhalf the brides are under twenty; the same was true of the antebellum\r\nNegroes. Today, however, very few of the boys and less than a fifth of\r\nthe Negro girls under twenty are married. The young men marry between\r\nthe ages of twenty-five and thirty-five; the young women between twenty\r\nand thirty. Such postponement is due to the difficulty of earning\r\nsufficient to rear and support a family; and it undoubtedly leads, in\r\nthe country districts, to sexual immorality. The form of this\r\nimmorality, however, is very seldom that of prostitution, and less\r\nfrequently that of illegitimacy than one would imagine. Rather, it\r\ntakes the form of separation and desertion after a family group has\r\nbeen formed. The number of separated persons is thirty-five to the\r\nthousand,\xe2\x80\x94a very large number. It would of course be unfair to compare\r\nthis number with divorce statistics, for many of these separated women\r\nare in reality widowed, were the truth known, and in other cases the\r\nseparation is not permanent. Nevertheless, here lies the seat of\r\ngreatest moral danger. There is little or no prostitution among these\r\nNegroes, and over three-fourths of the families, as found by\r\nhouse-to-house investigation, deserve to be classed as decent people\r\nwith considerable regard for female chastity. To be sure, the ideas of\r\nthe mass would not suit New England, and there are many loose habits\r\nand notions. Yet the rate of illegitimacy is undoubtedly lower than in\r\nAustria or Italy, and the women as a class are modest. The plague-spot\r\nin sexual relations is easy marriage and easy separation. This is no\r\nsudden development, nor the fruit of Emancipation. It is the plain\r\nheritage from slavery. In those days Sam, with his master\xe2\x80\x99s consent,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctook up\xe2\x80\x9d with Mary. No ceremony was necessary, and in the busy life of\r\nthe great plantations of the Black Belt it was usually dispensed with.\r\nIf now the master needed Sam\xe2\x80\x99s work in another plantation or in another\r\npart of the same plantation, or if he took a notion to sell the slave,\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s married life with Mary was usually unceremoniously broken, and\r\nthen it was clearly to the master\xe2\x80\x99s interest to have both of them take\r\nnew mates. This widespread custom of two centuries has not been\r\neradicated in thirty years. To-day Sam\xe2\x80\x99s grandson \xe2\x80\x9ctakes up\xe2\x80\x9d with a\r\nwoman without license or ceremony; they live together decently and\r\nhonestly, and are, to all intents and purposes, man and wife. Sometimes\r\nthese unions are never broken until death; but in too many cases family\r\nquarrels, a roving spirit, a rival suitor, or perhaps more frequently\r\nthe hopeless battle to support a family, lead to separation, and a\r\nbroken household is the result. The Negro church has done much to stop\r\nthis practice, and now most marriage ceremonies are performed by the\r\npastors. Nevertheless, the evil is still deep seated, and only a\r\ngeneral raising of the standard of living will finally cure it.\r\n\r\nLooking now at the county black population as a whole, it is fair to\r\ncharacterize it as poor and ignorant. Perhaps ten per cent compose the\r\nwell-to-do and the best of the laborers, while at least nine per cent\r\nare thoroughly lewd and vicious. The rest, over eighty per cent, are\r\npoor and ignorant, fairly honest and well meaning, plodding, and to a\r\ndegree shiftless, with some but not great sexual looseness. Such class\r\nlines are by no means fixed; they vary, one might almost say, with the\r\nprice of cotton. The degree of ignorance cannot easily be expressed. We\r\nmay say, for instance, that nearly two-thirds of them cannot read or\r\nwrite. This but partially expresses the fact. They are ignorant of the\r\nworld about them, of modern economic organization, of the function of\r\ngovernment, of individual worth and possibilities,\xe2\x80\x94of nearly all those\r\nthings which slavery in self-defence had to keep them from learning.\r\nMuch that the white boy imbibes from his earliest social atmosphere\r\nforms the puzzling problems of the black boy\xe2\x80\x99s mature years. America is\r\nnot another word for Opportunity to _all_ her sons.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for us to lose ourselves in details in endeavoring to grasp\r\nand comprehend the real condition of a mass of human beings. We often\r\nforget that each unit in the mass is a throbbing human soul. Ignorant\r\nit may be, and poverty stricken, black and curious in limb and ways and\r\nthought; and yet it loves and hates, it toils and tires, it laughs and\r\nweeps its bitter tears, and looks in vague and awful longing at the\r\ngrim horizon of its life,\xe2\x80\x94all this, even as you and I. These black\r\nthousands are not in reality lazy; they are improvident and careless;\r\nthey insist on breaking the monotony of toil with a glimpse at the\r\ngreat town-world on Saturday; they have their loafers and their\r\nrascals; but the great mass of them work continuously and faithfully\r\nfor a return, and under circumstances that would call forth equal\r\nvoluntary effort from few if any other modern laboring class. Over\r\neighty-eight per cent of them\xe2\x80\x94men, women, and children\xe2\x80\x94are farmers.\r\nIndeed, this is almost the only industry. Most of the children get\r\ntheir schooling after the \xe2\x80\x9ccrops are laid by,\xe2\x80\x9d and very few there are\r\nthat stay in school after the spring work has begun. Child-labor is to\r\nbe found here in some of its worst phases, as fostering ignorance and\r\nstunting physical development. With the grown men of the county there\r\nis little variety in work: thirteen hundred are farmers, and two\r\nhundred are laborers, teamsters, etc., including twenty-four artisans,\r\nten merchants, twenty-one preachers, and four teachers. This narrowness\r\nof life reaches its maximum among the women: thirteen hundred and fifty\r\nof these are farm laborers, one hundred are servants and washerwomen,\r\nleaving sixty-five housewives, eight teachers, and six seamstresses.\r\n\r\nAmong this people there is no leisure class. We often forget that in\r\nthe United States over half the youth and adults are not in the world\r\nearning incomes, but are making homes, learning of the world, or\r\nresting after the heat of the strife. But here ninety-six per cent are\r\ntoiling; no one with leisure to turn the bare and cheerless cabin into\r\na home, no old folks to sit beside the fire and hand down traditions of\r\nthe past; little of careless happy childhood and dreaming youth. The\r\ndull monotony of daily toil is broken only by the gayety of the\r\nthoughtless and the Saturday trip to town. The toil, like all farm\r\ntoil, is monotonous, and here there are little machinery and few tools\r\nto relieve its burdensome drudgery. But with all this, it is work in\r\nthe pure open air, and this is something in a day when fresh air is\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\nThe land on the whole is still fertile, despite long abuse. For nine or\r\nten months in succession the crops will come if asked: garden\r\nvegetables in April, grain in May, melons in June and July, hay in\r\nAugust, sweet potatoes in September, and cotton from then to Christmas.\r\nAnd yet on two-thirds of the land there is but one crop, and that\r\nleaves the toilers in debt. Why is this?\r\n\r\nAway down the Baysan road, where the broad flat fields are flanked by\r\ngreat oak forests, is a plantation; many thousands of acres it used to\r\nrun, here and there, and beyond the great wood. Thirteen hundred human\r\nbeings here obeyed the call of one,\xe2\x80\x94were his in body, and largely in\r\nsoul. One of them lives there yet,\xe2\x80\x94a short, stocky man, his dull-brown\r\nface seamed and drawn, and his tightly curled hair gray-white. The\r\ncrops? Just tolerable, he said; just tolerable. Getting on? No\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t getting on at all. Smith of Albany \xe2\x80\x9cfurnishes\xe2\x80\x9d him, and his rent\r\nis eight hundred pounds of cotton. Can\xe2\x80\x99t make anything at that. Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t he buy land! _Humph!_ Takes money to buy land. And he turns\r\naway. Free! The most piteous thing amid all the black ruin of war-time,\r\namid the broken fortunes of the masters, the blighted hopes of mothers\r\nand maidens, and the fall of an empire,\xe2\x80\x94the most piteous thing amid all\r\nthis was the black freedman who threw down his hoe because the world\r\ncalled him free. What did such a mockery of freedom mean? Not a cent of\r\nmoney, not an inch of land, not a mouthful of victuals,\xe2\x80\x94not even\r\nownership of the rags on his back. Free! On Saturday, once or twice a\r\nmonth, the old master, before the war, used to dole out bacon and meal\r\nto his Negroes. And after the first flush of freedom wore off, and his\r\ntrue helplessness dawned on the freedman, he came back and picked up\r\nhis hoe, and old master still doled out his bacon and meal. The legal\r\nform of service was theoretically far different; in practice, task-work\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9ccropping\xe2\x80\x9d was substituted for daily toil in gangs; and the slave\r\ngradually became a metayer, or tenant on shares, in name, but a laborer\r\nwith indeterminate wages in fact.\r\n\r\nStill the price of cotton fell, and gradually the landlords deserted\r\ntheir plantations, and the reign of the merchant began. The merchant of\r\nthe Black Belt is a curious institution,\xe2\x80\x94part banker, part landlord,\r\npart banker, and part despot. His store, which used most frequently to\r\nstand at the cross-roads and become the centre of a weekly village, has\r\nnow moved to town; and thither the Negro tenant follows him. The\r\nmerchant keeps everything,\xe2\x80\x94clothes and shoes, coffee and sugar, pork\r\nand meal, canned and dried goods, wagons and ploughs, seed and\r\nfertilizer,\xe2\x80\x94and what he has not in stock he can give you an order for\r\nat the store across the way. Here, then, comes the tenant, Sam Scott,\r\nafter he has contracted with some absent landlord\xe2\x80\x99s agent for hiring\r\nforty acres of land; he fingers his hat nervously until the merchant\r\nfinishes his morning chat with Colonel Saunders, and calls out, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nSam, what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d Sam wants him to \xe2\x80\x9cfurnish\xe2\x80\x9d him,\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._, to\r\nadvance him food and clothing for the year, and perhaps seed and tools,\r\nuntil his crop is raised and sold. If Sam seems a favorable subject, he\r\nand the merchant go to a lawyer, and Sam executes a chattel mortgage on\r\nhis mule and wagon in return for seed and a week\xe2\x80\x99s rations. As soon as\r\nthe green cotton-leaves appear above the ground, another mortgage is\r\ngiven on the \xe2\x80\x9ccrop.\xe2\x80\x9d Every Saturday, or at longer intervals, Sam calls\r\nupon the merchant for his \xe2\x80\x9crations\xe2\x80\x99; a family of five usually gets\r\nabout thirty pounds of fat side-pork and a couple of bushels of\r\ncornmeal a month. Besides this, clothing and shoes must be furnished;\r\nif Sam or his family is sick, there are orders on the druggist and\r\ndoctor; if the mule wants shoeing, an order on the blacksmith, etc. If\r\nSam is a hard worker and crops promise well, he is often encouraged to\r\nbuy more,\xe2\x80\x94sugar, extra clothes, perhaps a buggy. But he is seldom\r\nencouraged to save. When cotton rose to ten cents last fall, the shrewd\r\nmerchants of Dougherty County sold a thousand buggies in one season,\r\nmostly to black men.\r\n\r\nThe security offered for such transactions\xe2\x80\x94a crop and chattel\r\nmortgage\xe2\x80\x94may at first seem slight. And, indeed, the merchants tell many\r\na true tale of shiftlessness and cheating; of cotton picked at night,\r\nmules disappearing, and tenants absconding. But on the whole the\r\nmerchant of the Black Belt is the most prosperous man in the section.\r\nSo skilfully and so closely has he drawn the bonds of the law about the\r\ntenant, that the black man has often simply to choose between pauperism\r\nand crime; he \xe2\x80\x9cwaives\xe2\x80\x9d all homestead exemptions in his contract; he\r\ncannot touch his own mortgaged crop, which the laws put almost in the\r\nfull control of the land-owner and of the merchant. When the crop is\r\ngrowing the merchant watches it like a hawk; as soon as it is ready for\r\nmarket he takes possession of it, sells it, pays the landowner his\r\nrent, subtracts his bill for supplies, and if, as sometimes happens,\r\nthere is anything left, he hands it over to the black serf for his\r\nChristmas celebration.\r\n\r\nThe direct result of this system is an all-cotton scheme of agriculture\r\nand the continued bankruptcy of the tenant. The currency of the Black\r\nBelt is cotton. It is a crop always salable for ready money, not\r\nusually subject to great yearly fluctuations in price, and one which\r\nthe Negroes know how to raise. The landlord therefore demands his rent\r\nin cotton, and the merchant will accept mortgages on no other crop.\r\nThere is no use asking the black tenant, then, to diversify his\r\ncrops,\xe2\x80\x94he cannot under this system. Moreover, the system is bound to\r\nbankrupt the tenant. I remember once meeting a little one-mule wagon on\r\nthe River road. A young black fellow sat in it driving listlessly, his\r\nelbows on his knees. His dark-faced wife sat beside him, stolid,\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my driver,\xe2\x80\x94he has a most imprudent way of addressing\r\nthese people, though they seem used to it,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98what have you got there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeat and meal,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the man, stopping. The meat lay uncovered in\r\nthe bottom of the wagon,\xe2\x80\x94a great thin side of fat pork covered with\r\nsalt; the meal was in a white bushel bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you pay for that meat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen cents a pound.\xe2\x80\x9d It could have been bought for six or seven cents\r\ncash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the meal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d One dollar and ten cents is the cash price in town. Here\r\nwas a man paying five dollars for goods which he could have bought for\r\nthree dollars cash, and raised for one dollar or one dollar and a half.\r\n\r\nYet it is not wholly his fault. The Negro farmer started\r\nbehind,\xe2\x80\x94started in debt. This was not his choosing, but the crime of\r\nthis happy-go-lucky nation which goes blundering along with its\r\nReconstruction tragedies, its Spanish war interludes and Philippine\r\nmatinees, just as though God really were dead. Once in debt, it is no\r\neasy matter for a whole race to emerge.\r\n\r\nIn the year of low-priced cotton, 1898, out of three hundred tenant\r\nfamilies one hundred and seventy-five ended their year\xe2\x80\x99s work in debt\r\nto the extent of fourteen thousand dollars; fifty cleared nothing, and\r\nthe remaining seventy-five made a total profit of sixteen hundred\r\ndollars. The net indebtedness of the black tenant families of the whole\r\ncounty must have been at least sixty thousand dollars. In a more\r\nprosperous year the situation is far better; but on the average the\r\nmajority of tenants end the year even, or in debt, which means that\r\nthey work for board and clothes. Such an economic organization is\r\nradically wrong. Whose is the blame?\r\n\r\nThe underlying causes of this situation are complicated but\r\ndiscernible. And one of the chief, outside the carelessness of the\r\nnation in letting the slave start with nothing, is the widespread\r\nopinion among the merchants and employers of the Black Belt that only\r\nby the slavery of debt can the Negro be kept at work. Without doubt,\r\nsome pressure was necessary at the beginning of the free-labor system\r\nto keep the listless and lazy at work; and even to-day the mass of the\r\nNegro laborers need stricter guardianship than most Northern laborers.\r\nBehind this honest and widespread opinion dishonesty and cheating of\r\nthe ignorant laborers have a good chance to take refuge. And to all\r\nthis must be added the obvious fact that a slave ancestry and a system\r\nof unrequited toil has not improved the efficiency or temper of the\r\nmass of black laborers. Nor is this peculiar to Sambo; it has in\r\nhistory been just as true of John and Hans, of Jacques and Pat, of all\r\nground-down peasantries. Such is the situation of the mass of the\r\nNegroes in the Black Belt to-day; and they are thinking about it.\r\nCrime, and a cheap and dangerous socialism, are the inevitable results\r\nof this pondering. I see now that ragged black man sitting on a log,\r\naimlessly whittling a stick. He muttered to me with the murmur of many\r\nages, when he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhite man sit down whole year; Nigger work day and\r\nnight and make crop; Nigger hardly gits bread and meat; white man\r\nsittin\xe2\x80\x99 down gits all. _It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong._\xe2\x80\x9d And what do the better classes of\r\nNegroes do to improve their situation? One of two things: if any way\r\npossible, they buy land; if not, they migrate to town. Just as\r\ncenturies ago it was no easy thing for the serf to escape into the\r\nfreedom of town-life, even so to-day there are hindrances laid in the\r\nway of county laborers. In considerable parts of all the Gulf States,\r\nand especially in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, the Negroes on\r\nthe plantations in the back-country districts are still held at forced\r\nlabor practically without wages. Especially is this true in districts\r\nwhere the farmers are composed of the more ignorant class of poor\r\nwhites, and the Negroes are beyond the reach of schools and intercourse\r\nwith their advancing fellows. If such a peon should run away, the\r\nsheriff, elected by white suffrage, can usually be depended on to catch\r\nthe fugitive, return him, and ask no questions. If he escape to another\r\ncounty, a charge of petty thieving, easily true, can be depended upon\r\nto secure his return. Even if some unduly officious person insist upon\r\na trial, neighborly comity will probably make his conviction sure, and\r\nthen the labor due the county can easily be bought by the master. Such\r\na system is impossible in the more civilized parts of the South, or\r\nnear the large towns and cities; but in those vast stretches of land\r\nbeyond the telegraph and the newspaper the spirit of the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment is sadly broken. This represents the lowest economic depths\r\nof the black American peasant; and in a study of the rise and condition\r\nof the Negro freeholder we must trace his economic progress from the\r\nmodern serfdom.\r\n\r\nEven in the better-ordered country districts of the South the free\r\nmovement of agricultural laborers is hindered by the migration-agent\r\nlaws. The \xe2\x80\x9cAssociated Press\xe2\x80\x9d recently informed the world of the arrest\r\nof a young white man in Southern Georgia who represented the \xe2\x80\x9cAtlantic\r\nNaval Supplies Company,\xe2\x80\x9d and who \xe2\x80\x9cwas caught in the act of enticing\r\nhands from the turpentine farm of Mr. John Greer.\xe2\x80\x9d The crime for which\r\nthis young man was arrested is taxed five hundred dollars for each\r\ncounty in which the employment agent proposes to gather laborers for\r\nwork outside the State. Thus the Negroes\xe2\x80\x99 ignorance of the labor-market\r\noutside his own vicinity is increased rather than diminished by the\r\nlaws of nearly every Southern State.\r\n\r\nSimilar to such measures is the unwritten law of the back districts and\r\nsmall towns of the South, that the character of all Negroes unknown to\r\nthe mass of the community must be vouched for by some white man. This\r\nis really a revival of the old Roman idea of the patron under whose\r\nprotection the new-made freedman was put. In many instances this system\r\nhas been of great good to the Negro, and very often under the\r\nprotection and guidance of the former master\xe2\x80\x99s family, or other white\r\nfriends, the freedman progressed in wealth and morality. But the same\r\nsystem has in other cases resulted in the refusal of whole communities\r\nto recognize the right of a Negro to change his habitation and to be\r\nmaster of his own fortunes. A black stranger in Baker County, Georgia,\r\nfor instance, is liable to be stopped anywhere on the public highway\r\nand made to state his business to the satisfaction of any white\r\ninterrogator. If he fails to give a suitable answer, or seems too\r\nindependent or \xe2\x80\x9csassy,\xe2\x80\x9d he may be arrested or summarily driven away.\r\n\r\nThus it is that in the country districts of the South, by written or\r\nunwritten law, peonage, hindrances to the migration of labor, and a\r\nsystem of white patronage exists over large areas. Besides this, the\r\nchance for lawless oppression and illegal exactions is vastly greater\r\nin the country than in the city, and nearly all the more serious race\r\ndisturbances of the last decade have arisen from disputes in the count\r\nbetween master and man,\xe2\x80\x94as, for instance, the Sam Hose affair. As a\r\nresult of such a situation, there arose, first, the Black Belt; and,\r\nsecond, the Migration to Town. The Black Belt was not, as many assumed,\r\na movement toward fields of labor under more genial climatic\r\nconditions; it was primarily a huddling for self-protection,\xe2\x80\x94a massing\r\nof the black population for mutual defence in order to secure the peace\r\nand tranquillity necessary to economic advance. This movement took\r\nplace between Emancipation and 1880, and only partially accomplished\r\nthe desired results. The rush to town since 1880 is the\r\ncounter-movement of men disappointed in the economic opportunities of\r\nthe Black Belt.\r\n\r\nIn Dougherty County, Georgia, one can see easily the results of this\r\nexperiment in huddling for protection. Only ten per cent of the adult\r\npopulation was born in the county, and yet the blacks outnumber the\r\nwhites four or five to one. There is undoubtedly a security to the\r\nblacks in their very numbers,\xe2\x80\x94a personal freedom from arbitrary\r\ntreatment, which makes hundreds of laborers cling to Dougherty in spite\r\nof low wages and economic distress. But a change is coming, and slowly\r\nbut surely even here the agricultural laborers are drifting to town and\r\nleaving the broad acres behind. Why is this? Why do not the Negroes\r\nbecome land-owners, and build up the black landed peasantry, which has\r\nfor a generation and more been the dream of philanthropist and\r\nstatesman?\r\n\r\nTo the car-window sociologist, to the man who seeks to understand and\r\nknow the South by devoting the few leisure hours of a holiday trip to\r\nunravelling the snarl of centuries,\xe2\x80\x94to such men very often the whole\r\ntrouble with the black field-hand may be summed up by Aunt Ophelia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nword, \xe2\x80\x9cShiftless!\xe2\x80\x9d They have noted repeatedly scenes like one I saw\r\nlast summer. We were riding along the highroad to town at the close of\r\na long hot day. A couple of young black fellows passed us in a\r\nmuleteam, with several bushels of loose corn in the ear. One was\r\ndriving, listlessly bent forward, his elbows on his knees,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhappy-go-lucky, careless picture of irresponsibility. The other was\r\nfast asleep in the bottom of the wagon. As we passed we noticed an ear\r\nof corn fall from the wagon. They never saw it,\xe2\x80\x94not they. A rod farther\r\non we noted another ear on the ground; and between that creeping mule\r\nand town we counted twenty-six ears of corn. Shiftless? Yes, the\r\npersonification of shiftlessness. And yet follow those boys: they are\r\nnot lazy; to-morrow morning they\xe2\x80\x99ll be up with the sun; they work hard\r\nwhen they do work, and they work willingly. They have no sordid,\r\nselfish, money-getting ways, but rather a fine disdain for mere cash.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll loaf before your face and work behind your back with\r\ngood-natured honesty. They\xe2\x80\x99ll steal a watermelon, and hand you back\r\nyour lost purse intact. Their great defect as laborers lies in their\r\nlack of incentive beyond the mere pleasure of physical exertion. They\r\nare careless because they have not found that it pays to be careful;\r\nthey are improvident because the improvident ones of their acquaintance\r\nget on about as well as the provident. Above all, they cannot see why\r\nthey should take unusual pains to make the white man\xe2\x80\x99s land better, or\r\nto fatten his mule, or save his corn. On the other hand, the white\r\nland-owner argues that any attempt to improve these laborers by\r\nincreased responsibility, or higher wages, or better homes, or land of\r\ntheir own, would be sure to result in failure. He shows his Northern\r\nvisitor the scarred and wretched land; the ruined mansions, the\r\nworn-out soil and mortgaged acres, and says, This is Negro freedom!\r\n\r\nNow it happens that both master and man have just enough argument on\r\ntheir respective sides to make it difficult for them to understand each\r\nother. The Negro dimly personifies in the white man all his ills and\r\nmisfortunes; if he is poor, it is because the white man seizes the\r\nfruit of his toil; if he is ignorant, it is because the white man gives\r\nhim neither time nor facilities to learn; and, indeed, if any\r\nmisfortune happens to him, it is because of some hidden machinations of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhite folks.\xe2\x80\x9d On the other hand, the masters and the masters\xe2\x80\x99 sons\r\nhave never been able to see why the Negro, instead of settling down to\r\nbe day-laborers for bread and clothes, are infected with a silly desire\r\nto rise in the world, and why they are sulky, dissatisfied, and\r\ncareless, where their fathers were happy and dumb and faithful. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nyou niggers have an easier time than I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said a puzzled Albany\r\nmerchant to his black customer. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand so does yo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTaking, then, the dissatisfied and shiftless field-hand as a\r\nstarting-point, let us inquire how the black thousands of Dougherty\r\nhave struggled from him up toward their ideal, and what that ideal is.\r\nAll social struggle is evidenced by the rise, first of economic, then\r\nof social classes, among a homogeneous population. To-day the following\r\neconomic classes are plainly differentiated among these Negroes.\r\n\r\nA \xe2\x80\x9csubmerged tenth\xe2\x80\x9d of croppers, with a few paupers; forty per cent who\r\nare metayers and thirty-nine per cent of semi-metayers and\r\nwage-laborers. There are left five per cent of money-renters and six\r\nper cent of freeholders,\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cUpper Ten\xe2\x80\x9d of the land. The croppers are\r\nentirely without capital, even in the limited sense of food or money to\r\nkeep them from seed-time to harvest. All they furnish is their labor;\r\nthe land-owner furnishes land, stock, tools, seed, and house; and at\r\nthe end of the year the laborer gets from a third to a half of the\r\ncrop. Out of his share, however, comes pay and interest for food and\r\nclothing advanced him during the year. Thus we have a laborer without\r\ncapital and without wages, and an employer whose capital is largely his\r\nemployees\xe2\x80\x99 wages. It is an unsatisfactory arrangement, both for hirer\r\nand hired, and is usually in vogue on poor land with hard-pressed\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nAbove the croppers come the great mass of the black population who work\r\nthe land on their own responsibility, paying rent in cotton and\r\nsupported by the crop-mortgage system. After the war this system was\r\nattractive to the freedmen on account of its larger freedom and its\r\npossibility for making a surplus. But with the carrying out of the\r\ncrop-lien system, the deterioration of the land, and the slavery of\r\ndebt, the position of the metayers has sunk to a dead level of\r\npractically unrewarded toil. Formerly all tenants had some capital, and\r\noften considerable; but absentee landlordism, rising rack-rent, and\r\nfailing cotton have stripped them well-nigh of all, and probably not\r\nover half of them to-day own their mules. The change from cropper to\r\ntenant was accomplished by fixing the rent. If, now, the rent fixed was\r\nreasonable, this was an incentive to the tenant to strive. On the other\r\nhand, if the rent was too high, or if the land deteriorated, the result\r\nwas to discourage and check the efforts of the black peasantry. There\r\nis no doubt that the latter case is true; that in Dougherty County\r\nevery economic advantage of the price of cotton in market and of the\r\nstrivings of the tenant has been taken advantage of by the landlords\r\nand merchants, and swallowed up in rent and interest. If cotton rose in\r\nprice, the rent rose even higher; if cotton fell, the rent remained or\r\nfollowed reluctantly. If the tenant worked hard and raised a large\r\ncrop, his rent was raised the next year; if that year the crop failed,\r\nhis corn was confiscated and his mule sold for debt. There were, of\r\ncourse, exceptions to this,\xe2\x80\x94cases of personal kindness and forbearance;\r\nbut in the vast majority of cases the rule was to extract the uttermost\r\nfarthing from the mass of the black farm laborers.\r\n\r\nThe average metayer pays from twenty to thirty per cent of his crop in\r\nrent. The result of such rack-rent can only be evil,\xe2\x80\x94abuse and neglect\r\nof the soil, deterioration in the character of the laborers, and a\r\nwidespread sense of injustice. \xe2\x80\x9cWherever the country is poor,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nArthur Young, \xe2\x80\x9cit is in the hands of metayers,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctheir condition is\r\nmore wretched than that of day-laborers.\xe2\x80\x9d He was talking of Italy a\r\ncentury ago; but he might have been talking of Dougherty County to-day.\r\nAnd especially is that true to-day which he declares was true in France\r\nbefore the Revolution: \xe2\x80\x9cThe metayers are considered as little better\r\nthan menial servants, removable at pleasure, and obliged to conform in\r\nall things to the will of the landlords.\xe2\x80\x9d On this low plane half the\r\nblack population of Dougherty County\xe2\x80\x94perhaps more than half the black\r\nmillions of this land\xe2\x80\x94are to-day struggling.\r\n\r\nA degree above these we may place those laborers who receive money\r\nwages for their work. Some receive a house with perhaps a garden-spot;\r\nthen supplies of food and clothing are advanced, and certain fixed\r\nwages are given at the end of the year, varying from thirty to sixty\r\ndollars, out of which the supplies must be paid for, with interest.\r\nAbout eighteen per cent of the population belong to this class of\r\nsemi-metayers, while twenty-two per cent are laborers paid by the month\r\nor year, and are either \xe2\x80\x9cfurnished\xe2\x80\x9d by their own savings or perhaps\r\nmore usually by some merchant who takes his chances of payment. Such\r\nlaborers receive from thirty-five to fifty cents a day during the\r\nworking season. They are usually young unmarried persons, some being\r\nwomen; and when they marry they sink to the class of metayers, or, more\r\nseldom, become renters.\r\n\r\nThe renters for fixed money rentals are the first of the emerging\r\nclasses, and form five per cent of the families. The sole advantage of\r\nthis small class is their freedom to choose their crops, and the\r\nincreased responsibility which comes through having money transactions.\r\nWhile some of the renters differ little in condition from the metayers,\r\nyet on the whole they are more intelligent and responsible persons, and\r\nare the ones who eventually become land-owners. Their better character\r\nand greater shrewdness enable them to gain, perhaps to demand, better\r\nterms in rents; rented farms, varying from forty to a hundred acres,\r\nbear an average rental of about fifty-four dollars a year. The men who\r\nconduct such farms do not long remain renters; either they sink to\r\nmetayers, or with a successful series of harvests rise to be\r\nland-owners.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the tax-books of Dougherty report no Negroes as landholders. If\r\nthere were any such at that time,\xe2\x80\x94and there may have been a few,\xe2\x80\x94their\r\nland was probably held in the name of some white patron,\xe2\x80\x94a method not\r\nuncommon during slavery. In 1875 ownership of land had begun with seven\r\nhundred and fifty acres; ten years later this had increased to over\r\nsixty-five hundred acres, to nine thousand acres in 1890 and ten\r\nthousand in 1900. The total assessed property has in this same period\r\nrisen from eighty thousand dollars in 1875 to two hundred and forty\r\nthousand dollars in 1900.\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances complicate this development and make it in some\r\nrespects difficult to be sure of the real tendencies; they are the\r\npanic of 1893, and the low price of cotton in 1898. Besides this, the\r\nsystem of assessing property in the country districts of Georgia is\r\nsomewhat antiquated and of uncertain statistical value; there are no\r\nassessors, and each man makes a sworn return to a tax-receiver. Thus\r\npublic opinion plays a large part, and the returns vary strangely from\r\nyear to year. Certainly these figures show the small amount of\r\naccumulated capital among the Negroes, and the consequent large\r\ndependence of their property on temporary prosperity. They have little\r\nto tide over a few years of economic depression, and are at the mercy\r\nof the cotton-market far more than the whites. And thus the\r\nland-owners, despite their marvellous efforts, are really a transient\r\nclass, continually being depleted by those who fall back into the class\r\nof renters or metayers, and augmented by newcomers from the masses. Of\r\none hundred land-owners in 1898, half had bought their land since 1893,\r\na fourth between 1890 and 1893, a fifth between 1884 and 1890, and the\r\nrest between 1870 and 1884. In all, one hundred and eighty-five Negroes\r\nhave owned land in this county since 1875.\r\n\r\nIf all the black land-owners who had ever held land here had kept it or\r\nleft it in the hands of black men, the Negroes would have owned nearer\r\nthirty thousand acres than the fifteen thousand they now hold. And yet\r\nthese fifteen thousand acres are a creditable showing,\xe2\x80\x94a proof of no\r\nlittle weight of the worth and ability of the Negro people. If they had\r\nbeen given an economic start at Emancipation, if they had been in an\r\nenlightened and rich community which really desired their best good,\r\nthen we might perhaps call such a result small or even insignificant.\r\nBut for a few thousand poor ignorant field-hands, in the face of\r\npoverty, a falling market, and social stress, to save and capitalize\r\ntwo hundred thousand dollars in a generation has meant a tremendous\r\neffort. The rise of a nation, the pressing forward of a social class,\r\nmeans a bitter struggle, a hard and soul-sickening battle with the\r\nworld such as few of the more favored classes know or appreciate.\r\n\r\nOut of the hard economic conditions of this portion of the Black Belt,\r\nonly six per cent of the population have succeeded in emerging into\r\npeasant proprietorship; and these are not all firmly fixed, but grow\r\nand shrink in number with the wavering of the cotton-market. Fully\r\nninety-four per cent have struggled for land and failed, and half of\r\nthem sit in hopeless serfdom. For these there is one other avenue of\r\nescape toward which they have turned in increasing numbers, namely,\r\nmigration to town. A glance at the distribution of land among the black\r\nowners curiously reveals this fact. In 1898 the holdings were as\r\nfollows: Under forty acres, forty-nine families; forty to two hundred\r\nand fifty acres, seventeen families; two hundred and fifty to one\r\nthousand acres, thirteen families; one thousand or more acres, two\r\nfamilies. Now in 1890 there were forty-four holdings, but only nine of\r\nthese were under forty acres. The great increase of holdings, then, has\r\ncome in the buying of small homesteads near town, where their owners\r\nreally share in the town life; this is a part of the rush to town. And\r\nfor every land-owner who has thus hurried away from the narrow and hard\r\nconditions of country life, how many field-hands, how many tenants, how\r\nmany ruined renters, have joined that long procession? Is it not\r\nstrange compensation? The sin of the country districts is visited on\r\nthe town, and the social sores of city life to-day may, here in\r\nDougherty County, and perhaps in many places near and far, look for\r\ntheir final healing without the city walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nOf the Sons of Master and Man\r\n\r\nLife treads on life, and heart on heart;\r\nWe press too close in church and mart\r\nTo keep a dream or grave apart.\r\n\r\nMRS. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world-old phenomenon of the contact of diverse races of men is to\r\nhave new exemplification during the new century. Indeed, the\r\ncharacteristic of our age is the contact of European civilization with\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s undeveloped peoples. Whatever we may say of the results of\r\nsuch contact in the past, it certainly forms a chapter in human action\r\nnot pleasant to look back upon. War, murder, slavery, extermination,\r\nand debauchery,\xe2\x80\x94this has again and again been the result of carrying\r\ncivilization and the blessed gospel to the isles of the sea and the\r\nheathen without the law. Nor does it altogether satisfy the conscience\r\nof the modern world to be told complacently that all this has been\r\nright and proper, the fated triumph of strength over weakness, of\r\nrighteousness over evil, of superiors over inferiors. It would\r\ncertainly be soothing if one could readily believe all this; and yet\r\nthere are too many ugly facts for everything to be thus easily\r\nexplained away. We feel and know that there are many delicate\r\ndifferences in race psychology, numberless changes that our crude\r\nsocial measurements are not yet able to follow minutely, which explain\r\nmuch of history and social development. At the same time, too, we know\r\nthat these considerations have never adequately explained or excused\r\nthe triumph of brute force and cunning over weakness and innocence.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, the strife of all honorable men of the twentieth century\r\nto see that in the future competition of races the survival of the\r\nfittest shall mean the triumph of the good, the beautiful, and the\r\ntrue; that we may be able to preserve for future civilization all that\r\nis really fine and noble and strong, and not continue to put a premium\r\non greed and impudence and cruelty. To bring this hope to fruition, we\r\nare compelled daily to turn more and more to a conscientious study of\r\nthe phenomena of race-contact,\xe2\x80\x94to a study frank and fair, and not\r\nfalsified and colored by our wishes or our fears. And we have in the\r\nSouth as fine a field for such a study as the world affords,\xe2\x80\x94a field,\r\nto be sure, which the average American scientist deems somewhat beneath\r\nhis dignity, and which the average man who is not a scientist knows all\r\nabout, but nevertheless a line of study which by reason of the enormous\r\nrace complications with which God seems about to punish this nation\r\nmust increasingly claim our sober attention, study, and thought, we\r\nmust ask, what are the actual relations of whites and blacks in the\r\nSouth? and we must be answered, not by apology or fault-finding, but by\r\na plain, unvarnished tale.\r\n\r\nIn the civilized life of to-day the contact of men and their relations\r\nto each other fall in a few main lines of action and communication:\r\nthere is, first, the physical proximity of home and dwelling-places,\r\nthe way in which neighborhoods group themselves, and the contiguity of\r\nneighborhoods. Secondly, and in our age chiefest, there are the\r\neconomic relations,\xe2\x80\x94the methods by which individuals cooperate for\r\nearning a living, for the mutual satisfaction of wants, for the\r\nproduction of wealth. Next, there are the political relations, the\r\ncooperation in social control, in group government, in laying and\r\npaying the burden of taxation. In the fourth place there are the less\r\ntangible but highly important forms of intellectual contact and\r\ncommerce, the interchange of ideas through conversation and conference,\r\nthrough periodicals and libraries; and, above all, the gradual\r\nformation for each community of that curious _tertium quid_ which we\r\ncall public opinion. Closely allied with this come the various forms of\r\nsocial contact in everyday life, in travel, in theatres, in house\r\ngatherings, in marrying and giving in marriage. Finally, there are the\r\nvarying forms of religious enterprise, of moral teaching and benevolent\r\nendeavor. These are the principal ways in which men living in the same\r\ncommunities are brought into contact with each other. It is my present\r\ntask, therefore, to indicate, from my point of view, how the black race\r\nin the South meet and mingle with the whites in these matters of\r\neveryday life.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to physical dwelling. It is usually possible to draw in\r\nnearly every Southern community a physical color-line on the map, on\r\nthe one side of which whites dwell and on the other Negroes. The\r\nwinding and intricacy of the geographical color-line varies, of course,\r\nin different communities. I know some towns where a straight line drawn\r\nthrough the middle of the main street separates nine-tenths of the\r\nwhites from nine-tenths of the blacks. In other towns the older\r\nsettlement of whites has been encircled by a broad band of blacks; in\r\nstill other cases little settlements or nuclei of blacks have sprung up\r\namid surrounding whites. Usually in cities each street has its\r\ndistinctive color, and only now and then do the colors meet in close\r\nproximity. Even in the country something of this segregation is\r\nmanifest in the smaller areas, and of course in the larger phenomena of\r\nthe Black Belt.\r\n\r\nAll this segregation by color is largely independent of that natural\r\nclustering by social grades common to all communities. A Negro slum may\r\nbe in dangerous proximity to a white residence quarter, while it is\r\nquite common to find a white slum planted in the heart of a respectable\r\nNegro district. One thing, however, seldom occurs: the best of the\r\nwhites and the best of the Negroes almost never live in anything like\r\nclose proximity. It thus happens that in nearly every Southern town and\r\ncity, both whites and blacks see commonly the worst of each other. This\r\nis a vast change from the situation in the past, when, through the\r\nclose contact of master and house-servant in the patriarchal big house,\r\none found the best of both races in close contact and sympathy, while\r\nat the same time the squalor and dull round of toil among the\r\nfield-hands was removed from the sight and hearing of the family. One\r\ncan easily see how a person who saw slavery thus from his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparlors, and sees freedom on the streets of a great city, fails to\r\ngrasp or comprehend the whole of the new picture. On the other hand,\r\nthe settled belief of the mass of the Negroes that the Southern white\r\npeople do not have the black man\xe2\x80\x99s best interests at heart has been\r\nintensified in later years by this continual daily contact of the\r\nbetter class of blacks with the worst representatives of the white\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nComing now to the economic relations of the races, we are on ground\r\nmade familiar by study, much discussion, and no little philanthropic\r\neffort. And yet with all this there are many essential elements in the\r\ncooperation of Negroes and whites for work and wealth that are too\r\nreadily overlooked or not thoroughly understood. The average American\r\ncan easily conceive of a rich land awaiting development and filled with\r\nblack laborers. To him the Southern problem is simply that of making\r\nefficient workingmen out of this material, by giving them the requisite\r\ntechnical skill and the help of invested capital. The problem, however,\r\nis by no means as simple as this, from the obvious fact that these\r\nworkingmen have been trained for centuries as slaves. They exhibit,\r\ntherefore, all the advantages and defects of such training; they are\r\nwilling and good-natured, but not self-reliant, provident, or careful.\r\nIf now the economic development of the South is to be pushed to the\r\nverge of exploitation, as seems probable, then we have a mass of\r\nworkingmen thrown into relentless competition with the workingmen of\r\nthe world, but handicapped by a training the very opposite to that of\r\nthe modern self-reliant democratic laborer. What the black laborer\r\nneeds is careful personal guidance, group leadership of men with hearts\r\nin their bosoms, to train them to foresight, carefulness, and honesty.\r\nNor does it require any fine-spun theories of racial differences to\r\nprove the necessity of such group training after the brains of the race\r\nhave been knocked out by two hundred and fifty years of assiduous\r\neducation in submission, carelessness, and stealing. After\r\nEmancipation, it was the plain duty of some one to assume this group\r\nleadership and training of the Negro laborer. I will not stop here to\r\ninquire whose duty it was\xe2\x80\x94whether that of the white ex-master who had\r\nprofited by unpaid toil, or the Northern philanthropist whose\r\npersistence brought on the crisis, or the National Government whose\r\nedict freed the bondmen; I will not stop to ask whose duty it was, but\r\nI insist it was the duty of some one to see that these workingmen were\r\nnot left alone and unguided, without capital, without land, without\r\nskill, without economic organization, without even the bald protection\r\nof law, order, and decency,\xe2\x80\x94left in a great land, not to settle down to\r\nslow and careful internal development, but destined to be thrown almost\r\nimmediately into relentless and sharp competition with the best of\r\nmodern workingmen under an economic system where every participant is\r\nfighting for himself, and too often utterly regardless of the rights or\r\nwelfare of his neighbor.\r\n\r\nFor we must never forget that the economic system of the South to-day\r\nwhich has succeeded the old regime is not the same system as that of\r\nthe old industrial North, of England, or of France, with their\r\ntrade-unions, their restrictive laws, their written and unwritten\r\ncommercial customs, and their long experience. It is, rather, a copy of\r\nthat England of the early nineteenth century, before the factory\r\nacts,\xe2\x80\x94the England that wrung pity from thinkers and fired the wrath of\r\nCarlyle. The rod of empire that passed from the hands of Southern\r\ngentlemen in 1865, partly by force, partly by their own petulance, has\r\nnever returned to them. Rather it has passed to those men who have come\r\nto take charge of the industrial exploitation of the New South,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsons of poor whites fired with a new thirst for wealth and power,\r\nthrifty and avaricious Yankees, and unscrupulous immigrants. Into the\r\nhands of these men the Southern laborers, white and black, have fallen;\r\nand this to their sorrow. For the laborers as such, there is in these\r\nnew captains of industry neither love nor hate, neither sympathy nor\r\nromance; it is a cold question of dollars and dividends. Under such a\r\nsystem all labor is bound to suffer. Even the white laborers are not\r\nyet intelligent, thrifty, and well trained enough to maintain\r\nthemselves against the powerful inroads of organized capital. The\r\nresults among them, even, are long hours of toil, low wages, child\r\nlabor, and lack of protection against usury and cheating. But among the\r\nblack laborers all this is aggravated, first, by a race prejudice which\r\nvaries from a doubt and distrust among the best element of whites to a\r\nfrenzied hatred among the worst; and, secondly, it is aggravated, as I\r\nhave said before, by the wretched economic heritage of the freedmen\r\nfrom slavery. With this training it is difficult for the freedman to\r\nlearn to grasp the opportunities already opened to him, and the new\r\nopportunities are seldom given him, but go by favor to the whites.\r\n\r\nLeft by the best elements of the South with little protection or\r\noversight, he has been made in law and custom the victim of the worst\r\nand most unscrupulous men in each community. The crop-lien system which\r\nis depopulating the fields of the South is not simply the result of\r\nshiftlessness on the part of Negroes, but is also the result of\r\ncunningly devised laws as to mortgages, liens, and misdemeanors, which\r\ncan be made by conscienceless men to entrap and snare the unwary until\r\nescape is impossible, further toil a farce, and protest a crime. I have\r\nseen, in the Black Belt of Georgia, an ignorant, honest Negro buy and\r\npay for a farm in installments three separate times, and then in the\r\nface of law and decency the enterprising American who sold it to him\r\npocketed the money and deed and left the black man landless, to labor\r\non his own land at thirty cents a day. I have seen a black farmer fall\r\nin debt to a white storekeeper, and that storekeeper go to his farm and\r\nstrip it of every single marketable article,\xe2\x80\x94mules, ploughs, stored\r\ncrops, tools, furniture, bedding, clocks, looking-glass,\xe2\x80\x94and all this\r\nwithout a sheriff or officer, in the face of the law for homestead\r\nexemptions, and without rendering to a single responsible person any\r\naccount or reckoning. And such proceedings can happen, and will happen,\r\nin any community where a class of ignorant toilers are placed by custom\r\nand race-prejudice beyond the pale of sympathy and race-brotherhood. So\r\nlong as the best elements of a community do not feel in duty bound to\r\nprotect and train and care for the weaker members of their group, they\r\nleave them to be preyed upon by these swindlers and rascals.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate economic situation does not mean the hindrance of all\r\nadvance in the black South, or the absence of a class of black\r\nlandlords and mechanics who, in spite of disadvantages, are\r\naccumulating property and making good citizens. But it does mean that\r\nthis class is not nearly so large as a fairer economic system might\r\neasily make it, that those who survive in the competition are\r\nhandicapped so as to accomplish much less than they deserve to, and\r\nthat, above all, the _personnel_ of the successful class is left to\r\nchance and accident, and not to any intelligent culling or reasonable\r\nmethods of selection. As a remedy for this, there is but one possible\r\nprocedure. We must accept some of the race prejudice in the South as a\r\nfact,\xe2\x80\x94deplorable in its intensity, unfortunate in results, and\r\ndangerous for the future, but nevertheless a hard fact which only time\r\ncan efface. We cannot hope, then, in this generation, or for several\r\ngenerations, that the mass of the whites can be brought to assume that\r\nclose sympathetic and self-sacrificing leadership of the blacks which\r\ntheir present situation so eloquently demands. Such leadership, such\r\nsocial teaching and example, must come from the blacks themselves. For\r\nsome time men doubted as to whether the Negro could develop such\r\nleaders; but to-day no one seriously disputes the capability of\r\nindividual Negroes to assimilate the culture and common sense of modern\r\ncivilization, and to pass it on, to some extent at least, to their\r\nfellows. If this is true, then here is the path out of the economic\r\nsituation, and here is the imperative demand for trained Negro leaders\r\nof character and intelligence,\xe2\x80\x94men of skill, men of light and leading,\r\ncollege-bred men, black captains of industry, and missionaries of\r\nculture; men who thoroughly comprehend and know modern civilization,\r\nand can take hold of Negro communities and raise and train them by\r\nforce of precept and example, deep sympathy, and the inspiration of\r\ncommon blood and ideals. But if such men are to be effective they must\r\nhave some power,\xe2\x80\x94they must be backed by the best public opinion of\r\nthese communities, and able to wield for their objects and aims such\r\nweapons as the experience of the world has taught are indispensable to\r\nhuman progress.\r\n\r\nOf such weapons the greatest, perhaps, in the modern world is the power\r\nof the ballot; and this brings me to a consideration of the third form\r\nof contact between whites and blacks in the South,\xe2\x80\x94political activity.\r\n\r\nIn the attitude of the American mind toward Negro suffrage can be\r\ntraced with unusual accuracy the prevalent conceptions of government.\r\nIn the fifties we were near enough the echoes of the French Revolution\r\nto believe pretty thoroughly in universal suffrage. We argued, as we\r\nthought then rather logically, that no social class was so good, so\r\ntrue, and so disinterested as to be trusted wholly with the political\r\ndestiny of its neighbors; that in every state the best arbiters of\r\ntheir own welfare are the persons directly affected; consequently that\r\nit is only by arming every hand with a ballot,\xe2\x80\x94with the right to have a\r\nvoice in the policy of the state,\xe2\x80\x94that the greatest good to the\r\ngreatest number could be attained. To be sure, there were objections to\r\nthese arguments, but we thought we had answered them tersely and\r\nconvincingly; if some one complained of the ignorance of voters, we\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cEducate them.\xe2\x80\x9d If another complained of their venality, we\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cDisfranchise them or put them in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d And, finally, to the\r\nmen who feared demagogues and the natural perversity of some human\r\nbeings we insisted that time and bitter experience would teach the most\r\nhardheaded. It was at this time that the question of Negro suffrage in\r\nthe South was raised. Here was a defenceless people suddenly made free.\r\nHow were they to be protected from those who did not believe in their\r\nfreedom and were determined to thwart it? Not by force, said the North;\r\nnot by government guardianship, said the South; then by the ballot, the\r\nsole and legitimate defence of a free people, said the Common Sense of\r\nthe Nation. No one thought, at the time, that the ex-slaves could use\r\nthe ballot intelligently or very effectively; but they did think that\r\nthe possession of so great power by a great class in the nation would\r\ncompel their fellows to educate this class to its intelligent use.\r\n\r\nMeantime, new thoughts came to the nation: the inevitable period of\r\nmoral retrogression and political trickery that ever follows in the\r\nwake of war overtook us. So flagrant became the political scandals that\r\nreputable men began to leave politics alone, and politics consequently\r\nbecame disreputable. Men began to pride themselves on having nothing to\r\ndo with their own government, and to agree tacitly with those who\r\nregarded public office as a private perquisite. In this state of mind\r\nit became easy to wink at the suppression of the Negro vote in the\r\nSouth, and to advise self-respecting Negroes to leave politics entirely\r\nalone. The decent and reputable citizens of the North who neglected\r\ntheir own civic duties grew hilarious over the exaggerated importance\r\nwith which the Negro regarded the franchise. Thus it easily happened\r\nthat more and more the better class of Negroes followed the advice from\r\nabroad and the pressure from home, and took no further interest in\r\npolitics, leaving to the careless and the venal of their race the\r\nexercise of their rights as voters. The black vote that still remained\r\nwas not trained and educated, but further debauched by open and\r\nunblushing bribery, or force and fraud; until the Negro voter was\r\nthoroughly inoculated with the idea that politics was a method of\r\nprivate gain by disreputable means.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, now, to-day, when we are awakening to the fact that the\r\nperpetuity of republican institutions on this continent depends on the\r\npurification of the ballot, the civic training of voters, and the\r\nraising of voting to the plane of a solemn duty which a patriotic\r\ncitizen neglects to his peril and to the peril of his children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren,\xe2\x80\x94in this day, when we are striving for a renaissance of civic\r\nvirtue, what are we going to say to the black voter of the South? Are\r\nwe going to tell him still that politics is a disreputable and useless\r\nform of human activity? Are we going to induce the best class of\r\nNegroes to take less and less interest in government, and to give up\r\ntheir right to take such an interest, without a protest? I am not\r\nsaying a word against all legitimate efforts to purge the ballot of\r\nignorance, pauperism, and crime. But few have pretended that the\r\npresent movement for disfranchisement in the South is for such a\r\npurpose; it has been plainly and frankly declared in nearly every case\r\nthat the object of the disfranchising laws is the elimination of the\r\nblack man from politics.\r\n\r\nNow, is this a minor matter which has no influence on the main question\r\nof the industrial and intellectual development of the Negro? Can we\r\nestablish a mass of black laborers and artisans and landholders in the\r\nSouth who, by law and public opinion, have absolutely no voice in\r\nshaping the laws under which they live and work? Can the modern\r\norganization of industry, assuming as it does free democratic\r\ngovernment and the power and ability of the laboring classes to compel\r\nrespect for their welfare,\xe2\x80\x94can this system be carried out in the South\r\nwhen half its laboring force is voiceless in the public councils and\r\npowerless in its own defence? To-day the black man of the South has\r\nalmost nothing to say as to how much he shall be taxed, or how those\r\ntaxes shall be expended; as to who shall execute the laws, and how they\r\nshall do it; as to who shall make the laws, and how they shall be made.\r\nIt is pitiable that frantic efforts must be made at critical times to\r\nget law-makers in some States even to listen to the respectful\r\npresentation of the black man\xe2\x80\x99s side of a current controversy. Daily\r\nthe Negro is coming more and more to look upon law and justice, not as\r\nprotecting safeguards, but as sources of humiliation and oppression.\r\nThe laws are made by men who have little interest in him; they are\r\nexecuted by men who have absolutely no motive for treating the black\r\npeople with courtesy or consideration; and, finally, the accused\r\nlaw-breaker is tried, not by his peers, but too often by men who would\r\nrather punish ten innocent Negroes than let one guilty one escape.\r\n\r\nI should be the last one to deny the patent weaknesses and shortcomings\r\nof the Negro people; I should be the last to withhold sympathy from the\r\nwhite South in its efforts to solve its intricate social problems. I\r\nfreely acknowledged that it is possible, and sometimes best, that a\r\npartially undeveloped people should be ruled by the best of their\r\nstronger and better neighbors for their own good, until such time as\r\nthey can start and fight the world\xe2\x80\x99s battles alone. I have already\r\npointed out how sorely in need of such economic and spiritual guidance\r\nthe emancipated Negro was, and I am quite willing to admit that if the\r\nrepresentatives of the best white Southern public opinion were the\r\nruling and guiding powers in the South to-day the conditions indicated\r\nwould be fairly well fulfilled. But the point I have insisted upon and\r\nnow emphasize again, is that the best opinion of the South to-day is\r\nnot the ruling opinion. That to leave the Negro helpless and without a\r\nballot to-day is to leave him not to the guidance of the best, but\r\nrather to the exploitation and debauchment of the worst; that this is\r\nno truer of the South than of the North,\xe2\x80\x94of the North than of Europe:\r\nin any land, in any country under modern free competition, to lay any\r\nclass of weak and despised people, be they white, black, or blue, at\r\nthe political mercy of their stronger, richer, and more resourceful\r\nfellows, is a temptation which human nature seldom has withstood and\r\nseldom will withstand.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the political status of the Negro in the South is closely\r\nconnected with the question of Negro crime. There can be no doubt that\r\ncrime among Negroes has sensibly increased in the last thirty years,\r\nand that there has appeared in the slums of great cities a distinct\r\ncriminal class among the blacks. In explaining this unfortunate\r\ndevelopment, we must note two things: (1) that the inevitable result of\r\nEmancipation was to increase crime and criminals, and (2) that the\r\npolice system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves. As\r\nto the first point, we must not forget that under a strict slave system\r\nthere can scarcely be such a thing as crime. But when these variously\r\nconstituted human particles are suddenly thrown broadcast on the sea of\r\nlife, some swim, some sink, and some hang suspended, to be forced up or\r\ndown by the chance currents of a busy hurrying world. So great an\r\neconomic and social revolution as swept the South in \xe2\x80\x9963 meant a\r\nweeding out among the Negroes of the incompetents and vicious, the\r\nbeginning of a differentiation of social grades. Now a rising group of\r\npeople are not lifted bodily from the ground like an inert solid mass,\r\nbut rather stretch upward like a living plant with its roots still\r\nclinging in the mould. The appearance, therefore, of the Negro criminal\r\nwas a phenomenon to be awaited; and while it causes anxiety, it should\r\nnot occasion surprise.\r\n\r\nHere again the hope for the future depended peculiarly on careful and\r\ndelicate dealing with these criminals. Their offences at first were\r\nthose of laziness, carelessness, and impulse, rather than of malignity\r\nor ungoverned viciousness. Such misdemeanors needed discriminating\r\ntreatment, firm but reformatory, with no hint of injustice, and full\r\nproof of guilt. For such dealing with criminals, white or black, the\r\nSouth had no machinery, no adequate jails or reformatories; its police\r\nsystem was arranged to deal with blacks alone, and tacitly assumed that\r\nevery white man was _ipso facto_ a member of that police. Thus grew up\r\na double system of justice, which erred on the white side by undue\r\nleniency and the practical immunity of red-handed criminals, and erred\r\non the black side by undue severity, injustice, and lack of\r\ndiscrimination. For, as I have said, the police system of the South was\r\noriginally designed to keep track of all Negroes, not simply of\r\ncriminals; and when the Negroes were freed and the whole South was\r\nconvinced of the impossibility of free Negro labor, the first and\r\nalmost universal device was to use the courts as a means of reenslaving\r\nthe blacks. It was not then a question of crime, but rather one of\r\ncolor, that settled a man\xe2\x80\x99s conviction on almost any charge. Thus\r\nNegroes came to look upon courts as instruments of injustice and\r\noppression, and upon those convicted in them as martyrs and victims.\r\n\r\nWhen, now, the real Negro criminal appeared, and instead of petty\r\nstealing and vagrancy we began to have highway robbery, burglary,\r\nmurder, and rape, there was a curious effect on both sides the\r\ncolor-line: the Negroes refused to believe the evidence of white\r\nwitnesses or the fairness of white juries, so that the greatest\r\ndeterrent to crime, the public opinion of one\xe2\x80\x99s own social caste, was\r\nlost, and the criminal was looked upon as crucified rather than hanged.\r\nOn the other hand, the whites, used to being careless as to the guilt\r\nor innocence of accused Negroes, were swept in moments of passion\r\nbeyond law, reason, and decency. Such a situation is bound to increase\r\ncrime, and has increased it. To natural viciousness and vagrancy are\r\nbeing daily added motives of revolt and revenge which stir up all the\r\nlatent savagery of both races and make peaceful attention to economic\r\ndevelopment often impossible.\r\n\r\nBut the chief problem in any community cursed with crime is not the\r\npunishment of the criminals, but the preventing of the young from being\r\ntrained to crime. And here again the peculiar conditions of the South\r\nhave prevented proper precautions. I have seen twelve-year-old boys\r\nworking in chains on the public streets of Atlanta, directly in front\r\nof the schools, in company with old and hardened criminals; and this\r\nindiscriminate mingling of men and women and children makes the\r\nchain-gangs perfect schools of crime and debauchery. The struggle for\r\nreformatories, which has gone on in Virginia, Georgia, and other\r\nStates, is the one encouraging sign of the awakening of some\r\ncommunities to the suicidal results of this policy.\r\n\r\nIt is the public schools, however, which can be made, outside the\r\nhomes, the greatest means of training decent self-respecting citizens.\r\nWe have been so hotly engaged recently in discussing trade-schools and\r\nthe higher education that the pitiable plight of the public-school\r\nsystem in the South has almost dropped from view. Of every five dollars\r\nspent for public education in the State of Georgia, the white schools\r\nget four dollars and the Negro one dollar; and even then the white\r\npublic-school system, save in the cities, is bad and cries for reform.\r\nIf this is true of the whites, what of the blacks? I am becoming more\r\nand more convinced, as I look upon the system of common-school training\r\nin the South, that the national government must soon step in and aid\r\npopular education in some way. To-day it has been only by the most\r\nstrenuous efforts on the part of the thinking men of the South that the\r\nNegro\xe2\x80\x99s share of the school fund has not been cut down to a pittance in\r\nsome half-dozen States; and that movement not only is not dead, but in\r\nmany communities is gaining strength. What in the name of reason does\r\nthis nation expect of a people, poorly trained and hard pressed in\r\nsevere economic competition, without political rights, and with\r\nludicrously inadequate common-school facilities? What can it expect but\r\ncrime and listlessness, offset here and there by the dogged struggles\r\nof the fortunate and more determined who are themselves buoyed by the\r\nhope that in due time the country will come to its senses?\r\n\r\nI have thus far sought to make clear the physical, economic, and\r\npolitical relations of the Negroes and whites in the South, as I have\r\nconceived them, including, for the reasons set forth, crime and\r\neducation. But after all that has been said on these more tangible\r\nmatters of human contact, there still remains a part essential to a\r\nproper description of the South which it is difficult to describe or\r\nfix in terms easily understood by strangers. It is, in fine, the\r\natmosphere of the land, the thought and feeling, the thousand and one\r\nlittle actions which go to make up life. In any community or nation it\r\nis these little things which are most elusive to the grasp and yet most\r\nessential to any clear conception of the group life taken as a whole.\r\nWhat is thus true of all communities is peculiarly true of the South,\r\nwhere, outside of written history and outside of printed law, there has\r\nbeen going on for a generation as deep a storm and stress of human\r\nsouls, as intense a ferment of feeling, as intricate a writhing of\r\nspirit, as ever a people experienced. Within and without the sombre\r\nveil of color vast social forces have been at work,\xe2\x80\x94efforts for human\r\nbetterment, movements toward disintegration and despair, tragedies and\r\ncomedies in social and economic life, and a swaying and lifting and\r\nsinking of human hearts which have made this land a land of mingled\r\nsorrow and joy, of change and excitement and unrest.\r\n\r\nThe centre of this spiritual turmoil has ever been the millions of\r\nblack freedmen and their sons, whose destiny is so fatefully bound up\r\nwith that of the nation. And yet the casual observer visiting the South\r\nsees at first little of this. He notes the growing frequency of dark\r\nfaces as he rides along,\xe2\x80\x94but otherwise the days slip lazily on, the sun\r\nshines, and this little world seems as happy and contented as other\r\nworlds he has visited. Indeed, on the question of questions\xe2\x80\x94the Negro\r\nproblem\xe2\x80\x94he hears so little that there almost seems to be a conspiracy\r\nof silence; the morning papers seldom mention it, and then usually in a\r\nfar-fetched academic way, and indeed almost every one seems to forget\r\nand ignore the darker half of the land, until the astonished visitor is\r\ninclined to ask if after all there IS any problem here. But if he\r\nlingers long enough there comes the awakening: perhaps in a sudden\r\nwhirl of passion which leaves him gasping at its bitter intensity; more\r\nlikely in a gradually dawning sense of things he had not at first\r\nnoticed. Slowly but surely his eyes begin to catch the shadows of the\r\ncolor-line: here he meets crowds of Negroes and whites; then he is\r\nsuddenly aware that he cannot discover a single dark face; or again at\r\nthe close of a day\xe2\x80\x99s wandering he may find himself in some strange\r\nassembly, where all faces are tinged brown or black, and where he has\r\nthe vague, uncomfortable feeling of the stranger. He realizes at last\r\nthat silently, resistlessly, the world about flows by him in two great\r\nstreams: they ripple on in the same sunshine, they approach and mingle\r\ntheir waters in seeming carelessness,\xe2\x80\x94then they divide and flow wide\r\napart. It is done quietly; no mistakes are made, or if one occurs, the\r\nswift arm of the law and of public opinion swings down for a moment, as\r\nwhen the other day a black man and a white woman were arrested for\r\ntalking together on Whitehall Street in Atlanta.\r\n\r\nNow if one notices carefully one will see that between these two\r\nworlds, despite much physical contact and daily intermingling, there is\r\nalmost no community of intellectual life or point of transference where\r\nthe thoughts and feelings of one race can come into direct contact and\r\nsympathy with the thoughts and feelings of the other. Before and\r\ndirectly after the war, when all the best of the Negroes were domestic\r\nservants in the best of the white families, there were bonds of\r\nintimacy, affection, and sometimes blood relationship, between the\r\nraces. They lived in the same home, shared in the family life, often\r\nattended the same church, and talked and conversed with each other. But\r\nthe increasing civilization of the Negro since then has naturally meant\r\nthe development of higher classes: there are increasing numbers of\r\nministers, teachers, physicians, merchants, mechanics, and independent\r\nfarmers, who by nature and training are the aristocracy and leaders of\r\nthe blacks. Between them, however, and the best element of the whites,\r\nthere is little or no intellectual commerce. They go to separate\r\nchurches, they live in separate sections, they are strictly separated\r\nin all public gatherings, they travel separately, and they are\r\nbeginning to read different papers and books. To most libraries,\r\nlectures, concerts, and museums, Negroes are either not admitted at\r\nall, or on terms peculiarly galling to the pride of the very classes\r\nwho might otherwise be attracted. The daily paper chronicles the doings\r\nof the black world from afar with no great regard for accuracy; and so\r\non, throughout the category of means for intellectual\r\ncommunication,\xe2\x80\x94schools, conferences, efforts for social betterment, and\r\nthe like,\xe2\x80\x94it is usually true that the very representatives of the two\r\nraces, who for mutual benefit and the welfare of the land ought to be\r\nin complete understanding and sympathy, are so far strangers that one\r\nside thinks all whites are narrow and prejudiced, and the other thinks\r\neducated Negroes dangerous and insolent. Moreover, in a land where the\r\ntyranny of public opinion and the intolerance of criticism is for\r\nobvious historical reasons so strong as in the South, such a situation\r\nis extremely difficult to correct. The white man, as well as the Negro,\r\nis bound and barred by the color-line, and many a scheme of\r\nfriendliness and philanthropy, of broad-minded sympathy and generous\r\nfellowship between the two has dropped still-born because some busybody\r\nhas forced the color-question to the front and brought the tremendous\r\nforce of unwritten law against the innovators.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary for me to add very much in regard to the social\r\ncontact between the races. Nothing has come to replace that finer\r\nsympathy and love between some masters and house servants which the\r\nradical and more uncompromising drawing of the color-line in recent\r\nyears has caused almost completely to disappear. In a world where it\r\nmeans so much to take a man by the hand and sit beside him, to look\r\nfrankly into his eyes and feel his heart beating with red blood; in a\r\nworld where a social cigar or a cup of tea together means more than\r\nlegislative halls and magazine articles and speeches,\xe2\x80\x94one can imagine\r\nthe consequences of the almost utter absence of such social amenities\r\nbetween estranged races, whose separation extends even to parks and\r\nstreetcars.\r\n\r\nHere there can be none of that social going down to the people,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nopening of heart and hand of the best to the worst, in generous\r\nacknowledgment of a common humanity and a common destiny. On the other\r\nhand, in matters of simple almsgiving, where there can be no question\r\nof social contact, and in the succor of the aged and sick, the South,\r\nas if stirred by a feeling of its unfortunate limitations, is generous\r\nto a fault. The black beggar is never turned away without a good deal\r\nmore than a crust, and a call for help for the unfortunate meets quick\r\nresponse. I remember, one cold winter, in Atlanta, when I refrained\r\nfrom contributing to a public relief fund lest Negroes should be\r\ndiscriminated against, I afterward inquired of a friend: \xe2\x80\x9cWere any\r\nblack people receiving aid?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthey were _all_ black.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd yet this does not touch the kernel of the problem. Human\r\nadvancement is not a mere question of almsgiving, but rather of\r\nsympathy and cooperation among classes who would scorn charity. And\r\nhere is a land where, in the higher walks of life, in all the higher\r\nstriving for the good and noble and true, the color-line comes to\r\nseparate natural friends and coworkers; while at the bottom of the\r\nsocial group, in the saloon, the gambling-hell, and the brothel, that\r\nsame line wavers and disappears.\r\n\r\nI have sought to paint an average picture of real relations between the\r\nsons of master and man in the South. I have not glossed over matters\r\nfor policy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for I fear we have already gone too far in that sort\r\nof thing. On the other hand, I have sincerely sought to let no unfair\r\nexaggerations creep in. I do not doubt that in some Southern\r\ncommunities conditions are better than those I have indicated; while I\r\nam no less certain that in other communities they are far worse.\r\n\r\nNor does the paradox and danger of this situation fail to interest and\r\nperplex the best conscience of the South. Deeply religious and\r\nintensely democratic as are the mass of the whites, they feel acutely\r\nthe false position in which the Negro problems place them. Such an\r\nessentially honest-hearted and generous people cannot cite the\r\ncaste-levelling precepts of Christianity, or believe in equality of\r\nopportunity for all men, without coming to feel more and more with each\r\ngeneration that the present drawing of the color-line is a flat\r\ncontradiction to their beliefs and professions. But just as often as\r\nthey come to this point, the present social condition of the Negro\r\nstands as a menace and a portent before even the most open-minded: if\r\nthere were nothing to charge against the Negro but his blackness or\r\nother physical peculiarities, they argue, the problem would be\r\ncomparatively simple; but what can we say to his ignorance,\r\nshiftlessness, poverty, and crime? can a self-respecting group hold\r\nanything but the least possible fellowship with such persons and\r\nsurvive? and shall we let a mawkish sentiment sweep away the culture of\r\nour fathers or the hope of our children? The argument so put is of\r\ngreat strength, but it is not a whit stronger than the argument of\r\nthinking Negroes: granted, they reply, that the condition of our masses\r\nis bad; there is certainly on the one hand adequate historical cause\r\nfor this, and unmistakable evidence that no small number have, in spite\r\nof tremendous disadvantages, risen to the level of American\r\ncivilization. And when, by proscription and prejudice, these same\r\nNegroes are classed with and treated like the lowest of their people,\r\nsimply because they are Negroes, such a policy not only discourages\r\nthrift and intelligence among black men, but puts a direct premium on\r\nthe very things you complain of,\xe2\x80\x94inefficiency and crime. Draw lines of\r\ncrime, of incompetency, of vice, as tightly and uncompromisingly as you\r\nwill, for these things must be proscribed; but a color-line not only\r\ndoes not accomplish this purpose, but thwarts it.\r\n\r\nIn the face of two such arguments, the future of the South depends on\r\nthe ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and\r\nappreciate and sympathize with each other\xe2\x80\x99s position,\xe2\x80\x94for the Negro to\r\nrealize more deeply than he does at present the need of uplifting the\r\nmasses of his people, for the white people to realize more vividly than\r\nthey have yet done the deadening and disastrous effect of a\r\ncolor-prejudice that classes Phillis Wheatley and Sam Hose in the same\r\ndespised class.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough for the Negroes to declare that color-prejudice is the\r\nsole cause of their social condition, nor for the white South to reply\r\nthat their social condition is the main cause of prejudice. They both\r\nact as reciprocal cause and effect, and a change in neither alone will\r\nbring the desired effect. Both must change, or neither can improve to\r\nany great extent. The Negro cannot stand the present reactionary\r\ntendencies and unreasoning drawing of the color-line indefinitely\r\nwithout discouragement and retrogression. And the condition of the\r\nNegro is ever the excuse for further discrimination. Only by a union of\r\nintelligence and sympathy across the color-line in this critical period\r\nof the Republic shall justice and right triumph,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat mind and soul according well,\r\nMay make one music as before,\r\n    But vaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\nOf the Faith of the Fathers\r\n\r\nDim face of Beauty haunting all the world,\r\n    Fair face of Beauty all too fair to see,\r\nWhere the lost stars adown the heavens are hurled,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n        There, there alone for thee\r\n        May white peace be.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeauty, sad face of Beauty, Mystery, Wonder,\r\n    What are these dreams to foolish babbling men\r\nWho cry with little noises \xe2\x80\x99neath the thunder\r\n        Of Ages ground to sand,\r\n        To a little sand.\r\n\r\nFIONA MACLEOD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was out in the country, far from home, far from my foster home, on a\r\ndark Sunday night. The road wandered from our rambling log-house up the\r\nstony bed of a creek, past wheat and corn, until we could hear dimly\r\nacross the fields a rhythmic cadence of song,\xe2\x80\x94soft, thrilling,\r\npowerful, that swelled and died sorrowfully in our ears. I was a\r\ncountry schoolteacher then, fresh from the East, and had never seen a\r\nSouthern Negro revival. To be sure, we in Berkshire were not perhaps as\r\nstiff and formal as they in Suffolk of olden time; yet we were very\r\nquiet and subdued, and I know not what would have happened those clear\r\nSabbath mornings had some one punctuated the sermon with a wild scream,\r\nor interrupted the long prayer with a loud Amen! And so most striking\r\nto me, as I approached the village and the little plain church perched\r\naloft, was the air of intense excitement that possessed that mass of\r\nblack folk. A sort of suppressed terror hung in the air and seemed to\r\nseize us,\xe2\x80\x94a pythian madness, a demoniac possession, that lent terrible\r\nreality to song and word. The black and massive form of the preacher\r\nswayed and quivered as the words crowded to his lips and flew at us in\r\nsingular eloquence. The people moaned and fluttered, and then the\r\ngaunt-cheeked brown woman beside me suddenly leaped straight into the\r\nair and shrieked like a lost soul, while round about came wail and\r\ngroan and outcry, and a scene of human passion such as I had never\r\nconceived before.\r\n\r\nThose who have not thus witnessed the frenzy of a Negro revival in the\r\nuntouched backwoods of the South can but dimly realize the religious\r\nfeeling of the slave; as described, such scenes appear grotesque and\r\nfunny, but as seen they are awful. Three things characterized this\r\nreligion of the slave,\xe2\x80\x94the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy. The\r\nPreacher is the most unique personality developed by the Negro on\r\nAmerican soil. A leader, a politician, an orator, a \xe2\x80\x9cboss,\xe2\x80\x9d an\r\nintriguer, an idealist,\xe2\x80\x94all these he is, and ever, too, the centre of a\r\ngroup of men, now twenty, now a thousand in number. The combination of\r\na certain adroitness with deep-seated earnestness, of tact with\r\nconsummate ability, gave him his preeminence, and helps him maintain\r\nit. The type, of course, varies according to time and place, from the\r\nWest Indies in the sixteenth century to New England in the nineteenth,\r\nand from the Mississippi bottoms to cities like New Orleans or New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe Music of Negro religion is that plaintive rhythmic melody, with its\r\ntouching minor cadences, which, despite caricature and defilement,\r\nstill remains the most original and beautiful expression of human life\r\nand longing yet born on American soil. Sprung from the African forests,\r\nwhere its counterpart can still be heard, it was adapted, changed, and\r\nintensified by the tragic soul-life of the slave, until, under the\r\nstress of law and whip, it became the one true expression of a people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsorrow, despair, and hope.\r\n\r\nFinally the Frenzy of \xe2\x80\x9cShouting,\xe2\x80\x9d when the Spirit of the Lord passed\r\nby, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy, was\r\nthe last essential of Negro religion and the one more devoutly believed\r\nin than all the rest. It varied in expression from the silent rapt\r\ncountenance or the low murmur and moan to the mad abandon of physical\r\nfervor,\xe2\x80\x94the stamping, shrieking, and shouting, the rushing to and fro\r\nand wild waving of arms, the weeping and laughing, the vision and the\r\ntrance. All this is nothing new in the world, but old as religion, as\r\nDelphi and Endor. And so firm a hold did it have on the Negro, that\r\nmany generations firmly believed that without this visible\r\nmanifestation of the God there could be no true communion with the\r\nInvisible.\r\n\r\nThese were the characteristics of Negro religious life as developed up\r\nto the time of Emancipation. Since under the peculiar circumstances of\r\nthe black man\xe2\x80\x99s environment they were the one expression of his higher\r\nlife, they are of deep interest to the student of his development, both\r\nsocially and psychologically. Numerous are the attractive lines of\r\ninquiry that here group themselves. What did slavery mean to the\r\nAfrican savage? What was his attitude toward the World and Life? What\r\nseemed to him good and evil,\xe2\x80\x94God and Devil? Whither went his longings\r\nand strivings, and wherefore were his heart-burnings and\r\ndisappointments? Answers to such questions can come only from a study\r\nof Negro religion as a development, through its gradual changes from\r\nthe heathenism of the Gold Coast to the institutional Negro church of\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the religious growth of millions of men, even though they be\r\nslaves, cannot be without potent influence upon their contemporaries.\r\nThe Methodists and Baptists of America owe much of their condition to\r\nthe silent but potent influence of their millions of Negro converts.\r\nEspecially is this noticeable in the South, where theology and\r\nreligious philosophy are on this account a long way behind the North,\r\nand where the religion of the poor whites is a plain copy of Negro\r\nthought and methods. The mass of \xe2\x80\x9cgospel\xe2\x80\x9d hymns which has swept through\r\nAmerican churches and well-nigh ruined our sense of song consists\r\nlargely of debased imitations of Negro melodies made by ears that\r\ncaught the jingle but not the music, the body but not the soul, of the\r\nJubilee songs. It is thus clear that the study of Negro religion is not\r\nonly a vital part of the history of the Negro in America, but no\r\nuninteresting part of American history.\r\n\r\nThe Negro church of to-day is the social centre of Negro life in the\r\nUnited States, and the most characteristic expression of African\r\ncharacter. Take a typical church in a small Virginia town: it is the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst Baptist\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94a roomy brick edifice seating five hundred or more\r\npersons, tastefully finished in Georgia pine, with a carpet, a small\r\norgan, and stained-glass windows. Underneath is a large assembly room\r\nwith benches. This building is the central club-house of a community of\r\na thousand or more Negroes. Various organizations meet here,\xe2\x80\x94the church\r\nproper, the Sunday-school, two or three insurance societies, women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsocieties, secret societies, and mass meetings of various kinds.\r\nEntertainments, suppers, and lectures are held beside the five or six\r\nregular weekly religious services. Considerable sums of money are\r\ncollected and expended here, employment is found for the idle,\r\nstrangers are introduced, news is disseminated and charity distributed.\r\nAt the same time this social, intellectual, and economic centre is a\r\nreligious centre of great power. Depravity, Sin, Redemption, Heaven,\r\nHell, and Damnation are preached twice a Sunday after the crops are\r\nlaid by; and few indeed of the community have the hardihood to\r\nwithstand conversion. Back of this more formal religion, the Church\r\noften stands as a real conserver of morals, a strengthener of family\r\nlife, and the final authority on what is Good and Right.\r\n\r\nThus one can see in the Negro church to-day, reproduced in microcosm,\r\nall the great world from which the Negro is cut off by color-prejudice\r\nand social condition. In the great city churches the same tendency is\r\nnoticeable and in many respects emphasized. A great church like the\r\nBethel of Philadelphia has over eleven hundred members, an edifice\r\nseating fifteen hundred persons and valued at one hundred thousand\r\ndollars, an annual budget of five thousand dollars, and a government\r\nconsisting of a pastor with several assisting local preachers, an\r\nexecutive and legislative board, financial boards and tax collectors;\r\ngeneral church meetings for making laws; sub-divided groups led by\r\nclass leaders, a company of militia, and twenty-four auxiliary\r\nsocieties. The activity of a church like this is immense and\r\nfar-reaching, and the bishops who preside over these organizations\r\nthroughout the land are among the most powerful Negro rulers in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSuch churches are really governments of men, and consequently a little\r\ninvestigation reveals the curious fact that, in the South, at least,\r\npractically every American Negro is a church member. Some, to be sure,\r\nare not regularly enrolled, and a few do not habitually attend\r\nservices; but, practically, a proscribed people must have a social\r\ncentre, and that centre for this people is the Negro church. The census\r\nof 1890 showed nearly twenty-four thousand Negro churches in the\r\ncountry, with a total enrolled membership of over two and a half\r\nmillions, or ten actual church members to every twenty-eight persons,\r\nand in some Southern States one in every two persons. Besides these\r\nthere is the large number who, while not enrolled as members, attend\r\nand take part in many of the activities of the church. There is an\r\norganized Negro church for every sixty black families in the nation,\r\nand in some States for every forty families, owning, on an average, a\r\nthousand dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of property each, or nearly twenty-six million\r\ndollars in all.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the large development of the Negro church since\r\nEmancipation. The question now is, What have been the successive steps\r\nof this social history and what are the present tendencies? First, we\r\nmust realize that no such institution as the Negro church could rear\r\nitself without definite historical foundations. These foundations we\r\ncan find if we remember that the social history of the Negro did not\r\nstart in America. He was brought from a definite social\r\nenvironment,\xe2\x80\x94the polygamous clan life under the headship of the chief\r\nand the potent influence of the priest. His religion was\r\nnature-worship, with profound belief in invisible surrounding\r\ninfluences, good and bad, and his worship was through incantation and\r\nsacrifice. The first rude change in this life was the slave ship and\r\nthe West Indian sugar-fields. The plantation organization replaced the\r\nclan and tribe, and the white master replaced the chief with far\r\ngreater and more despotic powers. Forced and long-continued toil became\r\nthe rule of life, the old ties of blood relationship and kinship\r\ndisappeared, and instead of the family appeared a new polygamy and\r\npolyandry, which, in some cases, almost reached promiscuity. It was a\r\nterrific social revolution, and yet some traces were retained of the\r\nformer group life, and the chief remaining institution was the Priest\r\nor Medicine-man. He early appeared on the plantation and found his\r\nfunction as the healer of the sick, the interpreter of the Unknown, the\r\ncomforter of the sorrowing, the supernatural avenger of wrong, and the\r\none who rudely but picturesquely expressed the longing, disappointment,\r\nand resentment of a stolen and oppressed people. Thus, as bard,\r\nphysician, judge, and priest, within the narrow limits allowed by the\r\nslave system, rose the Negro preacher, and under him the first church\r\nwas not at first by any means Christian nor definitely organized;\r\nrather it was an adaptation and mingling of heathen rites among the\r\nmembers of each plantation, and roughly designated as Voodooism.\r\nAssociation with the masters, missionary effort and motives of\r\nexpediency gave these rites an early veneer of Christianity, and after\r\nthe lapse of many generations the Negro church became Christian.\r\n\r\nTwo characteristic things must be noticed in regard to the church.\r\nFirst, it became almost entirely Baptist and Methodist in faith;\r\nsecondly, as a social institution it antedated by many decades the\r\nmonogamic Negro home. From the very circumstances of its beginning, the\r\nchurch was confined to the plantation, and consisted primarily of a\r\nseries of disconnected units; although, later on, some freedom of\r\nmovement was allowed, still this geographical limitation was always\r\nimportant and was one cause of the spread of the decentralized and\r\ndemocratic Baptist faith among the slaves. At the same time, the\r\nvisible rite of baptism appealed strongly to their mystic temperament.\r\nTo-day the Baptist Church is still largest in membership among Negroes,\r\nand has a million and a half communicants. Next in popularity came the\r\nchurches organized in connection with the white neighboring churches,\r\nchiefly Baptist and Methodist, with a few Episcopalian and others. The\r\nMethodists still form the second greatest denomination, with nearly a\r\nmillion members. The faith of these two leading denominations was more\r\nsuited to the slave church from the prominence they gave to religious\r\nfeeling and fervor. The Negro membership in other denominations has\r\nalways been small and relatively unimportant, although the\r\nEpiscopalians and Presbyterians are gaining among the more intelligent\r\nclasses to-day, and the Catholic Church is making headway in certain\r\nsections. After Emancipation, and still earlier in the North, the Negro\r\nchurches largely severed such affiliations as they had had with the\r\nwhite churches, either by choice or by compulsion. The Baptist churches\r\nbecame independent, but the Methodists were compelled early to unite\r\nfor purposes of episcopal government. This gave rise to the great\r\nAfrican Methodist Church, the greatest Negro organization in the world,\r\nto the Zion Church and the Colored Methodist, and to the black\r\nconferences and churches in this and other denominations.\r\n\r\nThe second fact noted, namely, that the Negro church antedates the\r\nNegro home, leads to an explanation of much that is paradoxical in this\r\ncommunistic institution and in the morals of its members. But\r\nespecially it leads us to regard this institution as peculiarly the\r\nexpression of the inner ethical life of a people in a sense seldom true\r\nelsewhere. Let us turn, then, from the outer physical development of\r\nthe church to the more important inner ethical life of the people who\r\ncompose it. The Negro has already been pointed out many times as a\r\nreligious animal,\xe2\x80\x94a being of that deep emotional nature which turns\r\ninstinctively toward the supernatural. Endowed with a rich tropical\r\nimagination and a keen, delicate appreciation of Nature, the\r\ntransplanted African lived in a world animate with gods and devils,\r\nelves and witches; full of strange influences,\xe2\x80\x94of Good to be implored,\r\nof Evil to be propitiated. Slavery, then, was to him the dark triumph\r\nof Evil over him. All the hateful powers of the Under-world were\r\nstriving against him, and a spirit of revolt and revenge filled his\r\nheart. He called up all the resources of heathenism to aid,\xe2\x80\x94exorcism\r\nand witch-craft, the mysterious Obi worship with its barbarious rites,\r\nspells, and blood-sacrifice even, now and then, of human victims. Weird\r\nmidnight orgies and mystic conjurations were invoked, the witch-woman\r\nand the voodoo-priest became the centre of Negro group life, and that\r\nvein of vague superstition which characterizes the unlettered Negro\r\neven to-day was deepened and strengthened.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of such success as that of the fierce Maroons, the\r\nDanish blacks, and others, the spirit of revolt gradually died away\r\nunder the untiring energy and superior strength of the slave masters.\r\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century the black slave had sunk, with\r\nhushed murmurs, to his place at the bottom of a new economic system,\r\nand was unconsciously ripe for a new philosophy of life. Nothing suited\r\nhis condition then better than the doctrines of passive submission\r\nembodied in the newly learned Christianity. Slave masters early\r\nrealized this, and cheerfully aided religious propaganda within certain\r\nbounds. The long system of repression and degradation of the Negro\r\ntended to emphasize the elements of his character which made him a\r\nvaluable chattel: courtesy became humility, moral strength degenerated\r\ninto submission, and the exquisite native appreciation of the beautiful\r\nbecame an infinite capacity for dumb suffering. The Negro, losing the\r\njoy of this world, eagerly seized upon the offered conceptions of the\r\nnext; the avenging Spirit of the Lord enjoining patience in this world,\r\nunder sorrow and tribulation until the Great Day when He should lead\r\nHis dark children home,\xe2\x80\x94this became his comforting dream. His preacher\r\nrepeated the prophecy, and his bards sang,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren, we all shall be free\r\nWhen the Lord shall appear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis deep religious fatalism, painted so beautifully in \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncame soon to breed, as all fatalistic faiths will, the sensualist side\r\nby side with the martyr. Under the lax moral life of the plantation,\r\nwhere marriage was a farce, laziness a virtue, and property a theft, a\r\nreligion of resignation and submission degenerated easily, in less\r\nstrenuous minds, into a philosophy of indulgence and crime. Many of the\r\nworst characteristics of the Negro masses of to-day had their seed in\r\nthis period of the slave\xe2\x80\x99s ethical growth. Here it was that the Home\r\nwas ruined under the very shadow of the Church, white and black; here\r\nhabits of shiftlessness took root, and sullen hopelessness replaced\r\nhopeful strife.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the abolition movement and the gradual growth of\r\na class of free Negroes came a change. We often neglect the influence\r\nof the freedman before the war, because of the paucity of his numbers\r\nand the small weight he had in the history of the nation. But we must\r\nnot forget that his chief influence was internal,\xe2\x80\x94was exerted on the\r\nblack world; and that there he was the ethical and social leader.\r\nHuddled as he was in a few centres like Philadelphia, New York, and New\r\nOrleans, the masses of the freedmen sank into poverty and listlessness;\r\nbut not all of them. The free Negro leader early arose and his chief\r\ncharacteristic was intense earnestness and deep feeling on the slavery\r\nquestion. Freedom became to him a real thing and not a dream. His\r\nreligion became darker and more intense, and into his ethics crept a\r\nnote of revenge, into his songs a day of reckoning close at hand. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing of the Lord\xe2\x80\x9d swept this side of Death, and came to be a thing\r\nto be hoped for in this day. Through fugitive slaves and irrepressible\r\ndiscussion this desire for freedom seized the black millions still in\r\nbondage, and became their one ideal of life. The black bards caught new\r\nnotes, and sometimes even dared to sing,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Freedom, O Freedom, O Freedom over me!\r\nBefore I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a slave\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be buried in my grave,\r\nAnd go home to my Lord\r\nAnd be free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nFor fifty years Negro religion thus transformed itself and identified\r\nitself with the dream of Abolition, until that which was a radical fad\r\nin the white North and an anarchistic plot in the white South had\r\nbecome a religion to the black world. Thus, when Emancipation finally\r\ncame, it seemed to the freedman a literal Coming of the Lord. His\r\nfervid imagination was stirred as never before, by the tramp of armies,\r\nthe blood and dust of battle, and the wail and whirl of social\r\nupheaval. He stood dumb and motionless before the whirlwind: what had\r\nhe to do with it? Was it not the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s doing, and marvellous in his\r\neyes? Joyed and bewildered with what came, he stood awaiting new\r\nwonders till the inevitable Age of Reaction swept over the nation and\r\nbrought the crisis of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to explain clearly the present critical stage of Negro\r\nreligion. First, we must remember that living as the blacks do in close\r\ncontact with a great modern nation, and sharing, although imperfectly,\r\nthe soul-life of that nation, they must necessarily be affected more or\r\nless directly by all the religious and ethical forces that are to-day\r\nmoving the United States. These questions and movements are, however,\r\novershadowed and dwarfed by the (to them) all-important question of\r\ntheir civil, political, and economic status. They must perpetually\r\ndiscuss the \xe2\x80\x9cNegro Problem,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94must live, move, and have their being in\r\nit, and interpret all else in its light or darkness. With this come,\r\ntoo, peculiar problems of their inner life,\xe2\x80\x94of the status of women, the\r\nmaintenance of Home, the training of children, the accumulation of\r\nwealth, and the prevention of crime. All this must mean a time of\r\nintense ethical ferment, of religious heart-searching and intellectual\r\nunrest. From the double life every American Negro must live, as a Negro\r\nand as an American, as swept on by the current of the nineteenth while\r\nyet struggling in the eddies of the fifteenth century,\xe2\x80\x94from this must\r\narise a painful self-consciousness, an almost morbid sense of\r\npersonality and a moral hesitancy which is fatal to self-confidence.\r\nThe worlds within and without the Veil of Color are changing, and\r\nchanging rapidly, but not at the same rate, not in the same way; and\r\nthis must produce a peculiar wrenching of the soul, a peculiar sense of\r\ndoubt and bewilderment. Such a double life, with double thoughts,\r\ndouble duties, and double social classes, must give rise to double\r\nwords and double ideals, and tempt the mind to pretence or revolt, to\r\nhypocrisy or radicalism.\r\n\r\nIn some such doubtful words and phrases can one perhaps most clearly\r\npicture the peculiar ethical paradox that faces the Negro of to-day and\r\nis tingeing and changing his religious life. Feeling that his rights\r\nand his dearest ideals are being trampled upon, that the public\r\nconscience is ever more deaf to his righteous appeal, and that all the\r\nreactionary forces of prejudice, greed, and revenge are daily gaining\r\nnew strength and fresh allies, the Negro faces no enviable dilemma.\r\nConscious of his impotence, and pessimistic, he often becomes bitter\r\nand vindictive; and his religion, instead of a worship, is a complaint\r\nand a curse, a wail rather than a hope, a sneer rather than a faith. On\r\nthe other hand, another type of mind, shrewder and keener and more\r\ntortuous too, sees in the very strength of the anti-Negro movement its\r\npatent weaknesses, and with Jesuitic casuistry is deterred by no\r\nethical considerations in the endeavor to turn this weakness to the\r\nblack man\xe2\x80\x99s strength. Thus we have two great and hardly reconcilable\r\nstreams of thought and ethical strivings; the danger of the one lies in\r\nanarchy, that of the other in hypocrisy. The one type of Negro stands\r\nalmost ready to curse God and die, and the other is too often found a\r\ntraitor to right and a coward before force; the one is wedded to ideals\r\nremote, whimsical, perhaps impossible of realization; the other forgets\r\nthat life is more than meat and the body more than raiment. But, after\r\nall, is not this simply the writhing of the age translated into\r\nblack,\xe2\x80\x94the triumph of the Lie which today, with its false culture,\r\nfaces the hideousness of the anarchist assassin?\r\n\r\nTo-day the two groups of Negroes, the one in the North, the other in\r\nthe South, represent these divergent ethical tendencies, the first\r\ntending toward radicalism, the other toward hypocritical compromise. It\r\nis no idle regret with which the white South mourns the loss of the\r\nold-time Negro,\xe2\x80\x94the frank, honest, simple old servant who stood for the\r\nearlier religious age of submission and humility. With all his laziness\r\nand lack of many elements of true manhood, he was at least\r\nopen-hearted, faithful, and sincere. To-day he is gone, but who is to\r\nblame for his going? Is it not those very persons who mourn for him? Is\r\nit not the tendency, born of Reconstruction and Reaction, to found a\r\nsociety on lawlessness and deception, to tamper with the moral fibre of\r\na naturally honest and straightforward people until the whites threaten\r\nto become ungovernable tyrants and the blacks criminals and hypocrites?\r\nDeception is the natural defence of the weak against the strong, and\r\nthe South used it for many years against its conquerors; to-day it must\r\nbe prepared to see its black proletariat turn that same two-edged\r\nweapon against itself. And how natural this is! The death of Denmark\r\nVesey and Nat Turner proved long since to the Negro the present\r\nhopelessness of physical defence. Political defence is becoming less\r\nand less available, and economic defence is still only partially\r\neffective. But there is a patent defence at hand,\xe2\x80\x94the defence of\r\ndeception and flattery, of cajoling and lying. It is the same defence\r\nwhich peasants of the Middle Age used and which left its stamp on their\r\ncharacter for centuries. To-day the young Negro of the South who would\r\nsucceed cannot be frank and outspoken, honest and self-assertive, but\r\nrather he is daily tempted to be silent and wary, politic and sly; he\r\nmust flatter and be pleasant, endure petty insults with a smile, shut\r\nhis eyes to wrong; in too many cases he sees positive personal\r\nadvantage in deception and lying. His real thoughts, his real\r\naspirations, must be guarded in whispers; he must not criticise, he\r\nmust not complain. Patience, humility, and adroitness must, in these\r\ngrowing black youth, replace impulse, manliness, and courage. With this\r\nsacrifice there is an economic opening, and perhaps peace and some\r\nprosperity. Without this there is riot, migration, or crime. Nor is\r\nthis situation peculiar to the Southern United States, is it not rather\r\nthe only method by which undeveloped races have gained the right to\r\nshare modern culture? The price of culture is a Lie.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the North the tendency is to emphasize the\r\nradicalism of the Negro. Driven from his birthright in the South by a\r\nsituation at which every fibre of his more outspoken and assertive\r\nnature revolts, he finds himself in a land where he can scarcely earn a\r\ndecent living amid the harsh competition and the color discrimination.\r\nAt the same time, through schools and periodicals, discussions and\r\nlectures, he is intellectually quickened and awakened. The soul, long\r\npent up and dwarfed, suddenly expands in new-found freedom. What wonder\r\nthat every tendency is to excess,\xe2\x80\x94radical complaint, radical remedies,\r\nbitter denunciation or angry silence. Some sink, some rise. The\r\ncriminal and the sensualist leave the church for the gambling-hell and\r\nthe brothel, and fill the slums of Chicago and Baltimore; the better\r\nclasses segregate themselves from the group-life of both white and\r\nblack, and form an aristocracy, cultured but pessimistic, whose bitter\r\ncriticism stings while it points out no way of escape. They despise the\r\nsubmission and subserviency of the Southern Negroes, but offer no other\r\nmeans by which a poor and oppressed minority can exist side by side\r\nwith its masters. Feeling deeply and keenly the tendencies and\r\nopportunities of the age in which they live, their souls are bitter at\r\nthe fate which drops the Veil between; and the very fact that this\r\nbitterness is natural and justifiable only serves to intensify it and\r\nmake it more maddening.\r\n\r\nBetween the two extreme types of ethical attitude which I have thus\r\nsought to make clear wavers the mass of the millions of Negroes, North\r\nand South; and their religious life and activity partake of this social\r\nconflict within their ranks. Their churches are differentiating,\xe2\x80\x94now\r\ninto groups of cold, fashionable devotees, in no way distinguishable\r\nfrom similar white groups save in color of skin; now into large social\r\nand business institutions catering to the desire for information and\r\namusement of their members, warily avoiding unpleasant questions both\r\nwithin and without the black world, and preaching in effect if not in\r\nword: _Dum vivimus, vivamus_.\r\n\r\nBut back of this still broods silently the deep religious feeling of\r\nthe real Negro heart, the stirring, unguided might of powerful human\r\nsouls who have lost the guiding star of the past and seek in the great\r\nnight a new religious ideal. Some day the Awakening will come, when the\r\npent-up vigor of ten million souls shall sweep irresistibly toward the\r\nGoal, out of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, where all that makes\r\nlife worth living\xe2\x80\x94Liberty, Justice, and Right\xe2\x80\x94is marked \xe2\x80\x9cFor White\r\nPeople Only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nOf the Passing of the First-Born\r\n\r\nO sister, sister, thy first-begotten,\r\nThe hands that cling and the feet that follow,\r\nThe voice of the child\xe2\x80\x99s blood crying yet,\r\n_Who hath remembered me? who hath forgotten?_\r\nThou hast forgotten, O summer swallow,\r\nBut the world shall end when I forget.\r\n\r\nSWINBURNE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnto you a child is born,\xe2\x80\x9d sang the bit of yellow paper that fluttered\r\ninto my room one brown October morning. Then the fear of fatherhood\r\nmingled wildly with the joy of creation; I wondered how it looked and\r\nhow it felt\xe2\x80\x94what were its eyes, and how its hair curled and crumpled\r\nitself. And I thought in awe of her,\xe2\x80\x94she who had slept with Death to\r\ntear a man-child from underneath her heart, while I was unconsciously\r\nwandering. I fled to my wife and child, repeating the while to myself\r\nhalf wonderingly, \xe2\x80\x9cWife and child? Wife and child?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94fled fast and\r\nfaster than boat and steam-car, and yet must ever impatiently await\r\nthem; away from the hard-voiced city, away from the flickering sea into\r\nmy own Berkshire Hills that sit all sadly guarding the gates of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nUp the stairs I ran to the wan mother and whimpering babe, to the\r\nsanctuary on whose altar a life at my bidding had offered itself to win\r\na life, and won. What is this tiny formless thing, this newborn wail\r\nfrom an unknown world,\xe2\x80\x94all head and voice? I handle it curiously, and\r\nwatch perplexed its winking, breathing, and sneezing. I did not love it\r\nthen; it seemed a ludicrous thing to love; but her I loved, my\r\ngirl-mother, she whom now I saw unfolding like the glory of the\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94the transfigured woman. Through her I came to love the wee\r\nthing, as it grew strong; as its little soul unfolded itself in twitter\r\nand cry and half-formed word, and as its eyes caught the gleam and\r\nflash of life. How beautiful he was, with his olive-tinted flesh and\r\ndark gold ringlets, his eyes of mingled blue and brown, his perfect\r\nlittle limbs, and the soft voluptuous roll which the blood of Africa\r\nhad moulded into his features! I held him in my arms, after we had sped\r\nfar away from our Southern home,\xe2\x80\x94held him, and glanced at the hot red\r\nsoil of Georgia and the breathless city of a hundred hills, and felt a\r\nvague unrest. Why was his hair tinted with gold? An evil omen was\r\ngolden hair in my life. Why had not the brown of his eyes crushed out\r\nand killed the blue?\xe2\x80\x94for brown were his father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s. And thus in the Land of the Color-line I saw, as it fell\r\nacross my baby, the shadow of the Veil.\r\n\r\nWithin the Veil was he born, said I; and there within shall he live,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nNegro and a Negro\xe2\x80\x99s son. Holding in that little head\xe2\x80\x94ah, bitterly!\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nunbowed pride of a hunted race, clinging with that tiny dimpled\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94ah, wearily!\xe2\x80\x94to a hope not hopeless but unhopeful, and seeing with\r\nthose bright wondering eyes that peer into my soul a land whose freedom\r\nis to us a mockery and whose liberty a lie. I saw the shadow of the\r\nVeil as it passed over my baby, I saw the cold city towering above the\r\nblood-red land. I held my face beside his little cheek, showed him the\r\nstar-children and the twinkling lights as they began to flash, and\r\nstilled with an even-song the unvoiced terror of my life.\r\n\r\nSo sturdy and masterful he grew, so filled with bubbling life, so\r\ntremulous with the unspoken wisdom of a life but eighteen months\r\ndistant from the All-life,\xe2\x80\x94we were not far from worshipping this\r\nrevelation of the divine, my wife and I. Her own life builded and\r\nmoulded itself upon the child; he tinged her every dream and idealized\r\nher every effort. No hands but hers must touch and garnish those little\r\nlimbs; no dress or frill must touch them that had not wearied her\r\nfingers; no voice but hers could coax him off to Dreamland, and she and\r\nhe together spoke some soft and unknown tongue and in it held\r\ncommunion. I too mused above his little white bed; saw the strength of\r\nmy own arm stretched onward through the ages through the newer strength\r\nof his; saw the dream of my black fathers stagger a step onward in the\r\nwild phantasm of the world; heard in his baby voice the voice of the\r\nProphet that was to rise within the Veil.\r\n\r\nAnd so we dreamed and loved and planned by fall and winter, and the\r\nfull flush of the long Southern spring, till the hot winds rolled from\r\nthe fetid Gulf, till the roses shivered and the still stern sun\r\nquivered its awful light over the hills of Atlanta. And then one night\r\nthe little feet pattered wearily to the wee white bed, and the tiny\r\nhands trembled; and a warm flushed face tossed on the pillow, and we\r\nknew baby was sick. Ten days he lay there,\xe2\x80\x94a swift week and three\r\nendless days, wasting, wasting away. Cheerily the mother nursed him the\r\nfirst days, and laughed into the little eyes that smiled again.\r\nTenderly then she hovered round him, till the smile fled away and Fear\r\ncrouched beside the little bed.\r\n\r\nThen the day ended not, and night was a dreamless terror, and joy and\r\nsleep slipped away. I hear now that Voice at midnight calling me from\r\ndull and dreamless trance,\xe2\x80\x94crying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shadow of Death! The Shadow of\r\nDeath!\xe2\x80\x9d Out into the starlight I crept, to rouse the gray\r\nphysician,\xe2\x80\x94the Shadow of Death, the Shadow of Death. The hours trembled\r\non; the night listened; the ghastly dawn glided like a tired thing\r\nacross the lamplight. Then we two alone looked upon the child as he\r\nturned toward us with great eyes, and stretched his stringlike\r\nhands,\xe2\x80\x94the Shadow of Death! And we spoke no word, and turned away.\r\n\r\nHe died at eventide, when the sun lay like a brooding sorrow above the\r\nwestern hills, veiling its face; when the winds spoke not, and the\r\ntrees, the great green trees he loved, stood motionless. I saw his\r\nbreath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then his little soul leapt\r\nlike a star that travels in the night and left a world of darkness in\r\nits train. The day changed not; the same tall trees peeped in at the\r\nwindows, the same green grass glinted in the setting sun. Only in the\r\nchamber of death writhed the world\xe2\x80\x99s most piteous thing\xe2\x80\x94a childless\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nI shirk not. I long for work. I pant for a life full of striving. I am\r\nno coward, to shrink before the rugged rush of the storm, nor even\r\nquail before the awful shadow of the Veil. But hearken, O Death! Is not\r\nthis my life hard enough,\xe2\x80\x94is not that dull land that stretches its\r\nsneering web about me cold enough,\xe2\x80\x94is not all the world beyond these\r\nfour little walls pitiless enough, but that thou must needs enter\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x94thou, O Death? About my head the thundering storm beat like a\r\nheartless voice, and the crazy forest pulsed with the curses of the\r\nweak; but what cared I, within my home beside my wife and baby boy?\r\nWast thou so jealous of one little coign of happiness that thou must\r\nneeds enter there,\xe2\x80\x94thou, O Death?\r\n\r\nA perfect life was his, all joy and love, with tears to make it\r\nbrighter,\xe2\x80\x94sweet as a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day beside the Housatonic. The world\r\nloved him; the women kissed his curls, the men looked gravely into his\r\nwonderful eyes, and the children hovered and fluttered about him. I can\r\nsee him now, changing like the sky from sparkling laughter to darkening\r\nfrowns, and then to wondering thoughtfulness as he watched the world.\r\nHe knew no color-line, poor dear\xe2\x80\x94and the Veil, though it shadowed him,\r\nhad not yet darkened half his sun. He loved the white matron, he loved\r\nhis black nurse; and in his little world walked souls alone, uncolored\r\nand unclothed. I\xe2\x80\x94yea, all men\xe2\x80\x94are larger and purer by the infinite\r\nbreadth of that one little life. She who in simple clearness of vision\r\nsees beyond the stars said when he had flown, \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be happy There;\r\nhe ever loved beautiful things.\xe2\x80\x9d And I, far more ignorant, and blind by\r\nthe web of mine own weaving, sit alone winding words and muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nstill he be, and he be There, and there be a There, let him be happy, O\r\nFate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlithe was the morning of his burial, with bird and song and\r\nsweet-smelling flowers. The trees whispered to the grass, but the\r\nchildren sat with hushed faces. And yet it seemed a ghostly unreal\r\nday,\xe2\x80\x94the wraith of Life. We seemed to rumble down an unknown street\r\nbehind a little white bundle of posies, with the shadow of a song in\r\nour ears. The busy city dinned about us; they did not say much, those\r\npale-faced hurrying men and women; they did not say much,\xe2\x80\x94they only\r\nglanced and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNiggers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe could not lay him in the ground there in Georgia, for the earth\r\nthere is strangely red; so we bore him away to the northward, with his\r\nflowers and his little folded hands. In vain, in vain!\xe2\x80\x94for where, O\r\nGod! beneath thy broad blue sky shall my dark baby rest in peace,\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nReverence dwells, and Goodness, and a Freedom that is free?\r\n\r\nAll that day and all that night there sat an awful gladness in my\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x94nay, blame me not if I see the world thus darkly through the\r\nVeil,\xe2\x80\x94and my soul whispers ever to me saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNot dead, not dead, but\r\nescaped; not bond, but free.\xe2\x80\x9d No bitter meanness now shall sicken his\r\nbaby heart till it die a living death, no taunt shall madden his happy\r\nboyhood. Fool that I was to think or wish that this little soul should\r\ngrow choked and deformed within the Veil! I might have known that\r\nyonder deep unworldly look that ever and anon floated past his eyes was\r\npeering far beyond this narrow Now. In the poise of his little\r\ncurl-crowned head did there not sit all that wild pride of being which\r\nhis father had hardly crushed in his own heart? For what, forsooth,\r\nshall a Negro want with pride amid the studied humiliations of fifty\r\nmillion fellows? Well sped, my boy, before the world had dubbed your\r\nambition insolence, had held your ideals unattainable, and taught you\r\nto cringe and bow. Better far this nameless void that stops my life\r\nthan a sea of sorrow for you.\r\n\r\nIdle words; he might have borne his burden more bravely than we,\xe2\x80\x94aye,\r\nand found it lighter too, some day; for surely, surely this is not the\r\nend. Surely there shall yet dawn some mighty morning to lift the Veil\r\nand set the prisoned free. Not for me,\xe2\x80\x94I shall die in my bonds,\xe2\x80\x94but for\r\nfresh young souls who have not known the night and waken to the\r\nmorning; a morning when men ask of the workman, not \xe2\x80\x9cIs he white?\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan he work?\xe2\x80\x9d When men ask artists, not \xe2\x80\x9cAre they black?\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cDo they\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d Some morning this may be, long, long years to come. But now\r\nthere wails, on that dark shore within the Veil, the same deep voice,\r\n_Thou shalt forego!_ And all have I foregone at that command, and with\r\nsmall complaint,\xe2\x80\x94all save that fair young form that lies so coldly wed\r\nwith death in the nest I had builded.\r\n\r\nIf one must have gone, why not I? Why may I not rest me from this\r\nrestlessness and sleep from this wide waking? Was not the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalembic, Time, in his young hands, and is not my time waning? Are there\r\nso many workers in the vineyard that the fair promise of this little\r\nbody could lightly be tossed away? The wretched of my race that line\r\nthe alleys of the nation sit fatherless and unmothered; but Love sat\r\nbeside his cradle, and in his ear Wisdom waited to speak. Perhaps now\r\nhe knows the All-love, and needs not to be wise. Sleep, then,\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x94sleep till I sleep and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless\r\npatter of little feet\xe2\x80\x94above the Veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nOf Alexander Crummell\r\n\r\nThen from the Dawn it seemed there came, but faint\r\nAs from beyond the limit of the world,\r\nLike the last echo born of a great cry,\r\nSounds, as if some fair city were one voice\r\nAround a king returning from his wars.\r\n\r\nTENNYSON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a human heart,\xe2\x80\x94the tale of a black boy who many\r\nlong years ago began to struggle with life that he might know the world\r\nand know himself. Three temptations he met on those dark dunes that lay\r\ngray and dismal before the wonder-eyes of the child: the temptation of\r\nHate, that stood out against the red dawn; the temptation of Despair,\r\nthat darkened noonday; and the temptation of Doubt, that ever steals\r\nalong with twilight. Above all, you must hear of the vales he\r\ncrossed,\xe2\x80\x94the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of\r\nDeath.\r\n\r\nI saw Alexander Crummell first at a Wilberforce commencement season,\r\namid its bustle and crush. Tall, frail, and black he stood, with simple\r\ndignity and an unmistakable air of good breeding. I talked with him\r\napart, where the storming of the lusty young orators could not harm us.\r\nI spoke to him politely, then curiously, then eagerly, as I began to\r\nfeel the fineness of his character,\xe2\x80\x94his calm courtesy, the sweetness of\r\nhis strength, and his fair blending of the hope and truth of life.\r\nInstinctively I bowed before this man, as one bows before the prophets\r\nof the world. Some seer he seemed, that came not from the crimson Past\r\nor the gray To-come, but from the pulsing Now,\xe2\x80\x94that mocking world which\r\nseemed to me at once so light and dark, so splendid and sordid.\r\nFourscore years had he wandered in this same world of mine, within the\r\nVeil.\r\n\r\nHe was born with the Missouri Compromise and lay a-dying amid the\r\nechoes of Manila and El Caney: stirring times for living, times dark to\r\nlook back upon, darker to look forward to. The black-faced lad that\r\npaused over his mud and marbles seventy years ago saw puzzling vistas\r\nas he looked down the world. The slave-ship still groaned across the\r\nAtlantic, faint cries burdened the Southern breeze, and the great black\r\nfather whispered mad tales of cruelty into those young ears. From the\r\nlow doorway the mother silently watched her boy at play, and at\r\nnightfall sought him eagerly lest the shadows bear him away to the land\r\nof slaves.\r\n\r\nSo his young mind worked and winced and shaped curiously a vision of\r\nLife; and in the midst of that vision ever stood one dark figure\r\nalone,\xe2\x80\x94ever with the hard, thick countenance of that bitter father, and\r\na form that fell in vast and shapeless folds. Thus the temptation of\r\nHate grew and shadowed the growing child,\xe2\x80\x94gliding stealthily into his\r\nlaughter, fading into his play, and seizing his dreams by day and night\r\nwith rough, rude turbulence. So the black boy asked of sky and sun and\r\nflower the never-answered Why? and loved, as he grew, neither the world\r\nnor the world\xe2\x80\x99s rough ways.\r\n\r\nStrange temptation for a child, you may think; and yet in this wide\r\nland to-day a thousand thousand dark children brood before this same\r\ntemptation, and feel its cold and shuddering arms. For them, perhaps,\r\nsome one will some day lift the Veil,\xe2\x80\x94will come tenderly and cheerily\r\ninto those sad little lives and brush the brooding hate away, just as\r\nBeriah Green strode in upon the life of Alexander Crummell. And before\r\nthe bluff, kind-hearted man the shadow seemed less dark. Beriah Green\r\nhad a school in Oneida County, New York, with a score of mischievous\r\nboys. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to bring a black boy here to educate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beriah\r\nGreen, as only a crank and an abolitionist would have dared to say.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the boys. \xe2\x80\x9cYe-es,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife; and Alexander came.\r\nOnce before, the black boy had sought a school, had travelled, cold and\r\nhungry, four hundred miles up into free New Hampshire, to Canaan. But\r\nthe godly farmers hitched ninety yoke of oxen to the abolition\r\nschoolhouse and dragged it into the middle of the swamp. The black boy\r\ntrudged away.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth was the first century of human sympathy,\xe2\x80\x94the age when\r\nhalf wonderingly we began to descry in others that transfigured spark\r\nof divinity which we call Myself; when clodhoppers and peasants, and\r\ntramps and thieves, and millionaires and\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\xe2\x80\x94Negroes, became\r\nthrobbing souls whose warm pulsing life touched us so nearly that we\r\nhalf gasped with surprise, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cThou too! Hast Thou seen Sorrow and\r\nthe dull waters of Hopelessness? Hast Thou known Life?\xe2\x80\x9d And then all\r\nhelplessly we peered into those Other-worlds, and wailed, \xe2\x80\x9cO World of\r\nWorlds, how shall man make you one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo in that little Oneida school there came to those schoolboys a\r\nrevelation of thought and longing beneath one black skin, of which they\r\nhad not dreamed before. And to the lonely boy came a new dawn of\r\nsympathy and inspiration. The shadowy, formless thing\xe2\x80\x94the temptation of\r\nHate, that hovered between him and the world\xe2\x80\x94grew fainter and less\r\nsinister. It did not wholly fade away, but diffused itself and lingered\r\nthick at the edges. Through it the child now first saw the blue and\r\ngold of life,\xe2\x80\x94the sun-swept road that ran \xe2\x80\x99twixt heaven and earth until\r\nin one far-off wan wavering line they met and kissed. A vision of life\r\ncame to the growing boy,\xe2\x80\x94mystic, wonderful. He raised his head,\r\nstretched himself, breathed deep of the fresh new air. Yonder, behind\r\nthe forests, he heard strange sounds; then glinting through the trees\r\nhe saw, far, far away, the bronzed hosts of a nation calling,\xe2\x80\x94calling\r\nfaintly, calling loudly. He heard the hateful clank of their chains; he\r\nfelt them cringe and grovel, and there rose within him a protest and a\r\nprophecy. And he girded himself to walk down the world.\r\n\r\nA voice and vision called him to be a priest,\xe2\x80\x94a seer to lead the\r\nuncalled out of the house of bondage. He saw the headless host turn\r\ntoward him like the whirling of mad waters,\xe2\x80\x94he stretched forth his\r\nhands eagerly, and then, even as he stretched them, suddenly there\r\nswept across the vision the temptation of Despair.\r\n\r\nThey were not wicked men,\xe2\x80\x94the problem of life is not the problem of the\r\nwicked,\xe2\x80\x94they were calm, good men, Bishops of the Apostolic Church of\r\nGod, and strove toward righteousness. They said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all very\r\nnatural\xe2\x80\x94it is even commendable; but the General Theological Seminary of\r\nthe Episcopal Church cannot admit a Negro.\xe2\x80\x9d And when that thin,\r\nhalf-grotesque figure still haunted their doors, they put their hands\r\nkindly, half sorrowfully, on his shoulders, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x94of course,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x94we know how _you_ feel about it; but you see it is impossible,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94it is premature. Sometime, we trust\xe2\x80\x94sincerely trust\xe2\x80\x94all such\r\ndistinctions will fade away; but now the world is as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the temptation of Despair; and the young man fought it\r\ndoggedly. Like some grave shadow he flitted by those halls, pleading,\r\narguing, half angrily demanding admittance, until there came the final\r\n_No;_ until men hustled the disturber away, marked him as foolish,\r\nunreasonable, and injudicious, a vain rebel against God\xe2\x80\x99s law. And then\r\nfrom that Vision Splendid all the glory faded slowly away, and left an\r\nearth gray and stern rolling on beneath a dark despair. Even the kind\r\nhands that stretched themselves toward him from out the depths of that\r\ndull morning seemed but parts of the purple shadows. He saw them\r\ncoldly, and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I strive by special grace when the way\r\nof the world is closed to me?\xe2\x80\x9d All gently yet, the hands urged him\r\non,\xe2\x80\x94the hands of young John Jay, that daring father\xe2\x80\x99s daring son; the\r\nhands of the good folk of Boston, that free city. And yet, with a way\r\nto the priesthood of the Church open at last before him, the cloud\r\nlingered there; and even when in old St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s the venerable Bishop\r\nraised his white arms above the Negro deacon\xe2\x80\x94even then the burden had\r\nnot lifted from that heart, for there had passed a glory from the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the fire through which Alexander Crummell went did not burn in\r\nvain. Slowly and more soberly he took up again his plan of life. More\r\ncritically he studied the situation. Deep down below the slavery and\r\nservitude of the Negro people he saw their fatal weaknesses, which long\r\nyears of mistreatment had emphasized. The dearth of strong moral\r\ncharacter, of unbending righteousness, he felt, was their great\r\nshortcoming, and here he would begin. He would gather the best of his\r\npeople into some little Episcopal chapel and there lead, teach, and\r\ninspire them, till the leaven spread, till the children grew, till the\r\nworld hearkened, till\xe2\x80\x94till\xe2\x80\x94and then across his dream gleamed some faint\r\nafter-glow of that first fair vision of youth\xe2\x80\x94only an after-glow, for\r\nthere had passed a glory from the earth.\r\n\r\nOne day\xe2\x80\x94it was in 1842, and the springtide was struggling merrily with\r\nthe May winds of New England\xe2\x80\x94he stood at last in his own chapel in\r\nProvidence, a priest of the Church. The days sped by, and the dark\r\nyoung clergyman labored; he wrote his sermons carefully; he intoned his\r\nprayers with a soft, earnest voice; he haunted the streets and accosted\r\nthe wayfarers; he visited the sick, and knelt beside the dying. He\r\nworked and toiled, week by week, day by day, month by month. And yet\r\nmonth by month the congregation dwindled, week by week the hollow walls\r\nechoed more sharply, day by day the calls came fewer and fewer, and day\r\nby day the third temptation sat clearer and still more clearly within\r\nthe Veil; a temptation, as it were, bland and smiling, with just a\r\nshade of mockery in its smooth tones. First it came casually, in the\r\ncadence of a voice: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, colored folks? Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d Or perhaps more\r\ndefinitely: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you _expect?_\xe2\x80\x9d In voice and gesture lay the\r\ndoubt\xe2\x80\x94the temptation of Doubt. How he hated it, and stormed at it\r\nfuriously! \xe2\x80\x9cOf course they are capable,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cof course they can\r\nlearn and strive and achieve\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d added the temptation\r\nsoftly, \xe2\x80\x9cthey do nothing of the sort.\xe2\x80\x9d Of all the three temptations,\r\nthis one struck the deepest. Hate? He had outgrown so childish a thing.\r\nDespair? He had steeled his right arm against it, and fought it with\r\nthe vigor of determination. But to doubt the worth of his life-work,\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ndoubt the destiny and capability of the race his soul loved because it\r\nwas his; to find listless squalor instead of eager endeavor; to hear\r\nhis own lips whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cThey do not care; they cannot know; they are\r\ndumb driven cattle,\xe2\x80\x94why cast your pearls before swine?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this, this\r\nseemed more than man could bear; and he closed the door, and sank upon\r\nthe steps of the chancel, and cast his robe upon the floor and writhed.\r\n\r\nThe evening sunbeams had set the dust to dancing in the gloomy chapel\r\nwhen he arose. He folded his vestments, put away the hymn-books, and\r\nclosed the great Bible. He stepped out into the twilight, looked back\r\nupon the narrow little pulpit with a weary smile, and locked the door.\r\nThen he walked briskly to the Bishop, and told the Bishop what the\r\nBishop already knew. \xe2\x80\x9cI have failed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply. And gaining\r\ncourage by the confession, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I need is a larger\r\nconstituency. There are comparatively few Negroes here, and perhaps\r\nthey are not of the best. I must go where the field is wider, and try\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d So the Bishop sent him to Philadelphia, with a letter to Bishop\r\nOnderdonk.\r\n\r\nBishop Onderdonk lived at the head of six white steps,\xe2\x80\x94corpulent,\r\nred-faced, and the author of several thrilling tracts on Apostolic\r\nSuccession. It was after dinner, and the Bishop had settled himself for\r\na pleasant season of contemplation, when the bell must needs ring, and\r\nthere must burst in upon the Bishop a letter and a thin, ungainly\r\nNegro. Bishop Onderdonk read the letter hastily and frowned.\r\nFortunately, his mind was already clear on this point; and he cleared\r\nhis brow and looked at Crummell. Then he said, slowly and impressively:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will receive you into this diocese on one condition: no Negro priest\r\ncan sit in my church convention, and no Negro church must ask for\r\nrepresentation there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sometimes fancy I can see that tableau: the frail black figure,\r\nnervously twitching his hat before the massive abdomen of Bishop\r\nOnderdonk; his threadbare coat thrown against the dark woodwork of the\r\nbookcases, where Fox\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLives of the Martyrs\xe2\x80\x9d nestled happily beside\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Whole Duty of Man.\xe2\x80\x9d I seem to see the wide eyes of the Negro\r\nwander past the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s broadcloth to where the swinging glass doors\r\nof the cabinet glow in the sunlight. A little blue fly is trying to\r\ncross the yawning keyhole. He marches briskly up to it, peers into the\r\nchasm in a surprised sort of way, and rubs his feelers reflectively;\r\nthen he essays its depths, and, finding it bottomless, draws back\r\nagain. The dark-faced priest finds himself wondering if the fly too has\r\nfaced its Valley of Humiliation, and if it will plunge into it,\xe2\x80\x94when\r\nlo! it spreads its tiny wings and buzzes merrily across, leaving the\r\nwatcher wingless and alone.\r\n\r\nThen the full weight of his burden fell upon him. The rich walls\r\nwheeled away, and before him lay the cold rough moor winding on through\r\nlife, cut in twain by one thick granite ridge,\xe2\x80\x94here, the Valley of\r\nHumiliation; yonder, the Valley of the Shadow of Death. And I know not\r\nwhich be darker,\xe2\x80\x94no, not I. But this I know: in yonder Vale of the\r\nHumble stand to-day a million swarthy men, who willingly would\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . bear the whips and scorns of time,\r\nThe oppressor\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, the proud man\xe2\x80\x99s contumely,\r\nThe pangs of despised love, the law\xe2\x80\x99s delay,\r\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\r\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nall this and more would they bear did they but know that this were\r\nsacrifice and not a meaner thing. So surged the thought within that\r\nlone black breast. The Bishop cleared his throat suggestively; then,\r\nrecollecting that there was really nothing to say, considerately said\r\nnothing, only sat tapping his foot impatiently. But Alexander Crummell\r\nsaid, slowly and heavily: \xe2\x80\x9cI will never enter your diocese on such\r\nterms.\xe2\x80\x9d And saying this, he turned and passed into the Valley of the\r\nShadow of Death. You might have noted only the physical dying, the\r\nshattered frame and hacking cough; but in that soul lay deeper death\r\nthan that. He found a chapel in New York,\xe2\x80\x94the church of his father; he\r\nlabored for it in poverty and starvation, scorned by his fellow\r\npriests. Half in despair, he wandered across the sea, a beggar with\r\noutstretched hands. Englishmen clasped them,\xe2\x80\x94Wilberforce and Stanley,\r\nThirwell and Ingles, and even Froude and Macaulay; Sir Benjamin Brodie\r\nbade him rest awhile at Queen\xe2\x80\x99s College in Cambridge, and there he\r\nlingered, struggling for health of body and mind, until he took his\r\ndegree in \xe2\x80\x9953. Restless still, and unsatisfied, he turned toward\r\nAfrica, and for long years, amid the spawn of the slave-smugglers,\r\nsought a new heaven and a new earth.\r\n\r\nSo the man groped for light; all this was not Life,\xe2\x80\x94it was the\r\nworld-wandering of a soul in search of itself, the striving of one who\r\nvainly sought his place in the world, ever haunted by the shadow of a\r\ndeath that is more than death,\xe2\x80\x94the passing of a soul that has missed\r\nits duty. Twenty years he wandered,\xe2\x80\x94twenty years and more; and yet the\r\nhard rasping question kept gnawing within him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name, am\r\nI on earth for?\xe2\x80\x9d In the narrow New York parish his soul seemed cramped\r\nand smothered. In the fine old air of the English University he heard\r\nthe millions wailing over the sea. In the wild fever-cursed swamps of\r\nWest Africa he stood helpless and alone.\r\n\r\nYou will not wonder at his weird pilgrimage,\xe2\x80\x94you who in the swift whirl\r\nof living, amid its cold paradox and marvellous vision, have fronted\r\nlife and asked its riddle face to face. And if you find that riddle\r\nhard to read, remember that yonder black boy finds it just a little\r\nharder; if it is difficult for you to find and face your duty, it is a\r\nshade more difficult for him; if your heart sickens in the blood and\r\ndust of battle, remember that to him the dust is thicker and the battle\r\nfiercer. No wonder the wanderers fall! No wonder we point to thief and\r\nmurderer, and haunting prostitute, and the never-ending throng of\r\nunhearsed dead! The Valley of the Shadow of Death gives few of its\r\npilgrims back to the world.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander Crummell it gave back. Out of the temptation of Hate, and\r\nburned by the fire of Despair, triumphant over Doubt, and steeled by\r\nSacrifice against Humiliation, he turned at last home across the\r\nwaters, humble and strong, gentle and determined. He bent to all the\r\ngibes and prejudices, to all hatred and discrimination, with that rare\r\ncourtesy which is the armor of pure souls. He fought among his own, the\r\nlow, the grasping, and the wicked, with that unbending righteousness\r\nwhich is the sword of the just. He never faltered, he seldom\r\ncomplained; he simply worked, inspiring the young, rebuking the old,\r\nhelping the weak, guiding the strong.\r\n\r\nSo he grew, and brought within his wide influence all that was best of\r\nthose who walk within the Veil. They who live without knew not nor\r\ndreamed of that full power within, that mighty inspiration which the\r\ndull gauze of caste decreed that most men should not know. And now that\r\nhe is gone, I sweep the Veil away and cry, Lo! the soul to whose dear\r\nmemory I bring this little tribute. I can see his face still, dark and\r\nheavy-lined beneath his snowy hair; lighting and shading, now with\r\ninspiration for the future, now in innocent pain at some human\r\nwickedness, now with sorrow at some hard memory from the past. The more\r\nI met Alexander Crummell, the more I felt how much that world was\r\nlosing which knew so little of him. In another age he might have sat\r\namong the elders of the land in purple-bordered toga; in another\r\ncountry mothers might have sung him to the cradles.\r\n\r\nHe did his work,\xe2\x80\x94he did it nobly and well; and yet I sorrow that here\r\nhe worked alone, with so little human sympathy. His name to-day, in\r\nthis broad land, means little, and comes to fifty million ears laden\r\nwith no incense of memory or emulation. And herein lies the tragedy of\r\nthe age: not that men are poor,\xe2\x80\x94all men know something of poverty; not\r\nthat men are wicked,\xe2\x80\x94who is good? not that men are ignorant,\xe2\x80\x94what is\r\nTruth? Nay, but that men know so little of men.\r\n\r\nHe sat one morning gazing toward the sea. He smiled and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe gate\r\nis rusty on the hinges.\xe2\x80\x9d That night at starrise a wind came moaning out\r\nof the west to blow the gate ajar, and then the soul I loved fled like\r\na flame across the Seas, and in its seat sat Death.\r\n\r\nI wonder where he is to-day? I wonder if in that dim world beyond, as\r\nhe came gliding in, there rose on some wan throne a King,\xe2\x80\x94a dark and\r\npierced Jew, who knows the writhings of the earthly damned, saying, as\r\nhe laid those heart-wrung talents down, \xe2\x80\x9cWell done!\xe2\x80\x9d while round about\r\nthe morning stars sat singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\nOf the Coming of John\r\n\r\nWhat bring they \xe2\x80\x99neath the midnight,\r\n    Beside the River-sea?\r\nThey bring the human heart wherein\r\n    No nightly calm can be;\r\nThat droppeth never with the wind,\r\n    Nor drieth with the dew;\r\nO calm it, God; thy calm is broad\r\n    To cover spirits too.\r\n        The river floweth on.\r\n\r\nMRS. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCarlisle Street runs westward from the centre of Johnstown, across a\r\ngreat black bridge, down a hill and up again, by little shops and\r\nmeat-markets, past single-storied homes, until suddenly it stops\r\nagainst a wide green lawn. It is a broad, restful place, with two large\r\nbuildings outlined against the west. When at evening the winds come\r\nswelling from the east, and the great pall of the city\xe2\x80\x99s smoke hangs\r\nwearily above the valley, then the red west glows like a dreamland down\r\nCarlisle Street, and, at the tolling of the supper-bell, throws the\r\npassing forms of students in dark silhouette against the sky. Tall and\r\nblack, they move slowly by, and seem in the sinister light to flit\r\nbefore the city like dim warning ghosts. Perhaps they are; for this is\r\nWells Institute, and these black students have few dealings with the\r\nwhite city below.\r\n\r\nAnd if you will notice, night after night, there is one dark form that\r\never hurries last and late toward the twinkling lights of Swain\r\nHall,\xe2\x80\x94for Jones is never on time. A long, straggling fellow he is,\r\nbrown and hard-haired, who seems to be growing straight out of his\r\nclothes, and walks with a half-apologetic roll. He used perpetually to\r\nset the quiet dining-room into waves of merriment, as he stole to his\r\nplace after the bell had tapped for prayers; he seemed so perfectly\r\nawkward. And yet one glance at his face made one forgive him much,\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nbroad, good-natured smile in which lay no bit of art or artifice, but\r\nseemed just bubbling good-nature and genuine satisfaction with the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHe came to us from Altamaha, away down there beneath the gnarled oaks\r\nof Southeastern Georgia, where the sea croons to the sands and the\r\nsands listen till they sink half drowned beneath the waters, rising\r\nonly here and there in long, low islands. The white folk of Altamaha\r\nvoted John a good boy,\xe2\x80\x94fine plough-hand, good in the rice-fields, handy\r\neverywhere, and always good-natured and respectful. But they shook\r\ntheir heads when his mother wanted to send him off to school. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nspoil him,\xe2\x80\x94ruin him,\xe2\x80\x9d they said; and they talked as though they knew.\r\nBut full half the black folk followed him proudly to the station, and\r\ncarried his queer little trunk and many bundles. And there they shook\r\nand shook hands, and the girls kissed him shyly and the boys clapped\r\nhim on the back. So the train came, and he pinched his little sister\r\nlovingly, and put his great arms about his mother\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and then was\r\naway with a puff and a roar into the great yellow world that flamed and\r\nflared about the doubtful pilgrim. Up the coast they hurried, past the\r\nsquares and palmettos of Savannah, through the cotton-fields and\r\nthrough the weary night, to Millville, and came with the morning to the\r\nnoise and bustle of Johnstown.\r\n\r\nAnd they that stood behind, that morning in Altamaha, and watched the\r\ntrain as it noisily bore playmate and brother and son away to the\r\nworld, had thereafter one ever-recurring word,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhen John comes.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nwhat parties were to be, and what speakings in the churches; what new\r\nfurniture in the front room,\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even a new front room; and there\r\nwould be a new schoolhouse, with John as teacher; and then perhaps a\r\nbig wedding; all this and more\xe2\x80\x94when John comes. But the white people\r\nshook their heads.\r\n\r\nAt first he was coming at Christmas-time,\xe2\x80\x94but the vacation proved too\r\nshort; and then, the next summer,\xe2\x80\x94but times were hard and schooling\r\ncostly, and so, instead, he worked in Johnstown. And so it drifted to\r\nthe next summer, and the next,\xe2\x80\x94till playmates scattered, and mother\r\ngrew gray, and sister went up to the Judge\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen to work. And still\r\nthe legend lingered,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98When John comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp at the Judge\xe2\x80\x99s they rather liked this refrain; for they too had a\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x94a fair-haired, smooth-faced boy, who had played many a long\r\nsummer\xe2\x80\x99s day to its close with his darker namesake. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir! John is\r\nat Princeton, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the broad-shouldered gray-haired Judge every\r\nmorning as he marched down to the post-office. \xe2\x80\x9cShowing the Yankees\r\nwhat a Southern gentleman can do,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; and strode home again with\r\nhis letters and papers. Up at the great pillared house they lingered\r\nlong over the Princeton letter,\xe2\x80\x94the Judge and his frail wife, his\r\nsister and growing daughters. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll make a man of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nJudge, \xe2\x80\x9ccollege is the place.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he asked the shy little\r\nwaitress, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Jennie, how\xe2\x80\x99s your John?\xe2\x80\x9d and added reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cToo\r\nbad, too bad your mother sent him off\xe2\x80\x94it will spoil him.\xe2\x80\x9d And the\r\nwaitress wondered.\r\n\r\nThus in the far-away Southern village the world lay waiting, half\r\nconsciously, the coming of two young men, and dreamed in an\r\ninarticulate way of new things that would be done and new thoughts that\r\nall would think. And yet it was singular that few thought of two\r\nJohns,\xe2\x80\x94for the black folk thought of one John, and he was black; and\r\nthe white folk thought of another John, and he was white. And neither\r\nworld thought the other world\xe2\x80\x99s thought, save with a vague unrest.\r\n\r\nUp in Johnstown, at the Institute, we were long puzzled at the case of\r\nJohn Jones. For a long time the clay seemed unfit for any sort of\r\nmoulding. He was loud and boisterous, always laughing and singing, and\r\nnever able to work consecutively at anything. He did not know how to\r\nstudy; he had no idea of thoroughness; and with his tardiness,\r\ncarelessness, and appalling good-humor, we were sore perplexed. One\r\nnight we sat in faculty-meeting, worried and serious; for Jones was in\r\ntrouble again. This last escapade was too much, and so we solemnly\r\nvoted \xe2\x80\x9cthat Jones, on account of repeated disorder and inattention to\r\nwork, be suspended for the rest of the term.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to us that the first time life ever struck Jones as a really\r\nserious thing was when the Dean told him he must leave school. He\r\nstared at the gray-haired man blankly, with great eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x94why,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nfaltered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t graduated!\xe2\x80\x9d Then the Dean slowly and clearly\r\nexplained, reminding him of the tardiness and the carelessness, of the\r\npoor lessons and neglected work, of the noise and disorder, until the\r\nfellow hung his head in confusion. Then he said quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell mammy and sister,\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t write mammy, now will you? For if you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out into the city and work, and come back next term and\r\nshow you something.\xe2\x80\x9d So the Dean promised faithfully, and John\r\nshouldered his little trunk, giving neither word nor look to the\r\ngiggling boys, and walked down Carlisle Street to the great city, with\r\nsober eyes and a set and serious face.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we imagined it, but someway it seemed to us that the serious\r\nlook that crept over his boyish face that afternoon never left it\r\nagain. When he came back to us he went to work with all his rugged\r\nstrength. It was a hard struggle, for things did not come easily to\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94few crowding memories of early life and teaching came to help him\r\non his new way; but all the world toward which he strove was of his own\r\nbuilding, and he builded slow and hard. As the light dawned lingeringly\r\non his new creations, he sat rapt and silent before the vision, or\r\nwandered alone over the green campus peering through and beyond the\r\nworld of men into a world of thought. And the thoughts at times puzzled\r\nhim sorely; he could not see just why the circle was not square, and\r\ncarried it out fifty-six decimal places one midnight,\xe2\x80\x94would have gone\r\nfurther, indeed, had not the matron rapped for lights out. He caught\r\nterrible colds lying on his back in the meadows of nights, trying to\r\nthink out the solar system; he had grave doubts as to the ethics of the\r\nFall of Rome, and strongly suspected the Germans of being thieves and\r\nrascals, despite his textbooks; he pondered long over every new Greek\r\nword, and wondered why this meant that and why it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nsomething else, and how it must have felt to think all things in Greek.\r\nSo he thought and puzzled along for himself,\xe2\x80\x94pausing perplexed where\r\nothers skipped merrily, and walking steadily through the difficulties\r\nwhere the rest stopped and surrendered.\r\n\r\nThus he grew in body and soul, and with him his clothes seemed to grow\r\nand arrange themselves; coat sleeves got longer, cuffs appeared, and\r\ncollars got less soiled. Now and then his boots shone, and a new\r\ndignity crept into his walk. And we who saw daily a new thoughtfulness\r\ngrowing in his eyes began to expect something of this plodding boy.\r\nThus he passed out of the preparatory school into college, and we who\r\nwatched him felt four more years of change, which almost transformed\r\nthe tall, grave man who bowed to us commencement morning. He had left\r\nhis queer thought-world and come back to a world of motion and of men.\r\nHe looked now for the first time sharply about him, and wondered he had\r\nseen so little before. He grew slowly to feel almost for the first time\r\nthe Veil that lay between him and the white world; he first noticed now\r\nthe oppression that had not seemed oppression before, differences that\r\nerstwhile seemed natural, restraints and slights that in his boyhood\r\ndays had gone unnoticed or been greeted with a laugh. He felt angry now\r\nwhen men did not call him \xe2\x80\x9cMister,\xe2\x80\x9d he clenched his hands at the \xe2\x80\x9cJim\r\nCrow\xe2\x80\x9d cars, and chafed at the color-line that hemmed in him and his. A\r\ntinge of sarcasm crept into his speech, and a vague bitterness into his\r\nlife; and he sat long hours wondering and planning a way around these\r\ncrooked things. Daily he found himself shrinking from the choked and\r\nnarrow life of his native town. And yet he always planned to go back to\r\nAltamaha,\xe2\x80\x94always planned to work there. Still, more and more as the day\r\napproached he hesitated with a nameless dread; and even the day after\r\ngraduation he seized with eagerness the offer of the Dean to send him\r\nNorth with the quartette during the summer vacation, to sing for the\r\nInstitute. A breath of air before the plunge, he said to himself in\r\nhalf apology.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright September afternoon, and the streets of New York were\r\nbrilliant with moving men. They reminded John of the sea, as he sat in\r\nthe square and watched them, so changelessly changing, so bright and\r\ndark, so grave and gay. He scanned their rich and faultless clothes,\r\nthe way they carried their hands, the shape of their hats; he peered\r\ninto the hurrying carriages. Then, leaning back with a sigh, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the World.\xe2\x80\x9d The notion suddenly seized him to see where the\r\nworld was going; since many of the richer and brighter seemed hurrying\r\nall one way. So when a tall, light-haired young man and a little\r\ntalkative lady came by, he rose half hesitatingly and followed them. Up\r\nthe street they went, past stores and gay shops, across a broad square,\r\nuntil with a hundred others they entered the high portal of a great\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nHe was pushed toward the ticket-office with the others, and felt in his\r\npocket for the new five-dollar bill he had hoarded. There seemed really\r\nno time for hesitation, so he drew it bravely out, passed it to the\r\nbusy clerk, and received simply a ticket but no change. When at last he\r\nrealized that he had paid five dollars to enter he knew not what, he\r\nstood stockstill amazed. \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful,\xe2\x80\x9d said a low voice behind him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou must not lynch the colored gentleman simply because he\xe2\x80\x99s in your\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d and a girl looked up roguishly into the eyes of her fair-haired\r\nescort. A shade of annoyance passed over the escort\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_\r\nnot understand us at the South,\xe2\x80\x9d he said half impatiently, as if\r\ncontinuing an argument. \xe2\x80\x9cWith all your professions, one never sees in\r\nthe North so cordial and intimate relations between white and black as\r\nare everyday occurrences with us. Why, I remember my closest playfellow\r\nin boyhood was a little Negro named after me, and surely no\r\ntwo,\xe2\x80\x94_well_!\xe2\x80\x9d The man stopped short and flushed to the roots of his\r\nhair, for there directly beside his reserved orchestra chairs sat the\r\nNegro he had stumbled over in the hallway. He hesitated and grew pale\r\nwith anger, called the usher and gave him his card, with a few\r\nperemptory words, and slowly sat down. The lady deftly changed the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAll this John did not see, for he sat in a half-daze minding the scene\r\nabout him; the delicate beauty of the hall, the faint perfume, the\r\nmoving myriad of men, the rich clothing and low hum of talking seemed\r\nall a part of a world so different from his, so strangely more\r\nbeautiful than anything he had known, that he sat in dreamland, and\r\nstarted when, after a hush, rose high and clear the music of\r\nLohengrin\xe2\x80\x99s swan. The infinite beauty of the wail lingered and swept\r\nthrough every muscle of his frame, and put it all a-tune. He closed his\r\neyes and grasped the elbows of the chair, touching unwittingly the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s arm. And the lady drew away. A deep longing swelled in all his\r\nheart to rise with that clear music out of the dirt and dust of that\r\nlow life that held him prisoned and befouled. If he could only live up\r\nin the free air where birds sang and setting suns had no touch of\r\nblood! Who had called him to be the slave and butt of all? And if he\r\nhad called, what right had he to call when a world like this lay open\r\nbefore men?\r\n\r\nThen the movement changed, and fuller, mightier harmony swelled away.\r\nHe looked thoughtfully across the hall, and wondered why the beautiful\r\ngray-haired woman looked so listless, and what the little man could be\r\nwhispering about. He would not like to be listless and idle, he\r\nthought, for he felt with the music the movement of power within him.\r\nIf he but had some master-work, some life-service, hard,\xe2\x80\x94aye, bitter\r\nhard, but without the cringing and sickening servility, without the\r\ncruel hurt that hardened his heart and soul. When at last a soft sorrow\r\ncrept across the violins, there came to him the vision of a far-off\r\nhome, the great eyes of his sister, and the dark drawn face of his\r\nmother. And his heart sank below the waters, even as the sea-sand sinks\r\nby the shores of Altamaha, only to be lifted aloft again with that last\r\nethereal wail of the swan that quivered and faded away into the sky.\r\n\r\nIt left John sitting so silent and rapt that he did not for some time\r\nnotice the usher tapping him lightly on the shoulder and saying\r\npolitely, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you step this way, please, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d A little surprised, he\r\narose quickly at the last tap, and, turning to leave his seat, looked\r\nfull into the face of the fair-haired young man. For the first time the\r\nyoung man recognized his dark boyhood playmate, and John knew that it\r\nwas the Judge\xe2\x80\x99s son. The White John started, lifted his hand, and then\r\nfroze into his chair; the black John smiled lightly, then grimly, and\r\nfollowed the usher down the aisle. The manager was sorry, very, very\r\nsorry,\xe2\x80\x94but he explained that some mistake had been made in selling the\r\ngentleman a seat already disposed of; he would refund the money, of\r\ncourse,\xe2\x80\x94and indeed felt the matter keenly, and so forth, and\xe2\x80\x94before he\r\nhad finished John was gone, walking hurriedly across the square and\r\ndown the broad streets, and as he passed the park he buttoned his coat\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Jones, you\xe2\x80\x99re a natural-born fool.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he went to his\r\nlodgings and wrote a letter, and tore it up; he wrote another, and\r\nthrew it in the fire. Then he seized a scrap of paper and wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cDear\r\nMother and Sister\xe2\x80\x94I am coming\xe2\x80\x94John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, as he settled himself on the train, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I am\r\nto blame myself in struggling against my manifest destiny simply\r\nbecause it looks hard and unpleasant. Here is my duty to Altamaha plain\r\nbefore me; perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll let me help settle the Negro problems\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x94perhaps they won\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x98I will go in to the King, which is not\r\naccording to the law; and if I perish, I perish.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d And then he mused\r\nand dreamed, and planned a life-work; and the train flew south.\r\n\r\nDown in Altamaha, after seven long years, all the world knew John was\r\ncoming. The homes were scrubbed and scoured,\xe2\x80\x94above all, one; the\r\ngardens and yards had an unwonted trimness, and Jennie bought a new\r\ngingham. With some finesse and negotiation, all the dark Methodists and\r\nPresbyterians were induced to join in a monster welcome at the Baptist\r\nChurch; and as the day drew near, warm discussions arose on every\r\ncorner as to the exact extent and nature of John\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments. It\r\nwas noontide on a gray and cloudy day when he came. The black town\r\nflocked to the depot, with a little of the white at the edges,\xe2\x80\x94a happy\r\nthrong, with \xe2\x80\x9cGood-mawnings\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHowdys\xe2\x80\x9d and laughing and joking and\r\njostling. Mother sat yonder in the window watching; but sister Jennie\r\nstood on the platform, nervously fingering her dress, tall and lithe,\r\nwith soft brown skin and loving eyes peering from out a tangled\r\nwilderness of hair. John rose gloomily as the train stopped, for he was\r\nthinking of the \xe2\x80\x9cJim Crow\xe2\x80\x9d car; he stepped to the platform, and paused:\r\na little dingy station, a black crowd gaudy and dirty, a half-mile of\r\ndilapidated shanties along a straggling ditch of mud. An overwhelming\r\nsense of the sordidness and narrowness of it all seized him; he looked\r\nin vain for his mother, kissed coldly the tall, strange girl who called\r\nhim brother, spoke a short, dry word here and there; then, lingering\r\nneither for handshaking nor gossip, started silently up the street,\r\nraising his hat merely to the last eager old aunty, to her open-mouthed\r\nastonishment. The people were distinctly bewildered. This silent, cold\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x94was this John? Where was his smile and hearty hand-grasp? \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Peared\r\nkind o\xe2\x80\x99 down in the mouf,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Methodist preacher thoughtfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeemed monstus stuck up,\xe2\x80\x9d complained a Baptist sister. But the white\r\npostmaster from the edge of the crowd expressed the opinion of his\r\nfolks plainly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat damn Nigger,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he shouldered the mail\r\nand arranged his tobacco, \xe2\x80\x9chas gone North and got plum full o\xe2\x80\x99 fool\r\nnotions; but they won\xe2\x80\x99t work in Altamaha.\xe2\x80\x9d And the crowd melted away.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of welcome at the Baptist Church was a failure. Rain\r\nspoiled the barbecue, and thunder turned the milk in the ice-cream.\r\nWhen the speaking came at night, the house was crowded to overflowing.\r\nThe three preachers had especially prepared themselves, but somehow\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s manner seemed to throw a blanket over everything,\xe2\x80\x94he seemed so\r\ncold and preoccupied, and had so strange an air of restraint that the\r\nMethodist brother could not warm up to his theme and elicited not a\r\nsingle \xe2\x80\x9cAmen\xe2\x80\x99; the Presbyterian prayer was but feebly responded to, and\r\neven the Baptist preacher, though he wakened faint enthusiasm, got so\r\nmixed up in his favorite sentence that he had to close it by stopping\r\nfully fifteen minutes sooner than he meant. The people moved uneasily\r\nin their seats as John rose to reply. He spoke slowly and methodically.\r\nThe age, he said, demanded new ideas; we were far different from those\r\nmen of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\xe2\x80\x94with broader ideas of\r\nhuman brotherhood and destiny. Then he spoke of the rise of charity and\r\npopular education, and particularly of the spread of wealth and work.\r\nThe question was, then, he added reflectively, looking at the low\r\ndiscolored ceiling, what part the Negroes of this land would take in\r\nthe striving of the new century. He sketched in vague outline the new\r\nIndustrial School that might rise among these pines, he spoke in detail\r\nof the charitable and philanthropic work that might be organized, of\r\nmoney that might be saved for banks and business. Finally he urged\r\nunity, and deprecated especially religious and denominational\r\nbickering. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthe world cares little\r\nwhether a man be Baptist or Methodist, or indeed a churchman at all, so\r\nlong as he is good and true. What difference does it make whether a man\r\nbe baptized in river or washbowl, or not at all? Let\xe2\x80\x99s leave all that\r\nlittleness, and look higher.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, thinking of nothing else, he slowly\r\nsat down. A painful hush seized that crowded mass. Little had they\r\nunderstood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue, save the\r\nlast word about baptism; that they knew, and they sat very still while\r\nthe clock ticked. Then at last a low suppressed snarl came from the\r\nAmen corner, and an old bent man arose, walked over the seats, and\r\nclimbed straight up into the pulpit. He was wrinkled and black, with\r\nscant gray and tufted hair; his voice and hands shook as with palsy;\r\nbut on his face lay the intense rapt look of the religious fanatic. He\r\nseized the Bible with his rough, huge hands; twice he raised it\r\ninarticulate, and then fairly burst into words, with rude and awful\r\neloquence. He quivered, swayed, and bent; then rose aloft in perfect\r\nmajesty, till the people moaned and wept, wailed and shouted, and a\r\nwild shrieking arose from the corners where all the pent-up feeling of\r\nthe hour gathered itself and rushed into the air. John never knew\r\nclearly what the old man said; he only felt himself held up to scorn\r\nand scathing denunciation for trampling on the true Religion, and he\r\nrealized with amazement that all unknowingly he had put rough, rude\r\nhands on something this little world held sacred. He arose silently,\r\nand passed out into the night. Down toward the sea he went, in the\r\nfitful starlight, half conscious of the girl who followed timidly after\r\nhim. When at last he stood upon the bluff, he turned to his little\r\nsister and looked upon her sorrowfully, remembering with sudden pain\r\nhow little thought he had given her. He put his arm about her and let\r\nher passion of tears spend itself on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nLong they stood together, peering over the gray unresting water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes it make every one\xe2\x80\x94unhappy when they study and\r\nlearn lots of things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused and smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it does,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, John, are you glad you studied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d came the answer, slowly but positively.\r\n\r\nShe watched the flickering lights upon the sea, and said thoughtfully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was unhappy,\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and,\xe2\x80\x9d putting both arms about his neck, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink I am, a little, John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was several days later that John walked up to the Judge\xe2\x80\x99s house to\r\nask for the privilege of teaching the Negro school. The Judge himself\r\nmet him at the front door, stared a little hard at him, and said\r\nbrusquely, \xe2\x80\x9cGo \xe2\x80\x99round to the kitchen door, John, and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d Sitting on\r\nthe kitchen steps, John stared at the corn, thoroughly perplexed. What\r\non earth had come over him? Every step he made offended some one. He\r\nhad come to save his people, and before he left the depot he had hurt\r\nthem. He sought to teach them at the church, and had outraged their\r\ndeepest feelings. He had schooled himself to be respectful to the\r\nJudge, and then blundered into his front door. And all the time he had\r\nmeant right,\xe2\x80\x94and yet, and yet, somehow he found it so hard and strange\r\nto fit his old surroundings again, to find his place in the world about\r\nhim. He could not remember that he used to have any difficulty in the\r\npast, when life was glad and gay. The world seemed smooth and easy\r\nthen. Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x94but his sister came to the kitchen door just then and\r\nsaid the Judge awaited him.\r\n\r\nThe Judge sat in the dining-room amid his morning\xe2\x80\x99s mail, and he did\r\nnot ask John to sit down. He plunged squarely into the business.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come for the school, I suppose. Well John, I want to speak to\r\nyou plainly. You know I\xe2\x80\x99m a friend to your people. I\xe2\x80\x99ve helped you and\r\nyour family, and would have done more if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got the notion of\r\ngoing off. Now I like the colored people, and sympathize with all their\r\nreasonable aspirations; but you and I both know, John, that in this\r\ncountry the Negro must remain subordinate, and can never expect to be\r\nthe equal of white men. In their place, your people can be honest and\r\nrespectful; and God knows, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do what I can to help them. But when\r\nthey want to reverse nature, and rule white men, and marry white women,\r\nand sit in my parlor, then, by God! we\xe2\x80\x99ll hold them under if we have to\r\nlynch every Nigger in the land. Now, John, the question is, are you,\r\nwith your education and Northern notions, going to accept the situation\r\nand teach the darkies to be faithful servants and laborers as your\r\nfathers were,\xe2\x80\x94I knew your father, John, he belonged to my brother, and\r\nhe was a good Nigger. Well\xe2\x80\x94well, are you going to be like him, or are\r\nyou going to try to put fool ideas of rising and equality into these\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x99 heads, and make them discontented and unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to accept the situation, Judge Henderson,\xe2\x80\x9d answered John,\r\nwith a brevity that did not escape the keen old man. He hesitated a\r\nmoment, and then said shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll try you awhile.\r\nGood-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a full month after the opening of the Negro school that the\r\nother John came home, tall, gay, and headstrong. The mother wept, the\r\nsisters sang. The whole white town was glad. A proud man was the Judge,\r\nand it was a goodly sight to see the two swinging down Main Street\r\ntogether. And yet all did not go smoothly between them, for the younger\r\nman could not and did not veil his contempt for the little town, and\r\nplainly had his heart set on New York. Now the one cherished ambition\r\nof the Judge was to see his son mayor of Altamaha, representative to\r\nthe legislature, and\xe2\x80\x94who could say?\xe2\x80\x94governor of Georgia. So the\r\nargument often waxed hot between them. \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, father,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nyounger man would say after dinner, as he lighted a cigar and stood by\r\nthe fireplace, \xe2\x80\x9cyou surely don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a young fellow like me to\r\nsettle down permanently in this\xe2\x80\x94this God-forgotten town with nothing\r\nbut mud and Negroes?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ did,\xe2\x80\x9d the Judge would answer laconically;\r\nand on this particular day it seemed from the gathering scowl that he\r\nwas about to add something more emphatic, but neighbors had already\r\nbegun to drop in to admire his son, and the conversation drifted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeah that John is livenin\xe2\x80\x99 things up at the darky school,\xe2\x80\x9d volunteered\r\nthe postmaster, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Judge, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothin\xe2\x80\x99 in particulah,\xe2\x80\x94just his almighty air and uppish ways.\r\nB\xe2\x80\x99lieve I did heah somethin\xe2\x80\x99 about his givin\xe2\x80\x99 talks on the French\r\nRevolution, equality, and such like. He\xe2\x80\x99s what I call a dangerous\r\nNigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard him say anything out of the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no,\xe2\x80\x94but Sally, our girl, told my wife a lot of rot. Then, too, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t need to heah: a Nigger what won\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98sir\xe2\x80\x99 to a white man, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this John?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s little black John, Peggy\xe2\x80\x99s son,\xe2\x80\x94your old playfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed angrily, and then he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the darky that tried to force himself into a seat\r\nbeside the lady I was escorting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Judge Henderson waited to hear no more. He had been nettled all\r\nday, and now at this he rose with a half-smothered oath, took his hat\r\nand cane, and walked straight to the schoolhouse.\r\n\r\nFor John, it had been a long, hard pull to get things started in the\r\nrickety old shanty that sheltered his school. The Negroes were rent\r\ninto factions for and against him, the parents were careless, the\r\nchildren irregular and dirty, and books, pencils, and slates largely\r\nmissing. Nevertheless, he struggled hopefully on, and seemed to see at\r\nlast some glimmering of dawn. The attendance was larger and the\r\nchildren were a shade cleaner this week. Even the booby class in\r\nreading showed a little comforting progress. So John settled himself\r\nwith renewed patience this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mandy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s better; but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t chop\r\nyour words up so: \xe2\x80\x98If\xe2\x80\x94the-man\xe2\x80\x94goes.\xe2\x80\x99 Why, your little brother even\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell a story that way, now would he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaw, suh, he cain\xe2\x80\x99t talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; now let\xe2\x80\x99s try again: \xe2\x80\x98If the man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole school started in surprise, and the teacher half arose, as\r\nthe red, angry face of the Judge appeared in the open doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, this school is closed. You children can go home and get to work.\r\nThe white people of Altamaha are not spending their money on black\r\nfolks to have their heads crammed with impudence and lies. Clear out!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll lock the door myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp at the great pillared house the tall young son wandered aimlessly\r\nabout after his father\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt departure. In the house there was\r\nlittle to interest him; the books were old and stale, the local\r\nnewspaper flat, and the women had retired with headaches and sewing. He\r\ntried a nap, but it was too warm. So he sauntered out into the fields,\r\ncomplaining disconsolately, \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! how long will this imprisonment\r\nlast!\xe2\x80\x9d He was not a bad fellow,\xe2\x80\x94just a little spoiled and\r\nself-indulgent, and as headstrong as his proud father. He seemed a\r\nyoung man pleasant to look upon, as he sat on the great black stump at\r\nthe edge of the pines idly swinging his legs and smoking. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t even a girl worth getting up a respectable flirtation with,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ngrowled. Just then his eye caught a tall, willowy figure hurrying\r\ntoward him on the narrow path. He looked with interest at first, and\r\nthen burst into a laugh as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I declare, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nJennie, the little brown kitchen-maid! Why, I never noticed before what\r\na trim little body she is. Hello, Jennie! Why, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t kissed me\r\nsince I came home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gaily. The young girl stared at him in\r\nsurprise and confusion,\xe2\x80\x94faltered something inarticulate, and attempted\r\nto pass. But a wilful mood had seized the young idler, and he caught at\r\nher arm. Frightened, she slipped by; and half mischievously he turned\r\nand ran after her through the tall pines.\r\n\r\nYonder, toward the sea, at the end of the path, came John slowly, with\r\nhis head down. He had turned wearily homeward from the schoolhouse;\r\nthen, thinking to shield his mother from the blow, started to meet his\r\nsister as she came from work and break the news of his dismissal to\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go away and find work, and\r\nsend for them. I cannot live here longer.\xe2\x80\x9d And then the fierce, buried\r\nanger surged up into his throat. He waved his arms and hurried wildly\r\nup the path.\r\n\r\nThe great brown sea lay silent. The air scarce breathed. The dying day\r\nbathed the twisted oaks and mighty pines in black and gold. There came\r\nfrom the wind no warning, not a whisper from the cloudless sky. There\r\nwas only a black man hurrying on with an ache in his heart, seeing\r\nneither sun nor sea, but starting as from a dream at the frightened cry\r\nthat woke the pines, to see his dark sister struggling in the arms of a\r\ntall and fair-haired man.\r\n\r\nHe said not a word, but, seizing a fallen limb, struck him with all the\r\npent-up hatred of his great black arm, and the body lay white and still\r\nbeneath the pines, all bathed in sunshine and in blood. John looked at\r\nit dreamily, then walked back to the house briskly, and said in a soft\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cMammy, I\xe2\x80\x99m going away\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him dimly and faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x99th, honey, is yo\xe2\x80\x99 gwine No\xe2\x80\x99th\r\nagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked out where the North Star glistened pale above the waters, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, mammy, I\xe2\x80\x99m going\xe2\x80\x94North.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, without another word, he went out into the narrow lane, up by the\r\nstraight pines, to the same winding path, and seated himself on the\r\ngreat black stump, looking at the blood where the body had lain. Yonder\r\nin the gray past he had played with that dead boy, romping together\r\nunder the solemn trees. The night deepened; he thought of the boys at\r\nJohnstown. He wondered how Brown had turned out, and Carey? And\r\nJones,\xe2\x80\x94Jones? Why, he was Jones, and he wondered what they would all\r\nsay when they knew, when they knew, in that great long dining-room with\r\nits hundreds of merry eyes. Then as the sheen of the starlight stole\r\nover him, he thought of the gilded ceiling of that vast concert hall,\r\nheard stealing toward him the faint sweet music of the swan. Hark! was\r\nit music, or the hurry and shouting of men? Yes, surely! Clear and high\r\nthe faint sweet melody rose and fluttered like a living thing, so that\r\nthe very earth trembled as with the tramp of horses and murmur of angry\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back and smiled toward the sea, whence rose the strange\r\nmelody, away from the dark shadows where lay the noise of horses\r\ngalloping, galloping on. With an effort he roused himself, bent\r\nforward, and looked steadily down the pathway, softly humming the \xe2\x80\x9cSong\r\nof the Bride,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreudig gef\xc3\xbchrt, ziehet dahin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid the trees in the dim morning twilight he watched their shadows\r\ndancing and heard their horses thundering toward him, until at last\r\nthey came sweeping like a storm, and he saw in front that haggard\r\nwhite-haired man, whose eyes flashed red with fury. Oh, how he pitied\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94pitied him,\xe2\x80\x94and wondered if he had the coiling twisted rope. Then,\r\nas the storm burst round him, he rose slowly to his feet and turned his\r\nclosed eyes toward the Sea.\r\n\r\nAnd the world whistled in his ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\nOf the Sorrow Songs\r\n\r\nI walk through the churchyard\r\n    To lay this body down;\r\nI know moon-rise, I know star-rise;\r\nI walk in the moonlight, I walk in the starlight;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll lie in the grave and stretch out my arms,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to judgment in the evening of the day,\r\nAnd my soul and thy soul shall meet that day,\r\n    When I lay this body down.\r\n\r\nNEGRO SONG.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey that walked in darkness sang songs in the olden days\xe2\x80\x94Sorrow\r\nSongs\xe2\x80\x94for they were weary at heart. And so before each thought that I\r\nhave written in this book I have set a phrase, a haunting echo of these\r\nweird old songs in which the soul of the black slave spoke to men. Ever\r\nsince I was a child these songs have stirred me strangely. They came\r\nout of the South unknown to me, one by one, and yet at once I knew them\r\nas of me and of mine. Then in after years when I came to Nashville I\r\nsaw the great temple builded of these songs towering over the pale\r\ncity. To me Jubilee Hall seemed ever made of the songs themselves, and\r\nits bricks were red with the blood and dust of toil. Out of them rose\r\nfor me morning, noon, and night, bursts of wonderful melody, full of\r\nthe voices of my brothers and sisters, full of the voices of the past.\r\n\r\nLittle of beauty has America given the world save the rude grandeur God\r\nhimself stamped on her bosom; the human spirit in this new world has\r\nexpressed itself in vigor and ingenuity rather than in beauty. And so\r\nby fateful chance the Negro folk-song\xe2\x80\x94the rhythmic cry of the\r\nslave\xe2\x80\x94stands to-day not simply as the sole American music, but as the\r\nmost beautiful expression of human experience born this side the seas.\r\nIt has been neglected, it has been, and is, half despised, and above\r\nall it has been persistently mistaken and misunderstood; but\r\nnotwithstanding, it still remains as the singular spiritual heritage of\r\nthe nation and the greatest gift of the Negro people.\r\n\r\nAway back in the thirties the melody of these slave songs stirred the\r\nnation, but the songs were soon half forgotten. Some, like \xe2\x80\x9cNear the\r\nlake where drooped the willow,\xe2\x80\x9d passed into current airs and their\r\nsource was forgotten; others were caricatured on the \xe2\x80\x9cminstrel\xe2\x80\x9d stage\r\nand their memory died away. Then in war-time came the singular Port\r\nRoyal experiment after the capture of Hilton Head, and perhaps for the\r\nfirst time the North met the Southern slave face to face and heart to\r\nheart with no third witness. The Sea Islands of the Carolinas, where\r\nthey met, were filled with a black folk of primitive type, touched and\r\nmoulded less by the world about them than any others outside the Black\r\nBelt. Their appearance was uncouth, their language funny, but their\r\nhearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power.\r\nThomas Wentworth Higginson hastened to tell of these songs, and Miss\r\nMcKim and others urged upon the world their rare beauty. But the world\r\nlistened only half credulously until the Fisk Jubilee Singers sang the\r\nslave songs so deeply into the world\xe2\x80\x99s heart that it can never wholly\r\nforget them again.\r\n\r\nThere was once a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s son born at Cadiz, New York, who in the\r\nchanges of time taught school in Ohio and helped defend Cincinnati from\r\nKirby Smith. Then he fought at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg and\r\nfinally served in the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau at Nashville. Here he formed a\r\nSunday-school class of black children in 1866, and sang with them and\r\ntaught them to sing. And then they taught him to sing, and when once\r\nthe glory of the Jubilee songs passed into the soul of George L. White,\r\nhe knew his life-work was to let those Negroes sing to the world as\r\nthey had sung to him. So in 1871 the pilgrimage of the Fisk Jubilee\r\nSingers began. North to Cincinnati they rode,\xe2\x80\x94four half-clothed black\r\nboys and five girl-women,\xe2\x80\x94led by a man with a cause and a purpose. They\r\nstopped at Wilberforce, the oldest of Negro schools, where a black\r\nbishop blessed them. Then they went, fighting cold and starvation, shut\r\nout of hotels, and cheerfully sneered at, ever northward; and ever the\r\nmagic of their song kept thrilling hearts, until a burst of applause in\r\nthe Congregational Council at Oberlin revealed them to the world. They\r\ncame to New York and Henry Ward Beecher dared to welcome them, even\r\nthough the metropolitan dailies sneered at his \xe2\x80\x9cNigger Minstrels.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\ntheir songs conquered till they sang across the land and across the\r\nsea, before Queen and Kaiser, in Scotland and Ireland, Holland and\r\nSwitzerland. Seven years they sang, and brought back a hundred and\r\nfifty thousand dollars to found Fisk University.\r\n\r\nSince their day they have been imitated\xe2\x80\x94sometimes well, by the singers\r\nof Hampton and Atlanta, sometimes ill, by straggling quartettes.\r\nCaricature has sought again to spoil the quaint beauty of the music,\r\nand has filled the air with many debased melodies which vulgar ears\r\nscarce know from the real. But the true Negro folk-song still lives in\r\nthe hearts of those who have heard them truly sung and in the hearts of\r\nthe Negro people.\r\n\r\nWhat are these songs, and what do they mean? I know little of music and\r\ncan say nothing in technical phrase, but I know something of men, and\r\nknowing them, I know that these songs are the articulate message of the\r\nslave to the world. They tell us in these eager days that life was\r\njoyous to the black slave, careless and happy. I can easily believe\r\nthis of some, of many. But not all the past South, though it rose from\r\nthe dead, can gainsay the heart-touching witness of these songs. They\r\nare the music of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment;\r\nthey tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer\r\nworld, of misty wanderings and hidden ways.\r\n\r\nThe songs are indeed the siftings of centuries; the music is far more\r\nancient than the words, and in it we can trace here and there signs of\r\ndevelopment. My grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother was seized by an evil Dutch\r\ntrader two centuries ago; and coming to the valleys of the Hudson and\r\nHousatonic, black, little, and lithe, she shivered and shrank in the\r\nharsh north winds, looked longingly at the hills, and often crooned a\r\nheathen melody to the child between her knees, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe child sang it to his children and they to their children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren, and so two hundred years it has travelled down to us and we\r\nsing it to our children, knowing as little as our fathers what its\r\nwords may mean, but knowing well the meaning of its music.\r\n\r\nThis was primitive African music; it may be seen in larger form in the\r\nstrange chant which heralds \xe2\x80\x9cThe Coming of John\xe2\x80\x99:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may bury me in the East,\r\nYou may bury me in the West,\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the trumpet sound in that morning,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94the voice of exile.\r\n\r\nTen master songs, more or less, one may pluck from the forest of\r\nmelody-songs of undoubted Negro origin and wide popular currency, and\r\nsongs peculiarly characteristic of the slave. One of these I have just\r\nmentioned. Another whose strains begin this book is \xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows the\r\ntrouble I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xe2\x80\x9d When, struck with a sudden poverty, the United\r\nStates refused to fulfill its promises of land to the freedmen, a\r\nbrigadier-general went down to the Sea Islands to carry the news. An\r\nold woman on the outskirts of the throng began singing this song; all\r\nthe mass joined with her, swaying. And the soldier wept.\r\n\r\nThe third song is the cradle-song of death which all men know,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Swing\r\nlow, sweet chariot,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whose bars begin the life story of \xe2\x80\x9cAlexander\r\nCrummell.\xe2\x80\x9d Then there is the song of many waters, \xe2\x80\x9cRoll, Jordan, roll,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\na mighty chorus with minor cadences. There were many songs of the\r\nfugitive like that which opens \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wings of Atalanta,\xe2\x80\x9d and the more\r\nfamiliar \xe2\x80\x9cBeen a-listening.\xe2\x80\x9d The seventh is the song of the End and the\r\nBeginning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, what a mourning! when the stars begin to fall\xe2\x80\x9d; a\r\nstrain of this is placed before \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dawn of Freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d The song of\r\ngroping\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy way\xe2\x80\x99s cloudy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94begins \xe2\x80\x9cThe Meaning of Progress\xe2\x80\x9d; the ninth\r\nis the song of this chapter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWrestlin\xe2\x80\x99 Jacob, the day is a-breaking,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npaean of hopeful strife. The last master song is the song of\r\nsongs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSteal away,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94sprung from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Faith of the Fathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are many others of the Negro folk-songs as striking and\r\ncharacteristic as these, as, for instance, the three strains in the\r\nthird, eighth, and ninth chapters; and others I am sure could easily\r\nmake a selection on more scientific principles. There are, too, songs\r\nthat seem to be a step removed from the more primitive types: there is\r\nthe maze-like medley, \xe2\x80\x9cBright sparkles,\xe2\x80\x9d one phrase of which heads \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nBlack Belt\xe2\x80\x9d; the Easter carol, \xe2\x80\x9cDust, dust and ashes\xe2\x80\x9d; the dirge, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s took her flight and gone home\xe2\x80\x9d; and that burst of melody\r\nhovering over \xe2\x80\x9cThe Passing of the First-Born\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI hope my mother will be\r\nthere in that beautiful world on high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese represent a third step in the development of the slave song, of\r\nwhich \xe2\x80\x9cYou may bury me in the East\xe2\x80\x9d is the first, and songs like \xe2\x80\x9cMarch\r\non\xe2\x80\x9d (chapter six) and \xe2\x80\x9cSteal away\xe2\x80\x9d are the second. The first is African\r\nmusic, the second Afro-American, while the third is a blending of Negro\r\nmusic with the music heard in the foster land. The result is still\r\ndistinctively Negro and the method of blending original, but the\r\nelements are both Negro and Caucasian. One might go further and find a\r\nfourth step in this development, where the songs of white America have\r\nbeen distinctively influenced by the slave songs or have incorporated\r\nwhole phrases of Negro melody, as \xe2\x80\x9cSwanee River\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOld Black Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSide by side, too, with the growth has gone the debasements and\r\nimitations\xe2\x80\x94the Negro \xe2\x80\x9cminstrel\xe2\x80\x9d songs, many of the \xe2\x80\x9cgospel\xe2\x80\x9d hymns, and\r\nsome of the contemporary \xe2\x80\x9ccoon\xe2\x80\x9d songs,\xe2\x80\x94a mass of music in which the\r\nnovice may easily lose himself and never find the real Negro melodies.\r\n\r\nIn these songs, I have said, the slave spoke to the world. Such a\r\nmessage is naturally veiled and half articulate. Words and music have\r\nlost each other and new and cant phrases of a dimly understood theology\r\nhave displaced the older sentiment. Once in a while we catch a strange\r\nword of an unknown tongue, as the \xe2\x80\x9cMighty Myo,\xe2\x80\x9d which figures as a\r\nriver of death; more often slight words or mere doggerel are joined to\r\nmusic of singular sweetness. Purely secular songs are few in number,\r\npartly because many of them were turned into hymns by a change of\r\nwords, partly because the frolics were seldom heard by the stranger,\r\nand the music less often caught. Of nearly all the songs, however, the\r\nmusic is distinctly sorrowful. The ten master songs I have mentioned\r\ntell in word and music of trouble and exile, of strife and hiding; they\r\ngrope toward some unseen power and sigh for rest in the End.\r\n\r\nThe words that are left to us are not without interest, and, cleared of\r\nevident dross, they conceal much of real poetry and meaning beneath\r\nconventional theology and unmeaning rhapsody. Like all primitive folk,\r\nthe slave stood near to Nature\xe2\x80\x99s heart. Life was a \xe2\x80\x9crough and rolling\r\nsea\xe2\x80\x9d like the brown Atlantic of the Sea Islands; the \xe2\x80\x9cWilderness\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe home of God, and the \xe2\x80\x9clonesome valley\xe2\x80\x9d led to the way of life.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWinter\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be over,\xe2\x80\x9d was the picture of life and death to a\r\ntropical imagination. The sudden wild thunderstorms of the South awed\r\nand impressed the Negroes,\xe2\x80\x94at times the rumbling seemed to them\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmournful,\xe2\x80\x9d at times imperious:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord calls me,\r\nHe calls me by the thunder,\r\nThe trumpet sounds it in my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe monotonous toil and exposure is painted in many words. One sees the\r\nploughmen in the hot, moist furrow, singing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDere\xe2\x80\x99s no rain to wet you,\r\nDere\xe2\x80\x99s no sun to burn you,\r\nOh, push along, believer,\r\nI want to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bowed and bent old man cries, with thrice-repeated wail:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, keep me from sinking down,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nand he rebukes the devil of doubt who can whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesus is dead and God\xe2\x80\x99s gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nYet the soul-hunger is there, the restlessness of the savage, the wail\r\nof the wanderer, and the plaint is put in one little phrase:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOver the inner thoughts of the slaves and their relations one with\r\nanother the shadow of fear ever hung, so that we get but glimpses here\r\nand there, and also with them, eloquent omissions and silences. Mother\r\nand child are sung, but seldom father; fugitive and weary wanderer call\r\nfor pity and affection, but there is little of wooing and wedding; the\r\nrocks and the mountains are well known, but home is unknown. Strange\r\nblending of love and helplessness sings through the refrain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder\xe2\x80\x99s my ole mudder,\r\nBeen waggin\xe2\x80\x99 at de hill so long;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Bout time she cross over,\r\nGit home bime-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nElsewhere comes the cry of the \xe2\x80\x9cmotherless\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell,\r\nfarewell, my only child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLove-songs are scarce and fall into two categories\xe2\x80\x94the frivolous and\r\nlight, and the sad. Of deep successful love there is ominous silence,\r\nand in one of the oldest of these songs there is a depth of history and\r\nmeaning:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA black woman said of the song, \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be sung without a full heart\r\nand a troubled sperrit.\xe2\x80\x9d The same voice sings here that sings in the\r\nGerman folk-song:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJetz Geh i\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99s brunele, trink\xe2\x80\x99 aber net.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOf death the Negro showed little fear, but talked of it familiarly and\r\neven fondly as simply a crossing of the waters, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94who knows?\xe2\x80\x94back\r\nto his ancient forests again. Later days transfigured his fatalism, and\r\namid the dust and dirt the toiler sang:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDust, dust and ashes, fly over my grave,\r\nBut the Lord shall bear my spirit home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe things evidently borrowed from the surrounding world undergo\r\ncharacteristic change when they enter the mouth of the slave.\r\nEspecially is this true of Bible phrases. \xe2\x80\x9cWeep, O captive daughter of\r\nZion,\xe2\x80\x9d is quaintly turned into \xe2\x80\x9cZion, weep-a-low,\xe2\x80\x9d and the wheels of\r\nEzekiel are turned every way in the mystic dreaming of the slave, till\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a little wheel a-turnin\xe2\x80\x99 in-a-my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in olden time, the words of these hymns were improvised by some\r\nleading minstrel of the religious band. The circumstances of the\r\ngathering, however, the rhythm of the songs, and the limitations of\r\nallowable thought, confined the poetry for the most part to single or\r\ndouble lines, and they seldom were expanded to quatrains or longer\r\ntales, although there are some few examples of sustained efforts,\r\nchiefly paraphrases of the Bible. Three short series of verses have\r\nalways attracted me,\xe2\x80\x94the one that heads this chapter, of one line of\r\nwhich Thomas Wentworth Higginson has fittingly said, \xe2\x80\x9cNever, it seems\r\nto me, since man first lived and suffered was his infinite longing for\r\npeace uttered more plaintively.\xe2\x80\x9d The second and third are descriptions\r\nof the Last Judgment,\xe2\x80\x94the one a late improvisation, with some traces of\r\noutside influence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the stars in the elements are falling,\r\nAnd the moon drips away into blood,\r\nAnd the ransomed of the Lord are returning unto God,\r\nBlessed be the name of the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the other earlier and homelier picture from the low coast lands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael, haul the boat ashore,\r\nThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the horn they blow,\r\nThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the trumpet sound,\r\nTrumpet sound the world around,\r\nTrumpet sound for rich and poor,\r\nTrumpet sound the Jubilee,\r\nTrumpet sound for you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough all the sorrow of the Sorrow Songs there breathes a hope\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfaith in the ultimate justice of things. The minor cadences of despair\r\nchange often to triumph and calm confidence. Sometimes it is faith in\r\nlife, sometimes a faith in death, sometimes assurance of boundless\r\njustice in some fair world beyond. But whichever it is, the meaning is\r\nalways clear: that sometime, somewhere, men will judge men by their\r\nsouls and not by their skins. Is such a hope justified? Do the Sorrow\r\nSongs sing true?\r\n\r\nThe silently growing assumption of this age is that the probation of\r\nraces is past, and that the backward races of to-day are of proven\r\ninefficiency and not worth the saving. Such an assumption is the\r\narrogance of peoples irreverent toward Time and ignorant of the deeds\r\nof men. A thousand years ago such an assumption, easily possible, would\r\nhave made it difficult for the Teuton to prove his right to life. Two\r\nthousand years ago such dogmatism, readily welcome, would have scouted\r\nthe idea of blond races ever leading civilization. So wofully\r\nunorganized is sociological knowledge that the meaning of progress, the\r\nmeaning of \xe2\x80\x9cswift\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cslow\xe2\x80\x9d in human doing, and the limits of human\r\nperfectability, are veiled, unanswered sphinxes on the shores of\r\nscience. Why should \xc3\x86schylus have sung two thousand years before\r\nShakespeare was born? Why has civilization flourished in Europe, and\r\nflickered, flamed, and died in Africa? So long as the world stands\r\nmeekly dumb before such questions, shall this nation proclaim its\r\nignorance and unhallowed prejudices by denying freedom of opportunity\r\nto those who brought the Sorrow Songs to the Seats of the Mighty?\r\n\r\nYour country? How came it yours? Before the Pilgrims landed we were\r\nhere. Here we have brought our three gifts and mingled them with yours:\r\na gift of story and song\xe2\x80\x94soft, stirring melody in an ill-harmonized and\r\nunmelodious land; the gift of sweat and brawn to beat back the\r\nwilderness, conquer the soil, and lay the foundations of this vast\r\neconomic empire two hundred years earlier than your weak hands could\r\nhave done it; the third, a gift of the Spirit. Around us the history of\r\nthe land has centred for thrice a hundred years; out of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart we have called all that was best to throttle and subdue all that\r\nwas worst; fire and blood, prayer and sacrifice, have billowed over\r\nthis people, and they have found peace only in the altars of the God of\r\nRight. Nor has our gift of the Spirit been merely passive. Actively we\r\nhave woven ourselves with the very warp and woof of this nation,\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nfought their battles, shared their sorrow, mingled our blood with\r\ntheirs, and generation after generation have pleaded with a headstrong,\r\ncareless people to despise not Justice, Mercy, and Truth, lest the\r\nnation be smitten with a curse. Our song, our toil, our cheer, and\r\nwarning have been given to this nation in blood-brotherhood. Are not\r\nthese gifts worth the giving? Is not this work and striving? Would\r\nAmerica have been America without her Negro people?\r\n\r\nEven so is the hope that sang in the songs of my fathers well sung. If\r\nsomewhere in this whirl and chaos of things there dwells Eternal Good,\r\npitiful yet masterful, then anon in His good time America shall rend\r\nthe Veil and the prisoned shall go free. Free, free as the sunshine\r\ntrickling down the morning into these high windows of mine, free as\r\nyonder fresh young voices welling up to me from the caverns of brick\r\nand mortar below\xe2\x80\x94swelling with song, instinct with life, tremulous\r\ntreble and darkening bass. My children, my little children, are singing\r\nto the sunshine, and thus they sing:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd the traveller girds himself, and sets his face toward the Morning,\r\nand goes his way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Afterthought\r\n\r\nHear my cry, O God the Reader; vouchsafe that this my book fall not\r\nstill-born into the world wilderness. Let there spring, Gentle One,\r\nfrom out its leaves vigor of thought and thoughtful deed to reap the\r\nharvest wonderful. Let the ears of a guilty people tingle with truth,\r\nand seventy millions sigh for the righteousness which exalteth nations,\r\nin this drear day when human brotherhood is mockery and a snare. Thus\r\nin Thy good time may infinite reason turn the tangle straight, and\r\nthese crooked marks on a fragile leaf be not indeed\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Souls of Black Folk, by W.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
