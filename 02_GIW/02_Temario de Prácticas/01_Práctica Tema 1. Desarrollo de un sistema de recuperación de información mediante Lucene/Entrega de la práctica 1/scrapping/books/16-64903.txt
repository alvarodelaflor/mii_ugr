They were ignorant and short-sighted; they asserted that\r\nhere was a useless burden of waste land fitted only to the Indian and\r\nthe fur-trader; that the people of the United States should occupy\r\nthemselves with the land east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nBut wiser men prevailed. The expedition launched boldly out into the\r\nunknown, to carry the flag now into the new country, and perhaps to\r\nmake possible the ownership of still a farther country, at the Pacific\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nTime proved the wisdom of President Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s preparations made\r\neven before the territory had been bought. Just at the right moment\r\nthe trail across the continent was opened. Louisiana Territory was\r\nvalued at its future worth; the people were informed of its merits and\r\npossibilities; after the return of the explorers, the American citizens\r\npressed forward, to see for themselves. And in due course the flag\r\nfloated unchallenged in that Oregon where, also, the Lewis and Clark\r\nmen had blazed the way.\r\n\r\nI should like to have been under Captain Meriwether Lewis, turning\r\nthirty, and Captain William Clark, scant thirty-four. They were true\r\nleaders: brave, patient, resourceful and determined. And the company\r\nthat followed them were likewise, brave, patient, resourceful and\r\ndetermined. These qualities are what bound them all together\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the\r\nAmerican, the Frenchman, the Indian\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95as one united band, and brought\r\nthem through, triumphant.\r\n\r\n                                                       EDWIN L.

The War for Independence had been won only\r\ntwenty years previous. George Washington himself had been gone but a\r\nyear and four months. The Capitol was being erected on the site that he\r\nhad chosen. And the western boundary of the nation was the Mississippi\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Mississippi extended onward to the Rocky Mountains the\r\nforeign territory of Louisiana Province. New Orleans was the capital of\r\nits lower portion, St. Louis was the capital of its upper portion. It\r\nall was assumed to be the property of Spain, until, before President\r\nJefferson had held office a year, there spread the rumor that by a\r\nsecret treaty in 1800 Spain had ceded Louisiana back to France, the\r\nfirst owner.\r\n\r\nAlmost another year passed. The treaty transferring Louisiana Province\r\nfrom Spain to France seemed to be hanging fire. The Spanish flag still\r\nfloated over New Orleans and St. Louis. Then, in October, 1802, the\r\nSpanish governor at New Orleans informed the American traders and\r\nmerchants that their flat-boats no longer might use the Mississippi\r\nRiver. New Orleans, the port through which the Mississippi River\r\ntraffic reached the Gulf of Mexico, was closed to them.\r\n\r\nFrom the west to the east of the United States swelled a vigorous cry\r\nof indignation against this decree that closed the Mississippi to\r\nAmerican commerce. Hot words issued, threats were loudly spoken, and\r\nthe people of the Ohio Valley, particularly, were ripe to seize New\r\nOrleans and re-open the big river by force of arms.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Spanish governor was not within his rights, anyway. By\r\nthat secret treaty, the Island of New Orleans (as it was called),\r\nthrough which the currents of the Mississippi flowed to the Gulf, was\r\nFrench property. So instead of disputing further with Spain, President\r\nJefferson, in January, 1803, sent Robert R. Livingston, United States\r\nminister to France, the authority to buy the New Orleans gateway for\r\n$2,000,000, or, if necessitated, to offer $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson was a gaunt, thin-legged, sandy-haired, homely man,\r\ncareless of his clothes and simple in his customs, but he passionately\r\nloved his country, and he had great dreams for it. His dreams he made\r\ncome true.\r\n\r\nHe long had been fascinated by the western half of the continent.\r\nHis keen hazel eyes had pored over the rude maps, largely guesswork,\r\nsketched by adventurers and fur-hunters. These eyes had travelled\r\nup the water-way of the uncertain Missouri, to the Stony Mountains,\r\nas they were called; thence across the Stony Mountains, in search\r\nof that mysterious Columbia River, discovered and christened by an\r\nAmerican. Twice he had urged the exploration of the Columbia region,\r\nand twice explorers had started, but had been turned back. Now, as\r\nPresident, he clung to his dream of gaining new lands and new commerce\r\nto the American flag; and scarcely had Minister Livingston been sent\r\nthe instructions to open the Mississippi, than President Jefferson\r\nproceeded with plans for opening another, longer trail, that should\r\nreach from the Mississippi to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nHe had in mind the person who could lead on such a trip: young Captain\r\nMeriwether Lewis of the First Infantry, U. S. A.; his private secretary\r\nat $500 a year, and to him like an own son. They were together day and\r\nnight, they loved each other.\r\n\r\nA Virginian, of prominent family, was Captain Lewis, and now barely\r\ntwenty-nine years of age. Slim, erect, sunny-haired, flashing\r\nblue-eyed, handsome and brave, he had volunteered before to explore\r\nthrough the farthest Northwest, but had been needed elsewhere. This\r\ntime President Jefferson wisely granted him his wish, and asked him to\r\nmake an estimate of the expenses for a Government exploring expedition\r\nby officers and men, from St. Louis up the Missouri River and across\r\nthe mountains to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nYoung Captain Lewis figured, and soon handed in his estimate. He\r\nwas of the opinion that at an expense of $2500, which would cover\r\neverything, a party of eighteen men might travel across-country\r\nfrom the Mississippi River, over the mountains, and to the Pacific\r\nOcean and back again! He had figured very closely, had young Captain\r\nLewis\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95perhaps because he was so anxious to go.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson accepted the estimate of $2500, and in his message\r\nof January 18, 1803, to Congress, he proposed the expedition. He urged\r\nthat at this small expense a party of soldiers, well led, could in two\r\nsummers map a trail clear to the western ocean; bring back valuable\r\ninformation upon climate, soil and peoples, and make Americans better\r\nacquainted with their own continent; also encourage the traders and\r\ntrappers to use the Missouri River as a highway to and from the\r\nIndians, thus competing with the British of Canada.\r\n\r\nCongress voted to apply the $2500 on the proposed expedition. We may\r\nimagine how the tall, homely President Jefferson beamed\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95he, who so\r\nfirmly believed in the expansion of American trade, and the onward\r\nmarch of the American flag. And we may imagine how young Captain Lewis\r\nglowed with joy, when now he might be definitely named as the leader to\r\ncarry the flag.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson advised him to go at once to Philadelphia, and\r\nstudy botany, geology, astronomy, surveying, and all the other sciences\r\nand methods that would enable him to make a complete report upon the\r\nnew country. At Lancaster, nearby, the celebrated Henry flint-lock\r\nrifles were manufactured, and he could attend to equipping his party\r\nwith these high-grade guns, turned out according to his own directions.\r\n\r\nThere should be two leaders, to provide against accident to one. Whom\r\nwould he have, as comrade? He asked for his friend, William Clark,\r\nyounger brother to the famed General George Rogers Clark, who in\r\nthe Revolution had won the country west of the Alleghanies from the\r\nBritish and the Indians, afterward had saved the Ohio Valley from the\r\nangry redmen, and then had defied the Spaniards who would claim the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nAs cadet only seventeen years old, and as stripling lieutenant\r\nappointed by Washington, William Clark himself had fought to keep\r\nthis fertile region white. \xe2\x80\x9cA youth of solid and promising parts and\r\nas brave as C\xc3\xa6sar,\xe2\x80\x9d was said of him, in those terrible days when the\r\nShawnees, the Mohawks and all declared: \xe2\x80\x9cNo white man\xe2\x80\x99s cabin shall\r\nsmoke beyond the Ohio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe, too, was a Virginian born, but raised in Kentucky. Now in this\r\nspring of 1803 he was verging on thirty-three years of age. He was\r\nrusset-haired, gray-eyed, round-faced and large-framed\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95kindly, firm,\r\nand very honest.\r\n\r\nHe had retired from the army, but by rank in the militia was entitled\r\ncaptain. For the purposes of the expedition President Jefferson\r\ncommissioned him second lieutenant of artillery.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark was at the Clark family home of Mulberry Hill, three\r\nmiles south of Louisville, Kentucky; Captain Lewis pursued his studies\r\nat Philadelphia. Meanwhile, what of Minister Livingston and the\r\npurchase from France of New Orleans\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the mouth of the Mississippi?\r\n\r\nThe famous Napoleon Bonaparte was the ruler of France. He, like\r\nPresident Jefferson, had his dreams for the Province of Louisiana.\r\nHe refused to sell the port of New Orleans. Here he intended to land\r\nsoldiers and colonists, that they might proceed up-river and make of\r\nhis Province of Louisiana another France.\r\n\r\nTrouble loomed. Congress appointed James Monroe as Envoy Extraordinary\r\nand on March 8 he started for France to aid Minister Livingston. He\r\narrived at Paris on April 12; but, lo, on the day before he arrived, a\r\nmost astonishing new bargain had been offered by Napoleon and Minister\r\nLivingston was ready to accept.\r\n\r\nThe dream of Napoleon had faded. For war with England was again upon\r\nhim; the British held Canada, their men-of-war were assembling off the\r\nGulf of Mexico, Louisiana Province and New Orleans would be seized\r\nbefore ever France could muster a force there to resist. So rather than\r\nlet England gain all this territory and wax more powerful, Napoleon,\r\non April 11, directed his ministers to proffer to the United States\r\nnot only New Orleans, but all Louisiana Province\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and the deal must be\r\nclosed at once!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake all, at 80,000,000 francs, or $15,000,000, or take nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe astounding proposal from Minister Marbois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am authorized to buy New Orleans,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Minister Livingston.\r\n\r\nThere was no time in which to inform President Jefferson and Congress.\r\nNews crossed the ocean only by slow sailing vessels. Envoy Monroe\r\narrived; he and Minister Livingston consulted together; Napoleon was\r\nimpatient, they should act quickly\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must do it,\xe2\x80\x9d they agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cOur country shall not lose this\r\nopportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle minds are afraid of responsibilities; great minds are not\r\nafraid. They prefer to act as seems to them they ought to act, rather\r\nthan merely to play safe. Monroe and Livingston were true patriots.\r\nThey thought not of themselves, but of their country, and risked rebuke\r\nfor exceeding their instructions.\r\n\r\nOn April 30 they signed the papers which engaged the United States\r\nto purchase all of Louisiana. The French ministers signed. On May 2\r\nNapoleon signed. The papers were immediately mailed for the approval of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAnd Congress did approve, on October 17. Thus, for less than three\r\ncents an acre, the United States acquired from the Mississippi River\r\nto the summits of the Rocky Mountains. The amount paid over was\r\n$11,400,000; $3,750,000 was applied on French debts.\r\n\r\nThe ship bearing the papers signed by Ministers Livingston and Monroe,\r\nand by the government of France, did not reach the United States\r\nuntil July. Down to that time President Jefferson had no knowledge of\r\nthe fact that his expedition, as planned, was to explore not French\r\nterritory, but American. But when the news broke, he was all ready for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95he needed only to go ahead. That is one secret of success: to be\r\nprepared to step instantly from opportunity to opportunity as fast as\r\nthey occur. The successful, energetic man is never surprised by the\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis had been kept very busy: studying science at Philadelphia,\r\ninspecting his flint-locks at Lancaster, storing them and gathering\r\nsupplies at the arsenal of Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Ferry. June 20 he received his\r\nwritten instructions.\r\n\r\nHe was to ascend the Missouri River from St. Louis to its source, and\r\nby crossing the mountains and following down other streams, endeavor\r\nto come out at the mouth of the Columbia on the Pacific coast. It\r\nwas hoped that he would find a way by water clear through. He was to\r\nmake a complete record of his journey: noting the character of the\r\ncountry, its rivers, climate, soil, animals, products, and peoples; and\r\nparticularly the Indians, their laws, languages, occupations\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95was to\r\nurge peace upon them, inform them of the greatness of the white United\r\nStates, encourage them to sell us their goods and to visit us.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the Pacific Ocean, he was to ship two of his party by\r\nvessel, if he found one there, for the United States, by way of Cape\r\nHorn, of South America, or the Cape of Good Hope, of Africa, and send\r\na copy of his notes with them. Or he and all his party were at liberty\r\nto return that way, themselves. He was given letters to the United\r\nStates consuls at Java, and the Isles of France off the African coast,\r\nand the Cape of Good Hope, and one authorizing him to obtain money, in\r\nthe name of the United States, at any part of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nAll this was a large order, placed upon the shoulders of a youth of\r\ntwenty-nine years; but who knew where the Missouri River trail might\r\nlead? No white man yet had followed it to its end.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis was at Washington, receiving those final instructions.\r\nOn July 5 he should start for the west. On July 3 he wrote a farewell\r\nletter to his mother in Virginia, bidding her not to worry, and\r\nassuring her that he felt he should return safely in fifteen to\r\neighteen months.\r\n\r\nHe did not dream\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95President Jefferson, his friend and backer, did not\r\ndream, or, at least, had not voiced that dream\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but even while the\r\nloving letter was being penned, into the harbor of New York had sailed\r\na ship from France, bringing the dispatches of Ministers Monroe and\r\nLivingston. The next day the news was announced at Washington. The\r\nProvince of Louisiana had been bought by the United States!\r\n\r\nThis was a Fourth of July celebration with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis scarcely had time to comprehend. To-morrow he was to\r\nstart, and his mind was filled with the details of preparation. But a\r\nglowing joy must have thrilled him as he realized that he was to be the\r\nfirst to carry the flag through that new America now a part of his own\r\nUnited States. Hurrah!\r\n\r\nHe had no occasion for delaying. His instructions required no change.\r\nHe was eager to be off. Therefore on July 5, this 1803, he set out, and\r\nfrom the White House President Jefferson wished him good-speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE START\r\n\r\n\r\nBy boat up the Potomac River from Washington hastened young Captain\r\nLewis, to pack his arms and supplies at Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Ferry, and forward\r\nthem by wagon for Pittsburg. He got to Pittsburg ahead of them; and\r\nthere remained until the last of August, overseeing the building of a\r\nbarge or flat-boat. He enlisted some men, too\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95six of them, picked with\r\ncare, and sworn into the service of the United States Army.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, with his recruits, on his laden flat-boat he launched\r\nout to sail, row, and float, towed by oxen (a \xe2\x80\x9chorn breeze,\xe2\x80\x9d this was\r\ntermed), down the Ohio.\r\n\r\nAt Mulberry Hill, near Louisville, Captain William Clark was\r\nimpatiently awaiting. He had enlisted nine men, all of Kentucky, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdark and bloody ground.\xe2\x80\x9d If any men could be relied on, they would\r\nbe Kentuckians, he knew. His negro servant, York, who had been his\r\nfaithful body-guard since boyhood, was going, too.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark took charge of the barge, to proceed with it and the\r\nrecruits and York down the Ohio into the Mississippi, and thence up\r\nthe Mississippi to St. Louis. Captain Lewis turned across country, by\r\nhorse, on a short cut, to pick up more men along the way.\r\n\r\nHe struck the Mississippi River fifty miles below St. Louis, where the\r\nUnited States Army post of Kaskaskia faced the Province of Louisiana\r\nacross the river. Here he enlisted four men more, selected from a score\r\nthat eagerly volunteered. Word of the great expedition had travelled\r\nahead of him, and he could have filled the ranks seven times over. But\r\nonly the strongest, and those of clean reputation, could qualify for\r\nsuch a trip. These thought themselves fortunate.\r\n\r\nNow up along the river, by military road, hastened Captain Lewis, for\r\nthe old town of Cahokia, and crossed the river to St. Louis at last. He\r\nwas in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll winter at La Charette, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to Captain Clark,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhere Daniel Boone lives. Boone can give us valuable information, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll be that far on our journey, ready for spring. Charette will be\r\nbetter for our men than St. Louis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGlad was Captain Clark to spend the months at La Charette. Daniel\r\nBoone had been his boyhood friend in Kentucky\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95had taught him much\r\nwood-craft. But when, in mid-December, Captain Clark, the redhead,\r\nanxious to push on to La Charette, seventy miles up the Missouri,\r\nbefore the ice closed, with York and his nine Kentuckians and five\r\nother recruits whom he had enlisted from Fort Massac at the mouth of\r\nthe Ohio tied his keel-boat at the St. Louis levee, he was met by\r\ndisagreeable information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to winter here,\xe2\x80\x9d informed Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spanish\r\nlieutenant-governor won\xe2\x80\x99t pass us on. He claims that he has not been\r\nofficially notified yet to transfer Upper Louisiana to the United\r\nStates\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95or, for that matter, even to France. So all we can do is to\r\nmake winter camp on United States soil, on the east side of the river,\r\nand wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95I\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged two more boats\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth sides of the river are ours,\r\nbut I suppose we ought to avoid trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the winter camp was placed near the mouth of Wood River, on the east\r\nbank of the Mississippi, about twenty miles above St. Louis. Log cabins\r\nwere erected; and besides, the big keel-boat was decked fore and aft,\r\nand had a cabin and men\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. Consequently nobody need suffer\r\nfrom the cold.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis stayed most of the time in St. Louis, arranging for\r\nsupplies, studying medicine, astronomy, botany and other sciences, and\r\nlearning much about the Indians up the Missouri. Captain Clark looked\r\nafter the camp, and drilled the men almost every day.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis was then forty years old; it contained less than 200 houses,\r\nof stone and log, and about 1000 people, almost all French. The\r\nlieutenant-governor, who lived here in charge of Upper Louisiana of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Illinois Country\xe2\x80\x9d (as all this section was called), was Don Carlos\r\nDehault Delassus, also of French blood, but appointed by Spain.\r\n\r\nIndignant now was Spain, objecting to the new ownership by the United\r\nStates, and asserting that by the terms of the bargain with France\r\nthat government had promised not to dispose of the province to any\r\nother nation. But this evidently had made no difference to Napoleon.\r\n\r\nNot until November 30, of 1803, while Captain Lewis was on his road\r\nfrom Kaskaskia to St. Louis and Captain Clark was toiling with his\r\nkeel-boat up from the mouth of the Ohio (both captains thinking that\r\nthey had a clear way ahead), was the Spanish flag in New Orleans hauled\r\ndown, and the French flag hoisted. On December 20 the representative of\r\nthe French government there, Monsieur Pierre Clement Laussat, and his\r\nmen, saluted the hoisting of the Stars and Stripes, formally delivered\r\nLower and Upper Louisiana to the United States.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Lieutenant-Governor Delassus, of Upper Louisiana, waited\r\nfor official instruction. Distances were great, he wished to receive\r\norders what to do. In St. Louis Captain Lewis waited; in the camp at\r\nWood River Captain Clark waited; the Missouri froze over and they could\r\nnot go on anyway.\r\n\r\nChristmas was celebrated, and the memorable year 1803 merged into the\r\nnew year 1804. Finally, by letter, date of January 12, 1804, from\r\nMonsieur Laussat at New Orleans, Lieutenant-Governor Delassus was\r\nnotified that dispatches were on the road to Captain Amos Stoddard,\r\nof the United States Artillery, and commanding at Fort Kaskaskia,\r\nempowering him to represent France at St. Louis and take over from\r\nSpain the district of Upper Louisiana. He was then to turn it over to\r\nhimself as representative of the United States.\r\n\r\nOn February 25 Captain Stoddard announced that he was ready to receive\r\nUpper Louisiana in the name of France. March 9 was set as the day.\r\nCaptain Lewis was invited to be present at the ceremony, as an official\r\nwitness. Captain Clark probably came over; perhaps some of the men, for\r\nall the countryside gathered at the great event.\r\n\r\nA number of Indians from up the Mississippi and up the Missouri, and\r\nout of the plains to the west, had witnessed the ceremony of transfer.\r\nThey did not understand it all. They said that the United States had\r\ncaptured St. Louis. On March 12 their good friend, Lieutenant-Governor\r\nDelassus, issued an address to them, explaining that now they had a new\r\nfather, and he introduced to them the new United States chiefs who had\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Captain Stoddard and Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nBut the Delawares, the Sacs, the Osages, and others\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95they still were\r\ndissatisfied, and especially the Osages. Captain Lewis was particularly\r\nanxious to please the Osages, for they were the first of the powerful\r\ntribes whom he might encounter, up the Missouri. He tried to talk with\r\nthe chiefs in St. Louis; by a trader sent a letter on to the Osage\r\nvillage, asking the head chiefs to meet him at the river and exchange\r\npeace presents.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Osages dwelt the Otoes, the Missouris, the \xe2\x80\x99Mahas (Omahas),\r\nthe Sioux, the Arikaras, the Mandans, the Minnetarees; and then, who\r\ncould say? Few white men, even the French traders, had been farther.\r\nHow would all these tribes, known and unknown, receive the strange\r\nAmericans?\r\n\r\nSpring had come, the ice was whirling down, in rotted floes, out of the\r\nnorth, the channel of the crooked Missouri was clearing, and every man\r\nin the expedition was keen to be away, following the honking geese into\r\nthis new America over which the flag of the United States waved at last.\r\n\r\nNow the expedition had grown to full strength. There were the two\r\ncaptains; the fourteen soldiers enlisted at Pittsburg, Fort Massac\r\nand Fort Kaskaskia; the nine Kentuckians, enrolled at Mulberry Hill\r\nnear Louisville; George Drouillard (or Drewyer, as he was called),\r\nthe hunter from Kaskaskia who had been recommended by Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother the general; Labiche and one-eyed old Cruzatte, French\r\nvoyageurs or boatmen engaged by Captain Lewis at St. Louis; nine other\r\nboatmen, and Corporal Warfington and six privates from the Kaskaskia\r\ntroops in St. Louis, who were to go as far as the next winter camp, and\r\nthen return with records and trophies; and black York, Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaithful servant, who was going just as far as his master did.\r\n\r\nSo forty-five there were in all, to start. Except York, those who were\r\ngoing through had been sworn in as privates in the United States Army,\r\nto serve during the expedition, or until discharged on the way, if so\r\nhappened. Charles Floyd, one of the young Kentuckians; Nathaniel Pryor,\r\nhis cousin, and John Ordway, enrolled at Kaskaskia from among the New\r\nHampshire company, were appointed sergeants.\r\n\r\nFor outfit they had their flint-lock rifles, especially manufactured;\r\nflint-lock pistols, hunting knives, powder contained in lead canisters\r\nor pails to be melted into bullets when emptied, tents, tools,\r\nprovisions of pork, flour, etc., warm extra clothing for winter, old\r\nCruzatte\xe2\x80\x99s fiddle, George Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s fiddle, medicines, including the new\r\nkine-pox with which to vaccinate the Indians, the captains\xe2\x80\x99 scientific\r\ninstruments, a wonderful air-gun that shot forty times without\r\nreloading, and a cannon or blunderbuss.\r\n\r\nSeven large bales and one emergency box had been packed with their\r\nstores; and there were fourteen other bales and one sample box of\r\ngifts for the Indians: gay laced coats, flags, knives, iron tomahawks,\r\nbeads, looking-glasses, handkerchiefs (red and blue), paints (yellow,\r\nblue and crimson), not forgetting three kinds of medals\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95first-class\r\nand second-class, of silver, and third-class, of pewter\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95for chiefs\r\nto hang about their necks as token of friendship from their new great\r\nwhite father at Washington. The knives and tomahawks had been made at\r\nHarper\xe2\x80\x99s Ferry.\r\n\r\nThree boats were ready: the keel-boat built at Pittsburg, and two\r\npirogues bought at St. Louis. The keel-boat or batteau was to be the\r\nflag-ship. It was a kind of flat-boat or barge, fifty-five feet long;\r\nof heavy planks, with bow overhanging and a little pointed, and square\r\noverhanging stern fitted with a keel and with a tiller rudder. It had\r\nplaces for eleven oars on a side, and carried a sail. Along either\r\ngunwale was a plank path or walking-board, from which the men might\r\npush with poles.\r\n\r\nMuch ingenuity and care had Captain Lewis spent on this flag-ship.\r\nUnder a deck at the bows the crew might sleep; and under the deck\r\nat the stern was the cabin for the officers; in the middle were\r\nlockers, for stowing stuff\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and the lids when raised formed a line of\r\nbreastworks against bullets and arrows! The blunderbuss was mounted in\r\nthe bows, the flag floated from a staff. The boat drew only three feet\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nThe two pirogues were smaller, open flat-boats or barges; one painted\r\nred, the other white; one fitted with six oars, the other with seven.\r\nThey also had sails.\r\n\r\nAt Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Ferry Captain Lewis had ordered the steel framework of\r\na canoe. This was \xe2\x80\x9cknocked down,\xe2\x80\x9d in sections, and stowed in the\r\nkeel-boat, later to be put together and covered with bark or skins, for\r\nuse in the shallow waters far up-river.\r\n\r\nAnd there were two horses, which should accompany the boats by land,\r\nfor scouting and hunting purposes.\r\n\r\nApril passed; May arrived. The Missouri was reported free of ice, and\r\nwas rising rapidly. The trees had budded and greened, the grasses\r\nwere getting high, game would be plentiful, the Indians would be\r\nleaving their villages for their spring hunts, and \xe2\x80\x99twas time that\r\nthe expedition should start. In their camp at Wood River the men drew\r\non the supply of quill pens, ink horns and paper and wrote farewell\r\nletters home. In St. Louis Captain Clark and Captain Lewis were given\r\nfarewell dinners. By Doctor Saugrain, the learned physician and\r\nscientist under whom he was studying, Captain Lewis was presented with\r\na handful of matches\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95curious little sticks which, when briskly rubbed\r\nagainst something, burst into flame. The Indians would marvel at these.\r\n\r\nShortly before four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon of May 14, this 1804, the\r\nstart was made. The St. Louis people gathered along the river bank on\r\nthat side, to watch the boats move up. The blunderbuss was discharged,\r\nin salute; the cannon of the fort answered. Captain Clark, bidding\r\ngoodbye from the deck of the keel-boat, was in full dress uniform of\r\nred-trimmed blue coat and trousers, and gold epaulets, his sword at his\r\nbelt, his three-cornered chapeau on his red head. The sails swelled in\r\nthe breeze, the men at the oars sang in French and shouted in English.\r\nDrewyer the hunter rode one horse and led the other. All, save Captain\r\nClark, were dressed for business\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Corporal Warfington\xe2\x80\x99s squad from St.\r\nLouis in United States uniform, the nine Kentuckians in buckskins, the\r\nfourteen soldiers and civilians, enlisted at the posts, in flannel\r\nshirts and trousers of buckskin or coarse army cloth, the French\r\nboatmen in brightly fringed woollens, with scarlet \xe2\x80\x99kerchiefs about\r\ntheir heads. Rain was falling, but who cared!\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis did not accompany. He was detained to talk more with the\r\nOsages who had come down. He hoped yet to make things clear to them.\r\nBut he would join the boats at the village of St. Charles, twenty miles\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIn the sunshine of May 16 they tied to the bank at St. Charles. At the\r\nreport of the cannon\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95boom!\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the French villagers, now Americans all,\r\ncame running down and gave welcome.\r\n\r\nSunday the 20th Captain Lewis arrived by skiff from St. Louis, and with\r\nhim an escort of the St. Louis people, again to cheer the expedition\r\non its way. Not until Monday afternoon, the 21st, was the expedition\r\nenabled to tear itself from the banquets and hand-shakings, and onward\r\nfare in earnest, against the wind and rain.\r\n\r\nTawny ran the great Missouri River, flooded with the melted snows\r\nof the wild north, bristling with black snags, and treacherous with\r\nshifting bars. On either hand the banks crashed in, undermined by the\r\nchanging currents. But rowing, poling, hauling with ropes, and even\r\njumping overboard to shove, only occasionally aided by favoring breeze,\r\nthe men, soldiers and voyageurs alike, worked hard and kept going. On\r\nleaving St. Charles the two captains doffed their uniforms until the\r\nnext dress-up event, and donned buckskins and moccasins.\r\n\r\nPast La Charette, the settlement where Daniel Boone lived\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the very\r\nlast white settlement on the Missouri, toiled the boats; now, beyond,\r\nthe country was red. Past the mouth of the Osage River up which lived\r\nthe Osage Indian; but no Osages were there to treat with them. Past the\r\nmouth of the Kansas River, and the Little Platte; and still no Indians\r\nappeared, except some Kickapoos bringing deer. Rafts were encountered,\r\ndescending with the first of the traders bringing down their winter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfurs: a raft from the Osages, shouting that the Osages would not\r\nbelieve that St. Louis had been \xe2\x80\x9ccaptured,\xe2\x80\x9d and had burnt the Captain\r\nLewis message; from the Kansas, from the Pawnees up the Big Platte,\r\nfrom the Sioux of the far north.\r\n\r\nOff a Sioux raft old Pierre Dorion, one of the traders, was hired by\r\nthe captains to go with the expedition up to the Sioux, and make them\r\nfriendly. He had lived among the Yankton Sioux twenty years.\r\n\r\nThrough June and July, without especial incident, the expedition\r\nvoyaged ever up-river into the northwest, constantly on the look-out\r\nfor Indians with whom to talk.\r\n\r\nThe two captains regularly wrote down what they saw and did and\r\nheard; a number of the men also kept diaries. Sergeant Charles Floyd,\r\nSergeant John Ordway, Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor, Private Patrick Gass,\r\nPrivate Joseph Whitehouse, Private Robert Frazier and Private Alexander\r\nWillard\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95they faithfully scrawled with their quill pens, recording\r\neach day\xe2\x80\x99s events as they saw them. The journals of Floyd, Gass, and\r\nWhitehouse have been published, so that we may read them as well as the\r\njournals of the captains.\r\n\r\nNot until the first of August, and when almost fifty miles above the\r\nmouth of the Platte River, was the first council with the Indians\r\nheld. Here a few Otoes and Missouris came in, at a camping-place on\r\nthe Nebraska side of the Missouri, christened by the two captains the\r\nCouncil-bluffs, from which the present Iowa city of Council Bluffs,\r\ntwenty miles below and opposite, takes its name.\r\n\r\nNow in the middle of August the expedition is encamped at the west\r\nside of the river, about fifteen miles below present Sioux City, Iowa,\r\nwaiting to talk with the principal chiefs of the Otoes and the Omahas,\r\nand hoping to establish a peace between them. But the Omahas had fled\r\nfrom the small-pox, and the Otoes were slow to come in.\r\n\r\nThe voyageur Libert\xc3\xa9 and the soldier Moses Reed were missing from the\r\ncamp; a party had been sent out to capture them as deserters.\r\n\r\nEight hundred and thirty-six miles had been logged off, from St. Louis,\r\nin the three months.\r\n\r\nHere the story opens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING THE WEST WITH LEWIS AND CLARK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF THE WHITE CHIEFS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are many,\xe2\x80\x9d reported Shon-go-ton-go, or Big Horse, sub-chief of\r\nthe Otoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many?\xe2\x80\x9d asked We-ah-rush-hah, or Little Thief, the head chief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs many,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Big Horse, \xe2\x80\x9cas five times the fingers on two hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWah!\xe2\x80\x9d gravely grunted the circle, where the chiefs and warriors\r\nsquatted in their blankets and buffalo robes.\r\n\r\nFor August, the Ripe Corn month, of 1804, had arrived to the Oto\r\nIndians\xe2\x80\x99 country in present Nebraska beyond the Missouri River; but\r\nnow at their buffalo-hunt camp north of the River Platte the chiefs of\r\nthe combined Oto and Missouri nations sat in solemn council instead of\r\nchasing the buffalo.\r\n\r\nThrough a long time, or since the month when the buffalo begin to shed,\r\nthe air had been full of rumors. Five moons back, when the cottonwood\r\nbuds first swelled, down at the big white village of \xe2\x80\x9cSan Loui\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d there\r\nhad been a ceremony by which, according to the best word, all this\r\nvast land watered by the Missouri River had changed white fathers.\r\nThe Spanish father\xe2\x80\x99s flag had been hauled down, and a different flag\r\nhad been raised. Indians had been there and had seen; yes, Shawnees,\r\nSaukies, Delawares, Osages\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95they had been there, and had seen. The\r\nSpanish governor, whose name was Delassus, had made a speech, to the\r\nwhite people. He had said:\r\n\r\n    PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n    March 9, 1804.\r\n\r\n    _Inhabitants of Upper Louisiana_:\r\n\r\n    By the King\xe2\x80\x99s command, I am about to deliver up this post and\r\n    its dependences!\r\n\r\n    The flag under which you have been protected for a period of\r\n    nearly thirty-six years is to be withdrawn. From this moment\r\n    you are released from the oath of fidelity you took to support\r\n    it.\r\n\r\nThe speech was hard to understand, but there it was, tacked up on the\r\nwhite man\xe2\x80\x99s talking paper. Moreover, the good governor had made a talk\r\nfor the Indians also, his red children. He had said:\r\n\r\n    Your old fathers, the Spaniard and the Frenchman, who grasp by\r\n    the hand your new father, the head chief of the United States,\r\n    by an act of their good will, and in virtue of their last\r\n    treaty, have delivered up to them all these lands. They will\r\n    keep and defend them, and protect all the white and red skins\r\n    who live thereon.\r\n\r\n    For several days we have fired off cannon shots to announce to\r\n    all the nations that your father, the Spaniard, is going, his\r\n    heart happy to know that you will be protected and sustained by\r\n    your new father, and that the smoke of the powder may ascend to\r\n    the Master of Life, praying him to shower on you all a happy\r\n    destiny and prosperity in always living in good union with the\r\n    whites.\r\n\r\nUp the great river and into the west, by traders and runners had come\r\nthe tidings.\r\n\r\nWho were these United States? What kind of a man was the new white\r\nfather? He was sending a party of his warriors, bearing presents\r\nand peace talk. They already had ascended the big river, past the\r\nmouth of the Platte. They had dispatched messengers to the Otoes and\r\nthe Missouris, asking them to come in to council. But the Otoes and\r\nMissouris had left their village where they lived with their friends\r\nthe Pawnees, in order to hunt the buffalo before gathering their corn,\r\nand only by accident had the invitation reached them.\r\n\r\nThen Shon-go-ton-go and We-the-a and Shos-gus-can and others had gone;\r\nand had returned safe and satisfied. They had returned laden with\r\ngifts\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95paint and armlets and powder, and medals curiously figured,\r\nhung around their necks by the two white chiefs themselves. They had\r\nhastened to seek out We-ah-rush-hah, the head chief, in his camp, and\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe white chiefs were waiting to treat with him, as was proper, and\r\nthey had sent to him a bright colored flag, and ornaments, and a medal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do the white chiefs want?\xe2\x80\x9d queried We-ah-rush-hah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say that the new white father will be generous with the Otoes and\r\nMissouris, and wishes us to be at peace with our enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he protect us from those robbers, the Omahas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wishes us to make peace with the Omahas. The United States would\r\ngo with us to the Omahas, but we told them we were afraid. We are poor\r\nand weak and the Omahas would kill us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d approved We-ah-rush-hah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two of the white chiefs,\xe2\x80\x9d added We-the-a, or Hospitable One,\r\nthe Missouri chief. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wear long knives by their sides. Their hair\r\nis of strange color. The hair of one is yellow like ripe corn; the hair\r\nof the other is red as pipe-stone. The Red Head is big and pleasant;\r\nthe yellow-haired one is slim and very straight, and when he speaks he\r\ndoes not smile. Yes, the Red Head is a buffalo, but the other is an\r\nelk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have three boats,\xe2\x80\x9d added Shos-gus-can, or White Horse, who was\r\nan Oto. \xe2\x80\x9cOne boat is larger than any boat of any trader. It has a gun\r\nthat talks in thunder. Of the other boats, one is painted white, one is\r\npainted red. The chiefs are dressed in long blue shirts that glitter\r\nwith shining metal. The party are strong in arms. They have much guns,\r\nand powder and lead, and much medicine. They have a gun that shoots\r\nwith air, and shoots many times. It is great medicine. They have a man\r\nall black like a buffalo in fall, with very white teeth and short black\r\nhair, curly like a buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s. He is great medicine. They carry a white\r\nflag with blue and red borders. Red, white and blue are their medicine\r\ncolors. The flag is their peace sign. There are French with them, from\r\nbelow, and another, a trader from the Sioux. They received us under a\r\nwhite lodge, and have named the place the Council-bluffs. They must be\r\nof a great nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go and see these United States, and talk with them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nannounced Little Thief, majestically. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir presents have been good,\r\ntheir words sound good. It is unwise to refuse gifts laid upon the\r\nprairie. If indeed we have a new father for all the Indians, maybe by\r\nlistening to his chiefs we can get more from him than we did from our\r\nSpanish father. I will go and talk, at the burnt Omaha village. Let\r\nthe four white men who have come with gifts and a message, seeking\r\nbrothers-who-have-run-away, be well treated, so that we shall be well\r\ntreated also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the council broke up.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts, a boy, Little White Osage, had listened with all his\r\nears. The affair was very interesting. A hot desire filled his heart to\r\ngo, himself, and see these United States warriors, with their painted\r\nboats and their marvelous guns and their black medicine-man and their\r\ntwo chiefs whose hair was different, like his own hair.\r\n\r\nHis own hair was brown and fine instead of being black and coarse, and\r\nhis eyes were blue instead of black, and his skin, even in its tan, was\r\nlight instead of dark. Sometimes he was puzzled to remember just how\r\nhe had come among the Otoes. He did not always feel like an Indian. To\r\nbe sure, he had been bought from the Osages by the Otoes; but away,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99way back there had been a woman, a light-haired, soft-skinned woman,\r\namong the Osages, who had kissed him and hugged him and had taught him\r\na language that he well-nigh had forgotten.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one of those strange words rose to his lips, but he rarely\r\nused it, because the Osages, and now the Otoes, did not wish him to use\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Otoes called him Little White Osage, as a kind of slur. Nobody\r\nkissed him and hugged him, but in their ill-natured moments the Oto\r\nsquaws beat him, and the children teased him. The squaws never beat the\r\nother boys. Antoine, the French trader, was kinder to him. But Antoine\r\nhad married an Oto woman, and all his children were dark and Indian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the burnt Omaha village,\xe2\x80\x9d had said Chief Little Thief.\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage knew where this was. The United States chiefs,\r\nby their messengers, had invited Little Thief to meet them at the\r\nprincipal Omaha Indian village, so that peace might be made between\r\nthe Omahas and the Otoes. But the village had been smitten by a\r\nsickness\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the smallpox, old Antoine had named it, and the frightened\r\nOmahas had burned their lodges and had fled, such as were able. Only\r\nthe site of the village remained, and its graves.\r\n\r\nIt would be of no use to try to go with the chief\xe2\x80\x99s party. They would\r\nnot want boys, and especially a boy who was not like other Indian boys,\r\nand bore a name of the hated Osages. Therefore, this night, in the\r\ndusk, he slipped from under his thin blanket in the skin lodge, where\r\nslumbered old Antoine and family, and scuttled, bending low, out into\r\nthe prairie.\r\n\r\nHe would have sought the four white men who had come from the United\r\nStates chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 camp, but they had left, looking for two other men who\r\nhad strayed. And besides, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel certain that they would help\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe prairie was thick with high grasses, and with bushes whereon\r\nberries were ripening; he wore only a cloth about his waist, on his\r\nfeet moccasins, but he did not mind, for his skin was tough. He carried\r\nhis bow, of the yellow osage wood, and slung under his left arm his\r\nbadger-hide quiver containing blunt reed arrows.\r\n\r\nThe damp night air was heavy with smoke, for the prairies had been\r\nfired in order to drive out the game. Now and then he startled some\r\nanimal. Eyes glowed at him, and disappeared, and a shadowy form loped\r\naway. That was a wolf. He was not afraid of any cowardly wolf. Larger\r\nforms bolted, with snorts. They were antelope. To a tremendous snort\r\na much larger form bounded from his path. That was an elk. But he\r\nhastened on at a trot and fast walk, alert and excited, his nostrils\r\nand eyes and ears wide, while he ever kept the North Star before him on\r\nhis left.\r\n\r\nIt seemed long ere in the east, whither he was hurrying, the stars were\r\npaling. On his swift young legs he had covered many miles. None of the\r\nOto or Missouri boys could have done better, but he simply had to\r\nrest. The dawn brightened; he should eat and hide himself and sleep. So\r\nhe paused, to make plans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWah!\xe2\x80\x9d And \xe2\x80\x9cHoorah!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHoorah!\xe2\x80\x9d was one of those strange words which\r\nwould rise to his lips. Far before him, although not more than three or\r\nfour hours\xe2\x80\x99 travel, was a low line of trees marking the course of the\r\nbig river. He took a step; from a clump of brush leaped a rabbit\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and\r\nstopped to squat. Instantly Little White Osage had strung bow, fitted\r\narrow, and shot. The arrow thudded, the rabbit scarcely kicked. Picking\r\nhim up, Little White Osage trotted on, his breakfast in hand.\r\n\r\nNow he smelled smoke stronger, and scouting about he cautiously\r\napproached a smouldering camp-fire. Omahas? But he espied nobody\r\nmoving, or lying down. It was an old camp-fire. Around it he discovered\r\nin the dust that had been stirred up, the prints of boots. The white\r\nmen had been here\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95perhaps the messengers to the camp of Little Thief.\r\nGood! He might cook his rabbit; and sitting, he did cook it after he\r\nhad built the fire into more heat. He ate. Then he curled in the grass,\r\nlike a brown rabbit himself, and slept.\r\n\r\nWhen he wakened, the sun was high. He stretched; peered, to be safe;\r\ndrank from a nearby creek, and set forward again. Nearer he drew to\r\nthe big river, and nearer; and he had to move more carefully lest the\r\nOmahas should be lurking at their village, and sight him. The Omahas\r\nwould be glad to capture anybody from the Otoes. There was no peace\r\nbetween the two peoples.\r\n\r\nThe ruined village lay lifeless and black, with its graves on the hill\r\nabove it. He circled the village, and found a spot whence he could gaze\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe broad big river flowed evenly between its low banks; curving amidst\r\nthe willows and cottonwoods and sand-bars, it was the highway for the\r\ngreat white village of \xe2\x80\x9cSan Loui\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d at its mouth many days to the\r\nsouth. It led also up into the country of the Mandans and the fierce\r\nSioux, in the unknown north. And yonder, on a sand sprit above the\r\nmouth of the Omaha Creek, was the white chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 camp!\r\n\r\nWith his sharp eyes Little White Osage eagerly surveyed. Three boats\r\nthere were, just as said by Shos-gus-can: one painted white, and one\r\npainted red, and one very large, fastened in the shallows. On the sand\r\nwere kettles, over fires, and many men moving about, or lying under a\r\ncanopy; and a red, white and blue flag flying in the breeze.\r\n\r\nA party were leaving the camp, and coming toward him. They could not\r\nsee him\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95he was too cleverly hidden in the bushes, above. Wading\r\nthrough the grasses waist high they made for the creek and halted\r\nwhere the beavers had dammed it into a pond. These were white men,\r\nsurely. They numbered the fingers on two hands, and three more fingers.\r\nThey carried guns, and a net of branches and twigs; and one, a tall\r\nstraight man, wore at his side a long knife in a sheath which flashed.\r\nHe had on his head a queer three-cornered covering. He was the leader,\r\nfor when he spoke and pointed, the other men jumped to obey.\r\n\r\nThey walked into the water, to net fish. They hauled and tugged and\r\nplashed and laughed and shouted; and when they emerged upon the bank\r\nagain their net was so heavy that the leader sprang to help them. He\r\ntossed aside his head covering. His hair was bright like ripe corn. One\r\nof the two chiefs, he!\r\n\r\nWhat a lot of fish they brought out! Hundreds of them sparkled in the\r\nsun. This sport continued until near sunset, when the men all went\r\naway, to eat and sleep.\r\n\r\nAt dusk Little White Osage stole down to the creek. Some of the fish\r\nwere scattered about, but they were stiff and dull; he could not eat\r\nthem without cooking them and he was afraid to risk a fire. So he\r\ngathered mussels and clams, and these were pretty good, raw.\r\n\r\nThat night the camp-fires of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Nited States\xe2\x80\x9d warriors blazed on the\r\nbeach at the river; in the grasses of a hollow above the creek Little\r\nWhite Osage finally slept.\r\n\r\nTherefore another morning dawned and found him still here, waiting to\r\nsee what the new whites would do next. But he must not be caught by\r\nChief Little Thief and old Antoine, or they would punish him.\r\n\r\nThe United States were eating. Almost could he smell the meat on the\r\nfires. After eating, the camp busied itself in many ways. Some of the\r\nmen again walked up the creek. Others raised a pole, or mast, on the\r\nlargest boat. Others swam and frolicked in the river. Evidently the\r\ncamp was staying for the arrival of We-ah-rush-hah.\r\n\r\nBut that meat! The thought of it made the mouth of Little White Osage\r\nto water. Well, he must go and find something and cook it where he\r\nwould be safe, and then return to those women and children who did not\r\nlike him. He had seen the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Nited States,\xe2\x80\x9d and their chief with the\r\nyellow hair. Maybe he had seen the red-hair chief, too.\r\n\r\nHe crept on hands and knees, until he might trudge boldly, aiming\r\nnorthward so as not to meet with Little Thief. When after a time he\r\nlooked back, toward the river, he saw a great smoke rising. The United\r\nStates had set the prairie afire!\r\n\r\nHah! That they had! Did they set the prairie afire just to burn him, a\r\nboy? Had they known that he was watching them, and had that made them\r\nangry? The smoke increased rapidly\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95broadened and billowed. The prairie\r\nbreeze puffed full and strong from the southeast, and the pungent odor\r\nof burning grasses swept across his quivering nostrils. The fire was\r\npursuing him. It had cut off any retreat to the big river waters; it\r\nwas swifter than an antelope, on his trail. Very cunning and cruel were\r\nthose \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Nited States\xe2\x80\x9d men.\r\n\r\nThrough the tall dry grasses strained Little White Osage, seeking\r\nrefuge. He sobbed in his husky throat. If he might but reach that line\r\nof sand hills, yonder, they would break the wall of fire and save him.\r\nIt was such a big fire to send after such a small boy. Now the sun was\r\nveiled by the scudding smoke, and the wind blew acrid and hot. Before\r\nhim fled animals\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95racing antelope and bounding elk, galloping wolves\r\nand darting birds. They were fast; but he\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95alas, he was too slow, and\r\nhe was weak and tired. Was he to be burned? He threw aside his quiver,\r\nand next his bow. They felt so heavy.\r\n\r\nThe fire was close. He could hear the crackle and the popping as it\r\ndevoured everything. The sand hills were mocking him; they seemed to\r\nsneak backward as he toiled forward. Suddenly, panting and stumbling,\r\nhe burst into a little clearing, where the grasses were short. In the\r\nmidst of the clearing lay the carcass of a buffalo bull.\r\n\r\nWith dimmed staring eyes Little White Osage, casting wildly about for\r\nshelter, saw. He saw the carcass, partially cut up; the meat had been\r\npiled on the hide, as if the hunters had left, to get it another time;\r\nand on the meat was planted a ramrod or wiping-stick, with a coat hung\r\non it, to keep off the wolves. But nobody was here.\r\n\r\nNot in vain had Little White Osage been trained to look out for\r\nhimself. Now he knew what he could do. He staggered for the meat-pile;\r\nfrantically tore it away, but not to eat it. He barely could lift the\r\ngreat hide, but lift it he did; wriggled underneath, drew it over him,\r\nand crouched there, gasping.\r\n\r\nCrackle, pop, roar\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and the wall of fire charged the clearing, dashed\r\ninto it, licked hotly across it, and snatched at the robe. He felt\r\nthe robe shrivel and writhe, and smelled the stench of sizzling flesh\r\nand hair. He could scarcely breathe. Over him the buffalo hide was\r\nscorching through and through. How the fire roared, how the wind\r\nblew; but neither fire nor wind could get at him through that tough,\r\ninch-thick canopy. Almost smothered by heat and smoke, Little White\r\nOsage cringed, waiting. He was a wee bit afraid.\r\n\r\nSoon he knew that the fire had passed. He ventured to raise an edge of\r\nthe hide and peek from under. Smoke wafted into his face and choked\r\nhim. Black lay the cindered land around; the fire was surging on to the\r\nwest, where the sand hills would stop it, but it had mowed a path too\r\nhot to walk on, yet. He must stay awhile.\r\n\r\nHe reached out a hand and dragged to him a piece of the charred\r\nbloody buffalo meat, and nibbled at it. Over him the buffalo hide\r\nhad stiffened, to form a pup-tent; and really he was not so very\r\nuncomfortable. He ate, and stretching the best that he might, pillowed\r\nhis face on his bended arm. Next, he was asleep\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95tired Little White\r\nOsage.\r\n\r\nHe slept with an ear open, for voices and tread of feet aroused him.\r\nPeople were coming. He craned his neck to peer about\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and ducked\r\nfurther inside, like a turtle inside its shell.\r\n\r\nTwo persons had arrived in the clearing. They were walking straight\r\ntoward him. They were white men. They were some of those United States\r\nwarriors!\r\n\r\nA moment more, and a heavy foot kicked the hide\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95thump!\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and hands\r\nruthlessly overthrew it. Exposed, Little White Osage sprang erect,\r\ngained his feet at a bound, stood bravely facing the two warriors of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Nited States.\xe2\x80\x9d He would not show them that he feared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99gorry,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a voice, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a quare pea in a pod!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPETER GOES ABOARD\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage did not understand the words, but they were said\r\nwith a laugh. He could only stare.\r\n\r\nTwo, were these United States men. The one who had spoken was short\r\nand broad and quick, like a bear. He had a lean freckled face and\r\nshrewd twinkling grey eyes. He wore a blue shirt, and belted trousers,\r\nand boots, and on his head a wide-brimmed black hat. Leaning upon a\r\nlong-barrelled flint-lock gun, he laughed.\r\n\r\nThe other man was younger\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95much younger, almost too young to take the\r\nwar path. He was smooth-faced and very blue-eyed. He wore a blue shirt,\r\ntoo, and fringed buckskin trousers, and moccasins, and around his black\r\nhair a red handkerchief, gaily tied.\r\n\r\nBut as his hair was black, he could not be one of the chiefs. The short\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s hair was not black, but it was the color of wet sand\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and so he\r\ncould not be one of the chiefs.\r\n\r\nNow the young warrior spoke and his voice was sweet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Little White Osage did understand. The words penetrated through as\r\nfrom a distance. There had been a long time since he had heard such\r\nwords. His throat swelled to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. What boy? Oto?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissouri?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Maha?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage shook his head more vigorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat tribe, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage struggled hard to reply in that language. But his\r\nthroat closed tight. The young warrior was so handsome and so kind,\r\nand the broad warrior was so homely and so alert, and he himself was\r\nso small and so full of hopes and fears, that he choked. He could not\r\nspeak at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what you can make out of him, Pat,\xe2\x80\x9d bade the young warrior. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nseems afraid of me. But he understands English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, now,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled the bold warrior, \xe2\x80\x9csure, mebbe he\xe2\x80\x99s wan o\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\nMandan Injuns, from up-river. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t they the eyes an\xe2\x80\x99 complexion same\r\nas a white man?\xe2\x80\x9d And he addressed Little White Osage. \xe2\x80\x9cMandan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage again shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not Oto or Missouri or \xe2\x80\x99Maha or Mandan, who be ye? My\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s Patrick Gass; what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe throat of Little White Osage swelled. He strove\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and suddenly out\r\npopped the word, long, long unused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKerr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKerr\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95white boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly saints!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Patrick Gass, astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear that,\r\nGeorge, lad? An\xe2\x80\x99 sure he\xe2\x80\x99s white, an\xe2\x80\x99 by the name o\xe2\x80\x99 him Irish! Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind the Irish, wherever ye go. An\xe2\x80\x99 what might be your first name, me\r\nboy? Is it Pat, or Terry, or Mike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was too much talk all at once, for Little White Osage. The man\r\ncalled George helped him out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can he understand your villainous brogue, Pat! Let me talk to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d And he invited, of Little White Osage: \xe2\x80\x9cKerr, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are white?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99d you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA boldness seized upon Little White Osage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cUp big river\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95with \xe2\x80\x99Nited States.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother recruit, is it? Does your mother\r\nsay you might?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage shook his head. Somehow, a lump rose in his throat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother?\xe2\x80\x9d What was \xe2\x80\x9cmother?\xe2\x80\x9d That soft white woman, who away back in\r\nthe Osage village had hugged him and kissed him and taught him these\r\nwords which thronged inside him, must have been \xe2\x80\x9cmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo mother. No f-f-father.\xe2\x80\x9d He carefully felt his way. \xe2\x80\x9cKen\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Kentucky.\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Peter Kerr. Go up river with \xe2\x80\x99Nited States.\xe2\x80\x9d And he managed\r\nanother word. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 we set the prairie afire to call in the Injuns, an\xe2\x80\x99 here\xe2\x80\x99s what we\r\ncaught,\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Kerr, be it? Likely that was\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s name, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s young Peter. Well, what\xe2\x80\x99ll we do with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can take him back to the boats with us, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d mused George.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as for his going on with the expedition, Pat, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nthe captains would say, or the Otoes, either. He\xe2\x80\x99s from the Otoes, he\r\nclaims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sure ain\xe2\x80\x99t he an Irishman from Kentucky?\xe2\x80\x9d reminded Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe Irish, too? Mebbe we can buy the young spalpeen, for a trifle o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npaint an\xe2\x80\x99 powder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if the Otoes would sell him. How long have you been with the\r\nOtoes, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage had been listening as hard as he could, trying to\r\nguess what these long speeches were about. That last question, to him,\r\nawakened an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAl-ways,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered, slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Osage, then Oto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where Kentucky is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d But he pointed to the east. \xe2\x80\x9cThere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are your father and mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d and Little White Osage pointed to the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where St. Louis is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed south.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where we\xe2\x80\x99re going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed north.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you leave the Otoes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95white; you white. I \xe2\x80\x99Nited States.\xe2\x80\x9d And Little White Osage\r\nstiffened proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBedad, spoken like a good citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d approved Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith,\r\nGeorge, lad, \xe2\x80\x99twould be a shame to return him to the Injuns\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95to them\r\noncivilized rascals. Can\xe2\x80\x99t we smuggle him aboard? An\xe2\x80\x99 then after we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall under way the two captains can do with him as they plaze.\xe2\x80\x9d His gray\r\neyes danced at the thought, and he scanned George questioningly.\r\n\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes were twinkling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say that on our way up river we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet more traders coming\r\ndown, and he can be sent to St. Louis that way. But we\xe2\x80\x99re liable to be\r\nin a scrape, Pat, if we\xe2\x80\x99re found out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s an Irishman without a scrape?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Pat \xe2\x80\x9cListen, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nbade, to Little White Osage, who had been attending very keenly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter dusk ye slip aboard the big boat. Understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle White Osage nodded. They had planned something good for him, and\r\nhe was willing to agree to whatever it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlip aboard the big boat,\xe2\x80\x9d and Pat pointed and signed, to make plain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 hide yourself away for\xe2\x80\x99d down among the supplies. Kape quiet till\r\nafter the council, or the Otoes\xe2\x80\x99ll get ye. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be findin\xe2\x80\x99 ye an\xe2\x80\x99\r\npassin\xe2\x80\x99 ye a bit to ate. An\xe2\x80\x99 when we\xe2\x80\x99re a-sailin\xe2\x80\x99 up the big river\r\nwance more, then ye\xe2\x80\x99ll have to face the captains, an\xe2\x80\x99 what they\xe2\x80\x99ll say\r\nI dunno, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet my hat that Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Clark\xe2\x80\x99ll talk the heart o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCap\xe2\x80\x99n Lewis, who\xe2\x80\x99s an officer an\xe2\x80\x99 a gintleman, into lettin\xe2\x80\x99 ye stay if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s proof ye have no-wheres else to go.\xe2\x80\x9d And Patrick Gass chuckled.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, they can\xe2\x80\x99t set ye afoot on the prairie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were too many strange words in this speech, but Little White\r\nOsage caught the import.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hide,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, obediently. \xe2\x80\x9cIn big boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight-o!\xe2\x80\x9d encouraged George. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you\xe2\x80\x99re found, stand up for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo tell,\xe2\x80\x9d blurted Little White Osage. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk to \xe2\x80\x99Nited States chiefs.\r\nNo tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99jabbers, there\xe2\x80\x99s pluck!\xe2\x80\x9d approved Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, we be goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\ntake some o\xe2\x80\x99 this meat back wid us, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll lave you enough to chew\r\non. You have plenty fire. \xe2\x80\x99Twas only for signal to the Injuns to come\r\nin to council. We had no thought o\xe2\x80\x99 burnin\xe2\x80\x99 annywan, \xe2\x80\x99specially a boy.\r\nNo, or of burnin\xe2\x80\x99 me own coat, nayther, till I see the wind changin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe and George rapidly made up a parcel of the meat, blackened and\r\ncharred though the hunks were. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we cooked our supper by it. Goodbye\r\nto ye. Chance be we\xe2\x80\x99ll see ye later.\xe2\x80\x9d With airy wave of hand he trudged\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name is Patrick Gass. My name is George Shannon,\xe2\x80\x9d emphasized\r\nGeorge, lingering a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYours is Peter Kerr. All right, Peter.\r\nWatch out for the Otoes, that they don\xe2\x80\x99t spy you when you come in after\r\ndark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Peter, carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOto no catch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAway they hastened, toward the river. Standing stock-still, Peter\r\nwatched them go. Good men they were. They were white; he was white.\r\nThey were \xe2\x80\x99Nited States; he was to be \xe2\x80\x99Nited States, too.\r\n\r\nHe did not pause to eat now. He grabbed a chunk of the buffalo meat\r\nleft for him, and trotted for the nearest sand-hill. The fire had\r\nburned before him, and the earth was still warm, but the sand-hills\r\nwere untouched.\r\n\r\nHe drank, at last, from a branch of the Omaha Creek; and among the\r\nsand-hills he stayed all day.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he heard, from off toward the United States camp at\r\nthe river, a rumble like thunder. It was the big gun! At dusk he saw\r\na glow redly lighting the eastern horizon over the river. Maybe the\r\nUnited States were having a war-dance. At any rate, the man named Pat\r\nhad told him to come; this seemed to be the best time; and, guided by\r\nthe glow, he hurried for the river.\r\n\r\nWhen he had struck the river well above the camp, the boats and the\r\nbeach were ruddy. People had gathered about a huge fire. They were\r\nmaking music and dancing; and some were white men and others were\r\nIndians: Otoes! Chief Little Thief had arrived.\r\n\r\nSomewhat fearing, but very determined, Peter cautiously waded out into\r\nthe water, and from waist-deep slipping into the current silently swam\r\ndown, down, outside the edge of the firelight, until obliquing in he\r\nmight use the big boat as a shield. With his hand he felt along it;\r\nencountered a rope stretched taut from boat to water. Wah! Or\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95hoorah,\r\nhe meant.\r\n\r\nAs neatly as a cat he swarmed up the rope and hoisted himself over the\r\ngunwale. Sprawling in, he dropped flat, to cower in the shadow of the\r\nmast. A dark figure, with a gun, had seen him\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95was making for him, from\r\ndown the deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist, Peter!\xe2\x80\x9d huskily spoke a voice. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis Pat. Ye\xe2\x80\x99re all right. Stay\r\nwhere ye are, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, except for Pat, the sentry, all the big boat was deserted.\r\nThere was a great time ashore. Crouched panting and dripping, Peter\r\nwitnessed, from behind the mast. The shore was bright, the figures\r\nplainly outlined. There were the two white chiefs. Of this he was\r\ncertain. They had on their heads the queer hats; they wore long tight\r\nblue shirts that glittered with ornaments; they carried the long\r\nknives, in sheathes at their sides; the one was the chief with the\r\nyellow hair, and the other was the chief with the red hair.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x99Nited States were giving a feast and dance, evidently. Two of them\r\nwere making music by drawing a stick across a box held to their chins;\r\nand the others, and the Indians, sat in a circle, around the fire,\r\nwatching the dances.\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of the Otoes, for they sprang up, and into the\r\ncentre, to dance. Peter knew them, one by one: Head Chief Little Thief,\r\nBig Horse, Crow\xe2\x80\x99s Head, Black Cat, Iron Eyes, Bix Ox, Brave Man, and\r\nBig Blue Eyes\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95all Otoes except Crow\xe2\x80\x99s Head and Black Cat, who were\r\nMissouris.\r\n\r\nThey danced. It was the Oto Buffalo Dance. The \xe2\x80\x99Nited States warriors\r\ncheered\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and on a sudden cheered louder and clapped their hands\r\ntogether, for into the centre had leaped a new figure, to dance by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe was the black medicine man!\r\n\r\nHis eyes rolled white; his teeth were white; but all the rest of him\r\nwas black\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and he was very large. Assuredly, the \xe2\x80\x99Nited States must be\r\na great and powerful nation, with such medicine men, decided little\r\nPeter, watching.\r\n\r\nAlong the deck Patrick Gass hissed and beckoned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d he bade. Peter scurried to him. \xe2\x80\x9cGet down in for\xe2\x80\x99d,\xe2\x80\x9d and Pat\r\npointed to the open door of the forecastle or wooden house that had\r\nbeen built in the bows, under a higher deck. \xe2\x80\x9cStow yourself away an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nkape quiet. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll find a place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter darted in. It was a room lined with beds in tiers from floor\r\nto ceiling: the white warriors\xe2\x80\x99 sleeping-room. Clothing was hanging\r\nagainst the far end; down the centre was a narrow table. Like a cat\r\nagain, Peter sprang upon the table, scrambled into the highest of the\r\nbunks on this side, and came to the far-end wall. The wall did not\r\nmeet the roof; it was a bulkhead partition dividing off the room from\r\nthe remainder of the bows. Peter thrust his arm in over the top, and\r\ncould feel, there beyond, a solid bale on a level with the bunk. He\r\nwriggled in over, landed cautiously, explored with hands and feet, in\r\nthe darkness\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and stretched out in a space that had been left between\r\nthe ballast of extra supplies and the deck above. Good!\r\n\r\nThat warm August night the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Nited States\xe2\x80\x9d men of Captains Lewis and\r\nClark slept on the sand, in the open air, by the river; and in the\r\ntent of the captains slept Chief Little Thief. But Patrick Gass, when\r\nrelieved from guard duty, slept in the forecastle, near Peter\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95that\r\nbeing, as he yawned, \xe2\x80\x9cmore convanient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPETER MEETS THE CHIEFS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hour was early when Pat stuck his head over the partition, and to\r\nPeter said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhisht! Are ye awake, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99lo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch ye a bite to eat, an\xe2\x80\x99 wather to drink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99\r\nye best lie hid till we start, when the Injuns go. \xe2\x80\x99Twon\xe2\x80\x99t be long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw-right,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Peter.\r\n\r\nPatrick passed in to him some dried meat and a canteen of water. After\r\nthat the day seemed to move very slowly. Here on the boat all was\r\nquiet, particularly in Peter\xe2\x80\x99s end. However, outside on the shore there\r\nwas a constant sound of voices, from the \xe2\x80\x99Nited States camp.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose high, as betokened by the close warmth where Peter lay\r\nhidden. He felt as though he must get out and see what was going on. So\r\nhe peered over the top of the partition, to find whether the forecastle\r\nwas empty. It was. He slipped down into it, and stealing through and\r\nworming flat across the deck, peeped through a crack in the gunwale.\r\n\r\nLittle Thief and his Otoes and Missouris had not yet gone. They were\r\nholding another council with the \xe2\x80\x99Nited States. More talk! The \xe2\x80\x99Nited\r\nStates chiefs and warriors were sitting, and the Otoes and Missouris\r\nwere sitting, all forming a great circle.\r\n\r\nOne after another the Otoes and the Missouris arose and talked, and the\r\nwhite chiefs replied; but of all this talk Peter understood little.\r\nAfter a time he grew tired; the sun was hot, and he went back into his\r\nnook. He still had meat and water enough.\r\n\r\nIt was much later when he awakened, to hear people in the room beyond\r\nhis partition. There were white men\xe2\x80\x99s voices\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95one voice sounded like\r\nthat of his other friend, George Shannon. And there were groans.\r\nSoon the white men left\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95all except the man who groaned. He stayed.\r\nEvidently one of the white men was sick, and had been put into a bed.\r\n\r\nDusk was falling, and Peter thought that he might venture out and\r\nstretch his legs. The sounds from the sick man had ceased; maybe\r\nhe slept. Peter peered over. Everything was quiet; and forth he\r\nslipped\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95only to discover that in the open door was sitting, amidst the\r\ndusk, a watcher. It was the United States warrior, George Shannon. He\r\nsaw Peter, poised about to leap down, and smiled and beckoned. Peter\r\nlightly went to him.\r\n\r\nGeorge Shannon looked worn and anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all right, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Aw-right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA soldier\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95very sick,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, and pointed to a bunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharles Floyd. He danced and got hot. Lay down on the sand all night\r\nand got cold. Now very sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cMebbe get well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, soberly.\r\n\r\nThat was too bad. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they call in the black medicine-man?\r\n\r\nExcept for George and the sick Charles Floyd, the boat was deserted;\r\nfor on the shore another dance and feast were in progress. Chief Little\r\nThief and his Indians were staying, and the \xe2\x80\x99Nited States appeared to\r\nbe bent upon giving them a good time.\r\n\r\nAll that night the sick Charles Floyd moaned at intervals, in the bunk;\r\nand George Shannon and Patrick Gass and others kept watch over him;\r\nwhile Peter, on the other side of the partition, listened or slept.\r\nToward morning, when Peter next woke up, he had been aroused by tramp\r\nof feet over his head, and splash of water against the boat, and orders\r\nshouted, and a movement of the boat itself.\r\n\r\nThey were starting, and he was starting with them! Hoorah! Now he was\r\nnot hungry or thirsty or tired; he was excited.\r\n\r\nYes, the boat was moving. He could hear the plashing of oars, and the\r\ncreak as the sail was raised. And in a few minutes more the boat leaned\r\nand swerved and tugged, and the river rippled under its bow.\r\n\r\nPeter waited as long as he possibly could stand it to wait. Patrick\r\nGass had said for him to lie hidden until Chief Little Thief had left,\r\nand the boat had started. Very well.\r\n\r\nAll was silent in the room beyond. He peered, and could see nobody.\r\nOver the partition he once more squirmed, into the top-most bunk; and\r\nfeeling with his toes let himself down. The door was shut, but it had a\r\nwindow in it that he might look out of; and if anybody opened, he would\r\ndive under the table or under a bunk, until he saw who it was.\r\n\r\nThe sick man in the bottom bunk opposite suddenly exclaimed. He was\r\nawake and watching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he challenged weakly.\r\n\r\nWith his feet on the floor, Peter paused, to stare. He saw a pale,\r\nclammy countenance gazing at him from the blanket coverings\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and at\r\nthat instant the door opened, and before Peter might so much as stir,\r\nthe chief with the red hair entered. Peter was fairly caught. He drew\r\nbreath sharply, and resolved not to show fear.\r\n\r\nThe chief with the red hair was all in buckskin, and wore moccasins on\r\nhis feet, and on his head a round hat with the brim looped up in front.\r\nHis face was without hair and was very tanned, so that it was reddish\r\nbrown instead of white, and his two eyes were clear, keen gray. His\r\nhair was bound behind in a long bag of thin skin. He had rather a large\r\nnose, and a round chin; and was heavy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered. He glanced swiftly from Peter to the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbunk, and back again to Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stole down from above, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sick man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Sergeant? Any better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m awful weak, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch pain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been suffering terribly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, my man. We\xe2\x80\x99ll do all we can for you.\xe2\x80\x9d Now the chief spoke\r\nto Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you? How\xe2\x80\x99d you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was stern and\r\nquick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hide,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter pointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho brought you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come. Night. Swim down river. Hide.\xe2\x80\x9d For Peter had no notion of\r\ntelling on Patrick Gass and George Shannon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! You did!\xe2\x80\x9d And the chief with the red hair grunted. \xe2\x80\x9cRan away,\r\neh? Who was your chief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe-ah-rush-hah. First Osage, then Oto, but me white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty pickle,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the chief with the red hair\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and\r\nPeter wondered what he meant. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you come along with me.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nadded, to the sick man, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be back directly, Charley; as soon as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve turned this stow-away over. Do you want anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m sleepy. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d and the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\ntrailed off into a murmur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\xe2\x80\x9d bade the red-haired chief to Peter, beckoning with his\r\nfinger. And Peter followed Captain William Clark, of the United States\r\nArtillery, and second in command of this Captains Lewis and Clark\r\ngovernment exploring expedition up the Missouri River, through the\r\ndoorway, into the sunshine and the open of the great barge\xe2\x80\x99s deck.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark led straight for the stern, but on the way Peter, keeping\r\nclose behind him, with his quick eyes saw many things. The white\r\nwarriors, in buckskins or in cloth, were busy here and there, mending\r\nclothes and tools and weapons and assorting goods, or viewing the river\r\nbanks\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and all paused to gaze at him. The big sail was pulling lustily,\r\nfrom its mast. At the stern two warriors were steering. In the barge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwake were sailing the two smaller barges, the red one and the white\r\none. They followed gallantly, the river rippled, the banks were flowing\r\npast. Nothing was to be seen moving on the banks, and the site of the\r\nOmaha village, and the sand sprit where the council with Little Thief\r\nhad been held, were gone. Good!\r\n\r\nBefore the cabin in the stern of the barge were standing the slim,\r\nyellow-haired chief and Patrick Gass, and they were watching Peter\r\ncoming. The slim chief was dressed in his blue clothes and his odd\r\nhat, and wore his long knife by his side. His hair hung in a tail.\r\nPatrick Gass was dressed as always. His eyes twinkled at Peter, as if\r\nto say: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter knew what he was going to do. He was going to stay with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Nited States.\r\n\r\nBut the slim chief\xe2\x80\x99s face betrayed no sign. He simply waited. For this\r\nCaptain Meriwether Lewis, of the First United States Infantry, the\r\nleader of the exploring expedition sent out by President Jefferson and\r\nCongress, was not much given to smiles, and was strong on discipline. A\r\nthorough young soldier, he, who felt the heavy responsibility of taking\r\nthe expedition safely through, with the help of Captain Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve found, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Captain Clark, with half a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he, Will?\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s query was quick, and his brows\r\nknitted a trifle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he\xe2\x80\x99s white. I found him in the forec\xe2\x80\x99sle when I went in to see\r\nabout Floyd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Floyd?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d that boy get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRan away from the Otoes, he says, and hid himself in the bows beyond\r\nthe bulkhead. Like as not he\xe2\x80\x99s been there a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the Long Knife Chief, of Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Kerr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOto. No like Oto. No like Indian. White boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah! Did the Otoes steal you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOsage. Oto buy me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did the Osage get you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95not\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, slowly, trying to speak the right words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95father. Take mother. She die. Long time ago. Me\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95I white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, Captain, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we hear down St. Louis way of a family by the\r\nsame name o\xe2\x80\x99 Kerr bein\xe2\x80\x99 wiped out by the Injuns some years back,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke\r\nPatrick Gass, saluting. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas up country a bit, though I disremember\r\nwhere, sorr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but there was no boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a bit of a baby, seems to me like, sorr,\xe2\x80\x9d alleged Sergeant\r\nGass. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 the woman was carried off, sorr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis shrugged his shoulders impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Pat. You go forward and you and Shannon see if you can\r\ndo anything for Floyd. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him move much. He\xe2\x80\x99s liable to be\r\nrestless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sorr.\xe2\x80\x9d Patrick Gass saluted but lingered a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I might be\r\nso bold, sorr\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeein\xe2\x80\x99 as how the boy\xe2\x80\x99s Irish\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIrish! He\xe2\x80\x99s as black as an Indian!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sorr. But the eyes an\xe2\x80\x99 hair of him, sorr. An\xe2\x80\x99 sure he has an\r\nIrish name. An\xe2\x80\x99 I was thinkin\xe2\x80\x99, beggin\xe2\x80\x99 your pardon, sorr, if you\r\ndecided to kape him a spell, Shannon an\xe2\x80\x99 me\xe2\x80\x99d look after him for ye,\r\nsorr. We Irish are all cousins, ye know, sorr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Captain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s mouth twitched; he shot a glance at Captain\r\nClark, who smiled back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that sound to you like an Irish name, Captain? More like good old\r\nEnglish, to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 again, sorr,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pat, \xe2\x80\x9cthat more like it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_O_\xe2\x80\x99Kerr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do, Gass. Go forward and find Shannon, and the two of\r\nyou tend to Floyd.\xe2\x80\x9d Patrick saluted and trudged away. Captain Lewis\r\ncontinued, to Captain Clark: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something back of this, Will.\r\nGass is too willing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wager he and Shannon know more than we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Irish in him, Merne. Do you think they smuggled the lad\r\naboard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they did\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95who brought you on this boat?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the Long Knife\r\nChief of Peter.\r\n\r\nPeter shrugged _his_ shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo with \xe2\x80\x99Nited States. Up big river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho taught you to speak English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95mother,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cNo English; \xe2\x80\x99Merican; Ken-tuck-y.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKentuckian!\xe2\x80\x9d blurted Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is white, sure enough. That\r\ncomes pretty close to home-folks, Merne. I know some Kerrs there,\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the question is, what are we to do with him?\xe2\x80\x9d reminded Captain\r\nLewis, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t cumber ourselves with useless baggage, and we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t start out by stealing children from the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; and yet it sort of goes against the grain to let the Indians keep\r\nany children they\xe2\x80\x99ve stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d argued Captain Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I agree with you there, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the\r\nPresident instructed us to make friends with all the tribes. We could\r\nhave shown the Otoes they were wrong, and could have offered to buy the\r\nboy or have made them promise to send him to St. Louis if we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsend him ourselves. This looks like bad faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we stop and put him ashore, Merne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we put you ashore will you go back to We-ah-rush-hah?\xe2\x80\x9d queried the\r\nLong Knife Chief, of Peter.\r\n\r\nPeter had not comprehended all that had been said, but he had listened\r\nanxiously\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and now he did understand that they were talking of putting\r\nhim off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo go back to We-ah-rush-hah. \xe2\x80\x99Maha catch me;\r\nSioux catch me; Oto whip me. No Indian; white.\xe2\x80\x9d And he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI follow\r\nboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you give the order, Merne, we\xe2\x80\x99ll stop and send him back with an\r\nescort,\xe2\x80\x9d teased Captain Clark, who knew very well that Captain Lewis\r\nwould do no such thing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the Otoes to forward him on\r\ndown to St. Louis. You think they\xe2\x80\x99d do it, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis tapped uneasily with his foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pshaw, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t stop and waste this fine breeze,\r\neven to send back a boy. When we land for dinner will be the proper\r\ntime. We may meet some traders, bound down, and he can be started back\r\nwith them, to St. Louis. Meanwhile Gass and Shannon must take care of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can be sent down river with the first party that take back the\r\ndispatches,\xe2\x80\x9d proffered Captain Clark.\r\n\r\nPatrick Gass came clumping up the deck and again saluted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Floyd wishes might he speak with Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Clark, sorrs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurrible weak, sorr, but the pain be not so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d bade Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou enlisted him. He knows you\r\nbetter. If I can do anything, call me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Red Hair Chief hastened away. The Long Knife Chief spoke to Patrick\r\nGass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll take charge of Peter until we send him back, Patrick. Draw on\r\nthe commissary for such clothes as he needs. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have him running\r\naround naked, this way, if he\xe2\x80\x99s white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYis, sorr,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Peter, lad; come with your\r\ncousin Pat, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll make your outside as white as your inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter gladly obeyed. He was rather afraid of the handsome young Long\r\nKnife Chief, but he was not afraid of Patrick Gass\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95no, nor of the Red\r\nHair.\r\n\r\nWhen dressed in the clothes that Patrick found for him, Peter was a\r\nfunny sight. There was a red flannel shirt\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95to Peter very beautiful,\r\nbut twice enough for him, so that the sleeves were rolled to their\r\nelbows, and the neck dropped about his shoulders. And there was a pair\r\nof blue trousers, also twice enough for him, so that the legs were\r\nrolled to their knees, and the waist was drawn up about his chest, and\r\nthe front doubled across where it was belted in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiver you mind,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Patrick, while the \xe2\x80\x99Nited States men gazed on\r\nPeter and howled with merriment. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit of a tailor an\xe2\x80\x99 if\r\nwe can\xe2\x80\x99t fit you with cloth we\xe2\x80\x99ll fit you with leather. Let \xe2\x80\x99em laugh.\r\nLaughin\xe2\x80\x99s good for the stomick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Peter did not mind. These were white people\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, and he was\r\nproud to wear them, although they did seem queer.\r\n\r\nThe sun had passed the overhead. At some orders the barge was swung in\r\nfor shore; the two smaller boats followed. Now would he be sent back,\r\nor left; or\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95what? Landing was made on the right-hand side, which was\r\nthe country of the Iowas and of the Sioux: not a good place, Peter\r\nreflected, for _him_. But scarcely had the barge tied up, and Peter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart was beating with anxiety, when Captain Clark hastily emerged from\r\nthe forecastle; another soldier trod close behind.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark went to Captain Lewis; the soldier proceeded slowly,\r\nspeaking to comrades. He arrived where Patrick was keeping friendly\r\nguard over Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, simply, his face clouded, his voice broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest his soul in pace,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Nat. Did\r\nhe say anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew. He asked the Captain to write a letter for him, to the folks\r\nat home. After that he went to sleep and did not wake again, here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, he gave his life for his country,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Patrick.\r\n\r\nSo the sick man had died. This much Peter easily guessed. It turned\r\ndinner into a very quiet affair. Nothing more was said of leaving Peter\r\nashore, nor of sending him back; but as soon as the dinner was finished\r\nthe boats all pushed out and headed up river, along a bank surmounted\r\nby rolling bluffs.\r\n\r\nAfter about a mile by sail and oars, everybody landed; and the body of\r\nSergeant Charles Floyd, United States Army, the first of the expedition\r\nto fall, was buried on the top of a bluff. Captain Clark read some\r\nwords out of a book, over the grave; and upon the grave was set a cedar\r\npost with the name, Sergt. C. Floyd, and the date, Aug. 20, 1804,\r\ncarved into it. Then three volleys from the rifles were fired.\r\n\r\nThe boats proceeded on for a camping-place, which was found about a\r\nmile up, on the right-hand or north side, near the mouth of a little\r\nriver. The bluff of the grave was referred to as Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s Bluff, and\r\nthe little river was called Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s River.\r\n\r\nAll the men, including Peter, felt sorry for Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor.\r\nFloyd had been his cousin. They felt sorry for those other relatives\r\nand friends, back at the Floyd home in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nFifty years later, or in 1857, the grave of the sergeant was moved a\r\nfew hundred feet, by the Sioux City, Iowa, people, so that it should\r\nnot crumble into the Missouri River; and in 1895 a monument was placed\r\nover it. To-day Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s Bluff is part of a Sioux City park.\r\n\r\nThe camp this evening was only thirteen miles above the Omaha village\r\nand the place where Chief Little Thief had come in to council, so that\r\nPeter very easily might have been sent back. But the death of Sergeant\r\nCharles Floyd seemed to be occupying the thoughts of the two captains;\r\nit made the whole camp sober. To-night there was no dancing or music,\r\nand Peter slept aboard the barge with nobody paying especial attention\r\nto him. Of this he was glad, because he feared that, once ashore, he\r\nwould be left behind\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the \xe2\x80\x99Nited States would try to sail on without\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTO THE LAND OF THE SIOUX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFust we have to pass the Sioux Injuns,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Patrick Gass, to\r\nPeter. \xe2\x80\x9cYe know the Sioux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey bad,\xe2\x80\x9d nodded Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cFight other Injuns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we aim to make everybody paceful with\r\neverybody else. An\xe2\x80\x99 after the Sioux, we talk with the \xe2\x80\x99Rikaras.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Rees bad, too,\xe2\x80\x9d nodded Peter. For the Otoes were afraid of the\r\nnorthern tribes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 after the \xe2\x80\x99Rikaras we come, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99, to\r\nthe Mandans, an\xe2\x80\x99 by that time \xe2\x80\x99twill be winter, an\xe2\x80\x99 with the Mandans\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll stay. I hear tell they have white skins an\xe2\x80\x99 blue eyes an\xe2\x80\x99 their\r\nhair trails on the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes sailing, sometimes rowed, and sometimes towed by heavy ropes\r\non which the men hauled, from the banks, the three boats had been\r\nsteadily advancing up-river. Peter was feeling quite at home. Everybody\r\nwas kind to him\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95especially Pat, who had been elected sergeant in place\r\nof Charles Floyd, and young George Shannon, who was only seventeen.\r\n\r\nTwo horses followed the boats, by land, for the use of the hunters.\r\nGeorge Drouillard, a Frenchman, who had lived with the Omahas, was\r\nchief hunter. At the evening camps Pierre Cruzatte, a merry Frenchman\r\nwith only one eye, and a soldier by the name of George Gibson, played\r\nlively music on stringed boxes called violins. Each night the two\r\ncaptains, and Pat and other soldiers, wrote on paper the story of\r\nthe trip. York, the black man, was Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s servant. Early in\r\nthe morning a horn was blown to arouse the camp. During the days the\r\ncaptains frequently went ashore, to explore.\r\n\r\nIt was well, thought Peter, that Pierre Dorion, a trader who lived with\r\nthe Sioux, was aboard the boats, for the fierce Sioux Indians did not\r\nlike strangers. Still, who could whip the United States?\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the eighth day after leaving Chief Little Thief,\r\nold Pierre, from where he was standing with the two captains on the\r\nbarge and gazing right and left and before, cried aloud and pointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDere she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Dorion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Jacques, w\xe2\x80\x99at is also call de Yankton River; my people de Yankton\r\nSioux lif on her. Mebbe soon now we see some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barge, flying its white peace flag, bordered with red and blue,\r\nploughed on. All eyes aboard were directed intently before. The mouth\r\nof the river gradually opened, amidst the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll halt there for dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cThat looks like\r\na good landing-place just above the mouth, Will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark nodded, and the barge began to veer in; the two pirogues\r\nor smaller boats imitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see one Injun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see him, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, now?\xe2\x80\x9d invited Patrick Gass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is standing still; watch us, this side of Yankton River.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, you\xe2\x80\x99ve sharp eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d praised Pat, squinting. \xe2\x80\x9cYis, sure I see\r\nhim, by the big tree just above the mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOthers saw him. And as the barge hove to, and led by Captain Clark the\r\nmen leaped for the shore, to cook dinner, the Indian plunged into the\r\nwater and swam across.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Maha!\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Peter, quickly, when, dripping, the Indian had plashed\r\nout and was boldly entering the camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is he, now?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Patrick Gass.\r\n\r\nPierre Dorion translated for him, to the captains. He said that he was\r\nan Omaha boy, living with the Sioux. While he was talking, two other\r\nIndians came in. They indeed were Sioux\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95straight, dark, and dignified,\r\nas befitted members of a great and powerful nation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey say de Yanktons, many of dem, are camp\xe2\x80\x99 to de west, one short\r\ntravel,\xe2\x80\x9d interpreted Dorion. \xe2\x80\x9cDey haf hear of our comin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 will be\r\nplease\xe2\x80\x99 to meet de white chiefs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Dorion. You go to the camp with these fellows, and tell the\r\nchiefs that we\xe2\x80\x99ll hold council at the river. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send Sergeant Pryor\r\nand another man along with you,\xe2\x80\x9d instructed Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind us again about opposite where their camp is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d approved Pierre Dorion. \xe2\x80\x9cNow mebbe I get my wife an\xe2\x80\x99 fam\xe2\x80\x99ly one\r\ntime more. My son, he dere, too, say dese young men.\xe2\x80\x9d For Pierre had\r\nmarried a Sioux woman.\r\n\r\nThe two Sioux, and Pierre, and Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor and Private\r\nJohn Potts left on foot for the camp of the Yanktons; but the Omaha boy\r\nstayed. Peter preferred to keep away from him. The Omahas, to him, were\r\nnot to be trusted.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Yankton River, which is to-day called the James\r\nRiver of South Dakota, the boats continued on up the Missouri, to the\r\ncouncil ground. The red pirogue ran upon a snag, so that it almost sank\r\nbefore it could be beached. Then all the goods had to be transferred to\r\nthe white pirogue. This took time, and it was not until nearly sunset\r\nthat Captain Lewis ordered landing to be made and camp pitched.\r\n\r\nThe camp of the Sioux was supposed to be somewhere across the river. In\r\nthe morning no Sioux had yet appeared for council, and Captain Lewis\r\nanxiously swept the country to the north with his spy-glass. However,\r\nIndians could not be hurried, as Peter well knew. But about four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock there spread a murmur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Sioux! Dey come. Now for beeg talk an\xe2\x80\x99 beeg dance! Hoo-zah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui!\xe2\x80\x9d added George Drouillard, the hunter. \xe2\x80\x9cMebbe fat dog feast, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, murther!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Pat. And, to Peter: \xe2\x80\x9cDid ye ever eat dog, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter shook his head, disgusted. Not he; nor the Otoes, either. Only\r\nthe northern Indians ate dog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a t\xe2\x80\x99arin\xe2\x80\x99 lot of \xe2\x80\x99em, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d mused Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m after\r\nwishin\xe2\x80\x99 George was here. Sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s like to get into trouble, wanderin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nabout the country where all those fellows are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor two days back George Shannon had been sent out to find the horses\r\nthat had strayed from camp, and he had not returned.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux made a brave sight indeed. They looked to be almost a\r\nhundred\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95ahorse and afoot, with gay streamers and blankets flying.\r\nPierre Dorion and Sergeant Pryor and Private Potts were to be seen,\r\nmounted and riding with the principal chiefs in the advance. So\r\nevidently everything was all right.\r\n\r\nThey halted on the bank opposite the United States camp. Sergeant Pryor\r\nwaved his hat, and the captains sent the red pirogue across for him.\r\nHe and Pierre and Private Potts returned in it. They brought with them\r\nyoung Pierre, who was old Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s son. He was half Sioux, and traded\r\namong the Tetons; but just now he was visiting among the Yanktons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are friendly, are they, Sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. They treated us very handsomely, and the head chief is\r\nyonder, waiting to talk with you,\xe2\x80\x9d informed Sergeant Pryor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. You and young Dorion go back to them\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95we\xe2\x80\x99d better send\r\nalong some presents, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we, Will?\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and tell the chiefs that we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nspeak with them in the morning. \xe2\x80\x99Twon\xe2\x80\x99t do to let them think we\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nany more of a hurry than they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sergeant Pryor.\r\n\r\nHe took over presents of corn and tobacco and iron kettles, with young\r\nPierre to do the translating for him, and returned. Both camps settled\r\ndown for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid yez have a rale good time with the Sioux, Nat?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Patrick\r\nGass, that night around the fire, after a hearty supper on cat-fish.\r\nDuring the day a number of huge cat-fish had been caught, some of them\r\nweighing sixty pounds. Now all the men were curious to hear more from\r\nNat Pryor and John Potts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTremendous,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Nat. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted to carry us into camp in a\r\nblanket, but we told \xe2\x80\x99em we were not chiefs. They could wait and carry\r\nthe captains. They gave us a fat dog, though, boiled in a pot\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and I\r\nswear he was good eating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone for me, thank ye,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sergeant Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 how far is their\r\ncamp, an\xe2\x80\x99 what kind is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about nine miles back, near the Jacques. All fine buffalo hide\r\nlodges\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95some elk hide, too\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95painted different colors. Fact is, they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nabout the best Indians we\xe2\x80\x99ve met yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn anything of Shannon or the horses, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word. But I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be safe if only the Sioux find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day dawned so foggy that nobody could see across the river.\r\nThe captains made preparations for the grand council. A pole was set\r\nup, near to a large oak tree, and a new flag hoisted to the top of it.\r\nThe flag was striped red and white; in a corner was a blue square, like\r\nthe sky, studded with stars. \xe2\x80\x99Twas the great flag of the United States\r\nnation\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and Peter thought it beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe two captains dressed in their best. Captain Lewis wore a long coat\r\nof dark blue trimmed with light blue, down its front bright brass\r\nbuttons, and on its shoulders bright gold-fringed epaulets. Captain\r\nClark\xe2\x80\x99s coat was dark blue faced with red; it, too, had the brass\r\nbuttons and the bright epaulets. Both wore their cocked hats, and their\r\nlong knives, or swords.\r\n\r\nThe men also were ordered to put on their best, and to clean up even if\r\nthey had no \xe2\x80\x9cbest.\xe2\x80\x9d Presents were laid out. By the time the fog lifted,\r\nat eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the camp was ready.\r\n\r\nNow it could be seen that over in the Sioux camp, also, the chiefs and\r\nwarriors were preparing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re painting and polishing, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Captain Clark, who\r\nhad levelled the spy-glass, to peer.\r\n\r\nThat was so. Peter needed no spy-glass. He could make out figures of\r\nthe chiefs and warriors sitting and plaiting their hair and painting\r\ntheir faces and chests and arms.\r\n\r\nThe two captains waited until nearly noon. Then the red pirogue was\r\ndispatched, under Sergeant Pryor, accompanied by old Pierre, to bring\r\nthe chiefs and warriors. The white pirogue was loaded with goods, but\r\nthe red pirogue had been emptied for repairs. Even then the Sioux so\r\ncrowded it that it scarcely could be rowed. A number of the young Sioux\r\nwaded into the river and swam across.\r\n\r\nNow there were more Sioux than white men in the United States camp.\r\nBut they were armed mainly with bows and arrows, while the United\r\nStates were armed with rifles; and Peter\xe2\x80\x99s sharp eyes observed that the\r\ncannon in the bow of the barge was pointed right at the camp, ready for\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBroad-chested and sinewy were these Yankton Sioux, and evidently great\r\nwarriors. What struck Peter and the soldiers, especially, were the\r\nnecklaces of claws stitched in bands of buckskin or red flannel, and\r\nhanging low on those broad chests. Many warriors wore them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you mean to say those are b\xe2\x80\x99ar claws!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed John Shields, one\r\nof the Kentuckians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui, my frien\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d assured Drouillard, the hunter. \xe2\x80\x9cDey claw of great\r\nwhite bear\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95so we call heem. Beeg! More beeg dan one ox. An\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99fraid? He\r\nnot \xe2\x80\x99fraid of notting. To keel one white bear make Injun beeg warrior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where do those critters live, then?\xe2\x80\x9d queried John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp river. We meet \xe2\x80\x99em pret\xe2\x80\x99 queeck, now. Sometime w\xe2\x80\x99en we land\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95woof!\r\nDere coom one beast\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95beeg as one ox\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95mouth he open; an\xe2\x80\x99 mebbe eat us,\r\nif brush so t\xe2\x80\x99ick we not see heem soon \xe2\x80\x99nough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe listening Kentuckians and other soldiers scratched their heads, as\r\nif a little doubtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick Gass, \xe2\x80\x9csome o\xe2\x80\x99 them claws are six inches long,\r\nboys. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a country o\xe2\x80\x99 monsters that we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 into.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA group of the Sioux had been staring at black York, who, larger than\r\nany of them, was gaping back. Suddenly one stepped to him, wet his\r\nfinger and swiftly drew it down York\xe2\x80\x99s cheek; then looked to see if the\r\nblack had come off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, you man!\xe2\x80\x9d growled York. \xe2\x80\x9cWha\xe2\x80\x99 foh you done do dat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother Sioux deftly snatched off York\xe2\x80\x99s hat, and clutched the\r\nblack curly wool underneath; but it would not come off, either.\r\nMuch impressed, the circle widened respectfully, and Sioux murmured\r\ngutturally to Sioux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, York,\xe2\x80\x9d warned Captain Clark, who had noted; for his\r\nown red hair had been attracting much attention. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say you\xe2\x80\x99re great\r\nmedicine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui; he black buffalo,\xe2\x80\x9d affirmed young Dorion.\r\n\r\nAfter that York strutted importantly, alarmed the Indians by making\r\nfierce faces, and was followed about by a constant admiring procession.\r\n\r\nThe council was held at noon, under the great oak tree beside which\r\nfloated the United States flag. The chiefs and the leading warriors sat\r\nin a half circle; the two captains sat facing them, Pierre Dorion stood\r\nbefore them as interpreter; and the soldiers and French boatmen sat\r\nbehind in another half circle.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis made a welcoming speech\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and a fine figure he was,\r\nstanding straight and slim, in his tight-fitting, decorated coat, his\r\ncocked hat with black feather, his sword at his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe land has changed white fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great nation of\r\nthe Sioux, and all the other Indians, have a new white father, at\r\nWashington. That is his flag, the flag of the United States nation,\r\nwhich has bought this country. The new father has sent us, who are his\r\nchildren, to tell his red children that he wants them to be at peace\r\nwith one another. I have given flags and peace gifts to the Otoes and\r\nthe Missouris, and have sent word to the Osages and the Omahas and the\r\nPawnees and the Kickapoos and other Indians, that there must be no more\r\nwars among the red children. I will give you a flag and gifts, too, so\r\nthat you will remember what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the gifts were distributed. To the head chief, Weucha, or Shake\r\nHand, a flag, and a first-grade silver medal, and a paper that\r\ncertified the United States recognized him as the head chief, and\r\na string of beads and shells, and a \xe2\x80\x9cchief\xe2\x80\x99s coat,\xe2\x80\x9d which was a\r\nred-trimmed artillery dress-coat like Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s, and a cocked hat\r\nwith red feather in it. Weucha was immensely pleased; he put on the\r\ncoat and hat at once.\r\n\r\nThe four other chiefs also were given gifts. Chief Weucha produced\r\na long peace-pipe of red stone, with reed stem; it was lighted, he\r\npuffed, Captain Lewis and Captain Clark puffed; the four lesser chiefs\r\npuffed. After that the chiefs solemnly shook hands with the captains,\r\nand withdrew into a lean-to of branches, to consult on what they should\r\nreply to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux stayed at the camp during the afternoon. The captains gave\r\nthem a dressed deer-hide and an empty keg, for a dance drum. The\r\ndeer-hide was stretched taut over the head of the keg; and that night,\r\nby the light of the fires, the Sioux thumped on the drum and shook\r\ntheir rattles, and danced. One-eyed Cruzatte and George Gibson played\r\non their violins, and the United States warriors danced. But the Sioux\r\nkept it up almost all night, and nobody got much sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning after breakfast Weucha and his three sub-chiefs sat\r\nbefore the oak tree; each held a peace pipe in front of him, with the\r\nstem pointing at the spot where the captains were to sit. The names of\r\nthe other chiefs were White Crane, Struck-by-the-Pawnee, and Half Man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ver\xe2\x80\x99 modes\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d explained One-eyed Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cHe say \xe2\x80\x98I am no\r\nwarrior, I only half a man.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeucha spoke first, standing clad in his artillery coat and cocked\r\nhat. He said that the Yanktons were willing to be at peace, but were\r\nvery poor.\r\n\r\nWhite Crane, and Struck-by-the-Pawnee and Half Man likewise spoke. They\r\nagreed with what Shake Hand had said. They wanted powder and ball, and,\r\ntheir great father\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmilk\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95which was whisky.\r\n\r\nThat evening the Sioux went back, across the river, well satisfied.\r\nPierre Dorion and young Pierre went with them. Old Pierre promised that\r\nin the spring he would take some of the chiefs to Washington, that they\r\nmight meet their new father.\r\n\r\nJust as the Yanktons were leaving, Captain Lewis beckoned Peter to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go with Pierre. He will take you down river in the\r\nspring, if not before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, please,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cI rather stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re going clear to the Pacific Ocean, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Captain\r\nClark. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a hard trip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go, too,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not want to stay with Sioux. I am\r\nwhite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do, along with us, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI work. I can talk sign language,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Peter, proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something in that, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cNow with\r\nDorion gone we\xe2\x80\x99ll need an interpreter to help Drouillard. I fancy Peter\r\nknows almost as much as he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a kind heart, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Lewis, his eyes\r\nsoftening. \xe2\x80\x9cBut game\xe2\x80\x99s plenty; we\xe2\x80\x99ll have meat enough\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmain question. All right, Peter. You can come as far as the Mandan\r\nvillage, anyway. And in the spring we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon Peter resolved that he would make himself useful, so that\r\nthey would take him clear to the Pacific Ocean, which lay, according to\r\nPatrick Gass and the other men, many, many days\xe2\x80\x99 travel, far beyond the\r\nwestern mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBAD HEARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWork, work, work! Through this the month of September, 1804, the boats\r\nhad been toiling on up the sluggish Missouri River, in the present\r\nState of South Dakota. With the rains, the winds, and the shallows,\r\neverybody, even the captains, was wet all the day, from hauling on the\r\ntow-ropes, in and out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe weather turned cold and raw. Shelters of deer hides were stretched\r\nover the two pirogues, and in the camps the men made themselves hide\r\ncoats and leggins and moccasins. Patrick and old Cruzatte together\r\nfitted Peter with a buckskin suit that felt much better to him than his\r\nother, clumsy garments.\r\n\r\nAfter having been gone over two weeks, George Shannon appeared at last,\r\nriding through the rain, with only one horse. He had been lost, and had\r\nalmost starved, and the other horse had broken down. All were glad to\r\nsee George again.\r\n\r\nBut where, now, were the Teton Sioux? George reported that he had seen\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThe last week in September a great smoke was sighted in the distance;\r\nand that night three Indian boys swam the river, to enter the camp.\r\nThey were Tetons, from two villages a few miles above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them some tobacco,\xe2\x80\x9d directed Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cTell them to say to\r\ntheir chiefs that we will hold a council to-morrow morning, near the\r\nvillages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the way up, Reuben Fields, who had been hunting, horseback, returned\r\nafoot and signalled to be taken aboard. He said that some Indians had\r\nstolen his horse while he was dressing an elk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui,\xe2\x80\x9d chirped Drouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cDose Tetons haf bad hearts. We best look\r\nsharp or dey take scalps, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t let them have the idea they can plunder us,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Captain\r\nLewis, reddening. \xe2\x80\x9cThis leaves us without horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t those several Indians, on the bank ahead?\xe2\x80\x9d presently queried\r\nCaptain Clark.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis peered through his spy-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive of them. We\xe2\x80\x99ll stop and hail them, and hear what they have to\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think they\xe2\x80\x99re the fellows who stole your horse, Fields?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nCaptain Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Reuben. \xe2\x80\x9cI had only a glimpse of the\r\nthieves, and these Injuns mainly look alike, sir, till you get to know\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe five Indians on the bank stolidly waited, while the barge hove to,\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they Tetons, Drouillard?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui,\xe2\x80\x9d nodded Drouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cDey Tetons. Eh, Cruzatte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais, oui,\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed One-eyed Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cBeeg rascals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Tell them that some of their young men have stolen a horse\r\nfrom their great father at Washington, and we want it returned or we\r\nwill hold no council. We\xe2\x80\x99re willing to be friends, but we aren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid\r\nof them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know much of dees Sioux tongue, but I will try,\xe2\x80\x9d engaged\r\nDrouillard. And by signs and a few words he delivered the message.\r\n\r\nThe Indians consulted a moment together; then one of them replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ink dey say dey haf not seen a hoss,\xe2\x80\x9d translated Drouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nif it is found it will be return\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ink so, too,\xe2\x80\x9d added the funny Cruzatte\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95although everybody was\r\naware that he did not understand a word of Sioux.\r\n\r\nHowever, by the signs that were made, Peter would have interpreted\r\nthe same as Drouillard. He and the Oto boys had practiced for hours,\r\ntalking sign language.\r\n\r\nThe boats stopped for the night off the mouth of a river on the left\r\nor the south. This night only a few men were allowed ashore, to guard\r\nthe cook fires; the remainder slept aboard the boats, with their guns\r\nready. The captains named the river Teton River, but it was soon\r\nrenamed Bad River, for very good reason.\r\n\r\nIn the morning everybody, except the boat guards, landed. The\r\ncaptains ordered the United States flag hoisted, again, on a pole,\r\nand the awning was stretched, as at the camp where the Otoes had been\r\nentertained. All the soldiers ashore were formed in rank, under arms,\r\nfacing the flag-pole and the canopy; and soon the Tetons came in to\r\ncouncil, from their village two miles up-river.\r\n\r\nThere were about sixty of them. They were not nearly so good-looking as\r\nthe Yanktons, being smaller, with slim crooked legs and lean arms, and\r\neyes set over high cheek-bones.\r\n\r\nThe council did not pass off very satisfactorily, because Drouillard\r\nknew little Teton talk, and scarcely could make himself understood when\r\nhe talked for Captain Lewis. Still, the head chief, Black Buffalo,\r\nwas given a medal, and a United States flag, and a red coat decorated\r\nwith white lace, and a cocked hat with red feather. The second chief,\r\nTor-to-hon-ga or Partisan, and the third chief, Buffalo Medicine, were\r\ngiven medals and beads and tobacco. Two warriors, Wah-zing-go, and\r\nMat-o-co-que-pa or Second Bear, also were rewarded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you suppose those raven scalps signify?\xe2\x80\x9d asked George Shannon.\r\nFor the two warriors wore each two or three raven skins fastened to\r\ntheir waists behind, with the tails sticking out, and on their heads\r\nwas another raven skin, flattened with the beak to the fore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey special soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d explained old Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at you call\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95marshal.\r\nOui. Dey boss. Obey nobody but chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the captains took them all aboard the barge to show them the\r\ncannon and the air-gun that shot forty times, and other wonders.\r\nCaptain Clark brought them ashore again in the red pirogue.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the cable been carried on shore, to be held by Patrick\r\nGass and Reuben Fields and George Shannon while the load was landed,\r\nand Captain Clark had stepped out, than three of the Indians grabbed\r\nit, and Wah-zing-go, the warrior, put his arms about the mast, as if to\r\nkeep the boat there. Tor-to-hon-ga began to talk in a loud and angry\r\nvoice. Captain Clark flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he say, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d he appealed. For Drouillard was on the\r\nbarge, and only Peter was near. When the five men had started to row\r\nthe pirogue ashore, with the chiefs and Captain Clark, he had slipped\r\nin, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chief say you cannot go away till you give them more presents,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ntranslated Peter, boldly; for he had picked up some Sioux words and he\r\ncould read the gestures, also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d And Captain Clark was angry indeed. He had only five men, two\r\nin the boat and three ashore, but he was not afraid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell him we\r\nwill go on, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t stop us. We are not squaws, but warriors. Our\r\ngreat father has medicine on those boats that will wipe out twenty\r\nSioux nations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chief says he has plenty warriors, too,\xe2\x80\x9d interpreted Peter.\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment the chief sprang for Captain Clark; the warriors\r\nspread right and left, jerked arrows from quivers and fitted them to\r\nstrung bows. Out whipped Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s bright sword\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the long knife;\r\nand Chief Tor-to-hon-ga dodged. Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s face was redder than\r\nhis hair. He acted like a great chief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch out, Sergeant!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, to Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cRally on the boat;\r\nnever mind the rope. Face them and stand together, men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s voice rang high and stern, from the barge. Out of the\r\nwhite pirogue a dozen men plashed into the shallows and wading and\r\nplunging, hastened to reinforce the red pirogue. Corporal Warfington\r\nand the six St. Louis soldiers who had been sent along to help as far\r\nas the Mandans were with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady!\xe2\x80\x9d warned Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cLook sharp, Will.\xe2\x80\x9d And now the black\r\nmuzzle of the cannon in the bows of the barge swung full at the shore.\r\nBehind it stood Gunner Alexander Willard, with lighted match.\r\n\r\nThis was enough. Head Chief Black Buffalo shouted an order, and his men\r\nleft the cable and the pirogue and fell back. The \xe2\x80\x9cmedicine\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\ngreat father at Washington was, they realized, strong medicine.\r\n\r\nTo show that he was not afraid, and that he wished to be friendly,\r\nCaptain Clark offered to shake hands with Black Buffalo and Partisan;\r\nbut they surlily refused. So the captain laughed, and ordered the red\r\npirogue to return to the barge. Then Black Buffalo and Partisan, and\r\nthe warriors Wah-zing-go and Second Bear ran after, through the water,\r\nand climbed aboard, to go on the barge also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather a close shave, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cAn instant more\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99d have helped you out with a round of grape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wished to try our metal,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Captain Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were afraid the white chiefs would go on and not stop at our\r\nvillage to show our squaws and boys the great father\xe2\x80\x99s boats,\xe2\x80\x9d alleged\r\nChief Black Buffalo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him we are willing to be friends, and will stop,\xe2\x80\x9d directed\r\nCaptain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe soldiers of the great father do not fear the Sioux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf head chief he not tell dat raven soldier to let go mast, he hang on\r\ntill cut in leetle pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d was saying Cruzatte.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the boats were moved up to the village, and Captain\r\nLewis went ashore. Truly, the Red Head and the slim Captain Lewis were\r\nbrave men. Peter was proud to have been by Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s side, in the\r\nfracas. It was fine to be a United States.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Lewis returned on board, he told Captain Clark that\r\neverything was all right, and that the Tetons were waiting for the Red\r\nHead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a bigger man than I am, Will, after the stand you made\r\nyesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to be that way, for when Captain Clark landed he was\r\nmet by ten young warriors, with a gaily decorated buffalo robe. They\r\ncarried him upon it, and then bore him, sitting in it, to the council\r\nhouse. This was great honor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re nixt, Cap\xe2\x80\x99n,\xe2\x80\x9d ventured Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cThere they are, back for\r\nye, sorr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe alert, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d bade the captain, as he vaulted from the barge\r\ninto the pirogue. \xe2\x80\x9cThey may appear friendly, but we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take any\r\nchances. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let the men lay aside their arms for a minute, and keep\r\nthem together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYis, sorr. I will, sorr,\xe2\x80\x9d promised Patrick Gass. He was the oldest\r\nsoldier in the company, and the captains relied upon him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis likewise was borne to the council house; and the men of\r\nthe expedition, except the boat guards, marched after.\r\n\r\nThe council lasted a long time, and was concluded with a feast of the\r\ndog-meat from a pot, and of buffalo meat and hominy and ground-potato.\r\nBuffalo meat was given to the white chiefs as a present. The Tetons\r\nclaimed to be poor, but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t. This was a powerful and rich\r\nvillage, as anybody might see. Before the dance that had been planned\r\nfor the evening, the men were permitted to roam about a little. Peter\r\nand Patrick Gass and their party discovered a string of scalps hanging\r\nfrom a pole, and a number of Omaha squaws and children who appeared\r\nvery miserable.\r\n\r\nPeter talked with them a little. They were prisoners. The Tetons had\r\nattacked their village down the river, and had burned forty lodges and\r\nkilled seventy-five warriors.\r\n\r\nWhen dusk fell the dance was started, by the light of a fire, in\r\nthe middle of the council house. The Sioux warriors danced, and the\r\nSioux women danced; but at midnight the captains told the chief that\r\neverybody was tired and it was time to go to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chief he say: \xe2\x80\x98Ver\xe2\x80\x99 well. Now sleep. To-morrow more Sioux come,\r\nto talk with de great father.\xe2\x80\x99 He want you to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d interpreted\r\nDrouillard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will stay and see these other Sioux,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndo you think, Will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you say so, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s some trick\r\nin this. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be caught off guard\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and of course we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t show\r\nthat we\xe2\x80\x99re afraid, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no visiting Sioux turned up, although the boats waited all day. At\r\nnight another dance was given.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe in bad feex,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted One-eyed Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cDose Teton, dey keep us.\r\nI t\xe2\x80\x99ink dey plan mischief. I wish we go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody was nervous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I wonder if we\xe2\x80\x99re in for a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Corporal Warfington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick Gass, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can lick \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmidst the dusk ashore, while Peter, tired of the noise and dancing,\r\nwas wandering a few steps, a low voice hailed him, in Oto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist! You Oto?\xe2\x80\x9d It was one of the Omaha squaws. How could she have\r\nguessed that he had been an Oto?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. White,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your chiefs the Sioux are bad. They will not let the big boats\r\ngo. They play you a trick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou speak Oto well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Omaha, but I was in Oto village once. I saw you.\xe2\x80\x9d And the squaw\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTAINS SHOW THEIR SPUNK\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter believed that the Omaha woman spoke the truth. The captains ought\r\nto be told at once. But the dancing was still in progress in the lodge\r\nof Chief Black Buffalo, where sat the two captains and the chiefs,\r\nwatching. A boy would not be admitted. So Peter sought out Sergeant\r\nJohn Ordway, who was in charge of the shore guard. John Ordway was\r\nnot from Kentucky; he was from a place called New Hampshire, in the\r\nnortheast of the United States.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say!\xe2\x80\x9d replied John Ordway, when Peter had told him of the\r\nwarning from the Omaha woman. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, anybody might suspect as much.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll get word to the captains, first chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dancing continued until late, again. Peter curled in the bows of\r\nthe waiting pirogue, and went to sleep. He had done his duty and could\r\ntrust to John Ordway. By the stars it was midnight when he awakened at\r\nthe approach of the captains. They and two Indian guests and the guard\r\nclambered in, and the pirogue was rowed for the barge.\r\n\r\nThe shore was silent and dark\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but how alert were those Sioux! The\r\npirogue ran against the anchor cable of the barge, in the darkness, and\r\nbroke it. The barge was adrift. The captains cried loudly, ordering\r\nthe oars to be manned and the barge held until a cable could be passed\r\nashore\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and instantly the two Indians in the pirogue shouted excitedly,\r\nin the Sioux tongue, summoning the village.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d they called. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the boats! Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole village burst into an uproar; the warriors poured forth to\r\nthe water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. It was very plain that they feared the white men were\r\nleaving. The captains could pay little attention until a cable had been\r\ncarried from the barge and fastened to a tree on the bank, and the\r\nbarge pulled in out of the current. Then\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Tor-to-hon-ga what\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of all this alarm,\xe2\x80\x9d bade Captain\r\nLewis, tersely, of Drouillard. Tor-to-hon-ga was one of the two guests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe say de Tetons \xe2\x80\x99fraid de \xe2\x80\x99Maha warriors haf come up an\xe2\x80\x99 attack de\r\nboats of de great white father,\xe2\x80\x9d interpreted Drouillard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nAnd anybody might see how foolish was this excuse of the Tetons: that\r\nthe Omahas would attack boats defended by guns, when the Sioux were the\r\nreal enemies. After the village was quiet again, at least sixty Teton\r\nwarriors remained there on the bank, all night, ready for action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ink,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Drouillard, \xe2\x80\x9cmebbe we have leetle trouble, in\r\nmornin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in a bad box,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Sergeant Ordway. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re tied up close\r\nto the bank, under direct fire. We may have a hard time casting off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrong guards were kept under arms, on all the boats. There was\r\nlittle sleep. Both captains were constantly about, peering through\r\nthe darkness, and listening. Early in the morning the Tetons were\r\nassembled; and while Patrick Gass and a detail were dragging from a\r\npirogue, trying to find the barge\xe2\x80\x99s anchor, several chiefs and warriors\r\nwaded out to the barge and climbed aboard.\r\n\r\nThe anchor could not be found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go on without it. Send those\r\nfellows ashore, Will. Sergeant Pryor, take a squad with you and cast\r\noff that rope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian visitors did not wish to go ashore, but Captain Clark\r\nordered them pushed into the pirogue which was to bear Sergeant Pryor\r\nand squad. Chief Black Buffalo still refused to go. Sergeant Pryor\r\nreleased the rope from the tree on the bank and returned. The sail on\r\nthe barge was being hoisted\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and at the instant laughter and shouts\r\nmingled, both ashore and from the boats.\r\n\r\nA number of the Sioux had sat upon the rope, holding it!\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis flared into hot rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake charge of the pirogues, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cDown behind the\r\ngunwale, men. Advance your rifles. See that the priming\xe2\x80\x99s fresh,\r\nOrdway and Gass. Stand to your swivel, Willard!\xe2\x80\x9d And, to Chief Black\r\nBuffalo: \xe2\x80\x9cMy young men are ready for battle. If your young men do not\r\nrelease the rope we will fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe say de young men want leetle more tobac\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d translated Drouillard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him we have given all the presents that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to give,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncrisply answered Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95wait. Here!\xe2\x80\x9d And snatching a roll\r\nof tobacco, Captain Lewis threw it at Black Buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s feet. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him\r\nthere is his tobacco, on the prairie. He says he is a great chief.\r\nAmong the white men great chiefs are obeyed. If he is a great chief let\r\nhim order his young men to release that rope and they will obey him.\r\nBut we do not believe he is a great chief. He is a squaw, and the young\r\nmen laugh at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWah!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Chief Black Buffalo, when he heard. He seized the\r\ntobacco and leaped from the boat, to surge for the shore. There he\r\ntumbled his young men right and left, snatched the rope and hurled it\r\nout into the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d he bawled. Thus he proved himself to be the great chief.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers cheered. The barge\xe2\x80\x99s sail caught the breeze, the barge\r\nmoved. Just in time Captain Clark leaped from the pirogue, into which\r\nhe had transferred, and gained the gunwale, and the deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d he panted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGolly!\xe2\x80\x9d babbled York. \xe2\x80\x9cDat chief mighty brash when he get started.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barge and the pirogues gained the middle of the river. Rapidly the\r\nTeton village was left behind. Patrick Gass waved his hat derisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad luck to yez,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, an\xe2\x80\x99 if we\xe2\x80\x99d stayed a minute longer\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 put your town into mournin\xe2\x80\x99. We\xe2\x80\x99re not so paceful as we\r\nlook.\xe2\x80\x9d And he added: \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x99Rikaras nixt. We\xe2\x80\x99ll hope they be gintlemen.\r\nAnnyhow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve no horses left for \xe2\x80\x99em to stale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust what was to be expected from the Arikaras nobody might say, but\r\nalthough they were warlike they were thought to be not so mean as the\r\nTeton Sioux. The boats forged on, and the month changed to that of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far to the \xe2\x80\x99Rikara villages, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Captain Lewis, of a\r\ntrader named Valle who came aboard the barge for a talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy river about 100 miles, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom an excursion ashore with Captain Clark and squad, York returned\r\ntremendously excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe done found one o\xe2\x80\x99 dem white b\xe2\x80\x99ars,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed York. \xe2\x80\x9cYessuh, me\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 Marse Will. Oof!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99bouts, York?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhar\xe2\x80\x99s his scalp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you get a shot at him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuestions were volleyed thick and fast. York wagged his woolly head and\r\nrolled his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNossuh. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t get no shot at him. We des seen his track, in dem\r\nbushes yonduh near de mout\xe2\x80\x99 ob de ribber. Oof! Marse Will he set his\r\nmoccasin cl\xe2\x80\x99ar inside, an\xe2\x80\x99 dat track it stuck out all \xe2\x80\x99round. \xe2\x80\x99Spec\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndis chile ain\xe2\x80\x99t got bus\xe2\x80\x99ness wif dem critters. Oof!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed George Shannon. \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to Drouillard even the Indians\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t tackle one of those white bears, except in a crowd of six or\r\neight. And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot him through the head or heart he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nliable to out-fight them all. Before they go after him they make big\r\nmedicine, same as if they were going to war with a whole nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99special fond of black meat, too, I hear tell,\xe2\x80\x9d slyly remarked\r\nJohn Thompson.\r\n\r\nYork rolled his eyes, and muttered. But the Kentuckians, some of\r\nwhom had hunted with Daniel Boone, fingered their rifles eagerly and\r\nsurveyed the low country at the mouth of the river, as if hoping to see\r\nYork\xe2\x80\x99s monster stirring.\r\n\r\nThe next day the first Arikara Indians came aboard, from their lower\r\nvillage. Captain Lewis went with some of them to return the visit.\r\nHe was accompanied back by Mr. Tabeau and Mr. Gravelines, two French\r\ntraders who lived with the Arikaras. Mr. Gravelines spoke the Arikara\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThere were three Arikara villages, so that the captains ordered camp\r\nmade on the north side of the river, across from the villages.\r\n\r\nThe Arikaras were tall, handsome people\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95much superior, thought\r\nPatrick Gass and the rest of the men, to the Sioux. Chiefs\r\nKa-ka-wis-sas-sa or Lighting Crow, Fo-cas-se or Hay, and Pi-a-he-to or\r\nEagle\xe2\x80\x99s Feather, were introduced by Mr. Gravelines, and the camp soon\r\nfilled with the Arikara warriors, and even squaws who rowed across in\r\nlittle skin boats of a single buffalo hide stretched over basket-work.\r\n\r\nYork held a regular reception, for he appeared to astonish the Arikaras\r\nas much as he had astonished the Sioux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Marse Tabeau,\xe2\x80\x9d he called, to the French trader. \xe2\x80\x9cDes tell dese\r\npeople I\xe2\x80\x99se bohn wil\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 my young marster done ketched me when I was\r\nrunnin\xe2\x80\x99 in de timber an\xe2\x80\x99 tamed me. Tell \xe2\x80\x99em I used to eat peoples bones\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 all. I\xe2\x80\x99se a sorter g\xe2\x80\x99riller.\xe2\x80\x9d And thereupon York seized a thick\r\nstick, and snapped it in his two hands, and howled and gritted his\r\nteeth. He was very strong, was York.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted the Arikaras, respectfully falling back from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do, York,\xe2\x80\x9d cautioned Captain Clark, trying not to laugh.\r\n\r\nBut York, of much importance, thoroughly enjoyed himself.\r\n\r\nThe Arikaras were splendid entertainers and exceedingly hospitable\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Mos\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlike white folks,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted York. They did not beg, as the Sioux had\r\nbegged; they gave lavishly out of their store of corn and beans and dried\r\nsquashes, and accepted thankfully the gifts from the great father; they\r\nwould not drink any whisky\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x9cWe are surprised that the great father\r\nshould send us liquor to make fools of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chief Lighting Crow.\r\nTheir houses were built close together, of a willow frame plastered with\r\nmud, and were entered through a covered passage-way that kept out the\r\nwind. Around each village was a fence of close upright pickets, for\r\ndefense. They were well armed, too, with guns.\r\n\r\nWhen it came time, after the councils had been held, to leave the\r\nfriendly Arikaras, all the men of the expedition hated to go. John\r\nNewman, who had enlisted at St. Louis, was the most out-spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered, boldly, among his comrades at the last camp\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we go on, up to those Mandans? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we spend the\r\nwinter where we are? The Mandan village is nigh on 200 miles yet, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m tired of working my hands raw in this cold weather, hauling the\r\nboats over sand-bars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrders be orders,\xe2\x80\x9d reminded Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 up to the Mandans we\r\ngo, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if we show a little spunk and say we want to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhisht, now!\xe2\x80\x9d cautioned Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cWould ye spoil a good record?\r\nFaith,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cif the captain heard ye he\xe2\x80\x99ll have ye on the carpet\r\nfor mutiny, b\xe2\x80\x99gorry.\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Clark had strode hastily by, wrapped in\r\nhis cloak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s mutiny ye\xe2\x80\x99re talkin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d scolded Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nwant no more of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark had heard, for at breaking camp in the morning, John was\r\nplaced under arrest and confined in the forecastle aboard the barge.\r\n\r\nThat night, at camp, twenty-five miles above the Arikara villages, a\r\ncourt-martial was held on the case of John Newman. He was found guilty\r\nof mutinous speech and sentenced to received seventy-five lashes, and\r\nbe suspended from the company. The next noon the boats stopped in the\r\nrain, at a sand-bar in the middle of the river, everybody was ordered\r\nout, and John was roundly whipped on the naked back with ramrods and\r\nswitches.\r\n\r\nChief Ah-ke-tah-na-sha of the Arikaras, who was going with the\r\nexpedition up to the Mandans, to make peace between the Mandans and\r\nthe Arikaras, squatted on the sand-bar, to watch. Evidently he did not\r\nunderstand, for he began to weep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does Ah-ke-tah-na-sha cry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Captain Clark.\r\n\r\nAh-ke-tah-na-sha, who could speak some Sioux, explained to Drouillard,\r\nand Drouillard explained to the captains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe say de \xe2\x80\x99Rikara dey punish by death, but dey never whip even de\r\nchildren. He weep for Newman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him what the matter is, and that this is the white man\xe2\x80\x99s way of\r\npunishing disobedience,\xe2\x80\x9d directed Captain Clark, to Drouillard.\r\n\r\nDrouillard did; and reported.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe say mebbe so, but \xe2\x80\x99mong Injuns to whip men make women of dem. If\r\ndees is white man way, all right. Men ought to obey deir chiefs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow aren\xe2\x80\x99t ye \xe2\x80\x99shamed o\xe2\x80\x99 yourself, when even an Injun cries over ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreproved Patrick Gass, of John Newman, who was painfully donning his\r\nshirt and coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted John. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I deserved what I got. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nharbor any grudge, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSNUG IN WINTER QUARTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather had grown much colder, with squalls of snow and sleet and\r\nhigh winds; the wild geese were flying high, headed into the south; and\r\nthe river, falling rapidly, was split with bars and narrow channels,\r\nwhen, two weeks after the punishment of John Newman, the barge and the\r\ntwo pirogues anchored off the first of the Mandan villages, in the\r\ncentre of present North Dakota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive long months we\xe2\x80\x99ve been travelin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 for sixteen hundred crooked\r\nmiles,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cSure we desarve a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 rist. Now what\r\nwill the Mandans say, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see that young fellow who\xe2\x80\x99d lost the halves of two fingers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nqueried George Shannon. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99d cut \xe2\x80\x99em off, on purpose, because\r\nsome of his relatives had died! That\xe2\x80\x99s the Mandan way of going into\r\nmourning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould be better to cut the hair, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cThey most\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em nade it\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95an\xe2\x80\x99 hair\xe2\x80\x99ll grow again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mandans had swarmed aboard, and were examining every object\r\nwith much curiosity. They were an odd people, wrinkled and of low\r\nstature\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95many of the women with brown hair, but others with gray hair\r\nwhich flared almost to the ground. However, their voices were gentle,\r\nand they brought gifts of corn and vegetables, in earthen jars.\r\n\r\nMr. Jessaume, a French trader among them, also came aboard; so did a\r\nScotchman named Hugh McCracken, from a British fur company post far\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re frindly, be they, Pierre?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pat, of One-eyed Cruzatte,\r\nwho was hobbling past after a lively conversation with Mr. Jessaume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cruzatte, with a grimace of pain. \xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ink we stay an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nspen\xe2\x80\x99 one winter. Dey glad. We protect\xe2\x80\x99 dem \xe2\x80\x99gainst de Sioux. My poor\r\nleg, he carry me not furder, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Cruzatte had the rheumatism in both knees. Reuben Fields was laid\r\nup with the rheumatism in his neck; and Captain Clark had been so\r\nbothered with a stiff neck that he could not move around until Captain\r\nLewis had applied a hot stone wrapped in red flannel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi!\xe2\x80\x9d cackled big York, strutting as usual. \xe2\x80\x9cDese heah Mandans done gif\r\nme name Great Medicine, Mistuh McCracken say. Dey wants me foh a chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s coal in the banks, yonder,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke George Shannon. \xe2\x80\x9cSee it,\r\nPeter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is coal?\xe2\x80\x9d ventured Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack stuff, like a rock, that will burn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll make fine fuel for my forge,\xe2\x80\x9d put in John Shields, who was\r\nclever at fashioning things out of metal. \xe2\x80\x9cExpect I\xe2\x80\x99ll be busy all\r\nwinter, smithing, while you other fellows are hunting and dancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mandan villages were three in number. There was a village\r\nof Minnetarees, also; and a village of Ar-wa-cah-was and\r\nAh-na-ha-ways\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Indians whom neither Drouillard nor Cruzatte knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, now, belike there be plenty Injuns on ahead, too, that ye\r\nnever heard of,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cYis, an\xe2\x80\x99 lots of other cur\xe2\x80\x99osities\r\nbefore we get to the Paycific Ocean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head chief of all the Mandans was Pos-cap-sa-he, or Black Cat. The\r\nchief of the lowest village was Sha-ha-ka, or Big White. The chief of the\r\nsecond village was Raven Man. The chief of the Ar-wa-cah-was was White\r\nBuffalo Robe. The chief of the Ah-na-ha-ways was Cherry-on-a-Bush, or\r\nLittle Cherry, but he was very old. The chief of the Minnetaree village\r\nwas Black Moccasin. And the chief of the upper Mandan village, across\r\nfrom the Minnetaree village, was Red Shield.\r\n\r\nThe two captains met in council with all the villages together, and\r\nsmoked the pipe of peace and distributed gifts. During the speeches old\r\nCherry-on-a-Bush, the Ah-na-ha-way chief, rose to go, because, he said,\r\nhis son was on the war-trail against the Sho-sho-nes, or Snakes, and\r\nhis village was liable to be attacked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame on you, for an impolite old man,\xe2\x80\x9d rebuked Sha-ha-ka, Big White.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not know better than to show such bad manners before the chiefs\r\nfrom the great white father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd poor Cherry-on-a-Bush sat down mumbling.\r\n\r\nThe Arikara chief who had come up on the barge was well received. The\r\nMandans promised to observe peace between the two nations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not begin the war,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been killing those\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Rees like we kill birds, until we are tired of killing. Now we will\r\nsend a chief to them, with this chief of theirs, and they can smoke\r\npeace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCamp was made at a spot picked out by Captain Clark, across the river,\r\nbelow the first Mandan village, and everybody not on guard duty was\r\nset at work erecting winter quarters. Captain Clark had charge of the\r\ncamp, but Patrick Gass \xe2\x80\x9cbossed\xe2\x80\x9d the work. He was a carpenter. Axes\r\nrang, trees were felled and under Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s direction were trimmed and\r\nnotched, to form the walls and roofs of the cabins.\r\n\r\nThere were to be two rows of cabins, joined so as to make four rooms,\r\nbelow, on each side, and four rooms above, entered by ladders. The\r\nwalls were of hewn logs tightly chinked with clay; and the ceilings,\r\nseven feet high, were of planks trimmed with adzes\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and covered with\r\ngrass and clay to make a warm floor for the lofts. The roofs slanted\r\ninward, which made the outside of the rows eighteen feet high, so that\r\nnobody could climb over. Every down-stairs room had a fire-place, and a\r\nplank floor. The two rows met, at one end, and were open at the other;\r\nand across this opening was to be stretched a high fence of close,\r\nthick pickets, entered by a stout gate.\r\n\r\nThe Mandans and their Indian friends marveled much at the skill of\r\nthe white men, and at the strength of York, the Great Medicine. They\r\nadmitted that these white men\xe2\x80\x99s houses were better even than the\r\nMandan lodges\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95although the Mandan lodges were also of heavy timbers,\r\nplastered with earth, and banked with earth at the bottoms; had doors\r\nof buffalo hide, and fireplaces in the middle.\r\n\r\nMr. Jessaume, the French trader, moved to the camp, with his Mandan\r\nwife and child; and so did another French trader named Toussaint\r\nChaboneau. He had two wives: one was very old and ugly, but the other\r\nwas young and handsome. She was a Sho-sho-ne girl, from far-off. The\r\nMinnetaree Indians had attacked her people and taken her captive, and\r\nChaboneau had bought her as his wife. She and the old wife did not get\r\nalong together very well.\r\n\r\nMr. Jessaume and Chaboneau could speak the languages, and were hired by\r\nthe captains to be interpreters for the camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young wife come from ze Rock mountains,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chaboneau\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95who was a\r\ndark little man, his wrinkled face like smoked leather. \xe2\x80\x9cOne time I was\r\ndere. I trade with Minnetaree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never were over the mountains, Toussaint, were you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nSergeant Pryor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe, Monsieur Sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d And Toussaint shuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cMa foi (my word),\r\nno! It is not ze possible. Up dere, no meat, no grass, no trail,\r\nnotting but rock, ice, cold, an\xe2\x80\x99 ze terrible savages out for ze scalp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cabins were erected rapidly, for the cottonwood logs were soft\r\nand easily split. The first trees were felled on November 3, and on\r\nNovember 20 the walls were all in place. The men moved in before the\r\nroofs were put on, but buffalo hides were stretched over.\r\n\r\nThe two captains occupied one cabin, at the head of the angle. And\r\nsix or seven men were assigned to each of the other cabins. Sergeant\r\nPatrick Gass, Privates George Shannon, Reuben Fields and Joseph\r\nFields, who were great hunters, George Gibson, who played the violin,\r\nJohn Newman, who now was no longer mutinous, but worked with a will,\r\nand Peter formed one mess; Corporal Warfington and his six soldiers\r\nfrom St. Louis formed another; Drouillard, the hunter, and five of\r\nthe French boatmen another; One-eyed Cruzatte and five other boatmen\r\nanother; and so forth. Jessaume and Chaboneau had erected their own\r\nlodges.\r\n\r\nIt was high time that the cabins were completed. The weather turned\r\nvery cold and windy, and ice floated in the river. The roofs were\r\nhastened, and the picket fence ought to be erected soon, for the\r\nMandans were not yet satisfied with the presence of the white men.\r\n\r\nBlack Cat and Big White were frequent visitors. One day after Black\r\nCat had spent the whole morning talking with the captains, Chaboneau\r\nreported the bad news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMebbe now dere is troubles,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered, as he sat toasting his shins\r\nat the fire in the Patrick Gass cabin. He had entered with a gay \xe2\x80\x9cBon\r\nsoir (good evening), messieurs,\xe2\x80\x9d and had brought a draft of icy air\r\nwith him. \xe2\x80\x9cMebbe now dere is troubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Toussaint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI interpret for ze Black Cat an\xe2\x80\x99 ze captains. Ze Black Cat say ze\r\nSioux dey much enrage\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x99cause ze \xe2\x80\x99Rees make ze peace with ze Mandan.\r\nDey sen\xe2\x80\x99 ze word dat someday dey come up an\xe2\x80\x99 take ze scalp of all ze\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Ree an\xe2\x80\x99 ze Mandan an\xe2\x80\x99 ze white soldier. Dey sorry dey did not kill ze\r\nwhite soldier down-river, for ze white soldier carry bad talk. Black\r\nCat fear. He fear mebbe ze \xe2\x80\x99Ree get scare\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 help ze Sioux, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nbeen tol\xe2\x80\x99, too, dat ze white soldiers build strong fort, to stay an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntry to make slaves of ze Mandan, an\xe2\x80\x99 soon ze whole country he be Sioux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds like the British,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked George Shannon. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nnaturally don\xe2\x80\x99t want the United States in here, taking away their\r\ntrade. They\xe2\x80\x99d like to have us driven out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 what did the captains say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Patrick Gass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey say Black Cat must not open hees ears to such talk,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nToussaint. \xe2\x80\x9cZe United States speak only truth, an\xe2\x80\x99 if ze Mandan listen\r\nze white soldiers will protec\xe2\x80\x99 dem \xe2\x80\x99gainst all deir enemies. Black Cat\r\nsay dere been a council held, on ze matter, an\xe2\x80\x99 ze Mandan will wait an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch was yet to be done before the fort was secure. The barge ought\r\nto be unloaded and its goods stored in the two store-cabins. The\r\nmen in the Gass cabin spent their time evenings braiding a large\r\nrope of elk-skin, by which the barge might be hauled up on the bank,\r\nfarther out of the ice. Big White and Little Raven and other chiefs\r\nand warriors brought meat, on the backs of their squaws. Big White\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvillage was across the river, and he and his wife came over in their\r\nbuffalo-hide boat. She followed him to the fort, with 100 pounds\r\nof meat at a time on her back. She was delighted with the gift of\r\na hand-ax, with which to cut wood for the lodge fire. The captains\r\npresented the Mandan nation with an iron mill for grinding corn. This\r\npleased the women.\r\n\r\nThe weather turned warm, and Captain Lewis took a squad of men, to\r\npay a visit to the villages. Only one chief was unfriendly. He, named\r\nMah-pah-pa-pa-ra-pas-sa-too, or Horned Weasel, refused to see the\r\ncaptain at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we know the reason why,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Sergeant Pryor, who had been\r\nalong. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven traders of the British Northwest Company have just come\r\ndown with dog-sleds from the north country, and are giving out British\r\nflags and medals and telling the chiefs we aren\xe2\x80\x99t true men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Francois Larocque, the captain of the traders, paid a visit\r\nto the fort, Captain Lewis informed him very strongly that the United\r\nStates would not tolerate any flags and medals except those authorized\r\nby the President. This was now United States territory.\r\n\r\nThis day Sergeant Pryor dislocated his shoulder while helping to take\r\ndown the mast of the barge.\r\n\r\nNow cold weather set in again, and the river was closed by ice. The\r\nsnow fell for a day and a night, and lay thirteen inches deep. But\r\nfortunately the roofs were on the cabins, the stone chimneys drew well,\r\nand there was plenty of meat and dried corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nEXCITEMENT AT FORT MANDAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo! Hi! Hi-o!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the morning after Sergeant Pryor had hurt his shoulder, and\r\nthe Northwest Company traders had been talked to by Captain Lewis; a\r\nbitterly cold morning, too, with a stinging north wind blowing across\r\nthe snow and ice. The shrill call drifted flatly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! Hi-o!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant of the guard,\xe2\x80\x9d summoned William Bratton, who in beaver-fur\r\ncap, buffalo-fur coat and overshoes and mittens was walking sentry\r\noutside the opening of the two lines of cabins.\r\n\r\nSergeant John Ordway came running. All the men stopped their\r\nafter-breakfast tasks at the barge and in the street and in the timber,\r\nto gaze and listen. On the opposite bank of the river an Indian stood,\r\nwrapped in his buffalo-robe, with his hands to his mouth, calling. The\r\nriver, frozen from shore to shore, was only 400 yards wide, and the\r\nvoice carried clearly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dunno what he wants, but he wants something,\xe2\x80\x9d informed Sentry\r\nBratton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! Hi-o!\xe2\x80\x9d And then signs and a jangle of Indian words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to talk with us,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Peter, who read the signs, to\r\nGeorge Shannon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Chaboneau?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Sergeant Ordway. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Toussaint! What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhe saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi!\xe2\x80\x9d called back Chaboneau, with lifted hand. And listened to the\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe say he have somet\xe2\x80\x99ing ver\xe2\x80\x99 important to tell to ze Long\r\nKnife an\xe2\x80\x99 ze Red Head. He want to come over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian crossed on the ice. The sergeant and Chaboneau accompanied\r\nhim to the headquarters cabin at the head of the street. The Indian\r\nwas not closeted there very long. Out from the cabin bustled Sergeant\r\nOrdway again, and hastened down to the barge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gass! Here\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95you\xe2\x80\x99re to take twenty men, Pat, and go with Captain\r\nClark. See that they\xe2\x80\x99re well armed, and in marching order. The captain\r\nmeans business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pat, dropping his armful of supplies. \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99gorry,\r\nI hope it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up, John?\xe2\x80\x9d queried half a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sioux have tried to wipe out a party of Mandans, down to the\r\nsouthwest, and Big White\xe2\x80\x99s afraid the village is going to be attacked.\r\nSo now\xe2\x80\x99s the time for us to help Big White and show these Mandans our\r\nhearts are good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut from the headquarters cabin strode Captain Clark, in his furs, and\r\nbuckling his sword about his waist outside of his buffalo overcoat.\r\nUsually he did not wear his sword. He was known as the Red Head.\r\nCaptain Lewis was known as the Long Knife, because he was rarely\r\nwithout his sword.\r\n\r\nBehind Captain Clark came Chaboneau, and York, agrin, carrying his\r\nrifle, and looking indeed like a black buffalo.\r\n\r\nPeter thrilled. He was wild to go, himself. He ran after Pat, and\r\nclutched him by his skirt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go, Pat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no orders o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, bedad,\xe2\x80\x9d rebuked Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cSure,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the Irish blood in ye\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95an\xe2\x80\x99 if ye snake after an\xe2\x80\x99 the cap\xe2\x80\x99n doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee ye, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not send ye back. But ye can\xe2\x80\x99t go furder\xe2\x80\x99n the village.\r\nMind that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYork can go. I can go,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Peter, for York was no soldier,\r\neither, although sometimes he pretended to be. So Peter ran to York.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get out, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d rebuked York, strutting about while the men were\r\nbeing formed at Sergeant Pat\xe2\x80\x99s sharp orders. \xe2\x80\x9cDis am wah! Dis am berry\r\nseryus bus\xe2\x80\x99ness when Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Will done buckle on his sword. Yessuh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t no place foh chillun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Captain Clark say you could go?\xe2\x80\x9d challenged Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t necessitous, chile,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted York. \xe2\x80\x9cMarse Will gwine to take\r\nkeer ob his soldiers; I go to take keer ob Marse Will. He cain\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nalong wiffout Yawk. I raise him from a baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when the little column pressed forward, Captain Clark and\r\nChaboneau, the interpreter, in the lead, Sergeant Pat conducting the\r\ndouble file of men, and York toiling behind, Peter trotted at the heels\r\nof York.\r\n\r\nYork glanced over his shoulder, and grunted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! \xe2\x80\x99Spec\xe2\x80\x99 you think you gwine to help carry Marse Will\xe2\x80\x99s scalps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ice was firm and snow-covered. Captain Clark led straight across.\r\nNo sounds except the barking of dogs issued from the site of the Big\r\nWhite village, above. The Sioux had not yet attacked. Not an Indian\r\nwas to be seen; in the distance before, the smoke from the lodges\r\nstreamed in the wind. The captain made a half circuit of the village,\r\nand entered it on a sudden, from the land side. At the approach of the\r\nlittle company the Mandan dogs barked furiously\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95women screamed\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the\r\nvillage seemed to be alarmed; but Chief Big White, and Chief O-hee-naw,\r\na captive Cheyenne, and Chief Sho-ta-haw-ro-ra or Coal, issued to see\r\nwhat was the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have come to protect our friends the Mandans,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Captain\r\nClark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Red Head chief is welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d bade Big White, breathless\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95for he was\r\nrather fat. His hair, pure white, bushed out all around his head. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nmy brothers come to the council lodge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter had done well to stick by York; for York was Great Medicine, and\r\nof course was gladly admitted into a council. Peter sidled in beside\r\nhim. If he had tried to get in alone, the chiefs would have ordered him\r\nout. Councils were no places for boys.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark made a speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have heard that the Sioux have not kept our peace talk in their\r\nhearts,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut have attacked our friends, the Mandans, and have\r\nstained the prairie with blood. So we armed at once and are here to\r\nlead the Mandan warriors against the Sioux and punish them for their\r\ntreachery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWah!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted the chiefs and warriors, approving. They spoke together,\r\nin their half circle, a few minutes; and O-hee-naw, or Big Man, the\r\nCheyenne, arose and dropped his robe, to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe see now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Big Man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat what you have told us before is true.\r\nWhen our enemies attack us, you are ready to protect us. But, father,\r\nthe snow is deep, the weather is very cold, and our horses cannot\r\ntravel far. The murderers have gone off. In the spring, when the snow\r\nhas disappeared, if you will conduct us we will follow you to the Sioux\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x99Ricaras with all our warriors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the council dispersed, the Mandans were in a very good humor.\r\nChief Big White accompanied Captain Clark back to the river, and hugged\r\nhim, at parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe love our white fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cMy village has been weeping\r\nnight and day for the young man slain by the Sioux; but now my people\r\nwill wipe their eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAcross the ice Captain Clark marched his men, to the fort again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled York. \xe2\x80\x9cDose Mandans, dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t gwine to fight when\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t comf\xe2\x80\x99table to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 that was jest a Mandan trick, to try our mettle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasserted Patrick Gass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Mandans now our heap frien\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d assured Drouillard.\r\n\r\nColder grew the weather, until at the close of the first week in\r\nDecember the mercury of the thermometer stood at 10 above zero. The\r\nearth was freezing so rapidly that the men had hard work to set the\r\npickets of the fence which was to enclose the open end of the fort.\r\n\r\nNow on the morning of December 7, Patrick Gass paused in his work of\r\naligning the fence stringers to which the pickets were being spiked,\r\nand swung his arms and puffed. His breath floated white in the biting\r\nwind. He had peeled his overcoat, and was working in his flannel shirt.\r\nSha-ha-ka the Mandan chief shuffled business-like through the opening\r\nleft for the gate. He was muffled from chin to ankles in a buffalo\r\nrobe; and above it protruded his bushy white hair framing his solemn\r\nbut good-humored wrinkled face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTop o\xe2\x80\x99 the mornin\xe2\x80\x99 to ye, Big White,\xe2\x80\x9d hailed Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good\r\nnews, this fine day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOoh!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Big White, scarcely checking his stride. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere Red\r\nHead? Long Knife? Heap buffs.\xe2\x80\x9d And he passed on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cBuff\xe2\x80\x99lo, does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, through the thin air drifted a distant medley of shrill\r\nshouts, across the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d bade Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cDey hunt boof\xe2\x80\x99lo! De boof\xe2\x80\x99lo haf come out on\r\nde prairie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe uproar increased. Sha-ha-ka had disappeared in headquarters; but\r\nout burst York, and Chaboneau, and Jessaume, armed and running for\r\nhorses. Out issued Captain Clark and Sha-ha-ka, followed by Captain\r\nLewis. Baptiste Lepage, a new interpreter, yelled in French to\r\nJessaume, and Jessaume excitedly answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGran\xe2\x80\x99 boof\xe2\x80\x99lo hunt,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed Baptiste, running also. \xe2\x80\x9cEver\xe2\x80\x99body\r\nhunt ze boof\xe2\x80\x99lo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTools were dropped, but Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s voice rang clearly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPryor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a dozen men who aren\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise engaged and join the Indians\r\nacross the river in that buffalo hunt. Get all the meat you can. Use\r\nwhat horses you need, but don\xe2\x80\x99t wait for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. I will, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d And rejoiced, Sergeant Pryor, whose arm had\r\nhealed, called off the names as he bustled hither-thither.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArrah!\xe2\x80\x9d mourned Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cThat laves us out, fellows. \xe2\x80\x98Not\r\notherwise engaged,\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain. An\xe2\x80\x99 here we are with our fince\r\nnot finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark and Chief Big White were hurrying for the river, and the\r\nvillage beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want your rifle, Will?\xe2\x80\x9d called Captain Lewis, after.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Merne. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hunt as the Indians do. We\xe2\x80\x99ll beat them at their own\r\ngame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlready the Sergeant Pryor detachment were mounting. There were\r\nscarcely horses enough to go around, for only enough had been hired\r\nfrom the Mandans to supply the regular hunters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are more at the village, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d called Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe men without mounts went running, plodding, laughing, across the\r\nsnowy ice, for the village. York was pressing after the captain and\r\nthe chief. He carried a rifle and had a large knife belted around his\r\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat. Peter delayed not, but scurried, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stay by Marse Will,\xe2\x80\x9d was declaring York. \xe2\x80\x9cWe show dem Injuns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn mid-river the sounds from the hunt were plainer. To thud of hoofs\r\nthe squad under Sergeant Pryor raced past with a cheer and flourish of\r\nweapons. At the village the squad afoot were met by squaws, holding\r\nponies. A young squaw who had frequently smiled on York tendered him\r\nthe hide rope of a splendid black.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Medicine heap kill \xe2\x80\x99um,\xe2\x80\x9d she urged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! Dey all like Yawk,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled York, scrambling aboard.\r\n\r\nThe other men were grabbing ropes and mounting. A very old and ugly\r\nsquaw with a spotted pony yelped at Peter (who knew better than to push\r\nforward) and signed. She thrust the pony\xe2\x80\x99s thong at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy go,\xe2\x80\x9d she cackled, grinning toothless. She signed \xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshuffled away, fast.\r\n\r\nAll the men except Peter and York left, hammering their ponies with\r\ntheir overshoes, in haste to join the fray. Yonder, about a mile, a\r\nsnow dust hung in the wind, and under it black figures plunged and\r\ndarted. Reports of fire-arms boomed dully.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark and Chief Sha-ha-ka had disappeared in the chief\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodge, before which stood a squaw holding two horses. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s squaw\r\ncame trotting back, with a bow and quiver of arrows. Grinning, she\r\nextended them to Peter, and signed: \xe2\x80\x9cGo! Shoot!\xe2\x80\x9d Peter thankfully\r\naccepted\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95slung the quiver at his waist, strung the bow. He never had\r\nkilled a buffalo, but he had shot rabbits; now he would kill a buffalo.\r\nThe bow was a strong little bow, but after these weeks of work he had a\r\nstrong little arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGolly!\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled York. \xe2\x80\x9cCap\xe2\x80\x99n Clark done got a bow, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the captain and Sha-ha-ka had emerged from the chief\xe2\x80\x99s lodge.\r\nSha-ha-ka was muffled in a buffalo robe; so was the captain. He had\r\nshed his overcoat, and his cap, had bound about his brow a scarlet\r\nhandkerchief, Indian fashion, and his red hair flowed loose to his\r\nshoulders. He carried a bow; doubtless underneath his robe was the\r\nquiver.\r\n\r\nAs quick as the chief he snatched the hide rope from the squaw\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwilling fingers, and vaulted upon the pony\xe2\x80\x99s back, and he and Big White\r\npounded off together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d bade York; and he and Peter launched in pursuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind me, York,\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the captain, over his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake care of myself. This gray is the best buffalo horse in the\r\nvillage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarse Will done been brung up by Dan\xe2\x80\x99l Boone,\xe2\x80\x9d explained York, to\r\nPeter. \xe2\x80\x9cYessuh; done shot wif bow\xe2\x80\x99n arrer, too, back in ol\xe2\x80\x99 Kaintuck.\r\nReg\xe2\x80\x99lar Injun, Marse Will is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian ponies were saddled only with a buffalo-hide pad, from which\r\nhung thong loops into which the rider might thrust his feet, if he\r\nwished. Peter could not reach the loops. And the ponies were bridled\r\nonly with a single thong which looped around the lower jaw. But Peter\r\nhad ridden in this fashion many a time before.\r\n\r\nYork clung like a huge ape. To ride bareback was nothing new to him.\r\nBefore, the captain sat as if glued fast. Sha-ha-ka could sit no firmer\r\nthan the Red Head.\r\n\r\nThe breeze was keen, whistling past one\xe2\x80\x99s ears and stinging one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheeks. But see! The buffalo! There were hundreds, in a writhing,\r\nsurging, scampering, bewildered mass. They had come out of the\r\nsheltered bottoms to feed in the open, and the Indians had espied them.\r\nNow around and around them sped the Indians, yelling, volleying arrows,\r\nstabbing with lances, working at the mass, cutting out animals and\r\npursuing them to the death. The hunters from the fort were at work,\r\nalso. Guns puffed little clouds, which mingled with the greater cloud\r\nof snow.\r\n\r\nHere and there were lying buffalo carcasses, reddening the snow. The\r\ncaptain and Sha-ha-ka, and then Peter and York, began to pass some, and\r\nthe blood-stains were frequent. Before, other buffalo were staggering,\r\nor whirling and charging. Indians on their ponies dodged, and plied\r\ntheir arrows. Peter glimpsed One-eyed Cruzatte, and Chaboneau\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95they\r\ncould hardly be told from the Indians, so cleverly they managed their\r\nponies. Sergeant Pryor had been thrown, and was running afoot, a great\r\nbull after him. Ah!\r\n\r\nChief Sha-ha-ka whooped shrilly, and dropped his buffalo-robe about his\r\nthighs. Captain Clark dropped his, and laid arrow on bow. Their ponies\r\nquickened, as if understanding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGwan, you hoss! Gwan!\xe2\x80\x9d implored York, hammering his black mount. The\r\nspotted pony also leaped eagerly.\r\n\r\nWith a loud shout Captain Clark charged straight at Sergeant Pryor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbull. The gray horse bore him close alongside, on the right\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the proper\r\nplace. When even with the bull the captain drew bow, clear from hand\r\nto shoulder, loosed string\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and the arrow, swifter than sight, buried\r\nto the feathers just back of the bull\xe2\x80\x99s foreleg. The stung bull jumped\r\nand whirled; on raced the gray horse, and wheeled; the bull, his head\r\ndown, lunged for him\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and the gray horse sprang aside\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the bull forged\r\npast, the captain was ready with another arrow\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95twang! thud!\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the gray\r\nhorse leaped again, to follow up\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but the great bull halted, faltered,\r\ndrooped his head, his tail twitched and lashed, still his head slowly\r\ndrooped, he straddled, and began to sink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch your horse, Pryor. Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d ordered the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hunt\r\nafoot.\xe2\x80\x9d And before the bull\xe2\x80\x99s body had touched the snow he was away\r\nagain, in the wake of the frantic herd, his red hair flaming on the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFust kill foh Marse Will,\xe2\x80\x9d jubilated York. He and Peter scarcely had\r\nhad time to check their horses. \xe2\x80\x9cHe done beat Big White. Come on, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a twinkling all was confusion, of buffalo bellowing, fleeing,\r\ncharging; of horsemen shouting, pursuing, dodging, shooting; of flying\r\nsnow and blood and steaming breaths and reek of perspiring bodies.\r\nPeter speedily lost York; he lost Sha-ha-ka and Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but\r\noccasionally he sighted them, now separated, now near together, as\r\nif they were rivals. He lost everything but himself and pony and the\r\nbuffalo. He shot, too; he saw his arrows land, he left wounded buffalo\r\nbehind and chased others; and ever and again he saw the red hair of the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nThe captain was in his buckskin shirt; Sha-ha-ka was in buckskin; many\r\nof the Indians rode half naked\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95excitement kept them warm. Peter felt\r\nno cold, through his buckskin and his flannel shirt. He had been more\r\nthinly clad in the Oto village and was used to weather. But bitter was\r\nthe wind, nevertheless, and the wounds of the prone buffalo almost\r\ninstantly froze.\r\n\r\nThe chase had proceeded for a mile\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and on a sudden Chief Big White,\r\nfrom a little rise in a clear space, shouted high and waved his\r\nrobe. It was the signal for the hunt to cease. The turmoil died, the\r\nfrightened herd rushed on, and the horsemen dropped behind, to turn\r\nback. The squaws from the village already had been at work with their\r\nknives, cutting up the dead buffalo. They must work fast, on account of\r\nthe cold. They carefully pulled out the arrows and laid them aside, so\r\nthat it might be told to whom that buffalo belonged. The arrows of each\r\nhunter bore his mark, in paint on the shaft or the feathers.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark rode in, panting and laughing, with Sha-ha-ka. His quiver\r\nwas empty, his buffalo-horse frost-covered from eye-brows to tail.\r\nSha-ha-ka treated him with great respect; and so did the other Indians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey say de Red Head one great chief. He ride an\xe2\x80\x99 shoot like Injun,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexplained Chaboneau, as the company from the fore assembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarse Will kill more buff\xe2\x80\x99los dan all the rest ob dem put togedder,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nprated York. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly he done run out ob arrers. Den he try to choke \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nwif his hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive buffalo were credited to the captain\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95his arrows were in them.\r\nFive more were credited to the soldiers, who had been hampered by their\r\nunsaddled horses and by the big overcoats. York claimed three of the\r\nfive\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but nobody could believe York. The interpreters\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Chaboneau and\r\nLepage and Jessaume\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95had made their own kills, for their families.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many do you claim, Peter?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the captain, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old squaw who gave me the horse and bow, she owns what I kill,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Peter, carefully.\r\n\r\nFor there she was, cutting up a fat cow, from which one of Peter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrows protruded. Peter rode over to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine,\xe2\x80\x9d he signed, proudly.\r\n\r\nBut she only grinned and shook her head, and pointed to his pony and\r\nhis bow. Then she handed one of his arrows to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep bow. Make big hunter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnderstanding, Peter rode away. There seemed to be plenty of meat, but\r\na good bow and quiver was a prize. So he was willing to trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nPETER WINS HIS SPURS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo twenty-one, and then to thirty-eight below zero dropped the\r\nthermometer. The captains forbade the men to venture far from the fort,\r\nand the sentinels were relieved every half hour. The air was so filled\r\nwith ice haze that two suns seemed to be shining.\r\n\r\nOf course not much work could be done out of doors, in such weather.\r\nHowever, with the first warm spell, at twenty above, Pat, the boss\r\ncarpenter, hustled his squad to complete the fence. Lustily chopping\r\nwith broad-axes they rapidly turned out pickets that were two feet\r\nwide, four inches thick, twelve feet long and sharpened at both ends.\r\nThese were set upright in a shallow ditch and spiked, edge against\r\nedge, to the stringers.\r\n\r\nFinally Pat swung the heavy gate to and fro on its leathern hinges;\r\nit closed perfectly, and the bar that fastened it dropped easily into\r\nplace. That was the last touch, and Pat heaved a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a good job well done, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d he complimented. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 jest in time.\r\nTo-morrow we cilibrate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, ain\xe2\x80\x99t to-morrow Christmas?\xe2\x80\x9d rebuked Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a new wan to\r\nye, mebbe?\xe2\x80\x9d And Peter needs must have \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas\xe2\x80\x9d explained to him.\r\n\r\nYes, the captains had decided to celebrate. They instructed Chaboneau\r\nto tell the Mandans that on the morrow the white men were to have a\r\ngreat medicine day, and that no Indians should come near. That night,\r\nin the mess cabin, Patrick Gass passed another word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all o\xe2\x80\x99 yez up \xe2\x80\x99arly in the mornin\xe2\x80\x99, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll wake\r\nthe captains with thray rounds, so they\xe2\x80\x99ll know we\xe2\x80\x99ve not forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe winked.\r\n\r\nIn his bunk Peter was roused with a jump, amidst the grayness, by a\r\nthunderous noise. He sprawled to the floor\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95he heard a voice giving\r\nsharp orders, and before he could reach the door there was another\r\nthunder. Had the Sioux come? No! It was Christmas, and the celebration\r\nhad begun. He opened the door\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95powder smoke wafted into his nostrils,\r\nthe men had formed two lines down the middle of the street, their\r\nrifles were leveled, and \xe2\x80\x9cWhang!\xe2\x80\x9d they all spoke together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d now the men cheered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristmas Day in the mornin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pat, waving his cap. The door\r\nof the captains\xe2\x80\x99 cabin opened and the captains stood gazing out; York\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblack face peering over their shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas to yez,\r\nsorrs,\xe2\x80\x9d welcomed Pat, with a bow and a scrape. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only welcomin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nday, we are, an\xe2\x80\x99 christenin\xe2\x80\x99 the flag with a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 powder.\xe2\x80\x9d For from\r\nthe flag-staff in the street floated the United States flag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d approved Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas to each of you.\r\nYou may dismiss the men for the day, Sergeant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a jolly day this day of Christmas proved to be. Nobody worked,\r\neverybody was merry. After breakfast in the mess hall, which was a\r\ncabin with a table down the centre seating twenty on a side, and a huge\r\nfireplace at one end, and a loft for the cooks and their supplies,\r\nthe table was moved, One-eyed Cruzatte and George Gibson tuned their\r\nfiddles, and the men danced and capered.\r\n\r\nThere was a big dinner, of juicy meats, stewed corn, stewed dried\r\npumpkin, with plum pudding at the close. The captains were present, in\r\nuniform. There was more dancing, and story-telling; not until late at\r\nnight was the fort quiet. All the Indians had kept away.\r\n\r\nThus was passed Christmas Day, 1804, at this first United States fort\r\nwest of St. Louis, 1600 miles up the River Missouri, in the centre of a\r\nNorth Dakota yet to be named.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do we have another Christmas, George?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Peter, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for a long time, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed George. \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas comes only\r\nonce a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor, you see, Peter had a great deal to learn.\r\n\r\nNow Fort Mandan settled down to a winter routine. The United States\r\nflag floated. The swivel cannon from the barge had been planted in the\r\nstreet, its muzzle commanding the entrance. Just outside the gate a\r\nsentry constantly paced, by day; another sentry walked a beat on the\r\ntop of a mound of earth that half circled the rear of the fort and\r\nbanked the store-rooms against the cold. John Shields, the blacksmith,\r\nestablished his forge\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and that, also, was great medicine. The Indians\r\ncrowded about to watch the bellows fan the charcoal into ruddy heat.\r\nEven the interpreters were astonished, when John set to work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa foi!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Toussaint Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cI go get my squaw\xe2\x80\x99s kettle.\r\nShe haf one hole in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAway he ran, and returned with Sa-ca-ja-we-a, bringing her kettle. A\r\ngentle little woman was the girlish Sa-ca-ja-we-a, or Bird-woman, of\r\nthe far distant Snake nation; everybody was fond of her. John Shields\r\nwillingly took the kettle, and patched the hole in it; and beaming with\r\nsmiles the Bird-woman hastened to put it on her fire again.\r\n\r\nBut the wife of Jessaume had a kettle which could _not_ be mended; and\r\nvery indignant and jealous she left the fort, with her kettle and her\r\nchildren, and went across the river to her own people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jessaume, shrugging his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cShe be so bad, guess I\r\nget \xe2\x80\x99nodder wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Shields not only mended kettles for the women, but he mended the\r\nbattle-axes and tomahawks of the men. From scraps of sheet-iron and\r\ntin he manufactured a marvelous variety of articles\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95hide-scrapers,\r\npunches, arrow points, and occasionally a whole battle-ax. For these,\r\nthe Indians from the villages traded corn and beans and dried\r\npumpkins, so that John proved to be a valuable workman.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bratton and Alexander Willard sometimes helped him; and as they\r\nwere gun-smiths too, they repaired the rifles of the expedition and the\r\nfew fusils of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe weather blew warm, and cold again. There were hunting excursions;\r\nand on January 1, 1805, which, Peter learned, was called New Year\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthere was another celebration, like that of Christmas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZe Mandan, dey reques\xe2\x80\x99 we pay visit to deir village an\xe2\x80\x99 show ze squaw\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 boys how ze white mans dance,\xe2\x80\x9d informed Chaboneau, in the morning,\r\nafter a call from Big White.\r\n\r\nSo the captains gave permission for Cruzatte and George Gibson to take\r\ntheir violins, and for York and Patrick Gass and a dozen others to go,\r\nand entertain the village of Big White.\r\n\r\nThey trapsed gaily across the river, and in the lodge of Chief Black\r\nCat, who lived at this village, Francois Labiche, one of the boat-men\r\nfrom Cahokia, opposite St. Louis, danced on his head to the music of\r\nthe two fiddles, and thereby greatly astonished the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe village rewarded the dancers with buffalo robes and corn; and that\r\nevening Head Chief Black Cat brought to the fort another quantity of\r\nmeat packed on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the white medicine dancers visit my other villages, or there will\r\nbe jealousy,\xe2\x80\x9d he urged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will haf no more hair,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Francois Labiche.\r\n\r\nForty below zero sank the thermometer. John Newman froze his feet so\r\nbadly that he was unable to walk in, and a rescue party with horses\r\nwere sent to get him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark, with Chaboneau as guide, led a hunting party down-river,\r\nwith the thermometer eighteen below. Chaboneau returned alone, to say\r\nthat Captain Clark had obtained some meat, but that the horses could\r\nnot carry it on the slippery ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife is ill, Chaboneau,\xe2\x80\x9d informed Captain Lewis. And Chaboneau\r\nrushed for his lodge.\r\n\r\nForth he darted again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife she ver\xe2\x80\x99 seeck,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, wringing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99at s\xe2\x80\x99all I\r\ndo? I fear she die, ma pauvre Sa-ca-ja-we-a (my poor Sa-ca-ja-we-a).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to tend to her, Toussaint,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Lewis; and got out\r\nthe medicine chest.\r\n\r\nBut all that night, and part of the next day the groans of the little\r\nBird-woman could be heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDere is one remedy I hear of,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Jessaume. \xe2\x80\x9cI sorry my wife lef\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nBut sometime de Injun gif de rattle of de rattlesnake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s try that, then,\xe2\x80\x9d bade Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nSo the captain broke open the specimen bales in the store-room\r\nand found a dried rattlesnake skin. With Chaboneau jumping about\r\nimploringly, he crumbled two of the rattles into water, and this the\r\nsuffering Bird-woman drank. Everybody at the fort was interested.\r\n\r\nSoon from the lodge of Chaboneau issued a new sound\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95a feeble, shrill,\r\npiping wail. But the groans of Sa-ca-ja-we-a had ceased. Out again\r\ndarted Chaboneau, his leather face beaming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne fine boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, capering. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all right. One fine boy. I\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99ink he look like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day, which was February 12, the hunting party returned, having\r\nleft their meat in a pen to protect it from the wolves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to announce a new recruit, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d reported Captain\r\nLewis, saluting Captain Clark, a twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s his name, Merne? Chaboneau?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Captain Clark, smiling\r\nbroadly, with cold-reddened face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is leetle Toussaint,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cOne fine boy who look\r\nso han\xe2\x80\x99some as me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99gorry,\xe2\x80\x9d uttered Sergeant Pat, \xe2\x80\x9can addition to our number, is it?\r\nFaith, he has good lungs, but I thought it was a weasel chasin\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nrabbit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning four men and three horses to haul sleds were sent down\r\nto get the meat; but at evening they came back empty-handed. A hundred\r\nSioux had robbed them. Captain Lewis set out at sunrise, to punish the\r\nrobbers. Only three or four Mandans went. Chief Black Cat said that\r\nhis young men were out hunting, and the villages had few guns, so his\r\npeople could not help the white soldiers.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis was gone six days. He did not overtake the Sioux, but he\r\nbrought up the meat\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95part of it on a sled drawn by fifteen men.\r\n\r\nMr. Gravelines, the trader, arrived from the Arikara nation. The Sioux\r\nsent word by the Arikaras that they would hereafter kill the white\r\nsoldiers whenever they caught them.\r\n\r\nBut nobody at the fort minded these threats. February slipped into\r\nMarch, and all thoughts were turned upon the onward journey as soon as\r\nthe river opened.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer rose to forty above zero. A flock of ducks were seen,\r\nflying up stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first sign,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Sergeant Gass.\r\n\r\nThe weather was \xe2\x80\x9copen an\xe2\x80\x99 shet,\xe2\x80\x9d as said Pat, with wind, sunshine,\r\nand snow flurries. But the ice in the river began to move, a little;\r\nanother sign of spring. The captains decided that the barge was to be\r\nsent back to St. Louis, with the specimens, and the Corporal Warfington\r\nsquad and other extra men. Under the direction of Captain Clark and\r\nPatrick Gass, the carpenter, boat timber was cut, and small pirogues,\r\nor canoes, were built, to take the place of the barge. John Shields was\r\nbusy all the days long, making battle-axes to trade for a fresh supply\r\nof corn.\r\n\r\nThe store-room was ransacked and the clothing and such damp stuff\r\nwas hung out to dry. Great strings of geese and swans and ducks\r\npassed, northward bound. The rising river burst into a channel; down\r\nit floated ice cakes, carrying buffalo, elk and deer. The Indians,\r\nrunning out across the firmer ice, killed them with spears. The canoes\r\nwere finished and brought out of the timber, and to the bank at the\r\nfort. All hands were put at work loading.\r\n\r\nThis was an anxious time for Peter. Was he to be sent down with the\r\nbarge, or was he to be taken on, with the captains and Pat and all?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cI engage\xe2\x80\x99 as one interpreter, for ze\r\njourney to ze Rock Mountains an\xe2\x80\x99 ze salt ocean. I take my young wife,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 my baby, but I leave my ol\xe2\x80\x99 wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I go, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled Pat, pausing to wink at Toussaint. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhat would we do with a boy, yonder up amongst the white bear an\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ntwo-headed Injuns? For I hear there be giants, wearin\xe2\x80\x99 two heads on\r\ntheir shoulders. Sure, they\xe2\x80\x99d ate a boy with only one o\xe2\x80\x99 their mouths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hunt,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould ye kill bear an\xe2\x80\x99 buff\xe2\x80\x99lo with the bow an\xe2\x80\x99 arrer?\xe2\x80\x9d teased Pat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t we got Drouillard an\xe2\x80\x99 Fields an\xe2\x80\x99 the captains an\xe2\x80\x99 meself, all\r\nhandy with the gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI show you, Pat,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Peter.\r\n\r\nTwo steps he made, and grabbed his bow and quiver, where they were\r\nlying on the gunwale of the barge. The quiver was full of iron-pointed\r\narrows, which John Shields had equipped for him. Out he ran, upon the\r\nice of the river. His quick eye had noted a black object floating down\r\nthe channel aboard a floe. No Indian was after it, yet. He would show\r\nthat he was as good a hunter as any Indian.\r\n\r\nBuffalo? Elk? Deer? Wah! It was crouching, and he could not yet tell.\r\nBut fast he ran, in the slush, dodging air-holes, and with the ice\r\nweaving and bending beneath him. Suddenly, as he approached, heading\r\noff the floe, the creature stood. It was no buffalo, or elk, or deer;\r\nit was a bear.\r\n\r\nWah, again! Also, hooray! Voices were shouting at him, to turn back;\r\nbut, no, he would not turn back, even for a bear. He was a hunter. He\r\nran faster, because he was afraid that some of the men would come with\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nHe reached the edge of the channel. The bear stiffened, lowered its\r\nhead, and bristled, showing every fang. No \xe2\x80\x9cwhite bear\xe2\x80\x9d was it,\r\nevidently. It was a brown bear, but an old one, large and cross. Below,\r\na few yards, the channel narrowed; the floe might lodge there, or the\r\nbear be enabled to spring from it to the other ice. Peter must act\r\nquick. He knelt and bent his bow\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95drew the arrow clear to the iron\r\npoint, so that his arm holding the bow was straight and the hand of the\r\nother arm was against his shoulder. That was the way to shoot. The bear\r\nwas right in front of him, balancing on the ice cake. Twang-thud! The\r\narrow struck true\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95was buried to the feathers where the bear\xe2\x80\x99s neck\r\nmet shoulder.\r\n\r\nNow another! Up reared the bear, roaring and clawing, and the floe\r\nswerved in toward the channel\xe2\x80\x99s edge. Peter in his haste to pluck a\r\nsecond arrow, string it and launch it, slipped and fell sideways\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and\r\non the instant the floe had touched the channel edge, where the channel\r\nnarrowed; roaring, the bear had sprung ashore, and roaring he was\r\ncoming, the arrow feathers dripping red and his tongue dripping red,\r\nand crimsoned froth slathering his open jaws. The bristles on his back\r\nwere full six inches high.\r\n\r\nAll this Peter saw in a twinkling. He had time only to launch his\r\narrow. But he took good aim, there on his knees; whang-thud!\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95his\r\nsecond arrow landed near the first; and away he ran. From the bank at\r\nthe fort men, both white and red, were running, too; running to help\r\nhim. They waved their arms and weapons, shouted loudly.\r\n\r\nPeter changed his course. They should _not_ help him. He would show\r\nPat, and the captains, and everybody, what he could do. He glanced over\r\nhis shoulder. The bear was close. A bear could easily outrun a boy, or\r\na man, and for a short distance, a horse. Aside leaped Peter, digging\r\nin his moccasined heels, for foothold in the soft spots; another arrow\r\nwas on the bowstring; with scratching of claws and furious growl the\r\nbear slid past. But Peter had turned in a flash, and while turning had\r\ndrawn his bow. Whang-thud! The arrow sank almost out of sight in the\r\nbear\xe2\x80\x99s ribs, forward where the heart should be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered the shouting men.\r\n\r\nThe blow had knocked the bear down. He went sliding, in a struggling\r\nheap. Now he roared indeed, and twisting his head bit at the arrow. Up\r\nhe rose, sighted Peter, and on he came. Peter lost a moccasin, his foot\r\nslipped. He stood his ground, held his breath, and took very careful,\r\ncool aim\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95bending his bow till it quivered in his grasp. A moment more,\r\nand the bear would rear, to strike him\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and he loosed the taut string.\r\nThe arrow struck the bear right in the nape of the burly neck; his head\r\nwas low, bear fashion, and Peter had taken the chance. Down sprawled\r\nthe bear, as if smitten by lightning, for the arrow point had cut his\r\nspine. He shivered, and was still. The four feathered ends jutted from\r\nhis hide. He was a dead bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory be!\xe2\x80\x9d panted Sergeant Pat, arriving. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 ye did it all by\r\nyourself! But, sure, I thought I see ye \xe2\x80\x99aten up entoirely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Little Raven, second Mandan chief, prodding the lax,\r\nfurry carcass with his spear. \xe2\x80\x9cHeap boy. Make big hunter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll together they dragged the bear, at the end of Pat\xe2\x80\x99s belt, to the\r\nbarge. Peter, of course, said nothing. But when Captain Clark clapped\r\nhim roundly on the shoulder, and Captain Lewis said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell done,\r\nPeter,\xe2\x80\x9d he knew that he stood a good chance of being taken up-river.\r\nThe Long Knife was not much given to idle words; but he appreciated\r\ndeeds. The bear proved to be very old, very thin, with tusks worn to\r\nstubs. Hunger had driven him out of his winter hole early. The hair of\r\nhis hide was loose. Nevertheless he was a large specimen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll send his head to the President,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Captain Lewis to\r\nCaptain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cNo such bear as this can be found in Virginia or\r\nKentucky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE KINGDOM OF THE \xe2\x80\x9cWHITE BEARS\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nApril was ushered in by a great thunder-storm of rain mingled with\r\nhail. That speedily cleared the river. The rotted ice went swirling\r\ndown, and soon from bank to bank the Missouri was free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe trail is open,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Cruzatte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far to the Rock Mountains, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother thousand miles, I hear tell. An\xe2\x80\x99 after that, another thousand\r\nmiles to the big ocean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do we get over the mountains, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPat scratched his carroty thatch, and reflectively rubbed his stubbled\r\nchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, an\xe2\x80\x99 I dunno. Trust to the commandin\xe2\x80\x99 officers, I guiss. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe proper way for soldiers. We\xe2\x80\x99ll find a gate some\xe2\x80\x99ers. There be some\r\ntremenjous falls to get around, fust, say the Injuns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSa-ca-ja-we-a know,\xe2\x80\x9d proudly asserted Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cHer peoples lif\r\ndere, in ze mountains, beyond dose falls. She speak ze Snake tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gwine to kill one ob dem white b\xe2\x80\x99ars,\xe2\x80\x9d boasted York.\r\n\r\nAll the fort was in a fever of impatience\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the down-river men to be\r\non their way \xe2\x80\x9cback to the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d as they expressed it; the\r\nup-river men to be on their way into a new country never explored\r\nby white foot. Long letters were being scrawled, for the \xe2\x80\x9cfolks at\r\nhome,\xe2\x80\x9d telling them of the past year\xe2\x80\x99s adventures; Captain Lewis was\r\nbusy preparing his report to the President; Captain Clark was laboring\r\nnights, by fire-light, putting final touches on a map of the Missouri,\r\nbased upon a ruder map sketched by Little Raven, the Mandan, with\r\ncharcoal on a buffalo hide. Baptiste Lepage and Chaboneau helped, for\r\nthey, also, had been many days\xe2\x80\x99 travel westward, trading with the\r\nCheyennes and the Minnetarees.\r\n\r\nOnly John Newman was sad at heart. Captain Lewis had decreed that he\r\nbe returned to St. Louis at the first opportunity. The opportunity\r\nwas near. John pleaded to be permitted to go on with his comrades. He\r\nwanted to make good. Already he had showed that he was repentant of his\r\nbrief bad conduct. Had he not worked faithfully, and even frozen his\r\nfeet?\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark might have yielded to him, but Captain Lewis was sterner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, John,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, again. \xe2\x80\x9cI must make an example of you. I cannot\r\nrun the risk of any more mutinous talk. We have two thousand miles\r\nbefore us, and the party must all work together. You will return to\r\nSt. Louis on the barge. Later, if your good conduct continues, I will\r\nrequest the President to overlook your offense and you will be granted\r\nan honorable discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied John Newman, saluting. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty tough,\r\nsir. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather take another lickin\xe2\x80\x99, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, in time, John did receive honorable discharge, and was granted\r\nthe 320 acres of land and the extra pay allowed to the other men.\r\n\r\nApril 7 was the day for breaking camp. By five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon\r\nthe boats, loaded and manned\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the barge for down-river, the six canoes\r\nand the two pirogues for up-river\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95were being held at the bank, waiting\r\nonly for the captains\xe2\x80\x99 orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady, barge?\xe2\x80\x9d called Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nJohn Newman gripped the last of the hands extended to him by his former\r\ncomrades, and clambered aboard. He and five of the Corporal Warfington\r\nprivates from St. Louis were the guard. The sixth private, Moses B.\r\nReed, was being returned as a prisoner, for he had attempted to desert,\r\nwith his musket and other government equipment. Corporal Warfington was\r\nin command. Trader Gravelines was the pilot. Two French boatmen were\r\nthe crew. Chief Brave Raven, and two other Arikaras who had accompanied\r\nMr. Gravelines up from the Arikara village, also were aboard. They were\r\ngoing on to Washington to see their great white father.\r\n\r\nFor President Jefferson were being sent Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s journal and\r\nmap, and Captain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s report to this very date. And many hide and\r\nwooden boxes of specimens and trophies: two stuffed antelope, a white\r\nweasel pelt entire, squirrels that had been brought by the Minnetarees\r\nclear from the Rocky Mountains, dried prairie dogs, mountain sheep\r\nand elk and deer horns, a painted buffalo robe picturing a battle of\r\nMandans and Minnetarees against Sioux and Arikaras, a beautiful shield\r\nmade and decorated by Chief Black Cat especially for the great white\r\nfather, Peter\xe2\x80\x99s bear head, a yellow bear hide and other furs, Indian\r\nshirts and leggins and moccasins, a Mandan bow and battle-ax, and even\r\nan ear of the red Mandan corn. And three cages containing a live ground\r\nsquirrel, a prairie hen, and four magpies.\r\n\r\nNot until ten months later did these wonders arrive at Washington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ready, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Corporal Warfington, to the captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut pushed the barge. Captain Lewis drew his sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresent! Ready! Fire!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. And every rifle, of canoes and\r\npirogues, cracked in a volley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cArrah\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but good luck\r\nto \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen into the white pirogue sprang Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive way,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, standing beside Captain Clark; and out were\r\nshoved the eight boats together. Captain Lewis nodded at Gunner Willard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoom!\xe2\x80\x9d spoke the swivel cannon, in farewell to the shore.\r\n\r\nSha-ha-ka and other Indians had come over in skin canoes to bid the\r\nLong Knife and the Red Head goodby. They stood, and gazed, and made no\r\nsign. They would wait, and take care of the white fathers\xe2\x80\x99 fort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be back,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the buoyant George Shannon, as he bent to an\r\noar. \xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are, old fort. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in the fall and light\r\nyour winter fires again.\xe2\x80\x9d For the captains thus had figured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe locked the gates, but sure the Injuns\xe2\x80\x99ll be climbin\xe2\x80\x99 over the fince\r\nbefore we\xe2\x80\x99re out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Sergeant Pat.\r\n\r\nThe wind was almost dead ahead. With oars and paddles the men settled\r\nto their work. Now the party numbered thirty-three, and Peter.\r\n\r\nThere were the two captains\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Captain Meriwether Lewis and Captain\r\nWilliam Clark (to each other \xe2\x80\x9cMerne\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWill\xe2\x80\x9d), from Virginia and\r\nKentucky; and Sergeants John Ordway, of New Hampshire, Nathaniel Pryor\r\nand Patrick Gass; and Privates William Bratton of Captain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstate (Virginia); Alexander Willard from John Ordway\xe2\x80\x99s state, and\r\nJohn Shields, of Kentucky, the three smiths; Reuben Fields and Joseph\r\nFields, brothers, John Colter, Joseph Whitehouse, William Werner, who\r\nlike Pryor and Shields, were from Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s state, Kentucky; John\r\nCollins, of Maryland; John Thompson, the surveyor, from Indiana; Robert\r\nFrazier, of Vermont; the handsome, merry George Shannon from Ohio and\r\nPennsylvania both; George Gibson, the fiddler, Hugh McNeal, John Potts,\r\nPeter Wiser, all from the same place as Pat and George\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Pennsylvania;\r\nSilas Goodrich and Thomas Howard and Hugh Hall, of Massachusetts; Dick\r\nWindsor, said to hail also from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nPeter knew them all; fine men; but he liked Pat and George Shannon the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nThen, there were the Frenchmen: gay old Cruzatte, with his one eye and\r\nhis lively fiddle; Francois Labiche, the boatman who danced on his\r\nhead; Baptiste Lepage, who joined at the Mandan villages to take the\r\nplace of one Libert\xc3\xa9 who had run away; George Drouillard, the hunter;\r\nChaboneau and Sa-ca-ja-we-a, the Bird-woman, who was to help the\r\nparty into the mountains and make friends of the Snakes. And little\r\nToussaint, the beady-eyed baby\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95a great pet.\r\n\r\nAnd York, black, enormous York, the great medicine, whom all the\r\nIndians so highly respected.\r\n\r\nYes, this was a glorious company, from which a boy might learn much.\r\n\r\nSo, in a line, the eight boats proceeded up the Missouri, through\r\npresent North Dakota. The wind blew sometimes fair, sometimes adverse;\r\nsometimes so strong that it lifted the fine sand in dense clouds\r\nabove the river and the men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were made sore. Captain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntightly-cased watch stopped and would not run.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first week, when the night\xe2\x80\x99s camp was breaking up,\r\nfor the day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, George Shannon espied a black animal slinking\r\nthrough the grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWolf!\xe2\x80\x9d uttered Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 a black wan, for the captains\xe2\x80\x99 collection.\r\nWait till I draw a bead on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! That\xe2\x80\x99s a dog, Pat!\xe2\x80\x9d And George whistled. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t shoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe black animal crept toward George, stomach to earth, tail wagging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssiniboine dog,\xe2\x80\x9d pronounced Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cHe sled dog. Draw ze sled in\r\nwinter, an\xe2\x80\x99 ze travois\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95ze lodge pole, in summer. He from dat ol\xe2\x80\x99 camp\r\nwe see yesterday. Mus\xe2\x80\x99 be los\xe2\x80\x99, poor leetle dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s only a puppy, and nigh starved,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, patting him.\r\n\r\nSo the black shaggy little dog was taken along.\r\n\r\nThat night at camp Lepage and Chaboneau consulted together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never been up-river furder dan dees,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Baptiste. \xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ink\r\nonce I stop right at dees spot, an\xe2\x80\x99 turn back. Chaboneau, he stop once\r\n\xe2\x80\x99bout t\xe2\x80\x99ree mile below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s our own trail from here on,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke John Shields.\r\n\r\nWhere North Dakota and Montana meet, George Drouillard was sent out to\r\nexplore south up the Yellowstone River. He returned with report of many\r\nsand-bars and much coal.\r\n\r\nBeyond the mouth of the Yellowstone, in the morning of October 26,\r\nwhile the boats were slowly sailing on up the Missouri, Captain Lewis\r\nsuddenly appeared, at a clear spot on the bank, and signaled with a\r\nrifle-shot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, the cap\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s been in a hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Patrick Gass, as the\r\nboats turned in.\r\n\r\nAnd so he evidently had. He was still out of breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve killed a large white bear,\xe2\x80\x9d he panted. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of you men come and\r\nhelp Drouillard bring him down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood work, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d called Captain Clark. And enough men tumbled ashore\r\nto carry half a dozen bears.\r\n\r\nCruzatte ran, Peter ran, the Fields brothers ran; all ran. Back a few\r\nhundred yards they found Drouillard working with his knife on the\r\ncarcass of a bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Let\xe2\x80\x99s fetch him down entire, for the whole crowd to see,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nReuben Fields. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a sockdologer. Look at him, Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe not so ver\xe2\x80\x99 beeg\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but he beeg plenty,\xe2\x80\x9d averred Cruzatte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho shot him, Drouillard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe cap\xe2\x80\x99n an\xe2\x80\x99 me, both,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Drouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cDere was two. De one we\r\nwoun\xe2\x80\x99, he get away. Dis odder we woun\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 my gracious, he chase de\r\ncap\xe2\x80\x99n. He chase him seventy, eighty yard, but he bad hurt, could no run\r\nquite so fas\xe2\x80\x99 as de cap\xe2\x80\x99n. De cap\xe2\x80\x99n load hees gun while he run, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshoot again\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95bang! Bear no fall. I come, aim queeck\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95bang! Dis time\r\nbear fall. But my gracious, he ver\xe2\x80\x99 tough to keel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey dragged the huge carcass to the shore. It weighed 300 pounds.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung bear,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Drouillard. Everybody crowded about, to examine\r\nits fur (which was not white at all, but was yellowish), its long claws\r\nand tusks, its little, deep-set black eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDis chile dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered York, his own eyes popping. \xe2\x80\x9cMebbe he\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t gwine to look foh dis kind ob b\xe2\x80\x99ar. If he jes\xe2\x80\x99 a young b\xe2\x80\x99ar, what\r\nmought his daddy be? Hoo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you or the men take any chances with these animals, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncautioned Captain Lewis, to Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are lots of signs of\r\nthem now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark and Reuben Fields did take a chance, a few days later. In\r\nthe dusk they met a monster brown bear (which was a better name for it\r\nthan white bear, although grizzly bear is better still) not far from\r\nthe evening camp. When they shot together, he roared so loudly that the\r\nvery air shook, but fortunately he tried to escape. They followed him\r\nand shot him eight times more; and even then he swam clear into the\r\nmiddle of the river, and died on a sand-bar.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a job to get him into camp. He weighed about 600 pounds.\r\nThe captains measured him. From his hind feet to his nose was eight\r\nfeet, seven and a half inches; he was five feet, seven and a half\r\ninches around the chest, three feet, eleven inches around the neck, and\r\none foot, eleven inches around the fore-legs! His heart was as large as\r\nan ox-heart, and his claws four and one-half inches in length.\r\n\r\nBut William Bratton \xe2\x80\x9ccaught\xe2\x80\x9d the worst bear, to date. About five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the boats were just being landed, for night camp, when a great\r\ncrashing and shouting were heard; out from the brush burst William, and\r\nbolted, staggering and gesturing, for the nearest boat. He had lost his\r\nhat, his buckskin suit was torn, he could scarcely speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother man in a hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Patrick Gass, as everybody reached for\r\na gun. \xe2\x80\x9cInjuns, mebbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe-he-help!\xe2\x80\x9d panted William, lunging into the shallows and fairly\r\nfalling across the gunwale of the white pirogue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, man! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nWilliam heaved and gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear! White bear! Chasing me\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95close behind.\xe2\x80\x9d Puff. Puff. \xe2\x80\x9cShot\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95chased me\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95mile and a half\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95almost caught me. Look out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereabouts? Which direction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown river\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95back in brush, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go after him. Drouillard, the two\r\nFields, Willard, Potts, Shields, Pryor, come with me. Bratton\xe2\x80\x99s found\r\nanother bear. Want to go, York?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNossuh, nossuh!\xe2\x80\x9d asserted York, with decisive emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\ngo mighty well, Marse Merne, but I got to stay right hyah an\xe2\x80\x99 take keer\r\nob Marse Will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAway hastened Captain Lewis and the seven men. All eyes scanned the\r\nshore, and many tongues plied the exhausted hunter with questions.\r\nHe said that after shooting the bear he had run a mile and a half,\r\nwith the bear roaring and floundering behind him, but unable quite to\r\novertake him because of its wound.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour back came the hunting party, into camp\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Alec Willard\r\nand John Shields, who were the two largest members, weighted down with\r\nan enormous hide and a great quantity of fat.\r\n\r\nThey all said that after following Bratton\xe2\x80\x99s trail back, for a mile,\r\nthey had come upon the bloody trail of the bear. He had turned aside\r\nand had gone another mile, until he had stopped, to dig a hole or bed\r\ntwo feet deep and five feet long. There they had killed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he ought to\xe2\x80\x99ve been dead long before,\xe2\x80\x9d declared John Shields.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBratton had shot him straight through the chest. He was a tough one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, as the cap\xe2\x80\x99n says, it\xe2\x80\x99s safer to fight two Injuns together than\r\nwan white b\xe2\x80\x99ar by hisself,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed Pat.\r\n\r\nThe fat of this bear yielded eight gallons of oil, for greasing the\r\nguns and keeping the men\xe2\x80\x99s hair slick.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after, six of the men had a pitched battle with\r\nanother bear. He put them all to flight\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95almost caught several of them;\r\nand did not fall until he had been shot eight times. And while this was\r\ngoing on at the shore, Cruzatte\xe2\x80\x99s canoe, out in the stream, narrowly\r\nescaped a fatal upset.\r\n\r\nA gust of wind struck the sail, while Chaboneau was steering.\r\nChaboneau lost his head, dropped the oar, began to cry aloud with\r\nfright. The canoe tilted, tilted, water flowed in\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and over on its side\r\nturned the boat. The sail\xe2\x80\x99s rope had been jerked out of Cruzatte\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeize de rudder, Toussaint! Ketch de rope\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95queeck! Pull on de sail!\r\nWe all drown! Do de right t\xe2\x80\x99ing or I shoot you!\xe2\x80\x9d ordered Cruzatte,\r\nscrambling along the gunwale.\r\n\r\nOnly young Sa-ca-ja-we-a was calm. Holding her baby, she reached right\r\nand left and gathered the articles that were floating off. In a moment\r\nmore the canoe righted, but was full of water. Baling and rowing, the\r\nmen got her beached just in time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat stupid Chaboneau! Hees wife is better man dan heem,\xe2\x80\x9d scolded\r\nDrouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cHe near los\xe2\x80\x99 all de fine instruments an\xe2\x80\x99 de papers of the\r\ncaptains. Mebbe drown ever\xe2\x80\x99body, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs it was, a great deal of medicine had been spoiled by the soaking.\r\n\r\nThe six victors over the one bear brought him in at last. Because of\r\nthe battle, this place was known as Brown-bear-defeated Creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nWHICH WAY TO THE COLUMBIA?\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWirrah, but tired I am!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Patrick Gass.\r\n\r\nIt was June 3, and in the nineteen days they had come more than 300\r\nmiles from Brown-bear-defeated Creek. What with the constant wading and\r\ntugging to conquer the narrow, swift current and the strong head winds,\r\nwell might all groan.\r\n\r\nNight alarms had disturbed the camps. Once the men had been aroused\r\nonly just in time to drag the captains\xe2\x80\x99 hide lodge away from a spot\r\nupon which a burning tree was about to fall; and, again, a stupid\r\nbuffalo bull had charged through, and only the little black dog had\r\nsaved the camp from much damage.\r\n\r\nBut the Rock or Shining Mountains were nearer. On Sunday a week ago\r\nCaptain Lewis, climbing a hill, had seen them, to the west. The\r\nSho-sho-nes or Snake Indians might be expected any day. Their country\r\nwas near, also.\r\n\r\nNow the river had split: one branch for the north, one for the\r\nsouthward; and the captains did not know which branch to follow. So\r\nthey ordered camp here at the forks, below present Fort Benton in north\r\ncentral Montana.\r\n\r\nA travel-worn camp it was, too\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95of bearded, long-haired men, their\r\nbuckskin and elk-hide suits shriveled by water, their moccasins in\r\ntatters, their hands blistered and their feet sore from rocks and the\r\nprickly-pear cactus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe nort\xe2\x80\x99 branch\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95she de true Missouri,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted old Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cSee\r\nhow swift an\xe2\x80\x99 muddy she is, jus\xe2\x80\x99 like de Missouri. Ain\xe2\x80\x99 dat so,\r\nDrouillard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrouillard nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sartin she true Missouri. I lif on Missouri most my life, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nknow. De odder stream too clear an\xe2\x80\x99 smooth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that very r\xe2\x80\x99ason it comes out o\xe2\x80\x99 the Rock Mountains, \xe2\x80\x99cordin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto the cap\xe2\x80\x99ns,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 the bed of it be round stones, the\r\nsame as are fetched down out o\xe2\x80\x99 the mountains. Not but what I favor\r\nthe north branch myself, as the more likely direction. We\xe2\x80\x99ll find the\r\nColumby across to the north, an\xe2\x80\x99 not to the south, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Minnetarees down at the Mandan town told us the Missouri was\r\nclear, at its head, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d queried George Shannon. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\r\nare some big falls to pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMebbe de nort\xe2\x80\x99 branch get clear, in leetle time,\xe2\x80\x9d argued Drouillard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe de true Missouri, for de Columby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui. So t\xe2\x80\x99ink we all,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Cruzatte and Chaboneau and Lepage and\r\nLabiche. \xe2\x80\x9cDe odder branch go too far sout\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the opinion of the majority of the men. But\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be might careful,\xe2\x80\x9d argued George. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Missouri and the\r\nColumbia are supposed to head right near each other, the one on this\r\nside the mountains, the other on \xe2\x80\x99tother side. It would be a bad mess\r\nif we crossed and found we were in the wrong place. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t any time\r\nto lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvidently so thought the captains. For the next day Captain Lewis took\r\nDrouillard, Sergeant Nat Pryor and several others, to explore by foot\r\nup the north fork. Captain Clark took Chaboneau, Sergeant Pat and\r\nseveral others, to explore up the south fork. Peter and the rest of the\r\nmen remained at camp, together with Sa-ca-ja-we-a and little Toussaint.\r\n\r\nThis gave them the opportunity to sit in their bare feet, mend their\r\nmoccasins and leggins, and pick green wild currants and ripe wild\r\ngooseberries. Sa-ca-ja-we-a, who was always busy, dressed a doe-skin\r\nfor herself and little Toussaint.\r\n\r\nThe Captain Clark party returned on the third day, in the rain. They\r\nhad gone up along the south branch about forty miles\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95had walked about\r\n100 miles, all told, said Pat, with a wry face and a limp; Reuben had\r\nbeen chased so shrewdly by a big bear, after his gun had missed fire,\r\nthat in climbing a tree he kicked the bear\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and as nobody could\r\nget to the tree the bear had kept Reuben there for an hour; rain and\r\nsnow both had made the trip uncomfortable\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but the river appeared to\r\nlead west of south, and the captain was convinced that it was the true\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the commandin\xe2\x80\x99 officer; still I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, for the other river\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x99asier. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\nsail in a boat than on foot, any day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you sight any falls, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Joe Fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiver a fall\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but I felt some,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis was yet out. He and his party did not return this\r\nevening, nor the next day; and on the following day everybody was\r\nworried about them. But that afternoon at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock they came\r\ntoiling in, hungry, soaked with the cold rain, and weary after a five\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 tramp of 120 miles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Captain Clark, his face\r\nlighting up amidst his thick red hair and shaggy red beard. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nnews?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been along the north fork sixty miles and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t head toward\r\nany mountains. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s the Missouri, although Drouillard\r\ninsists it must be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so, either, Merne. The south fork looks the better of\r\nthe two, to me.\xe2\x80\x9d And they paced together to their lodge.\r\n\r\nIt was a cheery crowd, in spite of the dangers and discomforts and the\r\nhard work. That evening the sky had cleared, there was a big supper of\r\nvenison, the feet of the men who had stayed in camp were about well,\r\nand Cruzatte tuned up his fiddle for a dance.\r\n\r\nToward noon of the next day, Sunday, June 9, a parade was ordered,\r\nto hear what the captains had decided. The men left their tasks\r\nof dressing skins and repairing weapons, and fell in, under their\r\nsergeants.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis stood straight and slim before them, in his fringed but\r\nstained buckskin suit. His bright hair was tied in a queue behind, and\r\nhe, like Captain Clark, had grown a beard\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95yellow as his hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Clark and I have consulted together, men,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\nexamined our maps, and compared our notes; and we believe that the\r\nsouthern fork is the true Missouri. It has all the signs of a mountain\r\nstream, the Indians never have mentioned passing any south fork in\r\norder to proceed on to the great falls, and this south fork certainly\r\nbears off for those snowy mountains to the southwest which are\r\nundoubtedly the Rock Mountains that divide the waters of the Missouri\r\nand the Columbia. Accordingly we will take the south fork. That we have\r\nchosen as the Missouri; the north fork I have had the honor to entitle\r\nMaria\xe2\x80\x99s River, as a tribute to my cousin in Virginia, Miss Maria Wood,\r\nof Charlottesville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to hear from any of the men, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Captain\r\nClark. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of them may have an opinion to offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they favor the north fork, I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the captain,\r\nwith a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to hear what they may say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho was to speak? Patrick Gass, of course. Pat coughed, and saluted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Sergeant? Go ahead. Speak up, man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this way, sorr\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Captain, sorr. Yez are the commandin\xe2\x80\x99 officers\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95ye\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Clark, an\xe2\x80\x99 if yez say the south fork be the Missouri, o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncourse the Missouri it is, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll all follow yez, sorr. Sure, all\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of, sorr, is that we get down yonder at the foot o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nsnowy mountains, an\xe2\x80\x99 on the other side there won\xe2\x80\x99t be anny C\xe2\x80\x99lumby at\r\nall, sorr. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll go with yez, sorr, if that\xe2\x80\x99s where yez go. Thank\r\nyez, sorr.\xe2\x80\x9d And Patrick saluted again, quite out of breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Clark and I will take the responsibility. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try the south\r\nfork, men,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cParade is dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThray cheers for the captains, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Patrick Gass. And as the\r\nparade broke, into the air was flung every cap and hat and every voice\r\nrang true.\r\n\r\nImmediately preparations were begun. The heavy baggage and the extra\r\nsupplies were to be left here, and so was one of the pirogues. Men\r\nwere set at work digging a large hole in which to store the goods. It\r\nwas to be kettle shaped\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95small at the top, then hollowed out, round,\r\nuntil it was six or seven feet deep. The soil was dumped upon blankets\r\nand robes, and thrown into the river, so that there should be no trace\r\nof any digging, lest the Indians find and rob. The bottom and sides\r\nwere to be lined with dry brush and hides, to keep the moisture from\r\nthe goods. The storehouse was called a _cache_, from the French word,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_cacher_,\xe2\x80\x9d to conceal.\r\n\r\nThe red pirogue was to be hidden on an island at the mouth of Maria\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nJohn Shields, the blacksmith, and Alec Willard worked at bellows and\r\nforge, repairing tools and spontoons; and William Bratton repaired\r\nbroken guns.\r\n\r\nHowever, the captains were still cautious regarding the right route to\r\nstrike the Columbia on the other side of the mountains; and early the\r\nnext morning, June 11, Captain Lewis took Drouillard, John Shields,\r\nGeorge Gibson and Si Goodrich, to scout ahead up that south fork. He\r\npromised to send back word to Captain Clark, who was to follow, with\r\nthe boats and party, as soon as the cache was completed.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the twelfth the white pirogue and the six canoes\r\nheaded up the south fork, before a fair wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re off,\xe2\x80\x9d exulted Sergeant Pat.\r\n\r\nEverybody was in high spirits\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95everybody except Chaboneau and\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSa-ca-ja-we-a she seeck,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what is\r\nmatter. Mebbe stomick, or mebbe she ketch col\xe2\x80\x99 in all dat rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, the little sixteen-year-old Bird-woman was feeling very ill. Now\r\nfor almost a thousand miles she had carried baby Toussaint, had tended\r\nthe lodge fire and done other Indian woman work; sometimes she had been\r\nwet, frequently cold and foot-sore, but she never had complained or\r\nlagged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must let her rest, Chaboneau,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Clark, that evening\r\nat camp. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep her in bed. York, you look after her. Never mind me.\r\nMake her some broth. Peter, you help her with little Toussaint. Hold\r\nhim, if she\xe2\x80\x99ll let you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Peter took charge of baby Toussaint\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95who really was a very good\r\nbaby. He rarely cried, and even rarely smiled. He lay in his swathings\r\nof skins and stared with his bright black eyes.\r\n\r\nThe day had been an easy one for nobody. The river soon had run\r\nswiftly; it was broken with many sand-bars and gravel-bars, and by\r\nboulders upon which several times the canoes almost capsized.\r\n\r\nThe next day\xe2\x80\x99s voyage was as bad, and worse. Snow mountains appeared\r\non the south as well as at the west. There were numerous islands, more\r\nshoals and boulders, and the tow-lines were used. Sa-ca-ja-we-a, lying\r\non a couch of skins in the white pirogue, had not improved. She moaned,\r\nand tossed, and babbled strange words. Peter and York watched over her\r\nand the baby, although occasionally York had to tumble out and haul on\r\nthe tow-line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Captain Clark, that night, gazing, non-plussed, at\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a, who did not recognize him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t lose our little\r\nBird-woman. She\xe2\x80\x99s to be our guide to her own people, so that they\r\nwill show us the way across the mountains. In fact, the fate of the\r\nexpedition may depend upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ver\xe2\x80\x99 worried,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cNever see her dees way before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day the rapids were more severe. Wading breast-deep in the\r\ncold water and slipping on the rocky bottom, the men scarcely could\r\nhaul the boats against the current. All the morning was consumed in\r\nmaking six miles. Just at noon, when halt was ordered, for dinner, a\r\nfigure was seen, ahead, hurrying down along the banks.\r\n\r\nIt was John Shields, from Captain Lewis. As he approached, he swung his\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah, boys!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all right. This is the trail. The\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s found the falls!\xe2\x80\x9d He came panting and puffing into camp.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the true Missouri.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far up are the falls, Shields?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Captain Clark, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout twenty miles, sir. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t get to them with boats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd that was so. The next day the rapids of the river were more\r\nfurious, and the men were constantly dodging rattlesnakes on the banks.\r\nShields was sent ahead to tell Captain Lewis that the party were on\r\ntheir way. Captain Clark ordered a noon halt near a large spring of\r\nsulphur water, to wait for Captain Lewis. The roaring of the falls had\r\nalready been heard above the noise of the river.\r\n\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a was carried to the sulphur spring. She drank quantities\r\nof it and soon felt much better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow be very careful what she eats, Chaboneau,\xe2\x80\x9d warned Captain Clark.\r\n\r\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock Captain Lewis arrived from above. He was enthusiastic\r\nover the falls, but he had had several narrow escapes from death,\r\naccording to Drouillard.\r\n\r\nHe had been seriously ill, and only choke-cherry tea had cured him.\r\nWhen he had neglected to reload his rifle after shooting a buffalo, a\r\nhuge \xe2\x80\x9cwhite bear\xe2\x80\x9d had charged him, driven him into the river, but had\r\nretreated before the captain\xe2\x80\x99s leveled pike or spontoon. That same\r\nday three buffalo bulls at once had run at him, heads down, until he\r\nfortunately had turned on them, whereat they also turned. And that\r\nnight he slept with a rattlesnake over four feet long coiled on a log\r\njust above his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ink de cap\xe2\x80\x99n haf plenty excitement, in one day,\xe2\x80\x9d declared\r\nDrouillard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nSEEKING THE BIRD-WOMAN\xe2\x80\x99S PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a series of five falls, said Captain Lewis, connected by\r\ncataracts; and in the top of a tall cottonwood tree on an island at\r\nthe foot of the uppermost fall an eagle had built her nest. The lowest\r\nfall was only five miles above the camp; but the boats would have to be\r\ncarried around all the falls.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark took some of the men, to explore across country, from the\r\ncamp to the head of the falls, and stake the best route for the portage\r\nor carry.\r\n\r\nA big cottonwood tree near camp was cut down. Its trunk was twenty-two\r\ninches through, and cross-sections were sawed off, to supply wheels\r\nfor wagons on which the boats should be loaded. The mast of the white\r\npirogue was brought ashore, for wagon axles. The white pirogue was\r\nhidden in some willows, and a hole was started, as another cache where\r\nmore goods were to be left.\r\n\r\nThe men were told to double-sole their moccasins, because the\r\nprickly-pear cactus grew thickly all along the line of march. And\r\nhunters were sent out, to get meat and skins.\r\n\r\nThe captain had fixed upon a spot above the upper fall, opposite\r\nseveral islands, for the end of the portage. It was eighteen miles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d commented black York, shaking his woolly head dubiously. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nmonster white b\xe2\x80\x99ar done hab dat place already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor York had been chased clear into camp by a bear; and when the\r\ncaptain had taken three men and gone out to find the bear it had driven\r\nanother of the hunters, John Collins, into the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice quiet place to camp,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Dick Windsor.\r\n\r\nA quantity of the baggage and one canoe were loaded upon one of the\r\nlittle wagons, and led by the two captains, the men ranged themselves\r\nbefore and behind, to haul and push. Away they went, with the wagon\r\njolting and creaking, and threatening to fall apart.\r\n\r\nChaboneau and York and Peter had been left here at Portage Creek to\r\ncare for Sa-ca-ja-we-a again. The Bird-woman had improved so much that\r\nshe was able to walk about\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but thereupon she had eaten a lot of dried\r\nfish and little ground apples (_pomme blanc_: white apple, Chaboneau\r\ncalled it), which had made her ill once more and also had made the\r\ncaptains very angry at Chaboneau and at Peter too. The Bird-woman was\r\nhard to control; she thought she ought to eat, to get well.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Captain Clark came back down with all the men except\r\nSergeant Pat, Joe Fields and John Shields, after another load. The\r\nwagon had broken on the trip up, and they had had to carry the baggage\r\nhalf a mile on their backs. They were very tired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat cactus so bad it steeck my moccasin to my feets,\xe2\x80\x9d complained\r\nCruzatte.\r\n\r\nThere was quite a bit of news, time to time, from the White-bear\r\nIslands camp, where Patrick Gass and a few other men under Captain\r\nLewis stayed to cover the frame of an iron canoe with skins. The bears\r\nwere bad. Joe Fields had met three at once and had been chased into the\r\nriver; had fallen, cut his hand and knee on the rocks and bent his gun.\r\nDrouillard and Reuben Fields had climbed a tree, and from it Drouillard\r\nhad killed a bear with one shot through the head. The bear\xe2\x80\x99s nose was\r\nas large as an ox\xe2\x80\x99s, his front foot measured nine inches wide, his\r\nhind foot measured nearly twelve inches long, not counting the claws.\r\nThat same night another bear entered the camp and carried away some of\r\nthe buffalo meat. The little black dog was kept busy all the nights,\r\ngrowling and barking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDose islands full of bear,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cI never know bear so\r\nmean. Mebbe if we don\xe2\x80\x99 go in dere an\xe2\x80\x99 clean dem out, dey eat some of\r\nus. I sleep on my gun de whole night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne good thing: that pesky swivel\xe2\x80\x99s been cached at the foot of the\r\nfirst falls,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Robert Frazier. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have to lug a cannon\r\naround any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the last of June all the stuff had been moved from Portage Creek.\r\nBut there had been a rain, making the trail soft; so part of the final\r\ntwo wagon-loads was dumped about four miles on the way, and camp was\r\nmade, with the rest, at Willow Run Creek, two miles further along,\r\ninland from the Great Falls.\r\n\r\nIn the morning everybody except Captain Clark, York, Peter, and the\r\nChaboneau family went back, with one of the two carts, to bring on the\r\nbaggage that had been left behind on the plain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Sa-ca-ja-we-a like to see the Great Falls?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\ncaptain, kindly.\r\n\r\nThe little Bird-woman grinned at the Red Head\xe2\x80\x99s notice of her. He was,\r\nto her, a big chief. Of course she would like to see the wonders of\r\nthis medicine river that roared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ink I like to see, myself,\xe2\x80\x9d ventured Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cI been so busy I\r\nsee notting yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd that was so, not only with Chaboneau, but with others of the men;\r\nfor the Portage Creek end of the trail was below the falls and the\r\nWhite-bear Islands end was above the falls, and the trail itself cut\r\nacross several miles from the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go over, while the baggage is being brought up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncaptain. \xe2\x80\x9cYork, you come if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d He surveyed Peter\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95anxious\r\nPeter. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to detail you to guard the baggage here. You\r\nmust be a soldier. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lend you my pistol. You won\xe2\x80\x99t need to use it.\r\nBut keep the stuff spread out to dry. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be back soon. It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthree or four miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAway they hastened, the Bird-woman carrying small Toussaint in a net\r\non her back. Watching them go, Peter gulped. Was he never to see the\r\nroaring falls? Still, he felt proud to be left on guard, like any\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nHow hot and sultry was the morning! All the landscape of rock and\r\nprickly pear and low stiff brush lay smothering, and no sound was to be\r\nheard save the dull booming of the river, unseen in the north. Peter\r\nsat down, in the shade of the baggage on the wagon.\r\n\r\nPresently a black cloud welled over the crests of the shining snow\r\nmountains in the west. More rain? Peter watched it vigilantly. It grew\r\nswiftly, and rolled into mid-sky. Peter rose with haste and covered the\r\nbaggage with buffalo hides again. It was a fearful looking cloud, as it\r\nbellied and muttered, and let fall a dense veil.\r\n\r\nOn swept the veil, hanging from the cloud; under the wagon crept Peter.\r\nA moment more\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and whish! crackle! r-r-r-r-r-r! Wind! Rain! Hail! The\r\nair turned black! Such wind! Such rain! But such hail!!\r\n\r\nListen to the shouts! See! The party sent for the baggage were legging\r\nto camp! They had left, trudging gaily, laughing and gamboling and\r\nstripped to the waist, because of the heat and the work ahead. And here\r\nthey were, a confused crowd, heads down, naked shoulders high, beating\r\nthrough the storm for shelter while the fierce hail lashed their skins.\r\n\r\nIt was rather funny\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and it was serious, too. The hail pelted like\r\ngrape-shot; some of the hailstones were as large as Peter\xe2\x80\x99s fist. Ah!\r\nOne-eyed Cruzatte was down. He could not see very well, anyway, and\r\nthe hail had knocked him flat and sprawling. Down were George Gibson\r\nand John Potts, and Nat Pryor\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95only, all, to stagger to their feet and\r\nlurch onward again.\r\n\r\nIn charged the crowd, blinded and bleeding, to dive frenziedly\r\nunderneath the wagon, or to grab right and left for shirts and robes,\r\nand crouch, gasping but covered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ought I was knock\xe2\x80\x99 dead,\xe2\x80\x9d panted old Cruzatte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel as though I\xe2\x80\x99d had a lickin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d panted William Werner.\r\n\r\nThe hail was followed by a furious deluge of rain. The sky cleared\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and\r\nhere came the captain and squad. What a sight they were, not only\r\ndrenched, but muddy from head to feet. They had been caught in a\r\nravine, near the Great Falls, where they had sought the protection of\r\nshelf-rock. But in a twinkling the ravine had filled with water\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95a\r\nrushing mass carrying stones and drift-wood. They tried to climb. The\r\nwater rose almost as fast as they climbed. The captain and Chaboneau\r\nhelped the Bird-woman. She lost her net, but saved little Toussaint.\r\nThe captain lost his compass and an umbrella that he had carried;\r\nChaboneau lost his gun and bullet-pouch and tomahawk. York was up on\r\nthe plain hunting buffalo, and although badly bruised, fared the best\r\nof anybody, except Peter. So, after all, Peter was satisfied that he\r\nhad not been along.\r\n\r\nWillow Run had risen six feet, and now was impassable. Because of that,\r\nand the mud, two more days were required, to take all the baggage into\r\nthe White-bear Islands camp.\r\n\r\nThat evening, July 2, the captains ordered an attack on the largest\r\nisland, ruled by a king of the white bears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, they\xe2\x80\x99re so sassy we got to tache \xe2\x80\x99em a lesson,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Pat.\r\n\r\nBut although the island was thoroughly searched, by all hands,\r\nincluding Peter, only one bear fell. Drouillard shot him through the\r\nheart as he was charging, and he died without doing any damage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave ye seen the falls, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Pat, of Peter, the next morning.\r\nPeter shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, nayther have I,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen workin\xe2\x80\x99 too hard\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95an\xe2\x80\x99 so\xe2\x80\x99ve ye. But with the permission of the\r\ncommandin\xe2\x80\x99 officers we\xe2\x80\x99ll jest take a day off, b\xe2\x80\x99gorry, an\xe2\x80\x99 make a tour\r\nof inspection. We\xe2\x80\x99ll lave the other lads to finish the iron boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd inspect the falls they did, from end to end. It was a marvelous\r\nspectacle\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95ten miles of rush and roar and spray and foam. The eagle\r\nwas on her nest in the top of the lone cottonwood on the island. The\r\nIndians at the Mandan and Minnetaree villages had said there would be\r\nan eagle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 ten thousand buff\xe2\x80\x99lo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sergeant Pat, surveying from the\r\nbrink of one of the falls. \xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand grazin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 another thousand\r\ndrowned in the rapids. Sure, they\xe2\x80\x99re bein\xe2\x80\x99 carried down like chips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the south and west and north were the mountains, those to the\r\nnorthward snowy, those to the southward more bare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 those are the wans we have to cross, I reckon,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Patrick.\r\n\r\nBut the iron boat did not prove a success. After days of labor at\r\ndressing skins, both elk and buffalo, and stretching them over the\r\nframe, and cementing the seams with a mixture of beeswax, buffalo\r\ntallow and pounded charcoal, she leaked so that she had to be taken\r\napart again and buried.\r\n\r\nSo Captain Clark, with most of the men, went out in search of trees\r\nfrom which canoes might be hollowed; and it was the middle of July\r\nbefore the expedition was fairly on its way again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be lucky if we reach the Paycific before winter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nremarked Sergeant Pat.\r\n\r\nThe river led southwest, toward the mountains. It grew swifter and\r\nshallower, and was frequently broken by islands. There were days of\r\narduous wading, hauling, struggling, sometimes in rain and hail, and\r\nagain in the hot sun with the thermometer at eighty and above.\r\n\r\nThe mosquitoes and flies bothered. The shores grew rougher, and higher,\r\nuntil at one spot the river boiled down, 150 paces wide, through a gap\r\nin solid cliffs 1200 feet high, black granite below, creamy yellow\r\nabove. The channel was too deep for wading, or for the poles; and the\r\nboats were rowed, a few inches at a time, with the oars. This gap was\r\nnamed the Gate of the Mountains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you we\xe2\x80\x99d find a gate,\xe2\x80\x9d reminded Pat, to Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cNow what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninside, an\xe2\x80\x99 where be the Snakes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor this was the Sho-sho-ne country, at last. The Sho-sho-nes were\r\nhorse Indians. The captains counted on getting horses from them, and\r\nleaving the canoes. The firing of guns was limited, lest the Snakes\r\nshould hear and be alarmed. Indian trails and abandoned camps were\r\npassed. The snowy range of the Shining Mountains was nearer, in the\r\nwest. Captain Clark took Chaboneau and Joe Fields and York and John\r\nPotts, and set out ahead, by land, to find some Indians, if possible.\r\n\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a began to remark familiar places, where she and other\r\nSho-sho-ne women had been, before she was captured by the Minnetarees.\r\nNow little flags were hoisted on the canoes, to tell the Sho-sho-nes\r\nthat the United States soldiers were coming in peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon de river make t\xe2\x80\x99ree forks, Sa-ca-ja-we-a say,\xe2\x80\x9d informed old\r\nCruzatte, at the evening camp after Captain Clark had been gone almost\r\nnine days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 which is the trail then, I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d mused Sergeant Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cSure we\r\nought to be crossin\xe2\x80\x99 the mountains before we get much furder south.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s near August, already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt breakfast time the next morning, July 27, the crew hauling the\r\nleading boat against the stiff current suddenly cheered, frightened the\r\nbig-horn sheep that had been following along the tops of the cliffs\r\nand peeping over curiously, watching the strange white men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Sho-sho-nes!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Lepage, who was on the line of the second\r\nboat, wherein Peter sat, fending with an oar. This was Peter\xe2\x80\x99s job,\r\nwhen the current was very swift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered the men all.\r\n\r\nEverybody expected to see Captain Clark waiting with some of the\r\nSnakes. But the first crew had not cheered because of any Indians.\r\nThey had cheered because the cliffs ceased, and now there extended\r\na broadly-rolling green meadow-land rimmed about with high mountain\r\nranges white and gray. The mountains closed in behind, on the east and\r\nnorth and west; and the meadow lay before, on the east and south and\r\nwest. All lovely it looked in the sunrise.\r\n\r\nFirst, a river came in on the left, from the southeast. While breakfast\r\nwas being cooked Captain Lewis, climbing a rocky outcrop on the bank of\r\nthis river, saw, beyond, two other forks\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95a middle fork and a southwest\r\nfork, where the Missouri again split.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Three Forks, Sa-ca-ja-we-a?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\nThe Bird-woman nodded, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll breakfast and go on to those upper forks, men,\xe2\x80\x9d informed the\r\ncaptain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may find word there from Captain Clark, as to which is the\r\nbetter. Sa-ca-ja-we-a doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they proceeded. But deserted lay the meadow-land. However, at the\r\njuncture of those forks was found a note, stuck in a cleft pole planted\r\non the bank. Captain Clark said that the southwest fork was the better.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis ordered camp made a short distance up this fork, until\r\nCaptain Clark should return. Right glad were all, including Peter, to\r\nrest awhile; eat, sleep, mend the tow-ropes and repair moccasins, and\r\nkill meat.\r\n\r\nThe Bird-woman was especially delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe say here on dis spot is where de Snake camp was surprise\xe2\x80\x99 by de\r\nMinnetaree, five year ago, an\xe2\x80\x99 chase\xe2\x80\x99 into de timber. De Minnetaree\r\nkeel four warrior, an\xe2\x80\x99 capture four boys an\xe2\x80\x99 all de women,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\r\nDrouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cSa-ca-ja-we-a was capture\xe2\x80\x99, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat noon Captain Clark returned, with Chaboneau, Joe Fields, John\r\nPotts and York. They had not seen a single Indian; but they had had\r\na hard tramp. Chaboneau\xe2\x80\x99s feet had given out several times, and the\r\ncaptain was sick. He thought that he had drunk too much cold water\r\nwhile he was hot.\r\n\r\nThe first fork was named Gallatin\xe2\x80\x99s River, in honor of the secretary\r\nof the treasury of the United States. The middle fork was named\r\nMadison River, in honor of James Madison, the secretary of state, at\r\nWashington. But the southwest fork was named the Jefferson, in honor of\r\nthe President himself.\r\n\r\nThe two captains agreed that the Jefferson River was the main fork of\r\nthe Missouri; and up the Jefferson they all went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArrah!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 how d\xe2\x80\x99ye like it, Peter? Bad cess to that\r\nBird-woman. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say we\xe2\x80\x99d meet her people, an\xe2\x80\x99 where be they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose Snakes are a wandering tribe, Pat,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sergeant Pryor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Sa-ca-ja-we-a hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been here since she was a girl, five years\r\nago, remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sa-ca-ja-we-a was remembering. This was her home country. She\r\npointed out a high shoulder of rock not far from the river, to the\r\nwest, and exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat she say is w\xe2\x80\x99at ze Snakes call ze Beaver\xe2\x80\x99s Head,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\r\nChaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cZe Snakes spen\xe2\x80\x99 deir summer \xe2\x80\x99cross ze mountains jes\xe2\x80\x99 ze\r\nodder side, an\xe2\x80\x99 she t\xe2\x80\x99ink some sure to be on dis side, too. She t\xe2\x80\x99ink\r\nwe meet some of dem on dees river, furder up a leetle way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow I\xe2\x80\x99m going in yonder and not come back till I find the Snakes\r\nand their horses, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast Captain Lewis resolutely slung his knapsack\r\non his back, donned his cocked hat, and with Drouillard, John Shields\r\nand Hugh McNeal, struck into the west.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep traveling up river, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d he directed, as last word. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay\r\nout this time till I find Indians and horses. You won\xe2\x80\x99t see me again,\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was August 9. For a week the canoes were hauled and pushed on up\r\nthe crooked, rapid Jefferson, with never a word from the search party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll all be turnin\xe2\x80\x99 into fishes,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cMe toes are webbed\r\nlike a beaver\xe2\x80\x99s, already. Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s an awful empty country; an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthray thousand miles from home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn August 16 they approached where the river forked once more. It was\r\nalways forking, decided Peter. Before, not many miles, was a gap in the\r\nmountain range. The river seemed to lead for the gap. Were they going\r\nto follow it in? And then where would they be? The trees were ceasing.\r\nThere were only three in sight. What would the camps do for wood? Ahead\r\nwere brush and rocks; and this night the camp fires were made from\r\nwillow branches. Whew, but the water was cold\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the source of the river\r\nevidently was near, in the melting snow.\r\n\r\nThe river doubled in a great curve, before it reached the forks.\r\nCaptain Clark had sent Reuben Fields and George Shannon ahead, to the\r\nforks, but they reported no news. In the morning he set out, with\r\nChaboneau and Sa-ca-ja-we-a, to walk across the bend, while the boats\r\nwere hauled around by way of the river.\r\n\r\nAs all were hauling and puffing, somebody cried aloud. It was Sergeant\r\nOrdway, on the foremost rope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d he bade. \xe2\x80\x9cThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s sighted something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Sa-ca-ja-we-a! Has she gone crazy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cTis the Injuns they\xe2\x80\x99re meetin\xe2\x80\x99. I see\r\nsome on horseback. Hooray! Heave, lads, on the lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Sa-ca-ja-we-a had run ahead of the captain\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95she was dancing\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95back\r\nshe ran to him, and danced about him, her fingers in her mouth. Little\r\nToussaint bobbed in his net.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe suck her finger,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed old Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cDat mean she see her\r\nown peoples! Now she point. Dere dey come, on de hoss. Hooray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChaboneau swings his cap! The captain makes the peace sign!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrinds, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d croaked Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cHeave, now; heave on the lines, or\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll get away from yez!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow the men tugged, even Peter laying his weight sturdily to the rope.\r\nYonder, ahead to the left, inside the curve (and a long, vexatious\r\ncurve it was), half a dozen Indians were galloping for the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsquad. They met Sa-ca-ja-we-a first, then Chaboneau, then the captain;\r\nall mingled together. The Indians were singing and prancing, and taking\r\nthe captain up toward the forks. One jumped to earth and made the\r\ncaptain sit the horse. Hooray!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a village beyant,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cHeave, lads, or else we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndreamin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see Drouillard dere, with dose Injuns,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Labiche, whose eyes\r\nwere keen. \xe2\x80\x9cHe dress jes\xe2\x80\x99 like Injun. I guess he trade clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeave, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian camp grew plainer, as the boats rounded the curve. More\r\nIndians were flocking out, afoot and ahorse. Sa-ca-ja-we-a and another\r\nwoman had rushed together; they were hugging each other. But before\r\nthe canoes could arrive at the bank, the captain and Chaboneau and\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a had disappeared into a large willow lodge and most of the\r\nIndians had flowed in after.\r\n\r\nHugh McNeal met the boats, at the landing, and he had a long story to\r\ntell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nHORSES AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they Snakes, Hugh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course. But we put in the dag-gonedest time you ever saw,\r\ncatchin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Hugh. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst we had \xe2\x80\x99em, then we didn\xe2\x80\x99t, next\r\nthey had us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that around your neck? Where\xe2\x80\x99s your hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, ye look like a Borneo ape,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pat.\r\n\r\nHugh almost blushed through his coat of tan and whiskers. He was\r\nbare-headed, and about his neck was a curious object like a tippet or\r\nboa. In fact, it was very similar to the fur boas worn by women of\r\nto-day. One end was a nose and eyes, the other end was a tail; and all\r\nalong the edge dangled small rolls of white fur sewed to a white band\r\nand hanging eighteen inches long\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95forming a kind of tassel cloak. The\r\ncollar itself was brown otter, the border and tassels were ermine. But\r\nit was an odd-looking rig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks,\xe2\x80\x9d apologized Hugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWe traded clothes with the Injuns, to show\r\ngood feelin\xe2\x80\x99. The other fellow\xe2\x80\x99s wearin\xe2\x80\x99 my hat. Shields traded his\r\nshirt, too. The chief\xe2\x80\x99s got on the captain\xe2\x80\x99s cocked hat. And you ought\r\nto see Drouillard. He\xe2\x80\x99s painted, to boot. With all that, we had a\r\nnarrow squeak, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far you been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAcross the mountains, boys, to the Columby side. We followed up the\r\nMissouri, through yonder gap, till it got so small I stood with one\r\nfoot on each bank. And we went on over, up an Injun trail. Where the\r\nwaters flowed west we drank of the Columby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you meet any Injuns on this side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he did. On the third day out, the captain had sighted an Indian,\r\nthrough his spy-glass. The Indian was horseback, and looked as though\r\nhe might be a Snake. But when the captain, calling \xe2\x80\x9cTabba bone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmeaning, in Sho-sho-ne, \xe2\x80\x9cwhite man,\xe2\x80\x9d and stripping back his sleeve\r\nto show his white skin, was just about to talk with the Indian, John\r\nShields foolishly came in and the Indian galloped away. The captain\r\ngave John a proper \xe2\x80\x9cdressing down,\xe2\x80\x9d for this.\r\n\r\nA number of horse tracks were seen, and the captain kept on advancing,\r\nfollowing a sort of a road, into the mountains. He ordered a United\r\nStates flag to be carried, on a pole. Next, two squaws were frightened,\r\nand ran away\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but only a mile on, down the road, an old woman and a\r\nyoung woman and a little girl were discovered, on a sudden, digging\r\nroots. The young woman ran, but the old woman and the little girl\r\nsquatted and covered their heads, expecting to be killed.\r\n\r\nThe captain raised them up and gave them presents, and got Drouillard\r\nto talk with them in sign language. The young woman came back; and\r\nafter the captain had painted the cheeks of the three with vermilion,\r\nin token of peace, the two parties started on, for the village.\r\n\r\nPretty soon, up the road charged sixty other Indians\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95warriors, on\r\nhorses, ready for a fight; but the women went ahead, to talk peace, and\r\nthe captain followed, alone, carrying the flag; and as soon as they\r\nknew what to expect, the Indians jumped from their horses and hugged\r\nthe white men and rubbed faces with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh hi e, ah hi e!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Indians; meaning: \xe2\x80\x9cGlad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chief was Ca-me-ah-wait. In the village the men were given salmon\r\ntrout to eat, so they knew that they were on the Pacific side of the\r\nmountains. The village was friendly, but when the captain asked the\r\nIndians to return with him to the east side and meet the other white\r\nchief and men, they were afraid again\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95said the white men might be\r\nspies for the Minnetarees. Finally Ca-me-ah-wait was persuaded, and\r\nstarted, with eight warriors.\r\n\r\nThe women wept and wailed, but after a few hours the village followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, our troubles began again,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hugh. \xe2\x80\x9cTo get those Snakes\r\ndown here was like haulin\xe2\x80\x99 the barge up-stream in some of those rapids.\r\nThey turned so suspicious that we traded clothes with \xe2\x80\x99em. We gave \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nour flag to carry. The cap\xe2\x80\x99n had told \xe2\x80\x99em that the other white chief\r\nwas to be found at the forks\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but when we sighted the forks, the boats\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t to be seen, and that made matters worse. Where was the other\r\nwhite chief? Of course, we\xe2\x80\x99d calkilated you fellows might be slow,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99cause of the rapids, but we\xe2\x80\x99d hoped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we gave over our guns, and the cap\xe2\x80\x99n told the chief to have us\r\nshot if there was any ambush. We were terrible afraid the whole pack\r\nof Injuns\xe2\x80\x99d skip and leave us stranded without hosses, or guns either.\r\nThe cap\xe2\x80\x99n sent Drouillard and an Injun down to the forks, to get a note\r\nthat had been stuck on a pole there, for Captain Clark. They brought\r\nback the note, and the cap\xe2\x80\x99n pretended it was a note put there by the\r\nother white chief, sayin\xe2\x80\x99 he was comin\xe2\x80\x99, but had been delayed. The\r\ncap\xe2\x80\x99n wrote another note, by light of a brush fire, telling Captain\r\nClark to hurry. Drouillard and an Injun were to take it down river in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat night the Snakes hid out, all \xe2\x80\x99round us, in the brush, for\r\nfear of a trap, while the chief and four or five warriors bunked\r\nclose beside us. Our scalps felt mighty loose on our heads\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and the\r\nmosquitoes were powerful bad, too, so we none of us slept much. The\r\ncap\xe2\x80\x99n was pretty near crazy. It was touch-and-go, how things\xe2\x80\x99d turn\r\nout. The Snakes were liable to skeedaddle, the whole pack of \xe2\x80\x99em, and\r\ncarry us off with \xe2\x80\x99em. The only reason they were stayin\xe2\x80\x99 now, was that\r\nDrouillard had told \xe2\x80\x99em we had one of their women in the main party,\r\nand a big black medicine man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoo! Dat am me,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted York, proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cDis eckspedishun can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\n\xe2\x80\x99long wiffout Yawk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext mornin\xe2\x80\x99 we were on the anxious seat. The fate of the expedition\r\nhung on whether you fellows arrived pretty soon at those forks and\r\nproved that the cap\xe2\x80\x99n had spoken truth. The chief sent out a lot of\r\nscouts; and Drouillard and one Injun started early with the note, to\r\nfind you. They hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been gone more than two hours by sun, when in\r\ncame a scout at a gallop, makin\xe2\x80\x99 signs. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d seen men like us,\r\nwith skin color of ashes, travelin\xe2\x80\x99 up-river in boats, and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfar away. Hooray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered the listeners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat settled the business. Old Ca-me-ah-wait hugged us, and the other\r\nInjuns danced and sang, and away raced a gang of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and next thing\r\nDrouillard and a crowd met Captain Clark. And now here you all are. So\r\nI reckon we\xe2\x80\x99re fixed. They\xe2\x80\x99ll trade us hosses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe council was still in progress; but while camp was being made under\r\ndirection of Sergeant Ordway, out from the council lodge came Shields\r\nand Drouillard, to the camp. Drouillard was grinning and capering,\r\nevidently very happy. His swarthy cheeks were painted with vermilion,\r\nhe wore a Snake tippet and decorated shirt; he looked exactly like an\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat news, Drouillard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99ing is all right. We are \xe2\x80\x99mong frien\xe2\x80\x99s. Dey all glad to haf\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a, an\xe2\x80\x99 she speak well for us. She find one woman who was\r\ncapture\xe2\x80\x99 same time as she but escape\xe2\x80\x99. An\xe2\x80\x99 dat chief, he her brudder.\r\nDey haf recognize\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 haf weep togedder under one blanket. I mos\xe2\x80\x99\r\nweep too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA princess, be she?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sergeant Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well! Good for the\r\nlittle Bird-woman. An\xe2\x80\x99 what of hosses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty hoss. No more drag canoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captains came down. They also were dressed as Indians; in their\r\nhair had been tied little shells from the \xe2\x80\x9cstinking lake,\xe2\x80\x9d as the\r\nSnakes called the far-off Pacific Ocean. The shells had been bought\r\nfrom other Indians and were considered very valuable. A canopy of\r\nboughs and sails was ordered erected; under this another council was\r\nheld. Chief Ca-me-ah-wait promised to furnish horses. The Indian women\r\nset about repairing the men\xe2\x80\x99s moccasins. They appeared to be a kindly\r\ntribe\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95they wondered much at York, and the battered boats, and the\r\nguns, and even at the smartness of the little black dog. But they shook\r\ntheir heads when questioned about the country west of the mountains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey say it is not ze possible for ze white mans to make travel down ze\r\nColumbee by boats, an\xe2\x80\x99 ze trail for ze hoss an\xe2\x80\x99 ze foot is ver\xe2\x80\x99 bad,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndeclared Chaboneau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Sa-ca-ja-we-a, Toussaint?\xe2\x80\x9d queried George\r\nShannon, for the Bird-woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were red and swollen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe much cry. Mos\xe2\x80\x99 all her fam\xe2\x80\x99ly dead while she been away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the morning Captain Clark took Sergeant Pat and ten other men, and\r\nstarted over the mountains to explore beyond the Snake village, in\r\nhopes of finding a route by water. They were to send back a man to the\r\nSnake village, to meet Captain Lewis there and tell him what had been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nChief Ca-me-ah-wait and all his people except two men and two women\r\nstarted also for the village, with Sa-ca-ja-we-a and Chaboneau, to\r\nbring down horses, for Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nEverybody in the camp was put at work making pack-saddles from oar\r\nhandles and pieces of boxes tied firmly with raw-hide! Out of sight\r\nof the Indians a hole was dug in which to cache more of the baggage,\r\nespecially the specimens that had been collected.\r\n\r\nFive horses were purchased, at six dollars each in trade; the canoes\r\nwere sunk by rocks in the bottom of the river\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and the Snakes promised\r\nnot to disturb them, while the white men were away. On August 24\r\nthe march was begun for the village on the other slope of what are\r\nto-day the Bitter Root Mountains. The five horses were packed with the\r\nsupplies; Sa-ca-ja-we-a and little Toussaint rode on a sixth horse that\r\nChaboneau had bought.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was August, the evenings and nights were so cold that the\r\nink froze on the pens when the journals were being written. The village\r\nwas reached in the late afternoon of August 26. John Colter was here,\r\nwaiting. He brought word from Captain Clark that canoes would be of no\r\nuse; the country ahead was fit for only horse and foot, as far as the\r\ncaptain had gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had an old Injun for guide who\xe2\x80\x99d been living in another village\r\nfurther west,\xe2\x80\x9d related John. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says we can\xe2\x80\x99t go to the south\xe2\x80\x99ard,\r\nfor the land\xe2\x80\x99s bare rocks and high mountains without game, and the\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs\xe2\x80\x99d be cut to pieces, and the Broken Moccasin Indians would\r\nkill us. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t the direction we want to go, anyhow. The Injuns we\r\nmet said winter was due, with big snows, and soon the salmon would be\r\nleaving for lower country. So the captain decided to turn back and\r\nadvise Captain Lewis that we\xe2\x80\x99d better tackle another road he\xe2\x80\x99d heard of\r\nfrom the guide, farther to the north, into the Tushepaw country on the\r\nbig river. After we\xe2\x80\x99d struck the big river, which like as not is the\r\nColumby, we could follow it down to the Pacific. Anyhow, the Tushepaws\r\nmight know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis immediately began to bargain for twenty horses. The\r\nprices were being raised, so that soon a young horse cost a pistol, 100\r\nballs, some powder and a knife.\r\n\r\nSergeant Pat arrived from Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s camp below, to ask how\r\nmatters were shaping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a hard road ahead, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d he confirmed. \xe2\x80\x9cCruzatte will tell you\r\nthat. Sure, wance he was almost lost, himself. I was sint up here to\r\ninquire about the prospect of hosses; but what I want to learn, myself,\r\nis: are we have the pleasure of the comp\xe2\x80\x99ny of the little Bird-woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Sa-ca-ja-we-a was. She preferred the white men to her own people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSa-ca-ja-we-a will go. She wants to see the big water,\xe2\x80\x9d she had said.\r\n\r\nAll were pleased that Sa-ca-ja-we-a, the Bird-woman, would take little\r\nToussaint and continue on with them to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of August there was a general breaking up at the\r\nvillage. The Sho-sho-nes under Chief Ca-me-ah-wait rode east over the\r\npass which is to-day Lemhi Pass of the east fringe of the Bitter Root\r\nMountains, to hunt the buffalo on the plains of the Missouri. With\r\ntwenty-seven horses and one mule the white chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 company, guided by\r\nthe old Sho-sho-ne and his four sons, set out in quest of the Columbia\r\nand the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe men named the old guide \xe2\x80\x9cToby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nACROSS STARVATION MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick Gass, \xe2\x80\x9cif I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so sore in me feet an\xe2\x80\x99 empty in\r\nme stomick I could close my eyes an\xe2\x80\x99 think myself back in a Pennsylvany\r\nbarnyard, with the chickens all a-cluckin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut instead, we\xe2\x80\x99re four thousand miles from old \xe2\x80\x98Pennsylvany,\xe2\x80\x99 Pat,\r\nand in a country where even the dogs are so hungry they eat your\r\nmoccasins while you sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted George Shannon. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pesky brutes\r\nstole my best pair last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the day of September 5. Ca-me-ah-wait and Toby and John Colter\r\nand Pat had spoken truly when they had predicted a tough trip. The\r\nregion west from the Sho-sho-ne village proved impassable. Old Toby\r\nhad led northward, by hard trail up and down. The two captains rode in\r\nthe advance; the hunters scouted for game but found little; York\xe2\x80\x99s big\r\nfeet had failed him and he needs must ride until well; Sa-ca-ja-we-a,\r\nof course, rode, carrying on her back baby Toussaint; everybody else\r\ntrudged afoot, each man leading two pack-horses.\r\n\r\nThe horses soon were worn out by scrambling amidst rain and snow, and\r\nfalling on the sharp rocks.\r\n\r\nWhat with hauling and shoving and chasing them, the men had decided\r\nthat boats were easier, after all.\r\n\r\nThe route had crossed the crooked range, to the east side again, and\r\nhere had struck a Tushepaw Indian camp of thirty-three lodges. Now the\r\ncompany were lying around, waiting and resting, while the captains\r\ntraded for more horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can not onderstan\xe2\x80\x99 one word,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cNeider can\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Toby himself scarcely was able to interpret for the captains. The\r\nlanguage was a curious mixture of grunts and cries. Nevertheless, a\r\nkind and hospitable people were these light-skinned Oo-tla-shoots, of\r\nthe great Tushepaw or Flat-head nation. They were rich in horses, and\r\ngenerous with their roots and berries; and fearing that these strange\r\nwhite men, who rode without blankets, had been robbed, they threw about\r\ntheir guests\xe2\x80\x99 shoulders handsome bleached buffalo robes.\r\n\r\nThese Oo-tla-shoots, who were on their way eastward to hunt the\r\nbuffalo, signed that the best trail for the big water beyond the\r\nmountains was the Pierced Nose trail, northward still. If the white men\r\ncrossed the mountains by that trail, they would come to a swift river\r\nthat joined the Big River, down which were falls and a big water where\r\nlived other white men.\r\n\r\nOld Toby, winking his eyes violently, said that he knew. He once had\r\nbeen upon that trail of the Pierced Noses, by which they hunted the\r\nbuffalo. His four sons had left him, several days back; but another\r\nson had appeared, and he asserted that they two would guide the white\r\nchiefs, by the Pierced Nose trail onward from the No-Salmon River, and\r\nso to the stinking lake under the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat white men do we find, at the Pacific Ocean, George?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Peter;\r\nfor both the Snakes and the Flat-heads spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cwhite men\xe2\x80\x9d down the\r\nColumbia, which was known only as the Big River.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraders, Peter. White men from the United States, and from other white\r\nnations\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95England and Russia\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95who sail there in large boats and trade\r\nfor furs. Perhaps we\xe2\x80\x99ll all return to the United States by one of those\r\nboats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt No-Salmon River is where we enter the Pierced Nose trail, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmused Sergeant Nat Pryor. \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon that\xe2\x80\x99s a correct name. \xe2\x80\x99Cordin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nChaboneau and Drouillard the salmon aren\xe2\x80\x99t to be found in any waters\r\neast of the Rock Mountains. They all stay west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, murther, an\xe2\x80\x99 aren\xe2\x80\x99t we west o\xe2\x80\x99 the mountains, yet?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pat.\r\n\r\nStill north pushed the company, down through the Bitter Root Valley of\r\nwestern Montana, with the line of mountains on the left rising ever\r\ncolder and higher. In four days\xe2\x80\x99 journey was reached a broad Indian\r\ntrail, along a river running east. It was the Pierced Nose trail, said\r\nold Toby, and the river was the No-Salmon River. The Indian road was to\r\nbe followed westward, over the mountains, but on the way there would be\r\nno game.\r\n\r\nSo the captains called the No-Salmon (to-day the Lou Lou) River,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraveler\xe2\x80\x99s Rest Creek,\xe2\x80\x9d because here camp was made while the men\r\nhunted and mended clothes before again climbing the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Pierced Nose trail was plain at first, but on the Idaho side of\r\nthese the Bitter Root Mountains it soon was lost amidst many other\r\ntrails, and the snows and the thick timber and the bare rocks. Old Toby\r\nhimself was well-nigh confused; he had not been along the main trail\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nThe mountains were very broad, very wild. The jumble of high ridges was\r\nsteep, and constantly drear with rain and snow. The horses strayed,\r\nand went lame, and fell down and broke things. The hunters sometimes\r\nbrought in a lean deer, sometimes a few grouse, and frequently nothing,\r\nso then for all hands there were only a sip of canned soup, and berries.\r\n\r\nIt was on September 14 that the first of the colts was killed, to be\r\neaten. The soup and the berries were making the men ill. He was a nice\r\nlittle black colt, and Peter hated to have him killed; but what else\r\ncould be done? On this day, also, they arrived at a clear, rocky river\r\ndown which extended the Indian road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the Big River?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Captain Lewis, hopefully, of old Toby.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the Big River, with the falls and the white men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKoos koos kee,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted old Toby. And that was all he would say.\r\n\r\nSo \xe2\x80\x9cKoos-koos-kee\xe2\x80\x9d was the river named.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat one funny name,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cZe \xe2\x80\x98Some-odder-river.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe laughed. Not for considerable time did he explain to his comrades\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9ckoos koos kee\xe2\x80\x9d was only Indian for \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the river; it is\r\nsome other river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Kooskooskee or Clearwater River does the stream remain unto\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore mountains! Wirrah, more mountains!\xe2\x80\x9d lamented Patrick Gass, when\r\nthe Indian road left the banks of the stony Kooskooskee and through the\r\nroughest kind of a country started upward again. \xe2\x80\x9cWill we niver be out\r\ninto some place where it\xe2\x80\x99s open enough to see \xe2\x80\x99round a corner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNebber so col\xe2\x80\x99 in mah life befoh,\xe2\x80\x9d chattered York, plodding on in\r\nfrozen moccasins, with snow to his ragged knees. \xe2\x80\x9cWe got to follow\r\nMarse Will an\xe2\x80\x99 Marse Merne\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but how do dis hyar Tobe know whar he\r\ngwine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a pointed ahead from her pony\xe2\x80\x99s back. She had learned to\r\nunderstand even York\xe2\x80\x99s speech. She was very smart and quick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPony rub bark,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. For, as anybody ought to be able to\r\nperceive, the snow-covered trail was marked above by places where\r\nIndian pony packs had scuffed low-hanging branches. This to Peter was\r\nvery plain.\r\n\r\nThis night the brown colt was killed, for supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slept with me heels higher\xe2\x80\x99n me head,\xe2\x80\x9d in the morning announced Pat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a fine country where a man can\xe2\x80\x99t find a level spot to stretch\r\nhis bones over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day the spotted colt was killed. Some of the men were growing\r\ndiscouraged. After supper Captain Clark, lean but ruddy, his eyes tired\r\nbut steady, made a speech, with Captain Lewis seconding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re doing the best we can, men,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re bound to break our\r\nway out into the lower country where there\xe2\x80\x99ll be warmth and game and\r\nfriendly Indians. Why, it may be only a few miles ahead! We can\xe2\x80\x99t turn\r\nback. Behind us would be only disgrace. Before is glory, and the honor\r\nof the flag. To-morrow I\xe2\x80\x99m to scout for a better game country than we\r\nare finding. The level grassy plains are the places for game; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsend you back word, and as like as not some fat meat, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the men, feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur hearts be strong but our stomicks be weak,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Pat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re nearly at the end of the colts,\xe2\x80\x9d added Alec Willard. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d as\r\nsoon eat my moccasins as chaw old hoss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning early Captain Clark, with Drouillard, Joe Fields,\r\nAlec, John Colter, Hugh McNeal and George Shannon, the strongest of the\r\nmen, and good hunters all, rode ahead on picked horses to find, as they\r\nexpressed, \xe2\x80\x9ca level spot and game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Toby and his son continued to guide. They were doing the best they\r\ncould, too. But surely this Pierced Nose trail was long and difficult.\r\n\r\nNow the only food left was some soup and bear-oil. Everybody was\r\nfeeling weak and miserable. But once the men started a cheer, for\r\nthey glimpsed, distant before, through a gap, a large broad valley or\r\nplain\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95perhaps the end of the mountains and perhaps the country of the\r\nNez Perc\xc3\xa9s or Pierced Noses. Then the mountains closed again and the\r\nvalley was swallowed up.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, another shout was given. To a tree\r\nbeside the trail (the trees were getting larger, showing that the trail\r\nwas leading downward), in a little draw was hanging the carcass of a\r\nhorse; and to it was pinned by a splinter a note from Captain Clark:\r\n\r\n    I am going on to some plains to the southwest.\r\n    Will find Indians and collect provisions for you.\r\n\r\n    W. C.\r\n\r\nSturdy Captain Clark, the Red Head chief! He could always be depended\r\nupon. Captain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s thin face brightened under his tattered hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoad the meat, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a rousing dinner, this\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, but at noon that horse tasted good, after soup and bear-oil! The\r\nhead was cut off and tossed aside; then with their knives everyone\r\nslashed off thick steaks and roasted them on ramrods, over the fires.\r\nPeter got his share.\r\n\r\nHowever, just as the march was about to proceed, the captain, who, as\r\nusual, had paused to cast his eyes keenly along the line, exclaimed\r\nsharply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my pack animal, Cruzatte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Cruzatte was supposed to look after this horse and another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ought he follow,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Cruzatte, who was quite sick. \xe2\x80\x9cI no\r\nsee heem. My gracious! Mebbe he in brush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the captain. Then he spoke energetically. \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\nhave those saddle-bags. They\xe2\x80\x99re of the utmost importance. Fields (and\r\nhe addressed Reuben), you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty fit. Take a horse and another man\r\nand go clear back to where we loaded the meat this morning. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlikely where the animal strayed, while we halted. Look for his tracks\r\nand find him. Be sure and get the saddle-bags, in all events. Their\r\ncontents are valuable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Reuben. He looked about him doubtfully. And Peter\r\ndid an unexpected thing. Peter felt equal to any man. He was young\r\nand wiry; his life among the Otoes had accustomed him to all kinds of\r\noutdoor hardships. He had not had so much flesh and bones to carry as\r\nhad the men; he had walked lightly and straight-footed, as Indians\r\nwalked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all right. I find the horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith,\xe2\x80\x9d supported Patrick Gass, \xe2\x80\x9cye might do worse, Reub. Sure, the\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x99s as good as the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the captain has no objections\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95?\xe2\x80\x9d proffered Reuben, with a grin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99d make out first-rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn excellent plan,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cTake Peter, by all means. He\r\nwants to do his part, and when it\xe2\x80\x99s his turn to ride he\xe2\x80\x99ll be easy on\r\nthe horse. He\xe2\x80\x99s a regular woodsman, too. Look to your laurels, Reuben.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d grinned Reuben.\r\n\r\nSo they set off; Reuben, with his rifle, at first on the horse; Peter,\r\nwith his bow and quiver, trotting alongside, holding to the saddle\r\nthongs. After a time, they changed off; Peter rode and Reuben walked.\r\n\r\nThey had left about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. It was dusk when they arrived at the\r\nnoon camp spot, on the other side of the high ridge. Not even a bird\r\nhad they seen, to kill for food. They had started in such a hurry that\r\nthey had brought nothing. But the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head was still lying here,\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make shift with the head, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Reuben.\r\n\r\nSo they built a fire, and roasted the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head, and ate it even to\r\nthe ears. Then they rolled in Reuben\xe2\x80\x99s blanket and slept together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll find that hoss or bust,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Reuben, as in the morning\r\nearly, having finished the horse-head scraps, they again took the back\r\ntrail. Soon they arrived at the place where the horse carcass had been\r\npacked\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and sure enough, in the brush at one side were the tracks of a\r\nhorse that had wandered.\r\n\r\nThey followed the tracks carefully, and soon they came to the saddle\r\nbags, which had been scraped off from the horse\xe2\x80\x99s back. Reuben put them\r\naboard the other horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for the critter himself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe tracks led on and on; and not until almost noon did they sight\r\nthe loose horse, grazing in a small open spot. He was too weak to be\r\nwild, and they caught him easily by his dragging neck rope. Reuben\r\ntransferred the saddle bags, and clambered stiffly on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve a hoss apiece, anyhow, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m so empty\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t cast a shadow. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s take the cap\xe2\x80\x99n his saddle bags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmpty! Anyway\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95hooray! And now for \xe2\x80\x9chome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReuben, who was leading, suddenly pulled his horse short. He slipped\r\noff, and resting his rifle on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s back, took long aim. Two\r\ngrouse were sitting on a limb, craning their necks foolishly. Peter\r\ncould see the rifle muzzle waver; he himself felt as though he could\r\nnot draw his bow. The rifle cracked\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the grouse went hurling. Good!\r\nReuben swiftly reloaded, and aimed\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and down spun the other grouse. But\r\nwhen they were picked up, both were in a pulp, from which dangled the\r\nheads and legs. Reuben shook his own head dolefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd once I could clip off a bird\xe2\x80\x99s head at fifty paces. Well, I was\r\nlucky to hit \xe2\x80\x99em at all, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t hold steady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two grouse made scarcely a couple of mouthfuls, so much of the\r\nmeat had been shot away. The next morning the horses had disappeared,\r\nleaving only the saddle bags. Reuben finally shouldered them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we stay looking longer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll starve. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tote these as\r\nfar as I can, Peter; and you can tote \xe2\x80\x99em as far as _you_ can. Between\r\nus we\xe2\x80\x99ll manage, for the cap\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s got to have his saddle bags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Peter.\r\n\r\nThat _was_ a journey! They struggled all day. The saddle bags, vowed\r\nReuben, gasping, weighed a ton\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and what a ton might be, Peter did not\r\nknow, but at any rate it must be very heavy. Only toward late afternoon\r\ndid they sight, below and ahead, the captain\xe2\x80\x99s party, on the edge of a\r\nplain\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95_the_ plain.\r\n\r\nThe party were moving briskly, as if encouraged. The captain was in\r\nadvance. Reuben and Peter quickened at their best. Would they never\r\novertake the other men?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmoke, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d panted Reuben.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPierced Nose village, maybe, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I see Joe, with that crowd? Yes, and a strange Injun, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npanted Reuben.\r\n\r\nThey hastened, dragging their numb legs, and lugging those saddle bags.\r\nThe party saw them, and halted; gave them a cheer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBully for yez!\xe2\x80\x9d greeted Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve arriv, in a land o\xe2\x80\x99 plenty,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99mongst the Pierced Noses. Yez are in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReuben saluted the captain, who had turned back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe saddle bags, Cap\xe2\x80\x99n, but we lost the hosses again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done well, both of you, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d praised the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrought us some fish and roots, from Captain Clark. He\xe2\x80\x99s waiting close\r\nahead, with the Pierced Noses. Get on a horse, each of you, and eat as\r\nyou ride. I think our troubles are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithin an hour they all were at the village of the Pierced Noses,\r\nhere on the open, fertile prairie of the kamass roots that tasted\r\nlike pumpkin; and Captain Clark and Chief Twisted-hair made them all\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nHOORAY FOR THE PACIFIC!\r\n\r\n\r\nHow beautiful was this broad prairie beyond the mountains, here where\r\nlived the Cho-pun-nish or Pierced Nose Indians while they caught salmon\r\nin the rivers and the women dug the kamass roots! But the fish and the\r\nroots were given so generously that all the party were made ill.\r\n\r\nThe village was near the banks of the Koos-koos-kee. Twisted-hair, who\r\nwas the head chief, drew a map with charcoal on a white robe. He showed\r\nthat not far below, the Koos-koos-kee joined another river, and that\r\nthis river joined another river from the north, and the two combined\r\nflowed west to the big water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTim-tim-m-m-m!\xe2\x80\x9d crooned all the Indians, imitating the noise of some\r\ngreat falls that would be met. From the region of these falls and\r\nbelow, came the beads and the brass ornaments traded to Indians by\r\nwhite men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas time to change from horses to canoes again. Five canoes were\r\nhollowed by fire from tree trunks\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95for only a few of the men were\r\nstrong enough to swing an adze. All the horses were branded with the\r\narmy brand which bore the name \xe2\x80\x9cCapt. M. Lewis, U. S.,\xe2\x80\x9d and left in\r\ncharge of the Pierced Noses. Chief Twisted-hair promised that the\r\nhorses should be well taken care of, and would be waiting when the\r\nwhite men asked for them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I for one am glad to be away,\xe2\x80\x9d said George Shannon, when in the\r\nmorning of October 7 the canoes, laden and manned, their oar-blades\r\nflashing, headed into mid-stream. \xe2\x80\x9cThese Nez Perc\xc3\xa9s are a good\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x99bout the best looking Injuns we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but they\xe2\x80\x99re mighty\r\nindependent. They don\xe2\x80\x99t give anything for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. And they even hold us to small account because we eat dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth\r\nJoe Fields. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if a man wants meat, in their village, it\xe2\x80\x99s eat fish,\r\nhoss or dog\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95an\xe2\x80\x99 dog\xe2\x80\x99s the only stuff with any strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was true. Lacking better meat, the captains finally were buying\r\nthe Pierced Noses\xe2\x80\x99 work-dogs\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95for dog-meat had been found good, back at\r\nthe Sioux camps on the Missouri. Drouillard and Cruzatte and the other\r\nFrenchmen preferred it even to deer. But the Pierced Noses sneered at\r\nthe white \xe2\x80\x9cdog-eaters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy they were called \xe2\x80\x9cPierced Noses\xe2\x80\x9d nobody could tell. However, old\r\nToby claimed that below there were other, real Pierced Noses, and also\r\nreal Flat-heads.\r\n\r\nChief Twisted-hair and a second chief, Tetoh, were aboard the captains\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncanoe, to help the white men pass through the other villages, into the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTim-tim-m-m\xe2\x80\x9d river.\r\n\r\nAs for old Toby and his son, on the third day out, during a halt they\r\nsuddenly were espied running away at top speed, and did not so much as\r\nturn their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re leaving without their pay! Send and get them, so we can pay\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nChaboneau grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey \xe2\x80\x99fraid of ze tim-tim rapids. Ze chief say no use to pay dem,\r\nanyhow. His people take ever\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99ing from dem when dey go t\xe2\x80\x99rough\r\nvillage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDown, down, down with the swift current. The Koos-koos-kee joined the\r\nother river, which, the captains figured, was the same river on whose\r\nhead-waters, far, far eastward, the camp of Chief Ca-me-ah-wait and\r\nhis Snakes had been located. The Lewis River did they name it, but on\r\nmodern maps it is the Snake.\r\n\r\nNow on down, down, down the rushing Snake. There were rapids, where\r\nonce or twice a canoe or two was wrecked; but this sort of travel\r\nwas easier than travel over the mountains, and easier than travel\r\n_up_ stream. Many Indians were seen, fishing for the salmon. They\r\nwere friendly, and much astonished. They sent runners to other\r\nvillages, below, telling of the coming of white men; sometimes Chiefs\r\nTwisted-hair and Tetoh also ran ahead, along the bank, that the\r\nIndians might be ready. And on shore the Indian women made much of\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a and little Toussaint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf these white strangers travel with a woman and a baby, they cannot\r\nbe a war party,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoned the Indians.\r\n\r\nDown, down; until soon after dinner, on October 16, this 1805, the\r\ncourse of another large river, coming in from the north, was sighted\r\nbefore. The Columbia! It must be the Columbia, at last! Hooray! Hooray!\r\nHooray! Old Cruzatte, in the leading canoe, struck up a gay French\r\nboat-song; Drouillard and Lepage and Labiche and Chaboneau chimed in.\r\nFaster flashed the paddles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll land yonder,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Captain Lewis, pointing to the right. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nthe junction. A lot of Indians seem to be waiting for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to Twisted-hair,\xe2\x80\x9d jubilated Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, I see him\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95an\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nother wan, too. When they left they said they\xe2\x80\x99d meet us at the Tim-tim,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t they? An\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s a big river, by the looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great throng of Indians collected by Chiefs Twisted-hair and Tetoh\r\nhad collected on the shore just above where the two rivers joined. A\r\ncouncil, opened by a procession with drums, was held. These were Sokulk\r\nIndians. They claimed to be kins-folk of the Twisted-hair Pierced\r\nNoses, but their foreheads were flattened back so that their heads\r\nended in a peak, and therefore they were more like Flat-heads. They\r\nwere kind\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and not very attractive, because their eyes were sore from\r\nwater glare and sun glare, and their teeth were bad from eating fish\r\nand roots.\r\n\r\nYes, this was the Columbia. The two captains measured it, and the\r\nSnake. The width of the Snake was 575 yards, but the width of the\r\nColumbia was 960 yards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA noble stream,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder how far to the\r\nnorth it penetrates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see so many fish, dead and alive, in all your life,\r\nMerne?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the water swarms with them, and\r\nI understand that the Indians use dried ones for fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll buy more dogs, nevertheless, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nmen can\xe2\x80\x99t row and make portages on fish flesh alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA day and a half was spent with the curious Sokulks, here where\r\nin southeastern Washington the Snake River unites with the mighty\r\nColumbia, in the midst of a flat and pleasant plain. On October 18 the\r\nfive canoes swept out and down the Columbia itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far now, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the big ocean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-siven hunderd miles have we come, by the captains\xe2\x80\x99 reckonin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 belike \xe2\x80\x99tis four hunderd more to the Paycific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we do then, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there aren\xe2\x80\x99t anny ships we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stay the winter. An\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\nspring, barrin\xe2\x80\x99 better luck, \xe2\x80\x99tis back we track over the four thousan\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmoils ag\xe2\x80\x99in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the Sokulks had been procured another map, of the Columbia. It\r\nshowed many bad places\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95rapids and falls. Around some of these the\r\ncanoes had to be carried; through others they had to be hauled by hand,\r\nor carefully lowered with ropes. The Indians ashore seemed very timid,\r\nand hid.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark returned in high humor, from a walk ahead with Chaboneau\r\nand Sa-ca-ja-we-a, and Chiefs Twisted-hair and Tetoh. He had shot a\r\nwhite crane, and a teal duck, and then had entered an Indian house\r\nthat had been closed against him. The Indians had bowed before him,\r\nand covered their heads. When he had lighted his peace-pipe with his\r\nsun-glass, they had cried aloud in terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey thought me a god, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey had heard the gun,\r\nhad seen the two birds drop, and believed that I had dropped, too.\r\nWhen I brought fire out of the sky, that finished the business. But I\r\nquieted them with presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, near the mouth of a river, Chief Yellept of the Walla Walla\r\nIndians welcomed the white men, and wished them to stay. Captain Lewis\r\nsaid that they would visit him on their way back.\r\n\r\nChiefs Twisted-hair and Tetoh were sent ahead again, to assure the\r\nIndians that the white men intended no harm.\r\n\r\nThe first big falls, reached on October 23, were not the Tim-tim. The\r\nTim-tim was still below. But Chief Twisted-hair said that the Indians\r\ndown there were strangers to him, and unfriendly. He had heard that\r\nthey were planning to attack the white men. And as he could not speak\r\ntheir language he wished to return to his own people.\r\n\r\nHe was persuaded to stay\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and Tetoh also\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95until the passage of the\r\nTim-tim.\r\n\r\nThese first falls or rapids were very difficult; but the captains and\r\nold Cruzatte consulted together, and decided to run them with the boats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ever\xe2\x80\x99body follow me an\xe2\x80\x99 do as I do, we get t\xe2\x80\x99rough,\xe2\x80\x9d promised\r\nCruzatte, head boat-man.\r\n\r\nSo, with Cruzatte leading, down through the wild channel of the first\r\nrapids in the Dalles of the Columbia raced the canoes. And from\r\nthe rocky shores the Eneeshur Indians opened their mouths wide in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Irish an\xe2\x80\x99 Frinch together can lick the world,\xe2\x80\x9d boasted Pat.\r\n\r\nBut the place of Tim-tim, or \xe2\x80\x9cTimm,\xe2\x80\x9d for short, was close ahead. It was\r\nreached the next evening, and they camped above it, at a village of the\r\nEcheloots, or Chinook Indians, who also flattened their hats, and spoke\r\nmore cluckingly than did even the Oo-tla-shoots.\r\n\r\nThey were the enemies of the Pierced Noses, but they agreed upon peace,\r\nin a council with Chief Twisted-hair. Now, after a final \xe2\x80\x9csmoke,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nChiefs Twisted-hair and Tetoh left, on horses, for their home. They had\r\nbeen good and faithful guides.\r\n\r\nThe place of Timm, at the foot of the Dalles of the Columbia, is to-day\r\ncalled the Long Narrows. It was three miles long and in some stretches\r\nonly fifty yards wide. But the canoes, guided by Cruzatte, went through\r\nwithout one being wrecked. They had been badly battered, however, by\r\nthe many rocks; and the next day was spent in caulking them. That\r\nnight Cruzatte brought out his fiddle, a dance was held, about the\r\nfire, and the Echeloots appeared much entertained.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night, soon after the camp had gone to bed, Peter\r\nwas awakened by Pat\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly squirming out of the blanket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fleas are \xe2\x80\x99atin\xe2\x80\x99 me entoirely,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cInto the river goes\r\nivery stitch o\xe2\x80\x99 me clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter was glad to follow the example. By morning nearly all the men\r\nwere stripped, and needs must stalk about in blankets while their\r\nclothing was being cleaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas the mosquitoes east of the mountains,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed George Shannon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow \xe2\x80\x99tis the fleas west of the mountains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the fleas were a slight matter, when amidst grand scenery the\r\nColumbia River ever bore the canoes onward, toward the ocean and the\r\nend of the long, long journey.\r\n\r\nAfter the Echeloots (whom the violin and the dancing had so entertained),\r\nmore Indians were met. The banks of this Columbia were thickly populated.\r\nThese Indians lived in wooden houses, too\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95houses walled and raftered\r\nwith planks faced and trimmed by fire or by knives and little axes. The\r\nhouses were furnished with bedsteads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs good houses as some settlers\xe2\x80\x99 houses back in the Illinois country,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndeclared Captain Clark, who was constantly exploring among them.\r\n\r\nThe canoes that the Indians cleverly managed were large, hollowed from\r\na single log, with high bows curving upward; farther on down, bows and\r\nsterns both were high, and had figures of men and beasts. Some of the\r\nIndians owned articles of white men\xe2\x80\x99s manufacture, which they said came\r\nfrom below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say dese hyar Injuns call demselves, Marse Will?\xe2\x80\x9d York was\r\nheard to ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSkilloots, York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 what were dose we met \xe2\x80\x99foh we met dese Galoots?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Chilluckittequaws, York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJes\xe2\x80\x99 so,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped York. \xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t gwine to say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn November 2 the canoes were partly carried around, partly slid\r\nthrough, the rapids which formed the foot of other rapids termed by the\r\ncaptains the Great Shute. Presently the river opened two miles wide,\r\nand smooth and placid. That night the water rose nine inches on a stake\r\nset at the river\xe2\x80\x99s edge in front of the camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in tidewater, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d announced Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ocean tides\r\nascend this far. That means there are no more rapids; the ocean itself\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be very distant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach night after this a stake was set out and the rise measured. Each\r\nday the men sniffed for the smell of salt water and listened for the\r\nsound of the surf. Sa-ca-ja-we-a was very much excited; she had come\r\nespecially to see the big water.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of November 4 the rise from the tide was two feet;\r\nthe next night\xe2\x80\x99s rise was four feet. Ducks and geese were many. But it\r\nrained almost every day, and every morning a fog hung low.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 7 the camp rose and breakfasted in a wet\r\nmist so dense that it hung on all sides like a gray curtain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this rate,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Pat, as the canoes headed out into the silence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re liable to get half way to Chiny afore we know we\xe2\x80\x99re on the\r\nPaycific at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe I smell salt, though,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted George Shannon,\r\nsniffing. \xe2\x80\x9cSa-ca-ja-we-a\xe2\x80\x99s been insisting, too, that she could hear a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98boom-boom.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d bade Pat\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and they paused on their oars. Peter thought that\r\nhe also could hear a \xe2\x80\x9cboom-boom,\xe2\x80\x9d low and dull, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t certain.\r\nThey went on.\r\n\r\nThe captains\xe2\x80\x99 boat was being piloted by a Wah-kia-cum Indian, now: a\r\nsquat ugly man who wore a queer round jacket that, according to the\r\nmen, had come from a ship. The river was growing wider, the fog was\r\nthinning and lifting\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95on a sudden the crew of the captains\xe2\x80\x99 boat waved\r\ntheir hats, pointed before, cheered wildly. The cheer passed from boat\r\nto boat. For the fog ahead had swirled into fragments, and below it was\r\nan expanse of tumbling gray water on which the sun was trying to shine.\r\nOccasionally sounded a muffled \xe2\x80\x9cboom,\xe2\x80\x9d like the faint growl of summer\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Ocean! But they did not reach it this day; the fog closed\r\nin again, and the rain. They did not reach it the next day, although\r\nthe waves were so high in this, the mouth of the Columbia, that half\r\nthe party were seasick; and the water was salty. They did not reach\r\nit the next day, nor the next. Wind and rain kept beating them back.\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a was frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spirits are angry. They do not want us here,\xe2\x80\x9d she whimpered,\r\ncrouching over little Toussaint, under a grass mat raised on a pole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way we\xe2\x80\x99ll reach the sea is to be washed into it,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned\r\nPat. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, don\xe2\x80\x99t the very stones an\xe2\x80\x99 logs come a-rollin\xe2\x80\x99 down the\r\nhills? Now for the first time I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t started, an\xe2\x80\x99 here I am at\r\nthe ind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, miserable were they all. There was no chance to dry clothing and\r\nfood, and scarcely an opportunity to stir. The mouth of the river\r\nformed a wind-swept bay miles wide. The captains thought that if camp\r\nmight only be moved around a point ahead, and to a high sand beach,\r\nit would be more comfortable. A deserted Indian village stood there,\r\nwith no inhabitants \xe2\x80\x9cexcept fleas\xe2\x80\x9d; and, as Pat said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be all the\r\nwarmer for the exercise they give us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot until the afternoon of November 15 did the opportunity to move\r\ncome. The sky cleared, the wind suddenly dropped; the canoes were\r\nreloaded in a hurry, and the point was rounded.\r\n\r\nNow the ocean was in full sight, outside the bay; from the boards of\r\nthe Indian houses rude cabins were erected; hunters and explorers were\r\nsent out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER AT FORT CLATSOP\r\n\r\n\r\nBut no ships from the United States or any other nation were to be\r\nfound. Only the long gray swells appeared, as far as eye could see,\r\nrolling in to burst thunderously upon the white sands and the naked\r\nrocks; and the only people ashore were the Indians. Ships and white men\r\nhad been here, said the Indians, during the summer; and many of the\r\nIndians spoke a curious mixture of English and native words. Captain\r\nLewis discovered a place, in the bay, where white men had camped.\r\n\r\nA high point overlooking the lonely ocean was given the name Cape\r\nDisappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have been a fine end to our trip from the Mississippi\r\nclane to the Paycific if a nice big ship all stocked with flour an\xe2\x80\x99\r\np\xe2\x80\x99taties an\xe2\x80\x99 boots an\xe2\x80\x99 socks had been waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for us,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Pat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, mebbe the United States has forgotten us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to build winter quarters at once, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain\r\nLewis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rain is rotting all our goods and clothes, and spoiling our\r\nprovisions. We must get under cover. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be no ships before next\r\nsummer, according to the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimber for cabins, wood for fires, game and fresh water for the\r\nmesses, and shelter from the ocean tides\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95let\xe2\x80\x99s look about, then,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians say that skins and meat are\r\nabundant a little way south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis found it\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95a good site, on the south side of the bay\r\nformed by the mouth of the Columbia, and three miles up a little river\r\ncalled to-day the Lewis and Clark River. It was back ten miles from the\r\nocean, and in the midst of tall pines, with great shaking bogs near, on\r\nwhich elk fed.\r\n\r\nThe first fair morning, which was December 7, camp was moved to the new\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the seven cabins rose fast; and when it came time to put\r\non the roofs, Pat, the boss carpenter, was delighted to find a species\r\nof pine that split into boards ten feet long, and two feet wide, with\r\nnever a knot or crack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe finest puncheons I iver have seen,\xe2\x80\x9d he asserted, \xe2\x80\x9cfor floors\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 roofs both. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be snug an\xe2\x80\x99 dry in a jiffy, an\xe2\x80\x99 all ready for\r\nChristmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a far cry back to last Christmas, Pat,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke George. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nthrough a lot of country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 here we are,\xe2\x80\x9d reminded Pat.\r\n\r\nYes; Christmas\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95Peter\xe2\x80\x99s first Christmas\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95was indeed a long way behind.\r\nThat Christmas of 1804 had been celebrated in new Fort Mandan among\r\nthe Mandans and Minnetarees beside the snowy Missouri River. What were\r\nChiefs Big White and Black Cat doing now? Was Fort Mandan being kept\r\nready for the return of the Long Knife and the Red Head?\r\n\r\nThis Christmas of 1805 was celebrated in new Fort Clatsop, among the\r\nflat-headed Clatsops and Chinooks and Cathlamets at the mouth of the\r\nrainy Columbia River. The men fired a volley, before breakfast, and in\r\nfront of the captains\xe2\x80\x99 door old Cruzatte, accompanied by Drouillard and\r\nthe other Frenchmen, sang a lively Christmas song. But there was no\r\nfeast, because the only food in stock was some roots, pounded fish, and\r\nlean elk meat. The captains distributed a little tobacco to the men who\r\nsmoked, and Peter and the men who did not use tobacco received each a\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nThe rain poured all day, but the cabins were tight above and below, so\r\nthat everybody stayed dry and warm.\r\n\r\nNow the expedition might settle down to the winter\xe2\x80\x99s routine. Chimneys\r\nwere yet to be put up for the men\xe2\x80\x99s cabins\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95fires were tried, in open\r\nhearths in the middle of the rooms, Indian fashion, and proved too\r\nsmoky. A fence of high, close pickets, as at Fort Mandan, needs must be\r\nerected to guard against attack.\r\n\r\nThe captains\xe2\x80\x99 cabin had been built around a large stump, smoothly\r\nsawed; this was their writing table, on which they spread their maps\r\nand journals. Captain Clark had traded with the Indians for a panther\r\nskin seven feet long; this made a good rug. York occupied the same\r\ncabin. Chaboneau was the captains\xe2\x80\x99 cook; he and Sa-ca-ja-we-a and\r\nlittle Toussaint lived in another room, built on. The men were divided\r\ninto four messes, each with a cook, and the supplies were doled out\r\nfrom the storehouse every morning.\r\n\r\nDrouillard, the chief hunter, and George Shannon, John Collins,\r\nFrancois Labiche and Reuben Fields were sent out to hunt for elk and\r\ndeer; but the meat spoiled so quickly, even although smoked, in this\r\ndamp climate, that Joe Fields, William Bratton, Alec Willard, George\r\nGibson and Peter Wiser were ordered to the seashore with kettles, to\r\nmake salt.\r\n\r\nThey built a furnace or fireplace, of stones, and boiled down\r\nkettlesful of salt water. They brought back a gallon of good salt, for\r\ntable use and for preserving the meat. All winter the salt-makers were\r\nkept at work. Peter served his turn.\r\n\r\nThe hunters were constantly out, chasing elk over the bogs. The meat\r\nnot eaten was salted and smoke-dried; from the tallow, candles were\r\nrun, in reed moulds; and from the hides the men made shirts and\r\ntrousers and moccasins, in preparation for the next journey. The\r\ncaptains determined that the whole party should return by land, as soon\r\nas the travel season opened. No ship was to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe captains led out exploring parties. Captain Clark gained a great\r\nreputation as a shot; with a single ball no larger than a pea he\r\nclipped off the heads of geese and ducks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKloshe musquet! Kum-tux musquet!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Indians. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good\r\nmusket! Do not understand this kind of musket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir own guns were rusty flint-locks, loaded with poor powder and\r\ngravel. Their bows were beautiful and true, but were not strong enough\r\nfor killing elk. They were not nearly so strong as the bows of the\r\nOtoes and the Sioux, decided Peter; not nearly so strong as his own\r\nMandan bow.\r\n\r\nThe Indians from all around visited the fort. The Chinooks, under Chief\r\nCom-com-ly, who had only one eye (\xe2\x80\x9cSame as me,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Cruzatte),\r\nlived on the north side of the bay; on this south side lived the\r\nClatsops, under Chief Co-bo-way. Nearer the sea lived the Tilla-mooks.\r\nUp the Columbia River lived Cath-lam-ets. These all looked much alike,\r\nbeing small, ugly, and flat-footed and crooked-legged from squatting so\r\nmuch in their canoes and by their fires.\r\n\r\nThey were well acquainted with white men. One squaw had the name \xe2\x80\x9cJ.\r\nBowman\xe2\x80\x9d tattooed on her arm. The captain spent much time talking with\r\nthem, and learned of the ships and the white traders who had been in\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTyee (chief) Haley; so many mast (and Chief Com-com-ly held up three\r\nfingers); stay long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCallalamet; wood leg; trader.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTyee Davidson; three mast; hunt elk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so forth, all of which the captains, particularly Captain Lewis,\r\ncarefully wrote down.\r\n\r\nThe visitors brought provisions and goods to trade: fish, a little elk\r\nand deer, high-crowned hats woven of grass and bark, grass bowls that\r\nheld water, so tight they were; grass mats, furs. Some of the chiefs\r\nwore splendid robes of sea-otter skin. These were priced very dear, for\r\nthe Indians were shrewd traders. They wanted fish-hooks, knives, and\r\nfiles, in exchange for ordinary articles; but only blue beads would buy\r\nthe otter-skin robes.\r\n\r\nFor one otter-skin robe Captain Clark offered a watch, a handkerchief,\r\na dollar, and a bunch of red beads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Tyee ka-mo-suck!\xe2\x80\x9d refused the Indian. \xe2\x80\x9cChief beads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sa-ca-ja-we-a gave to the captain her own girdle of blue \xe2\x80\x9cchief\r\nbeads,\xe2\x80\x9d and for it he bought a robe.\r\n\r\nThere were several new roots that the men grew to like. One root,\r\nsha-na-taw-hee, was a thistle root, purple after it had been roasted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTastes like a parsnip, only swater,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Pat.\r\n\r\nAnother root was cul-whay-ma; two feet long and slender. It also was\r\nsweet and wholesome. But the best root was the wappatoo\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x9ca rale Irish\r\np\xe2\x80\x99tatie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pat.\r\n\r\nThis was brought down by Skilloots and the Wah-ki-a-cums, from\r\nup-river. It was a species of lily, and grew in the lakes. The Indian\r\nwomen waded in, breast-deep, and poking with their toes loosened the\r\nbulbs, which rose then to the surface. That was cold work.\r\n\r\nThe wappatoo roots were held at a rather stiff figure, because they\r\ncould be traded to the other Indians, if not to the white men.\r\n\r\nThe Clatsops were the best Indians. The Cath-lam-ets were treacherous;\r\none would have killed Hugh McNeal had not a Chinook woman warned Hugh.\r\nThe Chinooks were thievish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo Chinook shall be admitted into the fort without special invitation,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfinally ordered Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nSo after that when Indians appeared outside they always shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nChinook. Clatsop.\xe2\x80\x9d Or \xe2\x80\x9cSkilloot,\xe2\x80\x9d or whatever they chanced to be or\r\npretended to be. Another order was issued that no Indians should remain\r\nin the fort over night.\r\n\r\nThe Indians brought many fleas, too\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x9cthe wan thing for which we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 to trade,\xe2\x80\x9d as said Pat.\r\n\r\nThe greatest excitement of the winter was the arrival of a whale. Chief\r\nCo-bo-way of the Clatsops came with the news, and also with three dogs\r\nand some blubber. He said that the whale had been stranded ashore near\r\nthe Tillamooks\xe2\x80\x99 village down the coast. He was given a pair of old\r\nsatin breeches, and went away much pleased.\r\n\r\nJoe Fields and George Gibson appeared at the fort with the gallon of\r\nsalt from the salt camp, and with some more of the whale blubber. They\r\nsaid that the Indians all were flocking to the whale and cutting it up.\r\nThe blubber, when cooked, looked and tasted like beaver tail\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95it was\r\nvery good; and Captain Clark immediately organized a party to go to\r\nthe spot and get what blubber they might.\r\n\r\nNaturally, everybody was anxious to see the whale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better take Peter, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Captain\r\nLewis. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a boy\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95he ought to see what there is to be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what a whale is,\r\nPeter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA big fish,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Peter, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a big warm-blooded fish; a fish bigger than a buffalo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, Sa-ca-ja-we-a had heard; she had helped Chaboneau cook the blubber\r\nfor the captains. But she had not been invited to go. In fact, all this\r\ntime the Bird-woman had not been even so far as the big water. She had\r\nworked in the fort.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she did a very surprising thing, for an Indian woman. When she\r\nbelieved that she was to be left out of the sightseeing party, she wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you want to go?\xe2\x80\x9d scolded Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cZe capitaines no haf time to\r\nwait for woman with baby. You stay by ze lodge fire; dat is place for\r\nwomans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a tilted her chin at him and went straight to Captain Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapitin! I speak a leetle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Sa-ca-ja-we-a?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come long way, capitin. I carry baby, I cold, hungry, wet, seeck,\r\nI keep up an\xe2\x80\x99 I no complain. I show you trail; when you no know which\r\nway, I say \xe2\x80\x98Snake people here,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 you find Snakes. When Indians see\r\nme, dey say: \xe2\x80\x98Dis no war party,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 dey kind to you. When you get\r\nhungry for bread, I gif you one leetle bit I carry all way from Mandan\r\ntown, so you can taste. When you want otter robe, I gif you my belt,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 you get otter robe. I been here all dis time, an\xe2\x80\x99 I not yet go near\r\nde big water dat I travel many days to see. Now dere is a big fish;\r\nodders go, Chaboneau say I mus\xe2\x80\x99 stay an\xe2\x80\x99 care for Toussaint an\xe2\x80\x99 help\r\ncook. I feel bad, capitin\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95I\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95I\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x9d and poor little Bird-woman hid her\r\nface in her shawl and sobbed.\r\n\r\nThe captain placed his hand kindly upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall go, Sa-ca-ja-we-a. You shall go with us and see the ocean\r\nand the big fish; and Chaboneau can stay by the fire and tend to the\r\nbaby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a smiled and dried her eyes. Very proud, she made ready.\r\nBut Chaboneau went, too\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95because he, likewise, wished to inspect the\r\ngreat wonder which had been cast ashore.\r\n\r\nThe whale was 105 feet long. The busy Indians had stripped it to the\r\nbones, and with difficulty Captain Clark managed to buy 300 pounds of\r\nblubber and some oil.\r\n\r\nThus, with hunting, trading, and making garments of leather, the winter\r\npassed. An astonishingly mild winter it was, too, of little frost and\r\nwet snow, but of much rain and fog which gave the men rheumatism, and\r\nwhich, by spoiling the food and cutting down exercise, gave them boils\r\nand stomach complaint, also.\r\n\r\nThe captains were constantly hoping for a ship and fresh supplies. None\r\nwas sighted.\r\n\r\nSo February merged with March. The elk were retiring from the low\r\ncountry to the high, following the grass. On some days the fort had\r\nonly one day\xe2\x80\x99s provisions in store.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can find no elk, notting,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Drouillard, the chief hunter.\r\n\r\nThe Indians hoarded their own food very close, to make it last until\r\nthe salmon began to run again, in the spring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix blue blankets, wan red wan, five striped wans that used to be our\r\nbig United States flag, some old breeches an\xe2\x80\x99 waistcuts, an\xe2\x80\x99 Cap\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nClark\xe2\x80\x99s artillery dress-coat an\xe2\x80\x99 hat\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95faith, that\xe2\x80\x99s all we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat prisent prices they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy a square meal,\xe2\x80\x9d reported Patrick\r\nGass. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be atin\xe2\x80\x99 ourselves naked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDose t\xe2\x80\x99ings be need\xe2\x80\x99 for boats an\xe2\x80\x99 hosses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cOf de\r\nleetle t\xe2\x80\x99ings we haf scarce one hat full. How we go back four t\xe2\x80\x99ousand\r\nmiles I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nFRIENDLY YELLEPT, THE WALLA WALLA\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrouillard,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Captain Lewis, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must have another canoe. These\r\nIndians down here won\xe2\x80\x99t sell us any. Try what you can do up the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of March. The captains had intended to wait until\r\nat least the first of April, before starting on the back trail, so as\r\nnot to arrive at the mountains until June. Then the snows would have\r\nmelted, and there would be game. But meat already was extremely scarce\r\naround Fort Clatsop; the expedition would better start at once, and\r\nhunt along the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI try de Cath-lam-et\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95dey haf canoes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Drouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut dey\r\nwill hol\xe2\x80\x99 dem dear. I t\xe2\x80\x99ink I must take de best t\xe2\x80\x99ings we haf. Mebbe\r\nyou let me take your lace coat, capitaine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! My only dress uniform?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not that\r\nartillery coat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s mine!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Captain Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day a Cath-lam-et see your lace coat an\xe2\x80\x99 like it. I sure I get\r\ncanoe for it,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Drouillard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother canoe we must have. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhold councils in my leather clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the canny Drouillard, who was half Indian himself, went up the\r\nCath-lam-ets and traded the laced dress-coat for a canoe.\r\n\r\nSergeant Pat was ordered to count the moccasins in stock. He reported\r\n338 pairs, manufactured during the winter from the hides of the 131 elk\r\nand twenty deer that had been killed.\r\n\r\nTo Chief Co-bo-way (or Com-mo-wool), of the Clatsops, was given the\r\nfort and all its furniture. He had been exceedingly friendly; and now\r\nhe appeared to appreciate the gift very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make my home in the house where the white chiefs lived,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis and Captain Clark and several of the men had long before\r\ncarved their names into trees, as a record for other white men to see.\r\nAnd there, on a rock, also was \xe2\x80\x9cPETER.\xe2\x80\x9d During the winter Peter had\r\nmade great progress in reading and writing. However, something more\r\nofficial and explanatory than only inscriptions on trees was needed,\r\nthat the trading ships which came in might know and might carry\r\nthe news to the world. Therefore the captains wrote out statements\r\ncontaining the names of the party and maps of the country explored. The\r\nnotices said:\r\n\r\n    The object of this list is, that through the medium of some\r\n    civilized person, who may see the same, it may be made known to\r\n    the world that the party consisting of the persons whose names\r\n    are hereunto affixed, and who were sent out by the government\r\n    of the United States to explore the interior of the continent\r\n    of North America, did penetrate the same by the way of the\r\n    Missouri and Columbia Rivers, to the discharge of the latter\r\n    into the Pacific Ocean, where they arrived on the 14th day of\r\n    November, 1805, and departed the 23rd day of March, 1806, on\r\n    their return to the United States, by the same route by which\r\n    they had come out.\r\n\r\nOne copy was pasted up on a smooth post in the headquarters cabin.\r\nOther copies were given to the Clatsops and the Chinooks, who promised\r\nto hand them to white traders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, we\xe2\x80\x99ll beat the news home,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Sergeant Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the\r\nships\xe2\x80\x99ll be a long time makin\xe2\x80\x99 it, by Chiny an\xe2\x80\x99 the inds o\xe2\x80\x99 the world,\r\nwhile it\xe2\x80\x99s straight across we go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this proved truth. Had the captains only known, at the very time\r\nthe notices were being written, the American trading brig Lydia, of\r\nBoston, Captain Hill, was cruising along the coast, and in the first\r\nweek of April anchored in the mouth of the Columbia. But the other\r\nAmericans had been gone two weeks, and Chief Coboway was ruler of Fort\r\nClatsop. So Captain Hill took one of the statements, carried it to\r\nChina with him, and delivered it at Boston not until May, 1807.\r\n\r\nAt 1 o\xe2\x80\x99clock of March 23, this 1806, Fort Clatsop was abandoned; out\r\ninto the little river that flowed past it the five canoes glided, and\r\nheaded down for the Columbia\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95thence eastward which was _homeward_!\r\n\r\nThe men swung their hats, of tattered felt, of furs, and of Chinook\r\nweave from grass and bark; and cheered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe nex\xe2\x80\x99 winter we spen\xe2\x80\x99 in de United States,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoiced Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nplay my feedle at Cahokia an\xe2\x80\x99 make de pleasure dere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come away with plenty powder and lead, and plenty salt; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none good job,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pat.\r\n\r\nThe powder, sealed in lead canisters, had kept splendidly. Now there\r\nwere 140 pounds of it. And as to salt\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95twelve gallons had been packed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been not such a bad winter, after all, even if we did have only\r\nsix clear days in six months,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed George Shannon. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll soon\r\nbe rid of our rheumatism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpring had arrived; for although the weather continued wet and raw,\r\nwild fowl were feeding in the ponds, the gooseberry and honeysuckle\r\nwere leaving forth in the parks, and the frogs were croaking in the\r\nmarshes. Many Indians were met; they were gathering along the river, to\r\nwait for the salmon to run up from the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext full moon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Indians. \xe2\x80\x9cNo salmon till next full moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second of May, that is,\xe2\x80\x9d figured Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwait. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to depend on our guns; for if we wait, winter will\r\novertake us on the Missouri. Where there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to shoot, we can\r\nlive for a time on dogs and horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indians seemed poor and starving. Captain Clark was told of a\r\nlarge river emptying from the south: the Multnomah, which is the\r\nWillamette. He ascended it a short distance, and there found some of\r\nthe Neer-cho-ki-oo tribe. They refused to sell him any wappatoo roots.\r\nBut he tossed a match into a fire; it blazed and frightened them. He\r\nplaced a magnet on his compass, and whirled the compass needle \xe2\x80\x99round\r\nand \xe2\x80\x99round. The women and children crawled under the bed-covers, and\r\nthe men piled wappatoo roots at his feet. The captain liked to do this\r\nsort of thing.\r\n\r\nHe returned from among the Multnomahs with roots and five dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were not all friendly, especially those new tribes who had\r\ntraveled to await the salmon. The Clah-clel-lahs threw stones at the\r\ncanoes, and stole things; John Shields had to defend himself with his\r\nhunting-knife. The Wah-clel-lahs stole the little black Assiniboine\r\ndog. Captain Lewis, who was very fond of the little dog, immediately\r\nsent Sergeant Pryor, Drouillard and Hugh McNeal to get it even if they\r\nhad to shoot the thieves. The thieves ran off and left the dog. And in\r\nthe village of the Skilloots Captain Lewis knocked down an Indian who\r\nwas carrying off a valuable piece of iron.\r\n\r\nAmong the Skilloots, here, quite a number of articles were lost; so\r\nthat Captain Lewis made a speech, to say that he and his men were not\r\nafraid and were able to burn the village if necessary to stop the\r\nthieving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYessuh! Dese hyah Galloots\xe2\x80\x99d better watch out,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed York. \xe2\x80\x9cMarse\r\nMerne an\xe2\x80\x99 Marse Will are offishurs of the \xe2\x80\x99Nited States ahmy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, from the Skilloots ten horses were purchased with blankets\r\nand Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s artillery coat and two kettles, and two more were\r\nborrowed. William Bratton was too ill to walk, and rode one of the\r\nhorses. Nine others were loaded with the baggage, to take it around the\r\nrapids. One horse was stolen, and Captain Clark rode the twelfth up to\r\nthe village of the E-nee-shurs.\r\n\r\nThree of the canoes were broken up for fuel. The captains hoped soon to\r\ntravel altogether by horses; canoe work, against the current, was slow,\r\nhard work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn amazin\xe2\x80\x99 disagrayable people,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Sergeant Pat, on the\r\nSkilloots. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Twisted-hair and his Pierced Noses\xe2\x80\x99ll be gintlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe E-nee-shurs were no better in manners and honesty. The horse\r\nChaboneau was leading ran away, and spilled his pack; an E-nee-shur\r\nmade off with a fine robe, and before it was returned Captain Lewis had\r\nto utter more threats.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the trip up-river was very vexing, until, finally having\r\ncollected enough horses for the baggage, so as to do without any\r\ncanoes, the party arrived on April 27 at the Walla Walla village where\r\nlived Chief Yellept who last October had wanted them to stay longer\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will visit you on our way back,\xe2\x80\x9d had promised Captain Clark. Now\r\nhere they were\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and Chief Yellept was glad indeed to see them.\r\n\r\nHe met them a few miles below the village.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and stay with me three or four days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the captains.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have more horses, and plenty food. I am wearing the little\r\nmedal given me from my white father; I hope that you will give me a\r\nbigger one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe village was six miles above, opposite the mouth of the Walla Walla\r\nRiver. Chief Yellept made good his word. He called his people together,\r\nto tell them that they must be hospitable to the white strangers; and\r\nhe set an example by bringing the captains an armful of wood and a\r\nplatter of three baked fish. Then all the Walla Walla squaws busied\r\nthemselves with gathering wood for their guests. Dogs were offered at\r\nreasonable prices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDese Wallow-wallows \xe2\x80\x99mos\xe2\x80\x99 like home folks,\xe2\x80\x9d declared York.\r\n\r\nForsooth, it was difficult to get away from the village, so friendly\r\nwere Chief Yellept\xe2\x80\x99s people. The chief appeared to have taken a great\r\nfancy to the Red Head, and presented him with a noble white horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Red Head will give me a kettle, for my lodge, I will be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Yellept.\r\n\r\nAmong the Walla Wallas there was a Snake Indian prisoner, with whom\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a, much to her delight, could talk in Sho-sho-ne; and the\r\nSnake could translate for her the Walla Walla speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell the Sho-sho-ne to tell Chief Yellept that we have no kettles to\r\ngive,\xe2\x80\x9d directed Captain Clark, to the little Bird-woman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we will\r\nbe pleased to give him something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYellept say he take what you gif,\xe2\x80\x9d interpreted Sa-ca-ja-we-a.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to give him your sword, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsuggested Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been wanting it, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Believe I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t transfer it to better\r\nhands,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the last of my official garb,\r\nMerne\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t much left yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChief Yellept\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shone as he accepted the prized \xe2\x80\x9clong knife\xe2\x80\x9d; and\r\nshone again when to it were added powder and a hundred bullets for his\r\ngun. Now he was a big chief, indeed.\r\n\r\nThe Bird-woman had spread the word that the white chiefs were great\r\nworkers in medicine: with their magic box and their wonderful knowledge\r\nthey healed all sicknesses. Now to Captain Clark and Captain Lewis\r\nthe Walla Wallas brought broken arms, stiff knees, and sore eyes, for\r\ntreatment. The captains did their best.\r\n\r\nNot until the second morning, following a grand dance by the Indians,\r\nat the camp, might the expedition start onward. Chief Yellept had\r\ninformed them of a short cut, across country, from the mouth of the\r\nWalla Walla River to the Pierced Nose country at the Kooskooskee; a\r\nSkilloot, who had been guiding the expedition by land, said that he\r\nknew the trail, and a Pierced Nose who, with his family, was returning\r\nhome from a visit below, volunteered to help also; Chief Yellept lent\r\nthe captains two canoes, for crossing the Columbia to the south side at\r\nthe mouth of the Walla Walla, where the new trail began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe most hospitable, honest and sincere Indians we have met since\r\nleaving the United States, Merne,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Captain Clark, when they\r\nhad been overtaken, a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey out, by three Walla Walla young men\r\nwho had hastened after to restore to them a beaver-trap that had been\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PIERCED NOSES AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe white men are coming back! The white men are coming!\xe2\x80\x9d sped the\r\nglad word among the Cho-pun-nish or Pierced Noses, in their villages\r\n100 miles up, on the Kooskooskee. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will make us well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the white men were indeed coming, by the trail from the Walla Walla,\r\nwith the Snake Indian prisoner and Sa-ca-ja-we-a as interpreters; with\r\nthe Skilloot and the three Walla Walla young men as guides (for the\r\nPierced Nose and family had taken another trail); with some twenty\r\nhorses, for the baggage, and for William Bratton, and for the men who\r\nhad sore feet; and with the healing medicine box containing, especially,\r\nthe celebrated eye-water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us wance get the horses we left with Twisted-hair an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll all\r\nride, b\xe2\x80\x99gorry,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Sergeant Pat, limping along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn ze Kamass Prairie dere will be plenty root, plenty game,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoiced\r\nChaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 mebbe dere we rest, while leetle Toussaint get well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFor little Toussaint seemed to be ailing.\r\n\r\nFirst they were met, before reaching any village, by an old friend,\r\nChief We-ah-koo-nut, and ten warriors. We-ah-koo-nut was called the\r\nBighorn, because he always wore, hanging from his left arm, the horn\r\nof a mountain ram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have heard that you were coming, and have ridden to greet you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bighorn. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sight of you makes our sore eyes well. We have\r\nno food for you here, but to-morrow you will reach a lodge where\r\neverything will be supplied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore breakfast, in the morning, the lodge was found, on the bank of\r\nthe Lewis or Snake River; but the families living there could supply\r\nonly two dogs and some root bread.\r\n\r\nNext was met Chief Tetoh, or Sky\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the honest fellow who, with\r\nTwisted-hair, had helped the expedition get through from the Kamass\r\nPrairie to the Timm falls of the Columbia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to see you. You are welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tetoh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Chief Twisted-hair? We have come to visit our friends, the\r\nPierced Noses, again, and to get our horses,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must cross the Kin-oo-e-nim (Snake River), here, and go to\r\nthe Kooskooskee,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Chief Tetoh. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you will find the\r\nTwisted-hair, who has your horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they crossed, in canoes lent to them by Tetoh, and arrived at the\r\nKooskooskee or Clearwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEye-water, eye-water,\xe2\x80\x9d begged the Indians. Captain Clark traded a\r\nsmall bottle of the eye-water for a gray mare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the doctor, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom now on we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter charge a fee. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get more meat that way than with our guns or\r\ngoods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly Captain Clark, who handled the medicines, exchanged his\r\nservices for provisions. But the Indians appeared to be very poor, and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cdoctor\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d fees in dogs and horses and roots did not amount to much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarse Will won\xe2\x80\x99t nebber make a libbin\xe2\x80\x99 at doctorin\xe2\x80\x99, dat\xe2\x80\x99s suah,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfinally admitted York, with a shake of his head. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nkilled anybody yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChief Twisted-hair\xe2\x80\x99s village was up the Kooskooskee some miles. Chief\r\nSky, and another chief named Cut-nose, rode along with the captains.\r\nWhen questioned about the horses and the saddles, they would give no\r\nstraight answer; but\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose no get \xe2\x80\x99um horse, no get \xe2\x80\x99um saddle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sa-ca-ja-we-a.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSho-sho-ne say he hear saddles gone, horses gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was alarming news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 Twisted-hair seemed like a fine gintleman,\xe2\x80\x9d bemoaned Sergeant Pat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can get more horses, can\xe2\x80\x99t we, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cWe see lots of\r\nhorses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, an\xe2\x80\x99 how\xe2\x80\x99ll we buy \xe2\x80\x99em, when each man of us is down to a couple o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nneedles, a bit of thread an\xe2\x80\x99 a yard or so of ribbon, with a pinch o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npaint for an extry?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to cut the buttons off\r\nour clothes, I guess. Cross the mountains on foot ag\xe2\x80\x99in we won\xe2\x80\x99t an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. They\xe2\x80\x99re waist-deep in snow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the mountains were looming ahead, white and wintry, although this\r\nwas May.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Twisted-hair,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Chief Sky, pointing before. And Chief\r\nTwisted-hair, with six men, met the procession.\r\n\r\nTwisted-hair was not at all in a good humor. He refused to shake hands,\r\nhe scarcely noticed the captains, and suddenly he and Cut-nose (a very\r\nugly man whose nose had been laid open by a Snake lance, in battle)\r\nwere quarreling in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this all about, Chaboneau?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a to have the Sho-sho-ne interpret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZe Sho-sho-ne will not,\xe2\x80\x9d reported Chaboneau. \xe2\x80\x9cHe say dees is quarrel\r\nbetween two chiefs an\xe2\x80\x99 he haf no right to interfere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go on a bit and camp and hold a council, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d directed Captain\r\nLewis to Captain Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll get at the bottom of this business.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s evidently something wrong with the horses and saddles we left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt camp the captains first smoked and talked with Twisted-hair. He said\r\nit was true that the horses were scattered, but Cut-nose and another\r\nchief, the Broken-arm, were to blame. They had been jealous of him\r\nbecause he had the white men\xe2\x80\x99s horses; and being an old man, he had\r\ngiven up the horses. Some were near, and some were at the village of\r\nthe Broken-arm, a half-day\xe2\x80\x99s march east. As for the saddles, the cache\r\nhad fallen in and they might have been stolen, but he had hidden them\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen the Cut-nose talked. He said that the Twisted-hair was a bad old\r\nman, of two faces; that he had not taken care of the horses but had\r\nlet his young men ride them, to hunt, until the Broken-arm, who was a\r\nhigher chief, and he, Cut-nose, had forbidden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not well that the chiefs quarrel,\xe2\x80\x9d reproved Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\nchildren quarrel. We will take what horses there are here and we will\r\ngo on to the village of the Broken-arm, for the other horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed to satisfy everybody. Twisted-hair\xe2\x80\x99s young men brought in\r\ntwenty-one of the forty-three horses and half the saddles, besides some\r\nof the powder and lead that had been buried, also. That night Cut-nose\r\nand Twisted-hair slept together.\r\n\r\nThe Broken-arm and his Nez Perc\xc3\xa9s lived in one large straw-and-mud\r\nhouse 150 feet long. Over it was flying the United States flag that had\r\nbeen given to the nation on the way down last fall. Broken-arm ordered\r\na hide tent erected for the white chiefs; his women hastened there with\r\nroots and fish; and when the captains offered to trade a lean horse for\r\na fat one which might be killed, Broken-arm declined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen our guests come hungry, we do not sell them food,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have many young horses. All those you see on these plains belong\r\nto me and my people. Take what you need for food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNiver before did we have the Injuns offer us somethin\xe2\x80\x99 for nothin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ngasped Patrick Gass. \xe2\x80\x9cAt laste, niver before were we told to go help\r\nourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Walla Wallas were as obliging. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the Walla Wallas, and\r\nYellept,\xe2\x80\x9d reminded George Shannon.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks were spent near the big house of the Broken-arm, for whom\r\nanother name was Black Eagle. Captain Clark was appointed official\r\ndoctor; he had fifty patients at a time. Captain Lewis held a council,\r\nand told the warriors about the United States. They promised to make\r\npeace with the Sho-sho-nes. Labiche killed a bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are great hunters. They kill the bear, alone,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nPierced Noses.\r\n\r\nHunters were sent out every day, to get bear, and deer, and\r\nelk\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95whatever they could. The other men were sent out to trade for\r\nroots and fish.\r\n\r\nLittle Toussaint grew better. William Bratton could not walk, but he\r\nwas put into a hut of boughs and blankets built over a hole in which\r\nthere had been a fire. Water was sprinkled into the hole. The hot\r\nsteam soaked William through and through. He was then plunged into\r\ncold water, and sweated again in the hut. This was Indian treatment,\r\nnot white man\xe2\x80\x99s. And it cured Bratton, after even Doctor Red Head had\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nMost of the saddles and all the horses except two were delivered. These\r\ntwo, said Broken-arm, had been stolen last fall by old Toby and his son\r\non their way back to Chief Ca-me-ah-wait. There now were sixty-five\r\nhorses on hand\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95enough for the baggage and for the men. Everybody\r\nmight ride. So much food had been purchased, that buttons (as Pat had\r\npredicted) were being traded in, and John Shields, blacksmith, was\r\nmaking awls out of the links of a beaver-trap chain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must start on, or we won\xe2\x80\x99t reach Fort Mandan before winter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nannounced Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Twisted-hair and Sky, and all. \xe2\x80\x9cToo much snow. Much\r\nwater come down. The trail over the mountains is not open. Wait till\r\nthe next full moon, and the snows will have melted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe salmon will soon be running up the river. Wait, and you shall have\r\nfood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cut-nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the white chiefs are hungry, let them kill and eat my horses,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChief Ho-has-til-pilp, the Red Wolf, with a wave of his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thank the Red Wolf. But we shall need guides. Will the chiefs send\r\nsome young men with us, to show us the way over the mountains?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nCaptain Lewis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen there is grass for the horses, on the Road-to-the-Buffalo, we\r\nwill send young men,\xe2\x80\x9d promised Chief Broken-arm. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not until after\r\nthe grand council of all the Pierced Nose nation, on the Kamass\r\nPrairie. In the summer we will all go to the buffalo plains of the\r\nMissouri, if the white chiefs will protect us from the Snakes and\r\nPahkees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold high the peace flag we have given you, and it will turn your\r\nenemies into friends,\xe2\x80\x9d instructed Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Council was not to be held for two or three weeks yet. By the\r\nclose of the first week of June the river had fallen six feet, showing\r\nthat the snows were partially melted. The captains decided to push\r\nalong without guides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot wait till July and the full moon, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Captain\r\nLewis, in an address to the company. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only 160 miles from the\r\nKamass Prairie to our old camp on the other side at Traveler\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\r\nCreek, and there we\xe2\x80\x99ll be done with the snow. If no guides overtake us,\r\nDrouillard and Labiche and some of the rest of you are as good trailers\r\nas the Indians, and can lead us through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered all. They were as anxious as the captains to go.\r\nThey were in fine fettle. They had been playing prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s base, among\r\nthemselves, and had been running foot-races with the Nez Perc\xc3\xa9s, to\r\nharden their muscles. In the races only one Indian had proved as fast\r\nas Peter and John Colter, the American champions.\r\n\r\nNow on June 10 camp was broken, and the march to the mountains begun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen days\xe2\x80\x99ll see us through,\xe2\x80\x9d confidently declared Pat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nBACK ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nTraveler\xe2\x80\x99s Rest Creek, at last! But Pat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cten days\xe2\x80\x9d had lengthened\r\ninto twenty, for this was June 29.\r\n\r\nThere had been good reason. To be sure, the Kamass Prairie had been\r\nfound all abloom with the kamass, so that the host of pale petals had\r\nmade it look like a lake. The wild roses were in flower; the ground\r\nsquirrels were busy, and supplied tender tidbits. But when the company\r\ntried to climb they encountered snow fifteen feet deep, covering the\r\ngrass and the trail, and the air was that of winter. Game was very\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\nThe captains shook their heads, and called a council of the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t go on in this fashion, men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cAlready\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re short of food, and so are the horses. Even if we knew the trail,\r\nand could travel at our best, we\xe2\x80\x99ve four days yet until we reach grass\r\non the other side. If we lost the trail, in the snow, we\xe2\x80\x99d be lost,\r\ntoo. So Captain Clark and I have decided that we all must return to the\r\nKamass Prairie, kill more meat, and see if the Nez Perc\xc3\xa9s won\xe2\x80\x99t furnish\r\nus with guides. The snow holds the horses up, and with experienced\r\nguides we can make good time. Failing of guides, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try again,\r\nanyway\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95sending our best woodsmen ahead to note the marks on the\r\ntrees and to blaze the trail. But first, Drouillard and Shannon will\r\nstart back immediately, to the Nez Perc\xc3\xa9 grand council, which is now\r\nin session, and offer two guns for some guides. They\xe2\x80\x99ll join us on the\r\nprairie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sounded sensible, although everybody did hate to retrace steps.\r\nThe going down, amidst snow-hidden rocks and timber, was cruel work.\r\n\r\nDrouillard and George Shannon were gone for almost a week. When they\r\nreappeared they brought three young Nez Perc\xc3\xa9s warriors as guides. Then\r\na quick trip was made. The first day out the guides set fire to the\r\ntimber, in order, they said, to \xe2\x80\x9cmake fair weather.\xe2\x80\x9d They led rapidly.\r\nThey never missed the trail. Whenever the snow thinned, in spots,\r\nthere, underfoot, was the trail, plain to be seen\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the great Nez Perc\xc3\xa9\r\nRoad-to-the-Buffalo, from the west of the mountains to the east. Even\r\nDrouillard and Sa-ca-ja-we-a exclaimed with approval of such accurate\r\nguiding.\r\n\r\nAll the old camps of the fall before were passed. The Hungry Creek\r\ncamp, where Captain Clark had left the horse hung up, and where Peter\r\nand Reuben Fields had supped on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head; the camp of September\r\n17, from which Captain Clark had set out ahead to find the Nez Perc\xc3\xa9s;\r\nthe camp of September 16, where the spotted colt was killed; the camp\r\nof September 14, where the black colt was killed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 the other way,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\npleasant recollections of the first trip, when we were afoot an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstarvin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the other men agreed with him.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day the mountains had been crossed. On the sixth day the\r\nsnow had ceased, and the head of Traveler\xe2\x80\x99s Rest Creek was reached.\r\nOn the next day, June 30, they hastened down the creek, and soon were\r\ncamped again at its mouth\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the camping spot of September 11, before!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are, back in the Missouri country, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Captain\r\nClark. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear through to the Pacific and not lost a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 nebber killed an Injun,\xe2\x80\x9d added York. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we mighty nigh had to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay have a fight yet,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth George Gibson. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to have met some\r\nof the Oo-tla-shoots hereabouts. The guides are afraid to go on. They\r\nclaim their friends have been wiped out by the Pahkees or Blackfeet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey much \xe2\x80\x99fraid,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Drouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cDey see de tracks of two Injuns\r\nbarefoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Peter himself knew, Indians who were barefoot were likely to be\r\nIndians in distress.\r\n\r\nHowever, the captains did not appear to be alarmed. The news was spread\r\nthat the company were to be divided. Captain Clark and party were to\r\ntravel southward, along this, the east side of the mountains, get the\r\ncanoes and other stuff where they had been hidden at the first meeting\r\nplace with Chief Ca-me-ah-wait\xe2\x80\x99s Sho-sho-nes. Then half the party,\r\nunder Sergeant Ordway, were to descend the Jefferson, from there,\r\nwith the canoes and other stuff, into the main Missouri and on to the\r\nWhite-bear Islands camp at the Great Falls.\r\n\r\nThe other half of the party, under Captain Clark, were to cross\r\neastward, by land, to the Yellowstone River, and descend that to its\r\nmouth in the Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe Captain Lewis party were to continue eastward from this present\r\ncamp on Traveler\xe2\x80\x99s Rest Creek, and try to follow the Pierced Nose\r\nRoad-to-the-Buffalo to the Great Falls of the Missouri; there they were\r\nto meet Sergeant Ordway, and at the mouth of the Yellowstone they all\r\nwere to meet Captain Clark.\r\n\r\nNow, with which party did Peter wish to go? The Captain Clark trip\r\nsounded very interesting\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95down that Yellowstone River, where no white\r\nmen had been. Sa-ca-ja-we-a was to guide him, too, across country. But\r\nthe Captain Lewis trip also sounded interesting\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95all by land, through\r\nanother unknown country, to the wonderful falls again. On this trip\r\nthere would be good hunting\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and possibly the Blackfeet Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant Ordway trip sounded the least interesting, for it meant\r\nmerely floating down the same rivers that they had toiled up.\r\n\r\nHowever, Peter was a soldier and had no choice. So he waited anxiously\r\nwhile the captains made their selections. It was like choosing sides in\r\nthe game of prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s base.\r\n\r\nFor Captain Clark: Sergeant Ordway, Sergeant Nat Pryor, John Shields,\r\nGeorge Shannon, William Bratton, Dick Windsor, George Gibson, Hugh\r\nHall, Francois Labiche, John Colter, the fast runner, John Collins,\r\nTom Howard, John Potts, Baptiste Lepage, Alex Willard, Joe Whitehouse,\r\nPeter Wiser, Old Cruzatte, York, Chaboneau, and the Bird-woman.\r\n\r\nFor Captain Lewis: Sergeant Pat, Joe Fields and Reuben Fields,\r\nDrouillard, the hunter, William Werner, Rob Frazier, Hugh McNeal, John\r\nThompson and Si Goodrich.\r\n\r\nThen where was Peter? Nobody seemed to want him. But Sergeant Pat made\r\na scrape and a salute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg your pardon, sorr,\xe2\x80\x9d to Captain Lewis; \xe2\x80\x9cbut are we to lave Peter\r\nhere till we come ag\xe2\x80\x99in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Pon my word!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! He\xe2\x80\x99s to come along with us,\r\nof course. He\xe2\x80\x99s in your charge, Pat, remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYis, sorr. Thank ye, sorr,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pat.\r\n\r\nAnd Peter was glad.\r\n\r\nSo the parties separated, Captain Clark to the south, and the place\r\nwhere the canoes and goods had been left last August; Captain Lewis to\r\nthe east and the Great Falls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood luck, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d was the final word. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll all meet at the Missouri.\r\nThen down we\xe2\x80\x99ll go, for home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Pierced Noses who had guided across the mountains went with Captain\r\nLewis a short distance still, to show him the shortest route along\r\nthe Road-to-the-Buffalo. Before they quit, in order to look for their\r\nfriends the Oo-tla-shoots or Flat-heads, the captain gave them presents\r\nof meat, and exchanged names with the leader, who was a young chief.\r\n\r\nThe young chief was henceforth to be known as the Long Knife, and\r\nCaptain Lewis was to be known as Yo-me-kol-lick, or White Bear-skin\r\nUnfolded.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be only nine days\xe2\x80\x99 travel to the White-bear Islands camp\r\nat the head of the Falls of the Missouri, and during all the way not an\r\nIndian was sighted, although fresh sign was discovered\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x9cBlackfeet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasserted Drouillard. \xe2\x80\x9cDe Gros-ventres of de Prairie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose Big-bellies must be bad Injuns, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99, by the way\r\neverywan\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery bad,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Peter. For even the Otoes of the south feared the\r\nnorthern \xe2\x80\x9cGros-ventres\xe2\x80\x9d as much as they did the Sioux.\r\n\r\nThere had been plenty of buffalo, bellowing all the nights; but there\r\nhad been a tremendous amount of mosquitoes, too, which bit so that even\r\nthe little black dog howled with pain.\r\n\r\nNow, here at the old camp were the \xe2\x80\x9cwhite bears,\xe2\x80\x9d as pugnacious as\r\nbefore. One treed Hugh McNeal and kept him treed near half a day, after\r\nHugh had broken his gun over the bear\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nNobody had disturbed the articles that had been left here last summer.\r\nSome things had spoiled from dampness; but the frame of the iron canoe\r\nwas all right, and so were the cottonwood wagon-wheels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGass, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave you in charge, here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwill wait till the Ordway party come with the canoes; then you will\r\nmove the canoes and baggage, by the portage trail, to the foot of the\r\nfalls, and proceed on down the river. I shall take Drouillard and the\r\ntwo Fields, scout northward and strike the Maria\xe2\x80\x99s River, which I wish\r\nto follow down to the Missouri. I will meet you at the mouth of the\r\nMaria\xe2\x80\x99s River on the fifth day of August\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95if all goes well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, Cap\xe2\x80\x99n, do ye think three men\xe2\x80\x99ll be enough for ye?\xe2\x80\x9d blurted Pat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 up where the bloody Big Bellies live. Give me Peter alone,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 take the rist. Peter an\xe2\x80\x99 I are plenty for this camp, till Ordway\r\ncomes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Drouillard and the two Fields I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand off the Blackfeet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlaughed Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, lads?\xe2\x80\x9d And he sobered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf my life is\r\nspared, Pat, I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you on August 5. But if you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear from us,\r\nyou wait till the first day of September. Then if there\xe2\x80\x99s no word, you\r\nwill proceed on to Captain Clark at the mouth of the Yellowstone. Tell\r\nhim that my directions as commanding officer are for him to carry out\r\nour program and return to the United States, for I and my party have\r\nbeen destroyed. He already knows that I have planned this side trip to\r\nthe Maria\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPat saluted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYis, sorr. An\xe2\x80\x99, sorr (his voice was husky), I hope to meet ye safe an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsound at the mouth o\xe2\x80\x99 the Maria\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning, which was July 16, the captain took Drouillard, and\r\nthe two Fields, and six horses, and rode away, for the upper Maria\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nRiver in the country of the Gros-ventres of the Prairie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke Pat; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re now siven men an\xe2\x80\x99 four hosses, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter be busy fixin\xe2\x80\x99 the carts an\xe2\x80\x99 trainin\xe2\x80\x99 the hosses to drag \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nferninst the day when Ordway arrives with the canoes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no fancy for\r\nplayin\xe2\x80\x99 hoss myself, when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the rale animals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing especial happened, except the mosquitoes, until the arrival of\r\nSergeant Ordway and party. One trip was made to the lower end of the\r\nportage, to examine the white pirogue, and the caches; they all were\r\nsafe. Harness was manufactured, out of elk hide, for attaching the\r\nhorses to the wagons.\r\n\r\nSergeant Ordway appeared at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon of July\r\n19. He had with him Colter, Cruzatte, Collins, Potts, Lepage, Howard,\r\nWillard, Whitehouse, and Peter Wiser; the six canoes that had been sunk\r\nin the Jefferson River, and most of the goods that had been buried in\r\nthe cache, when last August the company under Captain Lewis had set out\r\nto follow Chief Ca-me-ah-wait to the Sho-sho-ne camp on the other side\r\nof the pass. Nothing had been stolen or injured.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant Ordway party had separated from Captain Clark and party at\r\nthe Three Forks, and had come on down without adventure. The captain\r\nprobably was now on his way down the Yellowstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 how were Sa-ca-ja-we-a an\xe2\x80\x99 the little spalpeen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine and hearty. The Bird-woman said she knew the way to the\r\nYellowstone. She\xe2\x80\x99d been all through that country, when the Sho-sho-nes\r\nhunted the buffalo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the canoes were loaded upon the carts, the horses pulled very\r\nwell, for buffalo-horses; but, just as a year ago, the rain and the mud\r\ninterfered, the carts broke; besides, Pat was taken ill; so that five\r\ndays were required for carrying canoes and baggage around the series of\r\nfalls, to the old Portage Creek camp at the lower end.\r\n\r\nOne canoe was worthless, but the others were placed in the water; so\r\nwas the white pirogue; the blunderbuss or swivel cannon was unearthed\r\nand mounted in its bows, as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, we\xe2\x80\x99re gettin\xe2\x80\x99 all our plunder together, wance ag\xe2\x80\x99in,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncongratulated Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s more of it, an\xe2\x80\x99 the red pirogue,\r\nremember, at the mouth o\xe2\x80\x99 the Maria\xe2\x80\x99s, where we\xe2\x80\x99re to meet Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Lewis.\r\nDo you be takin\xe2\x80\x99 the canoes down, Ordway, an\xe2\x80\x99 Peter an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll ride by\r\nland with the hosses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Maria\xe2\x80\x99s was not far\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95fifty miles by river, according\r\nto Pat\xe2\x80\x99s journal, written on the way up, but less by land. The Maria\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nas Peter recalled, was the fork of the Missouri where camp had been\r\nmade while the captains debated which route led to the Columbia.\r\nCaptain Lewis had explored up the Maria\xe2\x80\x99s and he and Captain Clark had\r\ndecided that the other fork was the right channel\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d Missouri.\r\n\r\nPeter and Pat covered thirty miles this first day. They saw thousands\r\nof buffalo, and a pack of wolves chasing an antelope. Pat shot an\r\nantelope, with his rifle, and Peter killed a buffalo with his arrows;\r\nthe next morning they killed, together, six antelope and seven\r\nbuffalo\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95which was all the meat that they could pack, although, as\r\ndeclared Pat, they might have killed a hundred.\r\n\r\nShortly after noon they came in sight of the mouth of the Maria\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nSergeant Ordway\xe2\x80\x99s party with the canoes already were there, and ashore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t that Drouillard, too?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cYis! An\xe2\x80\x99 the cap\xe2\x80\x99n,\r\nb\xe2\x80\x99gorry! An\xe2\x80\x99 the two Fieldses! Somethin\xe2\x80\x99 must have fetched \xe2\x80\x99em back in\r\na hurry. \xe2\x80\x99Tis only July 28; they\xe2\x80\x99re a week ahead o\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe quickened his horse into a trot, and leading each a horse packed\r\nhigh with meat and hides, he and Peter hastened forward to learn the\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN LEWIS MEETS THE ENEMY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party seemed to be overhauling the cache here as if in a great\r\nhurry to go on; but the captain waved greeting, and Joe Fields\r\nstraightened up, to grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYez got back mighty quick,\xe2\x80\x9d accused Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t yez go? An\xe2\x80\x99 where are\r\nthe hosses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure we went,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cHosses? We\xe2\x80\x99ve turned \xe2\x80\x99em loose, of\r\ncourse; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be turnin\xe2\x80\x99 yours loose, too, in a minute. So tumble\r\noff and I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you unpack. There\xe2\x80\x99s no time to waste. You ought to\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen along, Pat. We had a beautiful brush with the Injuns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell yez?\xe2\x80\x9d reminded Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnnywan hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of us. We wiped two of them out, though\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and a ball cut the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s ha\xe2\x80\x99r. \xe2\x80\x99Twas this way,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Joe, as he tugged at a rope\r\nend, to release the pack of meat: \xe2\x80\x9cOn the fust day, \xe2\x80\x99fore we\xe2\x80\x99d gone\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x99n twenty mile from the falls, we struck Injun sign in shape of\r\na wounded-buffler trail; and after that we kept guard all night, for\r\nfear of our hosses. When we got to the Maria\xe2\x80\x99s we turned down, after\r\nscoutin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99round a bit. Found a lot of old Injun lodges, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nany Injuns till the 26th. Then the cap\xe2\x80\x99n sighted a bunch o\xe2\x80\x99 hosses,\r\nthirty of \xe2\x80\x99em, through his spy-glass\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and next several Injuns, on a\r\nhill, lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at Drouillard, who was across the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Bout half the hosses were saddled, which meant more Injuns somewhere\r\nnear. Our hosses were too tuckered to run far, and of course we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave Drouillard; so the cap\xe2\x80\x99n said: \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll go right on\r\nto those Injuns, boys; put on a bold front, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have it out\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let \xe2\x80\x99em think we\xe2\x80\x99re afraid. They may not be the\r\nGros-vent\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99 When the Injuns fust saw us comin\xe2\x80\x99, they acted like\r\nthey were more afraid of us than we were of them. But we finally got\r\ntogether, the cap\xe2\x80\x99n made the peace sign, and told \xe2\x80\x99em our other man\r\nhad the pipe and after he\xe2\x80\x99d come in we\xe2\x80\x99d smoke. So Reub and one of the\r\nInjuns went after Drouillard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were only eight of \xe2\x80\x99em. They were the Big-bellies, all right,\r\nbut they had nothin\xe2\x80\x99 except two guns, and clubs and bows and arrers. We\r\nthought we could take care of ourselves; and that night we all camped\r\ntogether. The cap\xe2\x80\x99n told us in case of trouble to stick up and keep\r\ntogether and save the baggage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe slept in the same lodge with \xe2\x80\x99em. The cap\xe2\x80\x99n had given three of \xe2\x80\x99em\r\na flag and a medal and a handkerchief; but he put Reub on guard for\r\nthe night, and told him to watch sharp and wake us quick, so\xe2\x80\x99s to look\r\nafter the hosses, if the Injuns tried to sneak out. He and Drouillard\r\nlay down with the Injuns, and Reub and I stayed at the fire in the\r\nlodge entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to sleep. Just at sunrise I woke up with a jump. Reub had\r\nyelled\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and there was an Injun runnin\xe2\x80\x99 off with my gun and his, and\r\nReub in chase. Drouillard was up and yellin\xe2\x80\x99, too\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x98Let go my gun! Let\r\ngo my gun!\xe2\x80\x99 he bawled, and I see him wrestlin\xe2\x80\x99 with another Injun, and\r\nthe cap\xe2\x80\x99n aimin\xe2\x80\x99 at another with his pistol. But I had to have my gun,\r\nso I ran after Reub and the fust Injun. Before I got there, Reub had\r\ncaught him and knifed him, and had both guns. Drouillard had his gun by\r\nthis time, and all the Injuns came pourin\xe2\x80\x99 out of the lodge, makin\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\nthe hosses, with the cap\xe2\x80\x99n and his pistol followin\xe2\x80\x99 the third Injun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe drew a bead on the fellow, but he dropped the cap\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s gun, and\r\nthe cap\xe2\x80\x99n wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let us shoot. \xe2\x80\x98Look out for those other rascals!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe ordered. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re trying to drive off the hosses!\xe2\x80\x99 So Reub and\r\nDrouillard and I ran after six who were roundin\xe2\x80\x99 up the most of the\r\nhosses; and the cap\xe2\x80\x99n set out after his Injun and another who were\r\ndrivin\xe2\x80\x99 away a bunch. He made \xe2\x80\x99em leave twelve, but they kept on, with\r\nhis hoss, and that he was bound to get. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have his bullet pouch\r\nor his hat; and when they were just \xe2\x80\x99bout to disappear in a little\r\ngully he told \xe2\x80\x99em to surrender the hoss or he\xe2\x80\x99d fire. With that they\r\nturned on him, and fire he did, downin\xe2\x80\x99 one of \xe2\x80\x99em slick as a whistle,\r\nbut the fellow had life enough to fire back an\xe2\x80\x99 sent a ball through the\r\ncap\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s ha\xe2\x80\x99r.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cap\xe2\x80\x99n had only his pistol, now, so he quit, and the other Injun\r\nmade off with the hoss. Drouillard had turned back to help the\r\ncap\xe2\x80\x99n, but Reub and I follered our Injuns till we got four of our own\r\ncritters, and then we let the rest go. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, \xe2\x80\x99cause there were\r\nthe twelve left by the Injuns, so we\xe2\x80\x99d come out ahead in the little\r\ngame. Besides, we had the lodge, four shields, two bows and quivers,\r\nand a gun. Likewise the flag we\xe2\x80\x99d given, and the medal\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95but we left the\r\nmedal on the neck of the Injun Reub had killed, so as to show what kind\r\nof people we were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t hang \xe2\x80\x99round there long, you bet. The Injuns had said\r\nthe main band was only a day and a half away, and when the cap\xe2\x80\x99n had\r\ninvited \xe2\x80\x99em to bring their chiefs to council he of course told \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nwhere our camp was\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95at the mouth of the Maria\xe2\x80\x99s. Now we were desperate\r\nafraid the Injuns\xe2\x80\x99d out-foot us and attack you-all at the river. We\r\ntook four best horses, and only what meat we could carry, rode a\r\nhundred miles, with an hour and a half of rest, camped at two in the\r\nmornin\xe2\x80\x99, then rode another twenty miles and struck Ordway comin\xe2\x80\x99 down\r\nwith the canoes. We got aboard and here we are\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and the cap\xe2\x80\x99n is in a\r\npowerful hurry to join Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Clark below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was true; for, as said Drouillard: \xe2\x80\x9cDose Blackfeet now will hold\r\nall white men as enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis cache had caved in, and much of the supplies had spoiled. The red\r\npirogue also was found to be worthless, except for its spikes. Captain\r\nLewis hustled the work of loading, the rest of the horses were turned\r\nloose, and down the river again voyaged all. Sergeant Ordway was in\r\ncharge of the five canoes, Sergeant Pat and squad had charge of the\r\nwhite pirogue, which was the flagship.\r\n\r\nA sharp lookout was kept for the Big Bellies on the banks. However,\r\nnothing happened. The mouth of the Yellowstone was several days ahead;\r\nand when it was reached, no Captain Clark or others of that party\r\nappeared in sight. When halt was made, to look for sign, traces of the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s camp were found, and in the sand Lepage discovered the scrawl:\r\n\r\n    W. C. a few miles further down on right hand side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was that written, Lepage, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMebbe two, mebbe t\xe2\x80\x99ree day ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baptiste. \xe2\x80\x9cDe rain haf washed\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, he\xe2\x80\x99s safe,\xe2\x80\x9d uttered the captain, with much satisfaction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect the mosquitoes drove him out of here. Whew!\xe2\x80\x9d For the\r\nmosquitoes were worse than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll overtake him to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they did not overtake the captain\xe2\x80\x99s party on the morrow, nor on the\r\nnext day. On the third day, which was August 11, the canoes stopped to\r\ntake aboard some meat; the white pirogue continued on, until Captain\r\nLewis espied a herd of elk in some willow brush, near the shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn in, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he bade. \xe2\x80\x9cWait here. Come on, Cruzatte. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get a\r\nfew of those fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut he leaped, gun in hand; and he and One-eyed Cruzatte disappeared in\r\nthe brush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, let\xe2\x80\x99s hope there aren\xe2\x80\x99t Injuns there, too,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Sergeant Pat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a likely place for an ambush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly stands to reason there\xe2\x80\x99d be elk whar there are Injuns,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nremarked Alec Willard.\r\n\r\nEverybody waited anxiously; gazed and listened. Two rifle-shots were\r\nheard, distant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s meat, I reckon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alec.\r\n\r\nPresently another shot; and in about ten minutes out from the willow\r\nbrush and to the sandy shore burst Captain Lewis. He was running,\r\nlimping, staggering\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95he\xe2\x80\x99d been wounded\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the left thigh of his leather\r\nbreeches was stained red!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your arms, boys!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sergeant Pat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lewis staggered on, to the white pirogue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been shot, men,\xe2\x80\x9d he panted. \xe2\x80\x9cNot mortally, I think. Indians are\r\nin that thicket. Cruzatte is somewhere there, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see any Injuns, cap\xe2\x80\x99n?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the ball came from ambush, just as I was aiming at an elk. Gass,\r\ntake the men and follow me. We must rescue Cruzatte. I\xe2\x80\x99d lost sight of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillard, you and the two Fields,\xe2\x80\x9d roared Pat, springing into the\r\nshallows. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bloody Big-bellies ag\xe2\x80\x99in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Peter went also, with his bow and arrows. Nobody objected. The\r\ncaptain led on for about one hundred steps, when his leg gave out and\r\nhe almost fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t travel,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll return to the boat. If you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\noverpowered, Sergeant, keep your men together and retreat in good\r\norder, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll fight from the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYis, sorr.\xe2\x80\x9d And Pat gallantly plunged ahead, into the brush. \xe2\x80\x9cKentucky\r\nan the Irish ag\xe2\x80\x99in the redskins, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d he cheered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut mind your\r\neyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was exciting. The willows were thick\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95good hiding-place. Where was\r\nCruzatte\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95poor old Cruzatte with the one eye? Peter stuck close behind\r\nPat. His nostrils were wide, his eyes roved, his every sense was on the\r\nalert. He was Oto once more. Now was heard a crashing, before. Elk?\r\nIndian? Hah!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty quare sort o\xe2\x80\x99 Injun, to be makin\xe2\x80\x99 all that noise,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmuttered Pat, peering, his rifle advanced at a ready.\r\n\r\nAnd through a little open space here came Cruzatte! He was striding\r\nalong, with stained hands, his rifle on his shoulder, making for the\r\nboats and plainly much satisfied with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cCruzatte! \xe2\x80\x99Asy now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCruzatte started, and crouched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave ye seen Injuns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNon,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cI shoot one elk, follow \xe2\x80\x99nodder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back to the boats with us, an\xe2\x80\x99 step lively,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nbe Injuns \xe2\x80\x99round. They shot the cap\xe2\x80\x99n in the leg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gracious!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Cruzatte. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I see no sign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNayther do we. Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s powerful suspicious,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Pat.\r\n\r\nThey found the captain all prepared to defend himself in the pirogue.\r\nHe had laid out his rifle, pistol and pike, and was propped behind the\r\nair-gun that could shoot forty times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you discover?\xe2\x80\x9d he challenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a thing, sorr,\xe2\x80\x9d reported Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 Cruzatte, here, knows no more\r\nabout the Injuns than the rist of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been, Cruzatte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shoot wan elk, same time you shoot. Den I see nodder in brush, I\r\nshoot at heem, he vaneesh an\xe2\x80\x99 I try to find heem, but he get away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you did! How much of him did you see when you shot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99gorry, you shot the cap\xe2\x80\x99n!\xe2\x80\x9d bellowed Sergeant Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you\r\ndid. Ye\xe2\x80\x99re blind as a mole! B\xe2\x80\x99gorry, you shot the cap\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95ye shot your\r\ncommandin\xe2\x80\x99 officer, an\xe2\x80\x99 by that ye\xe2\x80\x99re to be coortmartialed an\xe2\x80\x99 shot\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNon, non!\xe2\x80\x9d wailed old Cruzatte, wringing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI no mean to\r\nshoot heem. I see wan leetle brown spot in brush\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95look jus\xe2\x80\x99 like wan\r\nelk-fur, long way off; I take aim, bang!\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95I t\xe2\x80\x99ink I see elk run, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI run to ketch heem. I no mean to shoot my capitaine. It wan grand\r\nmistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear me call?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI suspected maybe\r\nthat ball came from your rifle and I hallooed as loud as I could. Why,\r\nby the shock you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more than forty paces!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear notting. I hear not one word,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Cruzatte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ball coming from so close, and you not answering, I of course\r\nthought of Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99gorry, give me wan chance at him an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll close his other eye,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbesought Pat; and all the men murmured angrily, while poor Cruzatte\r\nshivered with fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI no mean to shoot my capitaine,\xe2\x80\x9d he babbled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an error. My leather\r\nbreeches are just the shade of an elk hide, remember. Let\xe2\x80\x99s dress the\r\nwound. I doubt if it\xe2\x80\x99s serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ball had passed clear through his left thigh, and had furrowed the\r\nright; but it seemed not to have touched the bone or any artery. After\r\nthe wounds had been dressed and lint stuffed into the holes, the canoes\r\nwith the other elk hunters arrived; and not waiting to explain much the\r\ncaptain insisted upon them all pushing along, to catch up with Captain\r\nClark.\r\n\r\nNow that he himself was laid up, this was more necessary than before.\r\nAll he could do was to rest, half sitting, in the stern of the white\r\npirogue. His leg had so stiffened that he could scarcely move it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTHE HOME STRETCH\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark was safe and well, with all his men, and only a short\r\ndistance down river! This was learned the next day from two white\r\ntrappers\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the first Americans met in over a year. Their names were\r\nHancock and Dickson. They had left Illinois, of the United States, in\r\nthe summer of 1804, and had been trapping in the upper Missouri country\r\never since.\r\n\r\nThey said that Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s party had passed them yesterday, but\r\nhad lost all the horses, by Indians, and were traveling in two wooden\r\ncanoes and two hide canoes. The captain had the idea that Captain Lewis\r\nand party were ahead of him.\r\n\r\nTrappers Hancock and Dickson had other news, also. They had seen the\r\nbarge, under Corporal Warfington, on its way from Fort Mandan, last\r\nsummer, to St. Louis. All aboard were well. Brave Raven, the Arikara\r\nchief, was there, bound for Washington; and so were several Yankton\r\nSioux chiefs, with old Pierre Dorion. But the Mandans and Minnetarees\r\nwere at war with the Arikaras; and the Mandans and the Assiniboines\r\nwere at war, too; and the Sioux were \xe2\x80\x9cbad.\xe2\x80\x9d So that the peace talks by\r\nthe captains had not buried the hatchet very deep.\r\n\r\nAnyway, soon after noon, this day, Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s camp was sighted,\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter here?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Captain Clark, the instant that the\r\npirogue grounded. He saw Captain Lewis lying in the stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing serious, Will. Merely a gun wound, in the thigh. Cruzatte shot\r\nme by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe capitin shot!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sa-ca-ja-we-a, running to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI not mean to,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Cruzatte, still in much distress. \xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ink I\r\nsee one elk in brush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Cruzatte,\xe2\x80\x9d consoled Captain Lewis.\r\n\r\nYes, Captain Clark\xe2\x80\x99s party all were here, so that the whole company\r\nwere united again. The captain had had a successful trip down the\r\nYellowstone. The Bird-woman (who now was applying some Indian salve\r\nto Captain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s wound) had proved a valuable guide across country.\r\nCaptain Clark was emphatic in his praise of her. George Gibson had\r\nfallen on a sharp piece of timber and driven it two inches into his\r\nthigh. Indians had early stolen twenty-four horses, and had left only a\r\nworn-out moccasin in exchange. Labiche had trailed them, but had been\r\nobliged to give up.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone was a fine stream, with many beaver, and many bear. At\r\nthe Missouri the mosquitoes had been so pestiferous that only brief\r\ncamps could be made. Little Toussaint was bitten so severely that his\r\neyes were puffed shut, and the mosquitoes settled so thickly on the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s gun-barrel as to prevent his taking aim!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe achieved one important thing,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe named a\r\nriver for York!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYessuh!\xe2\x80\x9d gabbled York. \xe2\x80\x9cYessuh! Dar\xe2\x80\x99s a ribber up yahnduh \xe2\x80\x99long de\r\nYallerstone named foh me: Yawk\xe2\x80\x99s Dry Ribber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Pryor, George Shannon, Hugh Hall and Dick Windsor had been\r\ndetailed to drive the remaining fifty horses overland to the Mandan\r\ntown; but the first night, Indians had stolen every one of these, also,\r\nand the squad were obliged to turn back. On the way, while the sergeant\r\nwas asleep in camp a wolf had bitten him through the hand, and had\r\ntried to seize Dick, but George Shannon had shot just in time. Back\r\nagain at the Yellowstone they had manufactured two round canoes, like\r\nMandan canoes, from buffalo hides stretched over basketry, with hoops\r\nas top and bottom. In these they had finally caught up with Captain\r\nClark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in command now, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do much\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t even write the records. But we\xe2\x80\x99re in the home stretch. Let\xe2\x80\x99s push\r\non as fast as we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two free-trappers, Hancock and Dickson, came down in their canoe to\r\ngo with the company as far as the Mandan town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be there in a jiffy,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed Sergeant Pat. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nwonderful good fortune we\xe2\x80\x99ve had\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95clane across to the Paycific an\xe2\x80\x99 nigh\r\nhome ag\xe2\x80\x99in, an\xe2\x80\x99 only wan man lost an\xe2\x80\x99 nobody bad hurt but the cap\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Sa-ca-ja-we-a, the Bird-woman, was much excited; for she was near\r\nhome, too. The first day eighty-six miles were covered. The next day,\r\nin the morning, they arrived once more at the Minnetaree village, and\r\nthe village of the Mandans opposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoom!\xe2\x80\x9d signaled the blunderbuss. And then again, and again. The\r\nMinnetarees, the Ah-na-ha-ways or Wassoons, and the Mandans flocked to\r\nthe river banks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur white fathers are back!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried, one to another.\r\n\r\nThe Indians seemed delighted. It was a great triumph\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95it really was\r\nlike getting home. Sa-ca-ja-we-a hardly could wait for the boats to\r\nland. Landing was made among the Ah-na-ha-ways, but headquarters\r\nwere immediately established among Chief Black Cat\xe2\x80\x99s Mandans. The\r\nBird-woman, carrying little Toussaint, proudly accompanied Chaboneau\r\nto the Minnetarees\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95which was _her_ village\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95to invite them to council\r\nwith the white chiefs. Drouillard was sent down to get Jessaume and Big\r\nWhite.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark held a council in the Black Cat\xe2\x80\x99s village. He invited\r\nthe chiefs to go with him to Washington, and call on the great white\r\nfather. Black Cat and Le Borgne, the one-eyed Minnetaree head chief,\r\nand old Cherry-on-a-Bush and others answered. They said that the\r\nSioux would kill any of them who ventured down the river. The captain\r\nanswered that all would be protected against the bad Sioux, and\r\nwould return safe, escorted by United States warriors and loaded with\r\npresents.\r\n\r\nAt last Big White agreed to take his wife and child and accompany the\r\nRed Head and the Long Knife.\r\n\r\nSo much corn was brought to the boats that it all could not be loaded.\r\nCaptain Clark presented the swivel cannon to the Minnetarees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this big gun we have announced the great white father\xe2\x80\x99s peace\r\nwords to his red children, all the way up the Missouri,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, to Le\r\nBorgne. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever it is fired, it will remind you of these good words,\r\nand you will think upon them, and live at peace with your neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ears will always be open to the words of the great white father,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npromised One-eyed.\r\n\r\nThen the cannon was discharged, and the Minnetarees, much pleased, bore\r\nit into their village.\r\n\r\nThe start was to be made the next day. But John Colter was not\r\ngoing. He had asked permission to turn back, up the Missouri again,\r\nwith the two trappers, Hancock and Dickson, to hunt the beaver. And\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a and Chaboneau were not going. The Bird-woman wished to\r\ngo\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95she wished to go on with the Red Head, to the country of the white\r\npeople, and learn more of their ways. Captain Clark offered to take her\r\nand little Toussaint and Chaboneau, and put little Toussaint at school\r\nwhen he grew up. However, Chaboneau shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI t\xe2\x80\x99ank you, capitaine,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in San Loui\xe2\x80\x99 I haf no\r\n\xe2\x80\x99quaintance, I would haf no means of makin\xe2\x80\x99 my support. I mus\xe2\x80\x99 stay\r\nhere, where I am known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo everybody bid goodby to John Colter, to Chaboneau, Sa-ca-ja-we-a,\r\nand little Toussaint, now nineteen months old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood luck!\xe2\x80\x9d to John.\r\n\r\nFive hundred dollars in wages, and the blacksmith tools, to Chaboneau.\r\n\r\nTo Sa-ca-ja-we-a the captains said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nation of the United States will not forget Sa-ca-ja-we-a, the\r\nBird-woman, who never complained, who carried her baby clear to the\r\nPacific Ocean, who made friends for us wherever she went, and who\r\nhelped us across the Rock Mountains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSa-ca-ja-we-a wept.\r\n\r\nAt the village of Sha-ha-ka, the Big White, the chief was found\r\nsitting surrounded by weeping women, and taking a final smoke with his\r\nrelatives and friends. They all feared that they never should see him\r\nagain. To them, it was a long, dangerous journey for him to take. Chief\r\nLe Borgne of the Minnetarees requested that the white chiefs take good\r\ncare of Big White. And they solemnly promised.\r\n\r\nThe canoes were lashed together two and two, in order to be steadier\r\nand to travel faster. Big White and his wife and child stepped aboard\r\nthe pirogue. Jessaume and his wife and two children were to accompany\r\nBig White and speak for him to the great white father at Washington.\r\n\r\nWith a farewell volley and a cheer the boats entered the current. The\r\nIndians had crowded to watch them leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA month more, lads, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in St. Louis,\xe2\x80\x9d jubilated Pat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarrin\xe2\x80\x99 accident, we\xe2\x80\x99re good for sixty miles a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFort Mandan, opposite, was passed; but only a few pickets, and one\r\ncabin, were standing. All the rest had been burned in a timber fire.\r\nThree traders were met, coming up-river. Two of them were the same who\r\nhad been at the Mandan town in the winter of 1804. They said that the\r\nSioux were on the war-path against the Mandans and Minnetarees\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95had\r\nalready set out, 700 warriors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not tell Sha-ha-ka,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered Captain Lewis, to Jessaume. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would\r\nwish to turn back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis same day the Arikara villages were reached. Some Cheyennes were\r\nhere, too. Captain Clark held a council with both tribes. They all were\r\nvery friendly. Big White addressed them, and they listened. They were\r\nwilling to be at peace with the Mandans and Minnetarees. The Arikaras\r\nsaid that they had refused to join the Sioux, on the war-path. They\r\nwished to send more chiefs to the great white father at Washington, but\r\nwere waiting until Brave Raven, who had gone down on the barge last\r\nyear, came back with the white father\xe2\x80\x99s words. The Cheyennes said that\r\nthey were afraid of the white people\xe2\x80\x99s medicine, but they hoped that\r\nthe new father would send traders and trappers into their country, to\r\nshow them how to live and how to catch the beaver.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the council, or July 22, Captain Lewis was able to\r\nwalk about a little, for the first time since he had taken to the boat.\r\n\r\nRapidly traveled the boats. Wild turkeys were seen; ripe wild plums\r\nwere found; the grasses were high and luxurious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe gettin\xe2\x80\x99 down into lower country,\xe2\x80\x9d chattered Drouillard, happily.\r\n\r\nThere were signs of many buffalo. On July 29, 20,000 in one herd\r\ndarkened the plain. The day following, halt was made in a wild plum\r\norchard. Everybody ate. But this was Sioux country, and below the wild\r\nplum orchard sudden exclamations arose from the boats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Sioux!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the bloody rascals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTetons, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMebbe Yankton. They act like they want to talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome twenty Indians had appeared on a high bank opposite. One man with\r\nthem wore a blanket-coat and a \xe2\x80\x99kerchief around his head. He might be\r\na French trader. A short distance farther down almost a hundred other\r\nIndians emerged, to the shore; from their guns they fired a salute.\r\nThey all were well armed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer the salute, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d directed Captain Lewis. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a\r\npeace signal. And you might go near them and talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark took Drouillard, Jessaume and Cruzatte and crossed to a\r\nsand-bar. The Indians who met him there said that they were Tetons,\r\nunder Chief Black Buffalo. Black Buffalo had been the chief who had\r\nmade trouble two years ago, so Captain Clark declined to have anything\r\nmore to do with him. He came back and ordered the boats to prepare for\r\nan attack and proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like wan shot at them,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sergeant Pat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not fire unless you are fired upon,\xe2\x80\x9d enjoined the captains.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the Sioux collected on the hill, Second Chief Partisan\r\ninvited them to land. But they knew better; and as they continued, the\r\nPartisan struck the earth three times with the butt of his gun, and all\r\nthe Indians yelled abuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey make vow to kill ev\xe2\x80\x99ry white man,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Drouillard.\r\n\r\nThat night camp was pitched on a bare sand-bar in the middle of the\r\nriver, so as to be safe from attack; but a terrific thunderstorm blew\r\ntwo of the canoes clear across the river. However, no Tetons turned up,\r\nwhich was fortunate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Yanktons next, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked George Shannon. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were a\r\npretty good set, two years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA number of lodges of the Yanktons were indeed waiting. They proved\r\nvery friendly, and Captain Clark held a council with them. They even\r\ntook Chief Sha-ha-ka by the hand and asserted that they were obeying\r\nthe words of the great white father and were at peace with the Mandans.\r\nThey said that as a token they had kept the flag-pole standing, by the\r\nbig tree of the council ground below, where they had first talked with\r\nthe white men. And sure enough, when the boats passed the spot opposite\r\nthe mouth of the James River, the flag-pole showed plainly.\r\n\r\nSoon another white man was met. He was James Airs, a trader on his way\r\nup from St. Louis, to the Sioux. Being so lately from the United States\r\nhe gave the captains much news, and they sat up nearly all night with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNow the region was very familiar ground, to Peter. The Omaha village\r\nwas close before. Soon after leaving Mr. Airs they sighted the bluff\r\nwhere Sergeant Charles Floyd had been buried. They landed, to pay the\r\ngrave a visit, and found that the Indians had opened it. The captains\r\nordered the earth filled in again. That night camp was made on the\r\nsand-sprit, at the old Omaha village\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95the very spot where the council\r\nhad been held with Chief Little Thief and his Otoes and Missouris, and\r\nwhere Peter had \xe2\x80\x9ccome aboard.\xe2\x80\x9d How long ago that seemed!\r\n\r\nThe Omaha village was still deserted. In the morning Captain Clark\r\ncalled Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Peter, would you like to go to the Otoes again? Are you tired of\r\nbeing white?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, please,\xe2\x80\x9d begged Peter. He had been afraid of this\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95afraid that he\r\nwould be sent to the Otoes. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go to St. Louis, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo you shall,\xe2\x80\x9d assured the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cGo you shall, Peter, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nattend to you myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHooray! But, reflected Peter, supposing that Chief Little Thief should\r\nappear before they started on. However, no Chief Little Thief, or other\r\nof the Otoes and Missouris did appear.\r\n\r\nMore white traders were encountered. On August 12 there hove in sight\r\ntwo pirogues; aboard them were none other than Trader Gravelines\r\nhimself, and old Pierre Dorion! Mr. Gravelines said that he had taken\r\nChief Brave Raven, of the Arikaras, clear to Washington, and that\r\nthe chief had seen the President, but had died just when about to\r\nreturn home. Now Mr. Gravelines was going up to the Arikaras with the\r\nPresident\xe2\x80\x99s words, and with presents. Old Pierre Dorion was on his way\r\nto the Yankton Sioux again, hoping to get six more of them and take\r\nthem to Washington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States has given all you people up for lost,\xe2\x80\x9d declared\r\nTrader Gravelines. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing has been heard from you since you left Fort\r\nMandan. The President and everybody are very anxious. We were asked to\r\ninquire about you, among the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, an\xe2\x80\x99 our welcome\xe2\x80\x99ll be the more hearty,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Sergeant Pat,\r\nto his fellows.\r\n\r\nBoats containing trading parties were met constantly. Surely, thought\r\nPeter, St. Louis cannot be very far ahead. At a fifty-miles-a-day clip\r\nthe boats proceeded. Soon the captains did not stop even to hunt; and\r\ncamp was broken before daylight!\r\n\r\nAugust 20 another glad shout arose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCows, boys! Look at the cows! We\xe2\x80\x99re near the settlements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the best sight I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in better\xe2\x80\x99n two years,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed\r\nSergeant Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, I\xe2\x80\x99m in that state o\xe2\x80\x99 mind when I could kiss a cow\r\non the nose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is cow, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d invited Peter, staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, murther, an\xe2\x80\x99 ye don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d bewailed Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cow be the buff\xe2\x80\x99lo\r\ncivilized, Peter. She be the white man\xe2\x80\x99s buff\xe2\x80\x99lo. She gives us milk to\r\ndrink an\xe2\x80\x99 butter to ate, an\xe2\x80\x99 the breath of her is swater\xe2\x80\x99n the prairie\r\nbreeze an\xe2\x80\x99 the voice of her is beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Charette! I see La Charette!\xe2\x80\x9d cried old Cruzatte.\r\n\r\nLa Charette was the first white man\xe2\x80\x99s village! The captains ordered\r\nguns to be fired, and told the men to cheer. Down to the shore hastened\r\nthe inhabitants. They, too, cheered. They talked part in French, part\r\nin United States. What a chatter sounded! They almost carried the men\r\nto the houses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe nefer expec\xe2\x80\x99 to see you again!\xe2\x80\x9d they exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe t\xe2\x80\x99ink you all\r\nscalped. Haf you been far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Pacific Ocean,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gracious! Come an\xe2\x80\x99 tell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrouillard and Cruzatte and Lepage and Labiche were well-nigh beside\r\nthemselves with joy. They greeted numerous old friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDees is the best part of all de trip,\xe2\x80\x9d they laughed, again and again.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, the villages of the white men of the United States must be\r\npleasant places, thought Peter.\r\n\r\nSixty-eight miles had been rowed, this day. With difficulty could\r\nthe men get away from hospitable La Charette, but on the next day\r\nforty-eight miles were covered, to another village, St. Charles. Here\r\noccurred more excitement, of greetings, and dinners, and good beds.\r\nThe captains, and all the men, in their elk-hide clothes, and their\r\nbeards, and their tan, were treated as heroes; and Peter was not\r\noverlooked\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95not by any means. Nor was Sha-ha-ka, the Big White. He,\r\nlike Peter, for the first time was seeing how the white people lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSha-ha-ka say de white people evidently a ver\xe2\x80\x99 good people,\xe2\x80\x9d announced\r\nJessaume. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he anxious to get on to de beeg village of San Loui\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far to St. Louis, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Peter, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly twenty miles. With an \xe2\x80\x99arly start we\xe2\x80\x99ll ate our dinner there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwenty miles! The last twenty of more than 8000! No wonder that all the\r\nmen were impatient. They made great plans. At St. Louis they were to be\r\npaid off and discharged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtry pay an\xe2\x80\x99 320 acres of land do we each get,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Patrick\r\nGass. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ve earned it. It\xe2\x80\x99s glad I am not to be with John Colter\r\nthis minute, trapsin\xe2\x80\x99 for the Yellowstone ag\xe2\x80\x99in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you do, Pat, after we get to St. Louis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, have my whiskers trimmed an\xe2\x80\x99 get my journal published.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sold my journal to the captains for ten dollars!\xe2\x80\x9d boasted\r\nSergeant Ordway. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more\xe2\x80\x99n you\xe2\x80\x99ll make with yours, Pat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to try for an officer\xe2\x80\x99s commission, in the army,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant\r\nNat Pryor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I get cleaned up, I\xe2\x80\x99ll strike straight for old New\r\nHampshire, and spin my yarns to the home folks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ordway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intend to study law. Think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to college,\xe2\x80\x9d said George Shannon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stay at San\xe2\x80\x99 Loui\xe2\x80\x99 for wan time. Den mebbe I haf money to enter de\r\nfur trade,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drouillard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Clark will send me to school,\xe2\x80\x9d piped Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, Peter,\xe2\x80\x9d encouraged George. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were long twenty miles. First, the captains did not leave St.\r\nCharles until mid-morning, because of the rain and the entertainments.\r\nThen, three miles below, was found a big camp of other United States\r\nsoldiers, and here the captains stopped for the day, at the log house\r\nwhich was the principal quarters.\r\n\r\nThey took Sha-ha-ka ashore; and when he was next seen by the company,\r\nhe had been dressed in new clothes\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95white man\xe2\x80\x99s clothes! Of these he\r\nwas very proud. He strutted more than York had strutted among the Sioux\r\nand the Arikaras and Mandans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s better dressed for polite\r\nsassiety than the rist of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeventeen miles to go! The start was made soon after an early\r\nbreakfast. All eyes strained ahead; the men pulled lustily on the oars.\r\nHouses and small settlements were passed. People ashore cheered. Toward\r\nnoon another large river was sighted, ahead; its course was marked by\r\nlines of trees. The Missouri emptied into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mississippi!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the men. And then\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95\r\n\r\nThe captains stood up in the white pirogue. Captain Clark looked back,\r\nat the canoes, and waved his hat, and smiled. Before, on the right, was\r\na great collection of houses set amidst trees\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and at the river bank,\r\nnear where the two rivers joined, loomed a huge (at least, to Peter it\r\nseemed huge) whitish stone fort, flying the United States flag. Many\r\nboats plied the current. St. Louis!\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark lifted his hand and called an order. But already every\r\nrifle in pirogue and canoes had been leveled, on every trigger was a\r\ntense finger\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95and \xe2\x80\x9cBang!\xe2\x80\x9d spoke all together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the boats had touched the landing, the people of St. Louis had\r\ngathered there like magic; they were running, shouting, jostling.\r\nExclamations sounded again and again. The air trembled with the\r\nexcitement. In the boats, the men were agrin\xe2\x80\x95\xe2\x80\x95waving, calling, and old\r\nCruzatte capering. Only the captains and Big White stood motionless, as\r\nproper for chiefs, waiting until the pirogue made landing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEet ees Lewis an\xe2\x80\x99 Clark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDey haf return\xe2\x80\x99 from de dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuzza! Huzza! Welcome home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you been, these two years and a half?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImportant personages pressed forward, to grasp the captains and shake\r\ntheir hands vigorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat news, Captains? What news from beyond the Mandan town? Did you\r\nsucceed in crossing the mountains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much farther?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Columbia and the Pacific!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvelous! Any fatalities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the death of Sergeant Floyd, by disease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what distance traveled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout eight thousand miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemarkable!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
