  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> circumstances under which the present expedition was undertaken,
    are indicated in the following extracts from the letters of instruction.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="right">“<i>Detroit, Aug.</i> 9, 1830.</div>

    <p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have been directed by the War Department to
      request you to proceed into the Chippewa country, to endeavor to
      put an end to the hostilities between the Chippewas and Sioux. The
      general route must be left to your discretion. Whether it will be
      necessary for you to go beyond Fond du Lac, you can best determine
      on your arrival there. From the limited means applicable to this
      object, I am apprehensive that your journey cannot be extended
      beyond that place. But in that event, it will be necessary to
      summon some of the principal Mississippi Chiefs to meet you, as
      without their concurrence no durable pacification can be effected.</p>

    <p>“Your object will be to impress upon them, the necessity
      of terminating their hostilities with the Sioux. And the
      considerations connected with the subject are so familiar to you,
      that I need not dwell upon them. You are perfectly acquainted with
      their useless and harrowing contests, and the miseries these have
      inflicted, and yet threaten to inflict upon them. But it will be
      well to state to them the result of the recent council at Prairie
      du Chien, that they may know what has been done by the other
      Indians, and that the Sioux, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>now freed from the pressure in other
      quarters, can direct their whole force against them.</p>

    <p>“In addition to the other considerations you may urge, I enclose a
      speech to be delivered to them, which you will please to accompany
      with a proper belt. I think it will be best for them to send a
      message to the Sioux without delay, stating their determination to
      refrain from hostilities in conformity with the wish of their great
      father the President, and their adhesion to the treaty of Prairie
      du Chien. This message should be sent while you are with them,
      and I recommend that one from you be likewise sent to the Sioux,
      explanatory of the matter.</p>

    <p>“You will proceed to the execution of this duty without delay, if
      the season be not too far advanced when you receive this letter.
      But I am apprehensive it will not reach you in season. Should
      it be so, you will please send a message to the chiefs stating
      your intention to visit them next summer, and recommending them

      views are approved. The Secretary of War deems it important
      that you should proceed to the country upon the heads of the
      Mississippi, and visit as many of the Indians in that, and the
      intermediate region, as circumstances will permit.</p>

    <p>“Reports have reached the department, from various quarters, that
      the Indians upon our frontiers are in an unquiet state, and that
      there is a prospect of extensive hostilities among themselves. It
      is no less the dictate of humanity, than of policy, to repress this
      feeling, and to establish permanent peace among these tribes. It is
      also important to inspect the condition of the trade in that remote
      country, and the conduct of the traders. To ascertain whether the
      regulations and the laws are complied with, and to suggest such
      alterations as may be required. And finally to inquire into the
      numbers, standing, disposition and prospects of the Indians, and to
      report all the statistical facts you can procure and which will be
      useful to the government in its operations, or to the community in
      the investigation of these subjects.</p>

    <p>“In addition to these objects, you will direct your attention
      to the vaccination of the Indians. An act for that purpose, has
      passed Congress, and you are authorised to take a surgeon with
      you. Vaccine matter prepared and put up by the Surgeon General is
      herewith transmitted to you, and you will, upon your whole route,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>explain to the Indians the advantages of vaccination, and endeavor
      to persuade them to submit to the process. You will keep and report
      an account of the number, ages, sex, tribe, and local situation of
      the Indians who may be vaccinated, and also of the prevalence, from
      time to time, of the small pox among them, and of its effects as

  <p>In the execution of these orders, the summer season of two years was
    devoted. All the bands of the Chippewa nation, located north of the
    mouth of the Wisconsin, and some bands of the Sioux were visited.
    Councils were held with them at various points, for the objects above
    specified, and no opportunity was omitted to acquire statistical and
    other information suited to aid in the formation of correct opinions
    respecting their condition, and the policy to be pursued respecting
    them.</p>

  <p>The portion of country situated between the bands of Lake Superior
    and the Mississippi, south of St. Anthony’s falls, occupied the
    summer of 1831. The area extending thence north, to the source of
    the Mississippi, and the Hauteur des Terres, forming the elevation
    separating its waters, from the streams received by Hudson’s bay,
    constituted the object of the expedition of 1832. So much of this area,
    as lies north of a latitude line passing through Cass lake, and west
    of about its parallel of longitude, comprehends the principal topic of
    description in the following work. And it is thus distinguished, from
    other portions of the western country, brought into discussion, in my
    two previous volumes of travels.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">American</span> geography may be said to have had three important problems
    to solve, in modern times. The first and second of these, related to
    the source of the Missouri, and to the course and termination of the
    Columbia. Both, were substantially resolved by the expedition of Lewis
    and Clark, under the administration of Mr. Jefferson. It is to be
    borne in mind, however, that but one of the three forks, up to which
    the Missouri was traced, has been explored, that its two northwestern
    branches have not been ascended, and that, consequently, we do not
    actually know, which of its primary tributaries is the longest, or
    brings down the greatest volume of water.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

  <p>The true source of the Mississippi, which forms the third topic
    of inquiry, was brought into discussion at the same period. And
    immediately after the acquisition of Louisiana, the American government
    sent an officer, with a suitable body of men, to determine it. Lieut.
    Pike, who was selected for this service (who, nine years afterwards
    lost his life as a general in the service, at the taking of York) did
    not, however, set out early enough in the season (1805) to accomplish
    the object. After the selection and purchase of the site, on which the
    fort near the Falls of St. Anthony, is now situated, he encountered
    delays in ascending the rapids characteristic of that part of the
    Mississippi. Winter overtook him before reaching the junction of the De
    Corbeau. He prepared for its severities by erecting a block house, for
    the security of his provisions and men. He then proceeded with a small
    detachment, on snow shoes to Sandy Lake, and Leech Lake; two points
    of central influence, which were then occupied by the North West Fur
    Company. As the partners of this company consisted of foreigners, and
    their operations were continued after the legal transfer of the country
    to the American government, Lieut. Pike would have been justified in
    making a seizure of the valuable furs then in their possession. He
    did not, however, adopt this course, and exhibited a magnanimity in
    relation to it, which is in accordance with his subsequent acts of
    disinterested intrepidity. He collected the geographical data, which
    are embodied in his published map and journal, and returned from his
    wintry station, on the opening of navigation in the spring.</p>

  <p>No further effort was made to explore the sources of the Mississippi,
    for several years. In 1820, Gov. Cass, then administering the
    government of Michigan Territory and exercising jurisdiction over
    Indian affairs, obtained the sanction of the general government to
    visit the region. He left Detroit, with a party of thirty-eight men,
    including the gentlemen composing his suit, during the latter part of
    May. He was supplied for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> a journey of four months. After traversing
    the coasts of Lake Huron, and visiting Michilimackinac, he proceeded
    north-westward, by ascending the primitive summit at the Falls of St.
    Mary, went through the extended and picturesque basin of Lake Superior,
    and first struck the waters of the Upper Mississippi at Sandy Lake. To
    this point he was accompanied by the military escort, and by the train
    of larger canoes employed to transport stores and baggage. But the
    fatigues which the men had undergone in crossing portages, added to the
    low state of the water, induced him to form a permanent encampment at
    this place. And he proceeded with a select party, in canoes to explore
    the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>It was the middle of July when the expedition reached Sandy Lake, and
    the difficulty of subsisting so large a party in so remote a position,
    with the constant claims of suffering and hungry tribes, who presented
    themselves at every point, began to be severely felt. The exploring
    party, which was now organized, went out, under a sense of these
    circumstances, and with a feeling of the responsibility pressing upon
    the claims of the expedition in other quarters, which limited the time
    applicable to the ascent. They entered the Mississippi on the 17th
    of the month, and found a strong current, with alluvial banks, and a
    vegetation indicative of a fertile soil. For the distance of about
    one hundred and fifty miles, above this point, the party found no
    diminution in the average strength of the current, which was frequently
    accelerated by rapids. The latter then assumed a more formidable aspect
    for ten or a dozen miles, at the end of which they were terminated
    by the falls of Peckágama. At this cataract, the river, which below
    has its course through alluvial banks, densely wooded, is compressed
    between rocks of granulated quartz, over which it rushes with a
    velocity, which would seem to threaten destruction to any species of
    craft that should attempt the descent. It became necessary, at this
    point, to transport the canoes and baggage from two to three hundred
    yards over land.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

  <p>On reaching the Peckágama summit, the channel of the Mississippi
    was found to flow more directly from the west, with a comparatively
    sluggish current. But the most distinctive trait of this part of the
    river was found to consist of a series of extensive savannahs, through
    which the river displays itself in the most elaborate windings. The
    junction of the Leech Lake branch takes place at this plateau, at the
    computed distance of fifty-five miles above the falls. After passing
    this point, the course of the river is again, generally, from the
    north-west, about forty-five miles to Lake Winnipec, a handsome body
    of clear water, estimated to be ten miles broad. The course of the
    ascent is then west, for about fifty miles, at which distance the
    river is found expanded into a more considerable lake, presenting
    an area of limpid water of, perhaps, 120 square miles. This sheet,
    which has subsequently been found to be the largest expansion of the
    Mississippi, is since denominated Cass Lake. It was the highest point
    reached. The party entered it on the 21st of July. The question of
    pursuing the stream further, was then submitted by Gov. Cass, to the
    gentlemen composing his party. Anxious as all were to see the actual
    source of so celebrated a stream, their wishes were controlled by
    circumstances. Inconveniences had been felt from leaving the supplies
    at so considerable a distance below, and as the waters were found to
    be low, and the preparations inadequate for a journey of indefinite
    extent, a decisive opinion was expressed in favor of a return from this
    point. This decision was immediately carried into effect.</p>

  <p>From the best information that could be obtained, the Mississippi
    was represented to have its origin in a lake called <i>La Biche</i>,
    supposed to be sixty miles distant, in a north-west direction. Upon
    this estimate, the length of the river was computed to be 3038 miles,
    and by a series of approximate estimates, its altitude placed at 1330
    feet above the Atlantic. Numerous rapids and lakes were, however,
    stated to exist in this remote part of the stream, and a degree of
    vagueness and uncertainty exhibited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> in relation to it, which evinced,
    that the traders, who were relied on for information, either, had
    seldom frequented it, or preserved an indefinite recollection of its
    geographical features.</p>

  <p>Such was the state of public information on this point in 1820. A
    veil of obscurity was still cast about the actual source of the
    Mississippi, which there was no further attempt to remove for ten or
    eleven years. In 1830, the writer of these sheets was directed to
    proceed into the Chippewa country, north-west of Lake Superior, in the
    execution of duties connected with Indian affairs. But the instructions
    were received so late in the season, that their execution became
    impracticable until the next year. In the mean time, means for more
    extensive observation were provided, a physician and botanist engaged,
    and a small detachment of troops, under the command of a subaltern,
    ordered to form a part of the expedition.</p>

  <p>This expedition numbering twenty-seven persons, exclusive of guides and
    Indian auxiliaries, employed on the portages, left St. Mary’s at the
    foot of Lake Superior, late in June 1831. After entering, and coursing
    around the shores of Lake Superior to Lapointe, it was found, from
    every representation, that the low state of the water on the Upper
    Mississippi, would render it difficult, if not impracticable, to reach
    the bands at its sources, during the drought of summer. Public reasons
    were, at the same time, urgent for visiting the interior bands, located
    between the group of islands at the head of Lake Superior, and the
    Mississippi—where a useless and harassing conflict was kept up between
    the Sioux and Chippewa nations.</p>

  <p>The expedition returned eight miles on its track, and entered the
    mouth of Mushkigo, or Mauvais river of Lake Superior. This stream,
    which carries down the waters of an extensive slope of highlands, is
    embarrassed with permanent rafts of flood wood, and with numerous
    rapids, presenting an arduous ascent. The axe, the canoe-pole, and the
    carrying-strap, were alternately employed in the ascent, and they were
    employed under the influence of the midsummer’s heat, and the annoyance
    of the hordes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> of smaller insects, who are on the wing, in this
    secluded valley, during the greater part of the twenty-four hours. This
    stream was ascended one hundred and four miles, to the portage. The
    goods and canoes were then carried 8¾ miles, across highlands, to a
    lake called Kaginógumoc, or the Longwater; and thence by four separate
    portages, and three intervening lakes, to the Namakágon river. The
    latter was descended one hundred and sixty-one miles, to its junction
    with the St. Croix, of which it is the right fork, and the channel of
    the latter pursued to Yellow River. From this point, where a public
    council was convened, the expedition re-ascended the Namakágon to the
    portage into <i>lac Courtorielle</i>, or Ottawa Lake. This portage
    consists of a carrying place of three miles and a lake, then another
    carrying place of 750 yards and a lake, from the latter of which there
    is a navigable outlet into the Ottawa for canoes.</p>

  <p>Ottawa Lake is a sheet of water about twelve miles long, having an
    outlet into the Chippewa river of the Upper Mississippi. In order,
    however, to visit certain hostile bands, a portage was made from this
    outlet (after following it down about half a day’s journey,) of 3½
    miles, into lac Chetac, the principal source of Red Cedar river. The
    latter was then pursued, through four principal expansions, called
    Wigwas, Warpool, Red Cedar and Rice Lakes, to its falls. A short
    portage over horizontal sand-rock, interrupts the navigation, after
    which there is a series of rapids, extending about 24 miles. Deep
    and strong water was then found to its junction with the Chippewa
    river, which it enters at the estimated distance of 40 miles from the
    confluence of the latter with the Mississippi, (on its eastern bank.)</p>

  <p>The entire line of country travelled by this interior route was 643
    miles. The Mushkigo, the St. Croix, and the Chippewa, were the rivers,
    which by their common origin and interlocking on the summit lands,
    afforded this communication. Many bands of Indians were visited in
    their fastnesses, where they had hitherto supposed themselves out of
    the reach of observation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> Councils were held at various points, and
    presents distributed. And the pauses afforded by these assemblages,
    and by the necessary delays of overland transportation, furnished
    opportunities for preserving notes on the manner of living, among
    those bands, and their population, traditions and resources, as well
    as the geographical features and the natural history of the country.
    On entering the Mississippi, the truth of the information, derived on
    Lake Superior, respecting its depressed state, was verified. Extensive
    portions of its outer channel and bars, were found exposed and dry. The
    party encamped on a sand bar formed by the junction of the Chippewa,
    which is usually several feet under water.</p>

  <p>From the mouth of the Chippewa, the expedition descended the
    Mississippi to Galena, in Illinois. While at Prairie du Chien, the
    murder of twenty-six Monomonee men, women, and children, by a war
    party of the Sacs and Foxes, which had transpired a few days previous,
    was the subject of exciting interest. It was narrated with all its
    atrocious circumstances. A flag waved over the common grave of the
    slain, and several of the wounded Monomonees, who had escaped the
    massacre, were examined and conversed with. This affray unparalleled
    for its boldness and turpitude, having occurred in the village of
    Prairie du Chien, in the hearing of its inhabitants, and in sight of
    the fort, was made the subject of demand by the government for the
    surrendry of the murderers, and produced the concentration of troops
    on that frontier, which eventuated in the Indian war of 1832. Some
    excitement was also felt at Galena, and its vicinity, in consequence of
    the menacing attitude which the Sacs and Foxes had recently assumed,
    in the vicinity of Rock Island, and a general mistrust felt of their
    sincerity in the treaty concluded with the United States a short time
    previous.</p>

  <p>At Galena, the exploring party separated, part returning in canoes up
    the Wisconsin, and part crossing the mine country, over the branches of
    the Pekatolika, and by the way of the Blue Mounds, to fort Winnebago.
    From this point, Fox River was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> descended to Green Bay, and the route
    of the lake coast pursued northward to the straits, and to the Sault of
    St. Mary.</p>

  <p>A narrative of this expedition, embracing its principal incidents, and
    observations on the productions of the country, is in preparation for
    publication by one of the gentlemen of the party. In the mean time, the
    official report transmitted to Government, and submitted to Congress by
    the War Department, together with remarks in a series of letters on the
    mine country, are subjoined in the appendix to this volume.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in 1832, the plan of visiting the source of the Mississippi, was
    resumed. And a memoir for its execution, accompanied by estimates,
    forwarded to the Department of War, which received the sanction of the
    Hon. L. Cass, then placed at the head of that department. An expedition
    was accordingly organized, consisting of thirty persons, including
    an officer of the army, detached, with ten men, for topographical
    duty, a surgeon and geologist, an interpreter of the language, and a
    missionary to the north-western Indians, who was invited to accompany
    the exploring party. This expedition was based on a renewal of the
    effort to effect a permanent peace with the two principal Indian
    nations, who inhabit that region, and whose continued feuds, not only
    weaken and harass each other, but embarrass the trade, interrupt
    the execution of the intercourse laws, and involve the lives and
    property of the frontier inhabitants. Additional weight was given
    to these considerations, by the unquiet state of the Indians on the
    Upper Mississippi, which broke out in open hostility during the year.
    These reasons were connected with the supervision of the trade, the
    acquisition of statistical facts, and the carrying into effect an act
    of Congress of that year, for exten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>ding the benefits of vaccination
    to the Indian tribes. To which end it was enjoined “to proceed to the
    country on the heads of the Mississippi, and to visit as many Indians
    in that, and the intermediate region, as circumstances would permit.”</p>

  <p>This expedition, to the account of which the present volume is devoted,
    left St. Mary’s on the 7th of June, 1832. As the route through
    Lake Superior, and thence north-west, on the waters of the Upper
    Mississippi, to Cass Lake, has been described in a “Narrative Journal
    of Travels in the North-west,” of 1820, heretofore published by the
    author, no details of the geography of the country then passed over
    and described, or of the ordinary incidents of a journey through this
    portion of the country, will be given. A brief sketch, however, of
    the general route, will serve to refresh the memory of readers whose
    attention has been before called to the subject, and cannot but prove
    acceptable to all, who feel an interest in the development of its
    natural features and character.</p>

  <p>The village of the Sault of St. Mary’s is situated on the communication
    which connects Lake Huron with Lake Superior, fifteen miles below
    the foot of the latter. A strong and continued rapid, over shelving
    sand rock, interrupts the navigation for vessels. The water has been
    computed to sink its level, twenty two feet ten inches, at this place.
    A portage exceeding half a mile, enables boats to proceed beyond.
    The river above has a brisk current, which is imperceptibly lost on
    entering between the two prominent capes, which form the opening into
    Lake Superior.</p>

  <p>This lake, which is called Igomi, Chigomi, and Gitchigomi, by the
    Indians, as the term is more or less abbreviated, is remarkable for
    its extent, its depth, and the purity of its waters. It lies in a
    basin of trap rocks, with alternations of the granite and sand stone
    series. No variety of calcareous rock is present,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and its waters
    are consequently free from impregnations from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>this source. As it
    is the largest and the purest of the series of lakes it is also the
    highest in position; its altitude being computed at 640 feet above
    the Atlantic. Its banks are diversified with mural precipices, with
    extensive deposits of marine sand, and with beds of mixed detritus. Its
    immediate margin is loaded with primitive boulders and pebble-stones,
    alternating with shores of yellow and of iron sand. Several bold
    mountains of primitive construction, stand near the central parts of
    its south shores, which are in striking contrast with the ruin-like,
    walled masses, of horizontal structure, which characterize other parts.
    Among the detritus of its shores are still occasionally found masses of
    native copper, which are now referred to the trap formation.</p>

  <p>Of a body of water so irregular in its shape and imperfectly defined,
    it may be vague to speak of its superficial area, but this may be
    assumed to cover 30,000 square miles. It embraces numerous islands,
    the largest of which are Grand, Royal, and Magdalen islands. It has
    several noble harbors, bays and inlets, and receives numerous rivers.
    It abounds with fish, the most noted of which are white-fish, sturgeon,
    and salmon-trout. But by far the most valuable product of its present
    commerce, is its furs and peltries. The Indian population of its
    immediate shores, is not great. Exclusive of bands located on the heads
    of its rivers, it does not exceed 1006 souls, to which may be added 436
    for the American side of the St. Mary’s river. Their trade is conducted
    by 15 clerks, licensed by the Indian department, employing 70 boatmen,
    interpreters and runners. Recently a mission has been established on
    Magdalen Island (<i lang="fr">La Pointe</i> of the traders,) by the American
    Board of Foreign Missions, and the gospel began to be preached to the
    natives. The estimated population which, in a comprehensive view,
    should be added for the south shores, extending to the borders of the
    Winnebago and Monomonee lands, and running west, to the Sioux line, is,
    for the northern curve of Green Bay, 210; heads of the Monomonee and
    Wisconsin rivers, 342; the Chip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>pewa river and its tributaries, 1376;
    the St. Croix and its tributaries, 895; Grand Portage, and Rainy Lake,
    476; to which latter may perhaps be added, 249, making, with the former
    estimates, 5000 souls.</p>

  <p>In travelling through this lake, in boats or canoes, the shores are
    followed round. The distance from Point Iroquois to the entrance of the
    St. Louis river of Fond du Lac, is estimated at 490 miles, exclusive
    of the journey around the peninsula of Keweena, which is ninety miles
    more. The general course is nearly due west, in consequence of which,
    the climate is deemed to be decidedly more favorable to agriculture at
    its head than at its outlet. Traders, who course round the peninsula
    in boats, take, on an average, twenty-six days in the voyage. Fifteen
    were employed on the present expedition. Indians were met at various
    points, and wherever it was practicable, they were vaccinated. The
    surgeon employed on that service reported 699 vaccinations on the
    voyage through the lake, and experienced no difficulty in getting them
    to submit to the process.</p>

  <p>At the mouth of the Ontonagon, where the party arrived on the 19th
    of June, a band of Indians was encamped on its way out, from Ottawa
    lake. Mozojeed, their chief, confirmed a report of the murder of an
    <i lang="fr">engagé</i>, or under clerk, named Brunet, by a Chippewa, named Waba
    Annimikee, or the White Thunder. He said that he had concurred with
    the traders in apprehending the Indian, and bringing him out to be
    delivered up to the Indian agent. But that he had effected his escape
    on the Mauvais Portage. He promised to exert himself to re-apprehend
    him, the following year. And he rigidly performed his promise. In July,
    1833, the White Thunder was delivered by Mozojeed and his followers, to
    the civil authorities. He was tried for the murder at the U. S. circuit
    court holden at Michilimackinac, in that month. Counsel being assigned
    to defend him, every advantage was secured to him that the laws
    provide. His own confessions were proved, to substantiate the murder,
    and on these he was convicted.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

  <p>He made no defence whatever on the trial, silently submitting to the
    determinations of his counsel. When judgment had been pronounced, he
    arose, and, through an interpreter, stated to the judge the reasons
    which had actuated him. He observed, that after aiding Brunet, on a
    certain occasion, in carrying his goods to the banks of a river, he
    had taken a canoe bound there, (being his <em>own</em> canoe) to cross
    the stream. For this Brunet threatened him, and <em>shook a tomahawk
    over his head</em>. On another occasion, having sold Brunet a shaved
    deer-skin, he asked him (as is customary after getting payment) for
    tobacco; but he replied abusively, that he did not give tobacco to
    <em>such scaly dogs</em>. Not long afterwards, being engaged in playing
    at the Indian game of bowl, Brunet took him by the hair, <em>on the
    crown of his head</em>, and shook him. Finally, on the morning of the
    day of the murder, Brunet had struck him on the chin, with violence.
    This, together with the other indignities, took place in the presence
    of the Indians, in whose eyes he was, consequently, disgraced. In the
    afternoon of that day, Brunet went back from the lake on which they
    were encamped, into the forest to procure some birch bark for making
    flambeaux for fishing. The White Thunder secretly followed him. He
    observed him tie up a roll of bark, put it across his shoulders, and
    commence his return. He soon crossed a log which lay in his path. The
    Indian quickly followed him, mounting the same log, and, from this
    elevation, raised his gun and deliberately shot him in the back. He
    fell dead.
  </p>

  <p>At <i lang="fr">La Pointe</i>, the party were introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Hall,
    missionaries, who, with Mr. Ayer, had proceeded to this place, in 1831,
    to establish a mission among the Chippewas. Mrs. Hall had presented to
    her husband a daughter during their residence, which is believed to
    be the first child of white parents, both by father and mother, ever
    born within the precincts of this lake. The mission had encountered no
    unforeseen obstacles in its first efforts. It has since been enlarged
    in its means and the number of its laborers, and promises to exert a
    happy influence in the region.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

  <p>It is interesting to observe the dawning of the gospel at a spot, which
    has been long noted as the scene of Indian trade, and the rallying
    point of Indian war parties. It is at this place, the Chegoimegon
    of early writers, that tradition places the ancient council fire of
    the Chippewa nation. And here resided the presiding chief, called
    Mudjikiwis, or Waishki, who exercised the sovereign power over a rude
    confederation of local tribes, whose dissolution, or separation into
    independent fragments, may be traced to the right of each chieftain of
    declaring a negative to any decision, and silently withdrawing his aid,
    for the time being. Personal influence and authority may be supposed
    to have counteracted this defect, while the tribe was small, as
    tradition represents it to have been when it first migrated from <em>the
    east</em>, to this lake; but its increase and spread over the adjacent
    country, would naturally destroy so feeble a tie of political power,
    and must soon have left each local band as it now remains, independent
    and sovereign in its acts. Yet the voice of tradition refers to this
    era of the reign of the Mudjikiwis as one of comparative splendor.
    Although republican in all that is left of their institutions, the
    succession of the Mudjikiwis is said to have been hereditary among the
    Chippewas, and the descendants of this magistrate, who yet exist at
    Chegoimegon, evince a pride of ancestry which we should only look for,
    among feudal or despotic nations. The last person who may be said to
    have exercised this office was Mongazid, (or Mamongazida,) who was in
    high favor with the French. He is represented to have visited Quebec
    in the time of Montcalm, and to have been an actor in the final battle
    in which that distinguished commander fell. His son Wahbojeeg, or the
    White Fisher, succeeded him as the ruling chieftain of the band, and
    eminently distinguished himself as a war leader. He died in 1793, after
    having been greatly instrumental in driving his cousins-german, the
    Foxes, from the Chippewa country. The present chieftain, Chi Waishki,
    alias Pizhickee, or the Buffalo, is the representative of this line.
    He said to the Indian Agent, who, by direction of the commissioners at
    the treaty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> Fond du Lac, in 1826, invested him with a silver medal,
    “What need I of this! It is known whence I am descended.”</p>

  <p>But there is no space for these reminiscences. Many scattered parties
    of Chippewas were encountered east of this point, interspersed with the
    loaded boats of the traders, bringing out their annual returns. Some of
    the parties were bound to the British post of Penetanguishine, others,
    to St. Mary’s or Michilimackinac. Chi Waishki, the chief above alluded
    to, was met at Keweena, on his way to visit the Agency. He expressed
    his regret that the agent would not be there, evinced a strong interest
    in the object of the expedition, and presented a peace-pipe, as the
    evidence of his friendship. At the mouth of the river Brule, a small
    party of the Chippewas was encountered, from the sources of the
    Mississippi. It turned out to be the family of Ozawindib, one of the
    principal Chippewas, from Cass Lake. He was persuaded to return, and
    proved himself to be a trusty and experienced guide through the most
    remote and difficult parts of the route.</p>

  <p>The expedition entered the mouth of the St. Louis river on the
    23d of June. The ascent of this stream is attended with separate
    portages of nine, and of three miles. There is, finally, a portage
    of six miles across a sandy tract, which separates the Lake Superior
    from the Mississippi waters, making 18 miles of land carriage. The
    other portions of the route consist of rapid water, much of which is
    shallow and interspersed with sharp rocks, requiring both strength and
    dexterity in the men to manage the canoes, and to repair them when
    injured. A part of the summit portage, immediately after quitting the
    Savanne river, consists of bog, the sod of which being cut through,
    it becomes necessary to wade in a pathway of mud and water, portions
    of which, are mid-thigh deep. The entire distance from Lake Superior
    to the Mississippi, estimating from water to water, is 150 miles. The
    expedition spent about ten days on this part of the route, and reached
    the trading house of Mr. Aitkin, on the banks of the Mississippi, on
    the 3rd of July. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> remained there, until the evening of the 4th,
    giving Lieut. Allen, who was in command of the troops, an opportunity
    to fire a salute in honor of the day, to the no small gratification of
    the Indians, who, being apprized of the occasion, thronged the banks of
    the river to witness the ceremony.</p>

  <p>Sandy Lake has been a post of importance in the fur trade from the
    earliest French times, being one of the central seats of Indian
    power on the Upper Mississippi. An assassination occurred here in
    1785, which affords a striking illustration of the evils of using
    ardent spirits in the Indian country. Mr. Kay, the victim of Indian
    resentment on this occasion, was a gentleman of Montreal, who had
    come out with an adventure of Indian goods, into this region. After
    passing the winter on the waters of the Mississippi, he awaited the
    assembling of his clerks at this place, and employed himself in closing
    the spring business with the Indians, preparatory to his return to
    Michilimackinac. On the 2nd of May, he was informed of the near arrival
    of one of his clerks, and prepared to go and meet him. The sequel is
    given in a translation of the words of an eye witness, whose manuscript
    account is before the author.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <p>“Mr. Kay said that he would himself go, although somewhat fatigued by
    the continual running of the Indians, the night previous. On parting
    he told me to draw some rum, of which he took a stout drink. And as
    he knew there was no rum at the post of Pine river, when he left Mr.
    Harris, he thought a dram would be pleasing to him also; for which
    reason he told me to fill one of the flagons of his liquor case, to
    take with him. And he gave me orders to give the Indians no drink
    during his absence, which was difficult, because they were already
    tipsey.</p>

  <p>“The Indians had given me the name of The Writer, which they are
    accustomed to do to all whom they observe writing. As soon as Mr. Kay
    had gone, I did not want for visits, his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span><i>savagesse</i> remaining
    in the tent with me. A great many Indians came in; among the number
    was Katawabida and Mongozid, who said to me, “Writer, give us rum!” I
    told them that I could not—that I was not master. They tormented me a
    long time. Mongozid threw to me a pair of <i>metasses</i>, which he had
    got on credit, and had not paid for, (for he was a poor paymaster,)
    demanding rum for them. I told him, no! He then talked with Mr. Kay’s
    woman, who was tired of them, as well as myself. She begged me to give
    them a little, after which they went out of the tent.</p>

  <p>“Within an hour after <i lang="fr">Le Barrique Eau</i> arrived, and told me
    that Mr. Harris and Mr. Pinot had actually arrived at the fish-dam.
    The Indians, one and all, set up a shout of joy, and ran to the
    beach to receive them. They did not however, meet with a very good
    reception, the flagon Mr. Kay had taken with him having intoxicated
    the whole party. They debarked, and while Mr. Harris was getting his
    tent pitched, Mr. Kay entered mine and took a glass in my presence.
    Mr. Harris was quite noisy. To complete the scene, the ferocity of
    <i lang="fr">Cul Blanc</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (an Indian unfriendly to Mr. K.) had returned. He
    had persuaded <em>Le Cousin</em> to stab Mr. Kay, in the course of the
    winter, saying to him, that he had not courage enough himself to do it.
    The other gloried in being equal to the commission of a crime, which he
    had promised to perpetrate when they came together.
  </p>

  <p>“The Cul Blanc was sitting, with many others, on a hillock, before
    the fire, smoking, directly before Mr. Kay’s tent. Le Cousin got up
    and went towards the tent, at the entrance of which he met Mr. Kay.
    Mr. Kay’s bed was placed across, opposite the pole supporting the
    tail-piece of his tent. The barrel of rum was behind the bed, in the
    bottom of the tent. Mr. Kay saw him coming, as he was going to take
    a seat beside me on the bed. At this moment Le Cousin entered. He
    tendered his hand, and asked for rum. Mr. Kay, who did not like the
    man, answered, “No! You do not pay your credits! You <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>shall have none!
    Go out, immediately!” With this, he took him by the arm, and conducted
    him out of the tent. On turning round to re-enter, the Indian, who
    was armed with a knife, which he had concealed under a <i lang="fr">mantelet de
    calmande</i>, gave him a stab in the back of the neck. He then retired
    towards the camp fire, which was surrounded by a great many Indians and
    our men. I got up immediately, hearing the scream of his wife, whom I
    perceived in front of me. “Have you been stabbed?” I inquired of Mr.
    Kay. “Yes!” he replied, “but he shall pay for it.” So saying he put his
    hand in the mess-basket and drew out a large, pointed table knife, with
    which he sallied furiously from the tent, without my being able to stop
    him. The Indians seeing the knife in his hand, asked the cause of it.
    He said that Le Cousin had stabbed him, and that he was in search of
    him to kill him. But Le Cousin had taken refuge in his own lodge which
    was near our camp. Mr. Kay went towards the lodge. We ran after him to
    prevent some fatal accident. The tumult was, by this time, very great.
    Great numbers were collected from all sides, and all, both French and
    Indians, bereft of their reason, for it was in the midst of a general
    carouse. In a moment, every one seized his arms, and there was a motley
    display of knives, guns, axes, cudgels, war-clubs, lances, &amp;c. I found
    myself greatly at a non-plus, for I had not before witnessed such
    a scene. I saw so many preparations that I judged we should have a
    serious time.</p>

  <p>“Mr. Kay pursued Le Cousin, but before he could reach him, the passage
    to his lodge was blocked up by the crowd. Le Cousin’s mother asked him
    what he wanted. “Englishman!” said she, “do you come to kill me?” She
    made her way among the crowd, armed with a small knife, and reached
    the spot where Mr. Kay was standing, without any one’s observing the
    knife, for she came in an humble attitude imploring Mr. Kay for the
    life of her son. In a moment, Mr. Kay cried out, in a loud voice, “I am
    killed,” and he fell. We entered, and found that she had struck him in
    the side, making an incision of more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> than three inches. We now took
    him to his tent, bathed in his blood. We laid him on his bed, which in
    a moment, was soaking with his blood.</p>

  <p>“At this moment his friend <i lang="fr">Le Petit Mort</i>, (Jeebyains) who had
    been tipsey and gone to sleep, started up. He ran to Mr. Kay’s tent,
    where the first object he saw, was his friend pale and quivering. He
    went and embraced him amidst a flood of tears, saying, “My friend, you
    are dead, but I survive to revenge you.” In contemplating a calico
    night-gown which Mr. Kay had on when he was wounded, and which was all
    bloody, he could no longer restrain his anger. He took up the knife
    which Mr. Kay had, at the time he was wounded, and which had been
    brought back by his wife, who was present. He sallied out of the tent
    to seek revenge, not of Le Cousin,—who was the instrument, but not the
    author of the murder—but of Cul Blanc, who was sitting before the fire,
    smoking his pipe. He seized him by the scalp-lock, drew his body back
    with one hand, exclaiming, “Die, thou dog!” with the other hand, he
    plunged a knife into his breast, Cul Blanc begging all the while for
    mercy.</p>

  <p>“This scene of carnage put a stop to the drinking. The women spilled
    out all the rum, of which there was still no small quantity in the
    different lodges. The stab Cul Blanc had received did not prove mortal,
    notwithstanding the ghastliness of the wound, the knife having passed
    out through the flesh without penetrating any vital part. But the blood
    issued copiously and disfigured his wife, who carried him off, trailing
    his blood through the camp.</p>

  <p>“This tragedy being finished, Le Petit Mort re-entered the tent. He
    told his wife, who followed him, to go and search for certain roots,
    which he chewed and formed into a cataplasm for the wound, after having
    applied his mouth to it, and sucked out the extravasated blood, an
    operation that caused Mr. Kay great pain. He enjoyed a little ease
    during the remainder of the night and following day. Le Petit Mort
    passed the night opposite to his bed. The next day he took off the
    compress, and re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>placed it by another, after having once more sucked
    out the blood and cleaned the wound. The patient became so exhausted
    by this dressing, that for the space of half an hour he lost all
    recollection. When he regained his senses he felt easier, and asked for
    the Bras Casse, (the chief of the band,) who had not yet heard what had
    happened, for the Indians had been occupied in drinking, and he had
    been getting ready to depart, having only delayed a little, to give
    some game to the Frenchmen. He came to the field of these atrocities,
    entered Mr. Kay’s tent, and gave him his hand, saying, “My friend, your
    misfortune has given me much pain. If I had been here, it would not
    have taken place. One thing, however, consoles me. It is, that I had
    not gone off; you may depend on my best efforts to restore you.” Mr.
    Kay accepted his offer, having confidence in him, and in his skill in
    the medical art, in which he was very expert. He resolved to take him
    along with him on his route to Mackinac, to take care of him.</p>

  <p>“On the third of May, the Bras Casse took him in hand, and began to
    apply his medicines, which were found to be efficacious. After letting
    him repose a little, he told him he would cure him, but in order to do
    this he must consent to bridle his appetites. He must abstain from the
    use of pepper and salt in his food; he must guard against drinking,
    <i lang="fr">de ne point toucher des femmes</i>. The next day Mr. Kay was a
    little better. He sent for M. Harris and myself to come to his tent, to
    receive his orders. He said to us: “Gentlemen, you see my situation. I
    do not know whether God will spare my life or not. I have determined
    to leave you, and at all hazards to set out for Mackinac with seven
    men, accompanied by the Bras Casse and his wife, to take care of me
    on the road. Assort the remainder of the goods, and ascend to Leech
    Lake, and wait there for the return of the Pillagers, who are out on
    the prairies. In short, complete the inland trade. Mr. Pinot is too
    feeble an opponent to do you much injury. I confide in the capacity
    of you both.” A few moments afterwards Mr. Harris went out, when he
    said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> to me particularly, taking hold of my hands—“My dear friend, you
    understand the language of the Chippewas. Mr. Harris would go with
    me, but he must accompany you. He is a good trader, but he has, like
    myself and others, a strong passion for drinking, which takes away his
    judgment. On these occasions, advise him. I will myself speak to him
    before my departure. Prepare every thing to facilitate our passage over
    the portages and along the lake. I shall set out to-morrow. I find
    myself better every day.”
  </p>

  <p>“I left him with his physician, and went to distribute the provisions
    and lading for two inland canoes, one for Mr. Kay, and one for the four
    men who were to take the furs from Pine river, consisting of 19 packs
    of 80 lbs. each, and four packs of deer skins, to serve as seats for
    Mr. Kay’s men. The next day Mr. Kay was a little better, which diffused
    pleasure among us all. I constructed a litter (<i lang="fr">un broncard</i>) for
    two men to carry him over the portages, and he set out the same day,
    being the 5th of May, about two o’clock, in the afternoon. Mr. Pinot
    also departed the same day. Bras Casse and his wife departed about sun
    set.”</p>

  <p>The sequel of this tale is briefly told. Mr. Kay reached Mackinac,
    where Capt. Robinson, then in command, had a second operation performed
    on him by the post surgeon. He afterwards closed his business, and went
    to Montreal. A suppuration of his wound, however, took place at the
    Lake of Two Mountains, which terminated his life on the 26th of August,
    1785, three months and twenty-four days after receiving the wound.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">At</span> Sandy Lake the expedition made its general arrangements for the
    route. Most of the Indians at that post being absent, with their
    principal Chief, on the plains near the junction of the Des Corbeau,
    it was determined to assemble them at that point, so as to meet the
    expedition on its return down the Mississippi, and to deposit at Sandy
    Lake House, the presents intended for distribution to this band,
    together with the supplies required for the home route. These were
    placed in charge of a trusty person, with directions to proceed down
    the river with them, to the Isle Des Corbeau, in season to meet the
    party at that place on the 24th July. Relieved of this portion of the
    burthen of transportation, it was then settled that the expedition
    should go up the Mississippi, through all its windings, to Cass Lake;
    there make a final deposit of the remainder of its heavy baggage,
    and fit out a select exploring party, in light canoes, to ascend to
    its actual source. This point fixed, the party would again descend
    to Cass Lake, thence, cross the interior, by a route, represented
    to be practicable, to Leech Lake, and from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> latter, strike
    south-westwardly, falling on a series of portages and lakes leading to
    the head of the great Des Corbeau, or Crow Wing River. This river it
    was proposed to follow down its entire length, to its entrance into the
    Mississippi, the point fixed on, for assembling the Sandy Lake, Pine
    River, and Mille Lac Indians.</p>

  <p>In conformity with these arrangements, the party left Sandy Lake House,
    on the afternoon of the 4th of July, having previously ascertained the
    width of the Mississippi, at that place, to be 331 feet. The evening
    of this day and the two following days, were employed in reaching
    the vicinity of the Peckagama Falls, against a brisk current, with
    occasional rapids. They made a portage on the 7th over the Granular
    Quartz ridge, producing the Falls, and encamped the same evening at
    Point aux Chenes, in the savannahs above. The next day, being the
    Sabbath, was passed at that point. While there, a French <i lang="fr">engagé</i>
    arrived from Leech Lake, being on his way to Sandy Lake. Advantage was
    taken of this opportunity, to send directions for the hastening the
    meeting of the Indians at <i lang="fr">Isle Des Corbeau</i>, by the space of
    two days, as the waters were found even more favorable, than had been
    anticipated.</p>

  <p>This man, whose name was La Plante, confirmed reports which had been
    current at Fond du Lac and at Sandy Lake, of the going out of a
    strong war party of the Leech Lake Indians against the Sioux. But he
    added, that the party, which had been headed by the popular Chief,
    Aishkibugikozh, or the Geulle Platte, had returned, bringing, as a
    trophy of their victory, three Sioux scalps. He also reported the
    attack of a hostile party of Indians, supposed to be Sioux, on the
    outskirts of the Pembina settlement, where they scalped a girl, in
    open day, but were pursued by a party of Chippewas, overtaken in the
    act of crossing a stream, and lost several men. It was found, by
    subsequent information, of an authentic character, that the attacking
    party, on this occasion, were Mandans, and that it consisted of forty
    men. They crossed the river Pembina, at the point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> its junction
    with Red River, on a raft, went down the latter about four miles, and
    concealed themselves in the vicinity of a trading house, at which there
    were several lodges of Chippewas. After waiting a definite time, and
    finding no opportunity to effect their purpose, they resolved to return
    to the raft at the crossing of the river, leaving a select party to
    make a sally upon the Chippewas. This party met the girl, tore off
    her scalp in haste, and fled to rejoin their companions at the raft.
    But as the girl was not killed, the alarm was immediately given. Nine
    Chippewas started in the pursuit. They overtook and fired upon the
    Mandans, killing one man, and driving them in to their main party. The
    latter, in the mean time, had tied their guns together and laid them
    on the raft, preparatory to crossing. Being suddenly roused by the war
    whoop, in their midst, and without arms, they plunged into the Pembina,
    and swam across. During this effort, they were fired upon by their
    pursuers, who killed two more of their number. One of these succeeded
    in gaining the opposite bank, and was carried a short distance by his
    companions before he expired. His body was left. The remainder of
    the party pursued their flight. But they were without the means of
    subsistence, for they had lost their arms. A new calamity overtook
    them. The Sioux (who were also their enemies, as well as the enemies of
    the Chippewas,) fell upon them, and, in their defenceless state, killed
    thirty-six men. The survivor reached his people on the Missouri to
    narrate the disaster.</p>

  <p>The expedition pursued its way on the 9th. The ascent of this part of
    the river, being through a series of savannahs, the guides availed
    themselves of an intimate knowledge of the country, and the high state
    of the water, to avoid numerous curves, which would have consumed much
    time in coursing around, and led the way through extensive fields of
    reeds and grass, assuming the character of semi-lakes. Not far above
    Oak Point, a side route was taken, through a lake called the Bogottowa,
    or <i lang="fr">Lac a le Crosse</i>. This lake, which is a clear and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> pleasant
    sheet of water of some ten miles in extent, receives a small but narrow
    creek at its head, noted for its helices, which is ascended to a small
    lake terminating a few hundred yards east of the Little Winnipec Lake
    of the Mississippi. The portage is through a fine forest. By taking
    this route the circuitous south bend of the Mississippi, at the
    entrance of the Leech Lake branch, was avoided, and the better part of
    a day’s travel saved. Day light was still undiminished, when the party
    reached the minor trading post of Winnipec House, where they encamped.</p>

  <p>The following queries were put to the Clerk in charge of this post,
    respecting the opposition trade, and the traffic in ardent spirits.</p>

  <p>1st. Do the Hudson’s Bay Clerks cross the American lines from the post
    of Rainy Lake, for the purposes of trade? Ans. No. They furnish goods
    to Indians who go trading into the American territories.</p>

  <p>2d. Do the Partners, or Clerks of the Hudson’s Bay Company, present
    flags and medals to Indians? Ans. Yes.</p>

  <p>3d. Do they give such flags and medals to Indians living within the
    American lines? Ans. No. I have heard that they took away an American
    flag given to an Indian on the United States’ borders of Rainy Lake,
    tore it, and burnt it, and gave him a British flag instead.</p>

  <p>4th. Was the Hudson’s Bay Company’s post on Rainy Lake, supplied with
    ardent spirits last season? (i.&nbsp;e. 1831 and 1832.) Ans. It was. They
    had about sixty kegs of highwines, which were shewn to some of our
    Indians, who went there, and Mr. Cameron, the person in charge of the
    post, said to them, that although their streams were high, from the
    melting of the snows, they should swim as high with liquor if the
    Indians required it.</p>

  <p>5th. What is the usual strength of the highwines? Ans. One keg is
    reduced to four.</p>

  <p>6th. Have the Indians sent on <i>derwin</i> by the Hudson’s Bay
    Company, approached near to your post? Ans. They have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> come very
    near—having been on the Turtle Portage, with goods.</p>

  <p>7th. Did they bring liquor thus far? Ans. No. The liquor is kept at
    Rainy Lake, to induce the Indians to visit that place with their furs.</p>

  <p>8th. Did the disposition made of the liquor, which the Secretary of War
    permitted the principal Factor of the Fond du Lac Department, to take
    in last year, (1831,) embrace the post of Winnipec? Ans. It did not.
    It was kept chiefly at Rainy Lake, and on the lines, to be used in the
    opposition trade.</p>

  <p>Another trader, inquired of, in the country below, observed that five
    Chiefs had been invested with medals and flags, by the British trader
    at <i lang="fr">Lac le Pluie</i>.</p>

  <p>The party traversed Lake Winnipec on the morning of the 10th, and
    entered and passed up the sand-hill bordered valley of the Mississippi,
    to Cass Lake, the entrance to which they reached about one o’clock,
    being eleven days earlier in the season than this lake had been
    visited by the light canoes of Gov. Cass, twelve years previous. The
    outlet of this lake, was ascertained to be 172 feet in width, with an
    estimated depth of eight feet; being over half the width of the river,
    immediately <em>below</em> the inlet of the Sandy Lake branch.</p>

  <p>At this point, being the <em>ultima Thule</em> of previous discovery,
    our narrative may assume a more personal character. The day was
    characterised by the striking warmth of the month of July in this
    latitude. The fore part of it had been spent in a diligent ascent
    of the Mississippi from Lake Winnipec; and the party reached the
    point of entrance, with a feeling of gratification, arising from the
    accomplishment of one of its objects. We halted a few moments, to allow
    the hindmost canoes to come up, so as to enter the Lake together. Oza
    Windib, or the Yellow Head, our Chippewa guide, had preceded the party
    a little, as he often did, to get the first glance of little bays and
    inlets, where water fowl are usually found. He had put his canoe ashore
    behind a small point, where he met a party of the Cass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> Lake band.
    Of this he kept us ignorant till turning the same point, that he might
    surprise us with an unexpected salute. The Indians then approached
    in their canoes in a body, with a welcome, which could hardly have
    been more cordial, had we been old friends. They represented their
    residence to be on a large island, bearing south-west from the entrance.
    And for this island we set forward, with every appliance. The Indians
    accompanied us, imparting a spirit of emulation to the men, by shouts
    and firing. In making this traverse, we left the mouth of Turtle river,
    (the spot of Gov. Cass’ landing in 1820,) on our right, and did not
    come near enough to the shore, distinctly to recognise its features.
    We were upwards of an hour in reaching the island, which is called
    Grand Island, or Colcaspi. On approaching it, a number of Indians
    were observed, running across an elevation, and pointing, with wild
    gestures, to a bay beyond. It was the best place of landing. They were
    assiduous in directing the men to the spot. They ranged themselves
    along the shore, fired a salute, and then came eagerly to the water’s
    edge, giving each one a hand, as he alighted from the canoe. He, who
    has formed his estimate of an Indian from the reading of books, in
    which he is depicted as cruel and morose, without any insight into his
    social character, need only to be ushered into a scene like this, to be
    convinced that he has contemplated an overshadowed picture. We found
    these Indians to be frank, cheerful, and confiding.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i032f" style="max-width: 131.75em;">

    <div class="caption">CASS LAKE<br />
    2978 miles above the Gulf of Mexico.</div>
  </div>

  <p>On ascending the elevation before referred to, it was found to be the
    site of an abandoned village, now covered partially with corn-fields,
    and overgrown, in other parts, with sumac and other shrubbery. The
    cutting down too much of the forest, and the consequent exposure to
    winds, had probably been their reason for removing the village to
    a more southerly and sheltered part of the island. An Indian town,
    all America over, is nothing but an assemblage of wigwams, built,
    exclusively to suit the particular convenience of the occupant, without
    right angled streets, for which (as they have no carts or waggons)
    they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> have no occasion, and they get thereby the additional advantage
    of having no clouds of dust blown up from the denuded surface. There is
    (as we should say) a public <em>square</em>, or rather, an open grassy
    spot, where councils and dances are held, and the ceremonies of the
    wabeno and medicine society performed. Hillocks and elevated grounds
    are selected for erecting their lodges on; and clumps of small trees
    and shrubs are sought. Large trees are avoided, for the simple reason,
    that they often loose a limb during windy weather, and are liable to be
    blown down by tempests. But the whole circular opening, constituting a
    town plat, is surrounded with forest, to shelter them, in summer and
    winter. Gardens are variously located, and generally without fences, as
    there are no domesticated cattle. Such, at least, was the town of Oza
    Windib, situated nearly a mile from the spot of our landing, to which
    he was welcomed, on his return, by groups of men, women, and children.
    The total population, as counted during our stay, was 157, and it does
    not, probably, at any time, exceed 200 or 250. They rely, in the main,
    on hunting for a subsistence, deriving considerable aid, as the season
    shifts, from fishing, the gathering of wild rice, and the products of
    small fields of corn and potatoes, cultivated by the women. We were
    assured that the corn crop was always relied on, and that seed corn
    is preserved from year to year, and has not been known to fail. About
    sixty miles northwest, at Red Lake, corn is stated by the traders, to
    be a profitable crop, and it is among the singularities of the fur
    trade, that this article has, within a few of the last years, been
    furnished in considerable quantity, from that lake, to the posts on the
    Upper Mississippi, and even as far east as Fond du Lac.</p>

  <p>The hunting grounds of Yellow Head’s band, embrace the extreme sources
    of the Mississippi, and his village is the last fixed location in the
    ascent. Part of them go to Lac Travers, and encamp there, for the
    purpose of making the winter hunt. And from this point, they ascend
    southerly, which carries them still further into the red deer and stag
    and hind country of (the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> absolute head of the Mississippi,) Itasca
    Lake. The furs and skins collected, are exchanged for goods with
    traders, who visit them annually in the fall, and remain during the
    winter. These goods are brought in canoes from Michilimackinac, an
    estimated distance, as travelled, of 1120 miles. Of this distance there
    are only 18¾ miles land carriage, separated into five portages, at
    distant points.</p>

  <p>We may observe in this singular facility of internal water
    communication, one of the primary reasons of the heads of the
    Mississippi, being supplied with Indian goods at first from Montreal,
    and afterwards from New-York. Not only were these facilities early
    found to exist, but it was the track of interior discovery, while
    the Mississippi itself opposed an obstacle to the trade, by its
    difficult navigation, and the unhealthiness of the climate of its lower
    latitudes. Political considerations, also, entered into the earlier
    arrangements. Indeed, whoever is curious to examine into this matter,
    will find the history of the fur trade in north-western America, to be
    intimately blended with the civil history of the country, for about
    two hundred and fifty years after its discovery. Dating this discovery
    from the arrival of Jaques Cartier in the gulf of St. Lawrence, in
    1534, (the first well settled era,) the traffic then commenced with
    the natives, and, soon assuming an engrossing character, may be traced
    through various modifications, up to the surrender of the lake posts
    to the American government in 1796. This momentous interval of two
    hundred and sixty-two years, is fraught with incidents of a deeply
    interesting character, which it will be sufficient here, to allude to.
    Through every change of things the fur trade continued to be, not only
    cherished, but formed one of the cardinal interests in the policy of
    the government which France and Great Britain successively exercised
    over this portion of North America. Under the French government the
    system was intimately connected with military and with missionary
    efforts, in a manner which was peculiar to that government. Licences
    to trade were granted by the governor general to superannuated
    officers, and other servants of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> crown, by whom they were sold out
    to enterprising individuals. These persons went inland to exchange
    their goods for furs, and first drew upon themselves the epithet of
    <i lang="fr">Couriers du Bois</i>. Great irregularities, however, existed. Civil
    and ecclesiastic power were alternately exerted to restrain them. And
    an order to prohibit the traffic in the article of brandy was issued by
    one of the French governors.</p>

  <p>Under English rule, local agents were authorised, in the name of the
    king, to oversee Indian affairs, grant licences, and exercise a general
    supervision over the trade. Serious difficulties arose in acquiring the
    confidence of the northern Indians after the fall of Quebec. But, after
    an interruption of four or five years, (say from ’59 to ’64,) including
    the period of Pontiac’s war, the trade gradually resumed its healthful
    action. French enterprise had spread it through the region of Lake
    Superior and the Upper Mississippi, to the banks of the Saskatchawine.
    Scottish intrepidity carried it to the mouths of the Mackenzie, and the
    Columbia.</p>

  <p>The date of American authority in the lake country, may be placed
    in 1796. It was, however, but feebly felt in its influence on the
    northwest fur trade, for several years. Congress first legislated on
    the subject in 1802, but four years afterwards Lieut. Pike, on reaching
    the Upper Mississippi, found it in the exclusive possession of the
    North West Company. The Indians were then as much attached to the
    English, as they had been to the French, in 1759. It cost the British
    crown the expenses of a war to gain this ascendancy, and the Americans
    were not permitted to succeed them, as the sovereign power over Indian
    territory, at a less hazard. The war of 1812, found all the northern
    tribes confederated with the English. Tecumseh had risen to re-act the
    part which Pontiac had failed to accomplish, fifty-two years before,
    namely, driving back the infringing power. This happened, in 1759, to
    be Great Britain; but in 1812, it was the United States. With less
    sterling capacity to organise and command, however, than his great
    prede<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>cessor had, and with the powerful resources of England to back
    him, he utterly failed. It was not till after this failure, and the
    re-establishment of American garrisons at Detroit and Michilimackinac,
    that the Jeffersonian Indian code of 1802, began to be put into effect
    in the north-west. In 1816, a law was passed by Congress to exclude
    foreigners from the trade. In 1819 St. Peter’s was established. In
    1820, Gov. Cass personally visited the tribes, and in 1822, a military
    post was advanced to St. Mary’s Falls, the most northern point occupied
    by the United States army.</p>

  <p>Although the North West Company had now transferred to an American
    company, organised by Mr. Astor, all their posts south and west
    of the lines of demarcation, they maintained, however, an active
    trade along the lines, and waged one of the most spirited and hard
    contested oppositions against the Hudson’s Bay Company, which has ever
    characterised a commercial rivalry. Lord Selkirk had now placed himself
    at the head of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and staked his character and
    resources on the maintenance of its territorial and commercial rights.
    It is no part of our object to go into details. Let it suffice, that
    he took Fort William on the 13th of August, 1816, carried his power
    over the region of Red river, where he planted a colony, and, after
    losing the lives of several of his most zealous agents and officers,
    (including the governor of his colony,) finally triumphed in asserting
    the rights of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and quieted, by an amalgamation
    of stocks, the claims of his intrepid rivals.</p>

  <p>One of the most painful atrocities which arose, in the course of
    this rivalry, was the murder of Owen Keveny. As the facts were
    subsequently detailed in a court of justice, they may be succinctly
    narrated. Mr. Keveny, a gentleman in the service of the Hudson’s Bay
    Company, was taken prisoner by the North West Company, in the summer
    of 1816; and ordered to be sent out from Red river to Montreal. On
    ascending the river Winnipec, (northwest of the Lake of the Woods,)
    he was finally put in charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> of a couple of <i lang="fr">engagés</i>, named
    Faye and La Point, in a canoe, with an Indian guide, called Joseph,
    Son-of-the-White-partridge, with directions to take him to Rainy Lake.
    By these he was landed on an island below the Dalles, where they
    slept. Next morning Keveny complained of being ill, and asked Faye
    to bring him some warm water. The latter, on coming to the beach,
    found that La Pointe, and the Indian, had put out into the stream. On
    being called, they came ashore and took in Faye, and all then went
    down the river together, abandoning Keveny on the island. A few days
    afterwards one of the <i lang="fr">engagés</i> in the canoe, quarrelled with the
    Indian, and the latter left them. They then turned about and began
    to ascend the river, but, having lost their guide, could not find
    their way, and soon encamped on a small island, resolved to wait till
    some canoe should pass. Four or five days had elapsed, when their
    expectations were answered, by the arrival of a light canoe, with two
    partners of the North West Company, and Charles de Reinhard, a clerk,
    and a <i lang="fr">Boisbrulè</i>, named Mainville, besides the Indian, Joseph,
    Son-of-the-White-partridge, who had fled from Faye and La Pointe, below.
    After a short halt, during which Mr. M‘Lellan, (a partner of the
    North West Company,) beat the two men with a canoe-pole, all embarked
    for Rainy Lake. The same day they met other canoes, from which they
    learned, that Keveny, whose life had been threatened by de Reinhard
    and others, had left the island, where he was first abandoned, and
    gone up the river five or six leagues, to another island situated
    above the Dalles. He was now the subject of engrossing interest and
    conversation. On reaching this, they found Keveny, as expected. Mr.
    Grant, one of the partners, landed, with others, and shook hands with
    him. They then embarked, leaving de Reinhard, Mainville, and Joseph,
    Son-of-the-White-Partridge, on the island with Keveny. After going two
    or three leagues further up the river, they encamped. Some time after
    landing, the report of a gun was heard in the direction they came from.
    In half an hour’s time, a canoe came from the same direction, having
    in it de Reinhard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> Mainville, and Joseph, Son-of-the-White-Partridge.
    It had much blood in it, together with the trunks, and clothes worn by
    Keveny, but Keveny himself was not there. On examining the coat, there
    was perceived to be a ball hole, and an incision, in different parts
    of it. Keveny’s trunks were then landed, unlocked, and a division made
    of his clothes, linen, and other effects. De Reinhard wiped the blood
    from his sword, declaring in the hearing of the men, as if glorying in
    the perpetration of the act, that he had killed him, and was entitled
    to the best apparel, which he accordingly appropriated to himself.
    Mainville took the perforated coat.</p>

  <p>The facts of this foul deed appeared to be these. Keveny, with the
    three persons left with him, by the Northwest partners, embarked in
    a small Indian canoe, to ascend the river. He complained of being
    unwell, and was landed at a certain spot. De Reinhard, Mainville, and
    Joseph, waited at the beach. De Reinhard stood near the canoe as Keveny
    re-embarked, and suddenly drawing a short sword, thrust it into his
    body. Keveny doubled down under the blow, but being a tall and powerful
    man, (although weakened by disease,) he recovered himself, seized the
    blade of the sword, and would have wrenched it away and overpowered the
    assassin, had he not called to Mainville to fire. The latter obeyed.
    The ball passed through Keveny’s neck, and he instantly fell. It does
    not seem that the Indian participated in the act. The body was stripped
    and left on shore, unburied. Two years after (i.&nbsp;e. 1818,) De Reinhard,
    who had, it seems, been a subaltern officer in one of the disbanded
    foreign regiments, was tried for the murder at Quebec, proved guilty,
    (by his own confessions to the men at the encampment,) and sentenced to
    the gallows. Mainville escaped.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Having</span> determined to organise a select party at this lake, to explore
    the source of the river, measures were immediately taken to effect
    it. A council of the Indians was assembled, and the object declared
    to them. They were requested to delineate maps of the country, and to
    furnish the requisite number of hunting canoes and guides. Oza Windib,
    said, “My father, the country you are going to see, is my hunting
    ground. I have travelled with you many days.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I shall go with you
    farther. I will myself furnish the maps you have requested, and will
    guide you onward. There are many rapids in the way, but the waters are
    favorable. I shall consult with my band about the canoes, and see who
    will step forward to furnish them. My own canoe, shall be one of the
    number.”</p>

  <p>Before night the maps were completed, and five different individuals,
    including Oza Windib, brought each a canoe of the proper size and
    laid it down. Two young men expressed their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>willingness to go, as
    additional guides. Seven engagés and a cook, were added to this number,
    making, with Lieut. J. Allen, (who declared he could push his men
    no farther, Doct. Douglass Houghton, the Reverend Wm. T. Boutwell,
    Mr. George Johnston, and myself,) sixteen persons. These, with their
    travelling beds, were distributed among five canoes, with provisions
    for ten days, a tent and poles, oil cloth, mess basket, tea-kettle,
    flag and staff, a medicine chest, some instruments, an herbarium,
    fowling pieces, and a few Indian presents. The detachment of infantry
    was left in their encampment on the island, under the command of their
    non-commissioned officer. The remainder of the party, with the baggage
    and travelling equipment, was placed in charge of Mr. Le Default, a
    clerk of one of the upper posts of trade, who was attached to the
    expedition from Fond du Lac, and obligingly undertook the acquisition
    of certain points of information, during the contemplated absence.</p>

  <p>While these arrangements were in process, a mixed group of men, women,
    and children, from the Indian village, thronged our encampment. Among
    them I observed the widow of a Chippewa warrior, who had been killed
    some three or four weeks previous, in the foray of the Leech Lake
    war party, in the Sioux country. She was accompanied by her children
    and appeared dejected. I asked one of the Indians the place of her
    residence. He replied, here; that her husband had been a brave warrior,
    and went, on the call of the Leech Lake chief, with a number of
    volunteers, to join the party. I asked him, of what number the party
    consisted? He replied, about one hundred. Who had led them? The Gueuile
    Platte. Where they had met the enemy? South of the head of Leaf river.
    What had been the result of the action? They were victorious, having
    taken three scalps on the field, and lost but one, being the husband
    of the widow referred to. The action had however, been at long shots,
    with frequent changes of position, and the enemy had finally fled to
    a village for reinforcement. The Chippewas took this opportunity to
    retreat, and, after con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>sultation, returned, bringing back the three
    scalps, as memorials of their prowess. These trophies had, we learned,
    been exhibited in the customary dances at Leech Lake, after which one
    of them was forwarded to Oza Windib’s band, to undergo a like ceremony.
    And it was finally presented to the widow.</p>

  <p>It was now exhibited by the young men, in her behalf, for a purpose
    which was certainly new to me. Although I knew that this people were
    ingenious in converting most circumstances, connected with both
    fortune and misfortune, into a means of soliciting alms, I had never
    before seen the scalp of an enemy employed as a means of levying
    contributions. Such, however, was the purpose for which it was now
    brought forward. It was exhibited with all the circumstances of
    barbarian triumph. Shouts and dancing, intermingled with the sounds
    of the rattle, and Indian drum, form the conspicuous traits of such
    a scene. Short harangues, terminated by a general shout, fill up the
    pauses of the dance, and at this moment the drums cease. It was an
    outcry of this kind that first drew my attention to a neighboring
    eminence. I observed some of the simple bark enclosures, which mark the
    locality of a Chippewa burial ground. Near them, was erected a sort
    of triumphal arch, consisting of bent and tied saplings, from the arc
    formed by which, depended an object, which was said to be the remains
    of decaying scalps. Around this, was gathered a crowd of dancers,
    moving in a circle. The fresh scalp was suspended from a rod. Every
    time it waved, a new impulse seemed to be given to the shouting. The
    widow and her children were present. And the whole group of spectators,
    Canadians as well as Indians, appeared to regard the ceremony with an
    absorbing interest. In the brief pause, which separated each dance,
    presents were thrown in. And all that was given was deemed the property
    of the widow. This was the scalp dance.</p>

  <p>Other incidents of the sojourn of the expedition on this island will be
    mentioned on the return of the party to it. A few may be added here.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

  <p>Representations having been made to the Department, on the subject of
    foreign interference in the trade of the Upper Mississippi, a number
    of queries were addressed to an American trader, well acquainted with
    its geography and resources. I inquired of him, whether the American
    traders on that border, were strenuously opposed in their trade by the
    inhabitants of the Red river colony, or by the partners and clerks of
    the Hudson’s Bay Company. He replied that the inhabitants of Pembina,
    were in the habit of making temporary voyages of trade to Voleuse, or
    Thief river, south of the parallel of forty-nine degrees, but that
    they had not built or made a permanent stand there. He said, that
    the open nature of the country about the Red river settlement, gave
    great facilities for making short excursions into the Indian country,
    on horseback and in carts. But he did not know any place to which
    permanent outfits had been sent, except the river Souris, west of Red
    river. He believed that this traffic was carried on, exclusively, by
    the inhabitants of the colony and not by the Hudson’s Bay Company.</p>

  <p>I asked him whether the Indians of the Lake of the Woods visited
    the post of Red Lake, and whether our traders were annoyed in their
    trade in that quarter by the servants of the Hudson’s Bay Company.
    He replied, that the Lac du Bois Indians came across to Red Lake
    ordinarily; that it is a three day’s journey; but that no annoyance is
    experienced in the trade of that part from the Hudson’s Bay factors.
    He was of opinion that they do not send outfits into any part of
    the territory south or west of the national boundary, beginning at
    <i lang="fr">Portage des Rats</i> on the Lake of the Woods.</p>

  <p>A quite different aspect was put upon the temper of this opposition
    by the Principal of this department of trade, who was met below. He
    complained of the influence which the Hudson’s Bay Company exert across
    the lines, and the moral character of the means which were resorted
    to, to induce the American Indians to go to their posts. He said that
    in 1831, (I think) one of his petty clerks had been induced to abscond
    with his outfit, and had been well received by one of the partners
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> the Hudson’s Bay Company. On inquiry, I found this clerk to be
    Mainville, one of the murderers of Keveny. He said that high wines was
    the great power of the supremacy of the Hudson’s Bay Company on the
    lines, and brought forward the usual arguments of those persons, who
    either deem ardent spirits essential to the success of the trade, or
    justify its temporary use on the principle of expediency.</p>

  <p>It may here, in brief, be observed, that all such arguments plausible
    as they may appear, are founded on a false principle. They assume the
    existence of an evil, which is alleged to be so fixed, that it is
    better to tolerate it, than to run the risk of uprooting it; as if
    it were better to submit to a disease, than to attempt its cure, by
    a removal of its causes. No trader, will however, deny the existence
    of the <em>evil</em>, as an abstract question. Neither is it denied,
    that ardent spirits is a tax upon the trade, in the exact ratio of its
    entire cost, doubled, and trebled, and quadrupled, as this cost is
    by the expense of interior transportation. But the question is, “Who
    shall begin to give up its use?” This is a question internally, between
    trader and trader, externally, between company and company. As such it
    has been bandied between New-York and London, the seats of commercial
    power. But neither side has felt the requisite degree of confidence, to
    risk the experiment of a voluntary arrangement for its entire exclusion
    <em>from the lines</em>.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Congress has terminated this question, so
    far as it respects American citizens, by an act of the 9th of July,
    of the present year, (1832,) which contains this provision: “That no
    ardent spirits shall be hereafter introduced, under any pretence, into
    the Indian country.” The enforcement of this act, has been rigidly
    enjoined, and it is in the process of successful execution. Posterity
    will probably regard this measure as reflecting more honor upon our
    national legislation, than if we had decreed a hundred monuments to
    fallen greatness. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> But we are writing a homily, where we intended to
    offer a few hints, and must hie to the labor of the journey before
    us. Every arrangement being completed on the evening of the 10th, we
    embarked, at the island, at three o’clock the next morning. Our course
    lay westward, through a strait, formed by the approach of a part of
    the island, to a part of the main shore. We then passed two islands,
    called Garden and Elm islands. The morning was too hazy to give us any
    extensive prospect of the lake, or its shores. We had been a little
    more than an hour in motion, when we found ourselves nearing the
    western head of the lake, and the men soon shoved our canoes upon a
    sandy beach, with the exclamation of <i lang="fr">un portage</i>. We found this
    portage to extend about fifty yards, over a plain of sand, bearing
    pine, and terminating on the banks of a small lake. Through this lake
    the Mississippi has its course, and the two lakes are connected by a
    circuitous channel, which might, perhaps, have occupied a half, or
    three quarters of an hour, to ascend. The lake, for which we heard
    no name, is several miles in extent. We passed it transversely, and
    entered the channel of the river on its western border. It presents a
    still current, with an edging of savannah, which, at no great distance
    above, is again expanded around the margin of another lake, called
    Tascodiac.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Hills of sand, covered with yellow pines, here present
    themselves, and the river exhibits for several miles above, either a
    sand bank, or a savannah border. Time is the only measure of distance,
    which we had the means of referring to. About eight o’clock, rapid
    water was encountered, and at this point, which may be fifteen miles
    above Cass Lake, the meadow lands cease. Boulders, of a primitive
    character, are found on the rapids. The rapids are such, in their force
    and inequality of depth, as to require the men frequently to wade, and
    pull up the canoes. There are, say, ten of these principal rapids, in
    the ensuing twenty or twenty-five miles, at which distance, we reach
    the most northern point of the Mississippi, which is marked by the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>fine expanse of the Pamitchi Gumaug, or Lac Travers. This lake may be
    fifty feet above the level of Cass Lake. It is about 12 miles long,
    from north to south, and six or seven broad, with elevated shores,
    presenting to the eye a beautiful vista of hard wood groves.</p>

  <p>We landed a few moments, on the right hand shore in entering it,
    to examine an object, which the men had been conversing of on the
    way, namely, a Shingaba Wossin. It proved to be a boulder of gneiss
    rock, water worn, so as to present the figure of a rude shaft, with
    an entablature, but not exceeding in weight, the maximum of a man’s
    strength. One of the canoe-men lifted it. It had been set up, on its
    base, and was decorated with a ring of red paint. The name may be
    freely translated Image Stone, and has no reference to the composition
    of the mass, any farther than that the name is usually found to be
    applied to rocks of the primitive kind, both from the liability of
    this class of rocks to assume these forms, and from their hardness,
    which has enabled them to endure the power of attrition. Offerings are
    usually left at such rude altars, and they afford, perhaps, the nearest
    approach to idol worship, in its grosser forms, which an examination
    of our Indian customs, present. The soil, at this spot, appeared to be
    rather rich, bearing a growth of elm, soft maple and white ash.</p>

  <p>We were an hour in crossing the lake south-westwardly, and were
    impressed with the extent and beauty of the prospect. On gaining the
    opposite shore, we found the Mississippi flowing with a brisk and
    deep current into it, and exhibiting a width of, perhaps one hundred
    and fifty feet. In landing, a few moments, at this point, we found
    the beach strewed with small shells, both uniones, and helices. A
    log house, used as a winter trading camp, stood a few hundred yards
    northwardly. And this may be referred to, as the most advanced trading
    location on the main waters of this river.</p>

  <p>Lac Travers is separated by a short channel, from a bay or lake of
    moderate dimensions, which is, from its proximity, con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>sidered a part
    of the main lake, although the current of the separating channel,
    indicates the latter to be rather a <em>river</em> than a strait. It
    will be convenient to refer to it, as it is from this point that
    the Mississippi, which has now been pursued to its utmost northing,
    is ascended directly south. About four miles above this bay, the
    Mississippi has its ultimate forks, being formed of an east and
    west branch, of which the west branch is decidedly the largest, and
    considerably the longest. Reasons indicated by our guide, induced him
    to conduct us up the east branch, which we soon found expanded into a
    small lake, denoted Marquette, and not far above, into another, denoted
    La Salle. We were twenty-four minutes in passing through the last, and
    on leaving it, found the stream strikingly diminished in volume, with a
    limited depth, and a vegetation of a more decidedly alpine character.
    About four miles above the latter, the stream expands into a lake some
    six or seven miles in length, and about half that distance in width.
    This lake, which is called Kubbakunna, The Rest in the Path, presented
    a pleasing aspect, after the sombre vegetation, we had passed below.
    Rushes, however, were abundant toward its head, and we found the
    ground too low and wet for encamping. After ascending the river, for a
    distance, we put ashore for the night, at a point of woods extending
    into the marsh-land, constituting the river margin. The soil at this
    place, appeared to be of the most frigid character. A carpet of moss
    covered it, which the foot sank deep into, at every step. The growth
    was exclusively small grey pine, with numerous dead branches below, and
    strikingly festooned with flowing moss. Nearer the margin of the river,
    alder, tamarack, and willow, occupied the soil. As night approached it
    commenced raining, which served to add to the natural gloom of the spot.</p>

  <p>Notices of the natural history of the country, during this day’s
    journey are meagre. The principal growth of forest trees, out of
    the immediate valley, is pine. The plants appear to present little
    variety, and consist of species peculiar to moist, cold, or elevated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
    situations. Water fowl are abundant, and were frequently shot. Among
    the number brought in from the different canoes, in the evenings,
    were the duck and mallard, wood-duck, and saw-bill. One of the latter
    species, had a unio firmly attached to its lower mandible, having been
    in the act of opening it when shot.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">We</span> resumed the ascent at five o’clock in the morning, (12th.) The
    course of this branch of the river, above the Kubbakunna Lake,
    resembles a thread wound across a savannah valley. A species of coarse
    marsh-land grass, covers the valley. Clumps of willow fringe this
    stream. Rushes and Indian reed are gathered in spots most favorable
    to their growth. The eye searches in vain, for much novelty in the
    vegetation. Wherever the stream touches the solid land, grey pine,
    and tamarack are conspicuous, and clumps of alder here take the place
    of willow. Moss attaches itself to almost every thing. And there is
    a degree of dampness and obscurity in the forest, which is almost
    peculiar to the region. Water fowl seem alone to exult in their
    seclusion, and evince the infrequency of intrusion by flying a short
    distance, and frequently alighting within gun-shot.</p>

  <p>After we had gone on a little more than an hour, the Indian in the
    bow of the forward canoe, fired at, and killed a deer. We all landed
    to look at the animal. Although fairly shot through the fore part of
    the body, it ran several hundred yards before it fell. The Indian
    traced it by its blood, and found it quite dead. He brought it to the
    banks of the river, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> skinning it. We stood in astonishment at
    the dexterity with which this operation was performed. In a very few
    minutes it was disrobed of its skin, quartered and dissected. The owner
    presented me the quarters. He gave the <i>moze</i> to our guide. This
    term comprehends all parts of the carcass except the four quarters,
    head and entrails. Nothing was, however, thrown away; and we had
    occasion, at night to observe, that the aid of fire enables them, with
    very little of the culinary art, to despatch those parts of the animal,
    which, it might be inferred, were most in need of preparation. Signs of
    this animal were frequently seen, and had the objects of the journey
    permitted delay, it might have been often killed.</p>

  <p>Our progress through the savannahs, was rendered more unpleasant than
    it would otherwise have been, by frequent showers of rain, which gave,
    as is usual, a peculiar activity and virulence to the musquito. When
    the usual hour of landing for breakfast had arrived, the banks were too
    marshy to admit of it, and we went on until a quarter past twelve. We
    then again renewed a labor with little variety of incident.</p>

  <p>At half past five we came to an elevated sand-hill on the right shore,
    covered with yellow pine, and presenting a naked face towards the
    river. As one of the canoes required mending, I directed the men to
    land at this spot, for that purpose. Oza Windib, who was a little in
    the rear, at the moment, said, on coming up, that we were within a few
    hundred yards of the junction of the Naiwa, the principal tributary
    of this fork; that a series of rapids commenced at that point, which
    would render it necessary to make a portage the whole extent of them,
    and that it was better to commence the portage at this place, as the
    river so ran, that we might go directly back through the forest, and
    strike its channel. He said that the Naiwa, which came in on the left,
    was a stream of considerable length, and originated in a lake which
    was infested by copper-head snakes, to which its name has reference.
    I observed that the soil at this place was of a diluvian character,
    and embraced pebbles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> and small boulders of syenite, trap rock, and
    quartz, and other debris of primitive and secondary rocks. One of the
    party picked up a well characterised piece of zoned agate.</p>

  <p>While the mending of the canoes was in progress, the baggage was put
    in portable order, and as soon as all was ready, the men moved on
    with the canoes and effects, which were so arranged that all could be
    carried at one load, and it did not require them to go back. This was
    a point originally kept in view, in the curtailment of the baggage
    at the island, and it was an object of the highest importance to the
    speed and success of the trip. Each canoe and its apparatus, with some
    of the lighter pieces was carried by one man. The guide led off the
    men, with no slight burden on his own shoulders, first scrambling up
    the sandy acclivity, and then striking through a growth of scrub oak
    and pines. The showers of the morning had so thoroughly wet the grass
    and shrubbery, that a few moments walking through it, was sufficient
    completely to saturate both pantaloons and stockings. I walked out a
    few hundred yards from the trail, towards the left which brought me
    into the curve of the river, in view of the rapids. There appeared
    to be a series of small rapids, with intervening shallows. The noise
    of falling water and the white wreaths of foam, induced me to think
    there might be distinct falls, but I could discern nothing entitled to
    the name. The average descent of the river, at this series of rapids,
    appeared to be, however, considerable, and might perhaps be estimated
    at forty-eight feet. I rejoined the party at the spot they had selected
    for their first pause, somewhat to their relief, probably, as guns
    had been fired by them, under the belief of my having missed the way.
    We first came in sight of the river again, on the brow of an elevated
    sand-hill, precipitous towards the water. The guide halted to inquire
    whether it would not be preferable to encamp at this spot, as we
    should suffer less from insects than if we encamped in the valley of
    the river, at the termination of the portage. As the day light was not
    gone, and some distance still remained, I deem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>ed it better to go on,
    that we might have nothing to do in the morning, but to put our canoes
    in the water. On reaching the bank of the stream, we found its current
    placid, and our guide informed us that we had now surmounted the last
    rapids.</p>

  <p>A fog prevented our embarking until five o’clock in the morning,
    (13th) and it was then impossible to discern objects at a distance. We
    found the channel above the Naiwa, diminished to a clever brook, more
    decidedly marshy in the character of its shores, but not presenting in
    its plants or trees, any thing particularly to distinguish it from the
    contiguous lower parts of the stream. The water is still and pond-like.
    It presents some small areas of wild rice. It appears to be a favorite
    resort for the duck and teal, who frequently rose up before us, and
    were aroused again and again by our progress. An hour and a half
    diligently employed, brought us to the foot of Ossowa Lake. We halted
    a moment to survey it. It exhibits a broad border of aquatic plants,
    with somewhat blackish waters. Perch abound in it. It is the recipient
    of two brooks, and may be regarded as the source of this fork of the
    Mississippi. We were precisely twenty minutes in passing through it. We
    entered one of the brooks, the most southerly in position. It possessed
    no current and was filled with broad leaved plants, and a kind of
    yellow pond-lily. We appeared to be involved in a morass, where it
    seemed equally impracticable to make the land, or proceed far by water.
    In this we were not mistaken; Oza Windib soon pushed his canoe into
    the weeds and exclaimed, <i>Oma, mikunna</i>, (here is the portage.) A
    man who is called on for the first time, to debark, in such a place,
    will look about him to discover some dry spot to put his feet upon. No
    such spot however existed here. We stepped into rather warm pond water,
    with a miry bottom. After wading a hundred yards, or more, the soil
    became firm, and we soon began to ascend a slight elevation, where the
    growth partakes more of the character of a forest. Traces of a path
    appeared here, and we suddenly entered an opening affording an eligible
    spot for landing. Here our bag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>gage was prepared for the portage. The
    carbonaceous remains of former fires, the bones of birds, and scattered
    camp poles, proved it to be a spot which had previously been occupied
    by the Indians. The prevailing growth at this place, is spruce, white
    cedar, tamarack and grey pine. We here breakfasted.</p>

  <p>Having followed out this branch of the Mississippi to its source, it
    may be observed, that its existence, as a separate river, has hitherto
    been unknown in our geography. None of the maps indicate the ultimate
    separation of the Mississippi, above Cass Lake, into two forks. Little
    surprise should therefore be manifested that the latitude of the head
    of this stream, is found to be incorrect. It was not however to be
    expected that the inaccuracy should be so great as to place the actual
    source, an entire degree south of the supposed point. Such however is
    the conclusion established by present observations.</p>

  <p>The portage from the east to the west branch of the river, is estimated
    to be six miles. Beginning in a marsh, it soon rises into a little
    elevation of white cedar wood, then plunges into the intricacies of a
    swamp matted with fallen trees, obscured with moss. From this, the path
    emerges upon dry ground. It soon ascends an elevation of oceanic sand,
    having boulders, and bearing pines. There is then another descent, and
    another elevation. In short, the traveller now finds himself crossing
    a series of deluvial sand ridges, which form the height of land
    between the Mississippi Valley and Red River. This ridge, is locally
    denominated Hauteur des Terres where it is crossed in passing from
    Lac Plaie to Ottertail Lake, from which point it proceeds northward,
    separating the tributaries of the River des Corbeau from those of
    Red River. It finally subtends both branches of the Mississippi,
    putting out a spur between the east and west fork, which intersects
    the portage, crosses the west or Itascan fork about the point of
    the Kakábikonce, or Little Rock Falls, and joining the main ridge,
    passes northeastwardly of Lac Travers and Turtle Lake, and is again
    encountered in the noted portage path from Turtle Lake to Red Lake. It
    is, in fine, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> table land between the waters of Hudson’s Bay and the
    Mexican Gulf. It also gives rise to the remotest tributaries of the
    river St. Louis, which, through Lake Superior and its connecting chain,
    may be considered as furnishing the head waters of the St. Lawrence.
    This table land, is probably, the highest in North-western America, in
    this longitude.</p>

  <p>In crossing this highland, our Indian guide, Oza Windib, led the way,
    carrying one of the canoes, as his portion of the burden. The others
    followed, some bearing canoes, and others baggage. The whole party were
    arranged in Indian file, and marched rapidly a distance—then put down
    their burthens a few moments, and again pressed forward. Each of these
    stops is called a <i lang="fr">posè</i> by the voyageurs, and is denominated
    Opugid-jiwunon, or a place of putting down the burthen, by the Indians.
    Thirteen of these rests, are deemed the length of the portage. The
    path is rather blind, and requires the precision of an Indian eye to
    detect it. Even the guide was sometimes at a loss, and went forward
    to explore. We passed a small lake occupying a vale, about midway of
    the portage, in canoes. The route beyond it, was more obstructed with
    underbrush. To avoid this, we waded through the margins of a couple
    of ponds, near which we observed old camp poles, indicating former
    journies by the Indians.</p>

  <p>The weather was warm and not favorable to much activity in bird or
    beast. We saw one or two species of the falco, and the common pigeon,
    which extends its migrations over the continent. Tracks of deer were
    numerous, but travelling without the precaution required in hunting,
    we had no opportunity of seeing this animal on the high grounds. It
    was observed in the valleys of the river, on both branches. Ripe straw
    berries were brought to me, by the men, at one of the resting places.
    I observed a very diminutive species of the raspberry, with fruit, on
    the moist grounds. Botanists would probably deem the plants few, and
    destitute of much interest. Parasitic moss is very common to the forest
    trees, and it communicates a peculiar aspect to the grey pine, which is
    the prevailing growth on all the elevations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

  <p>To the geologist, the scene is one of interest. The boulders of
    granite, and other primitive strata, occurring on the surface, remind
    him of the original position of these masses, in the system of nature
    and indicate revolutions affecting the earth’s surface, which have
    widely changed both the position and form of these solid materials.
    When the soil itself is examined, it adds further evidences of such
    changes. We may refer its sand to consolidated strata of this mineral
    which have been broken down by oceanic action, and distributed in
    the remarkable ridges and elevations, which now characterise the
    face of the country. In whatever light the subject is viewed, it
    seems difficult to resist the conclusion, that water has been the
    cause, under providence, in effecting these changes, and that the
    highest grounds in this region, have been subjected to the peculiar
    influence which this element alone exerts in the work of attrition
    and deposition of strata, solid or diluvial. It might be interesting
    to inquire, in what manner this agent of change was withdrawn, and
    whether a current was created toward either of the cardinal points. It
    would aid this inquiry to observe, in which direction the debris and
    soils were deposited in the heaviest masses? How far granite boulders
    had been carried from their beds? And whether wood, bones, and other
    organic remains had been subjected to like removals? We think these
    accumulations are abundantly witnessed in casting the eye down the
    Mississippi valley, with a measured decrease in the size and weight
    of the pulverised masses, in proceeding from the head to the mouth of
    this river. It is thus evident, that the heaviest boulders are found
    on its upper branches, while they become rare in its central plains,
    and disappear altogether, long before its entrance into the deltas at
    its mouth. And this remark may be coupled with the accounts given by
    travellers of the bleak, and denuded, and sterile character of the
    northern rock formations.</p>

  <p>But we have no leisure to devote to this investigation, and must
    proceed with the narrative that is before us. Every step we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> made in
    treading these sandy elevations, seemed to increase the ardor with
    which we were carried forward. The desire of reaching the actual source
    of a stream so celebrated as the Mississippi—a stream which La Salle
    had reached the mouth of, a century and a half (lacking a year) before,
    was perhaps predominant; and we followed our guide down the sides
    of the last elevation, with the expectation of momentarily reaching
    the goal of our journey. What had been long sought, at last appeared
    suddenly. On turning out of a thicket, into a small weedy opening, the
    cheering sight of a transparent body of water burst upon our view. It
    was Itasca Lake—the source of the Mississippi.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Itasca</span> Lake, the <i lang="fr">Lac la Biche</i> of the French, is, in every
    respect, a beautiful sheet of water, seven or eight miles in extent,
    lying among hills of diluvial formation, surmounted with pines, which
    fringe the distant horizon, and form an agreeable contrast with the
    greener foliage of its immediate shores. Its greatest length, is from
    south-east to north-west, with a southern prolongation, or bay, which
    receives a brook. The waters are transparent and bright, and reflect
    a foliage produced by the elm, lynn, maple, and cherry, together with
    other species more abundant in northern latitudes. The lake itself is
    of irregular form, which will be best illustrated by the accompanying
    sketch. It has a single island, upon which we landed, after an hour’s
    paddling from the spot of our arrival and embarkation. We found here,
    the forest trees above named growing promiscuously with the betula and
    spruce. The bones of fish and of tortoise, found at the locality of
    former Indian camp fires, indicate the existence of these species in
    the lake. We observed a deer, standing in the margin of the lake. And,
    here, as well as throughout the lakes of the region, found the duck,
    teal and loon, in possession of their favorite seclusions. Innumerable
    shells, (a species of small helix,) were driven up on the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> the
    island. Other parts of the lake yield small species of the unio, which
    were found strewing the bed of the outlet. And it may here be remarked,
    that this shell exists, in the largest and heaviest species heretofore
    known, in the lower parts of this stream—the Mississippi having its
    origin here.</p>

  <p>The outlet of Itasca Lake, is perhaps ten to twelve feet broad, with
    an apparent depth of twelve to eighteen inches. The discharge of water
    appears to be copious, compared to its inlet. Springs may, however,
    produce accessions which are not visible, and this is probable both
    from the geological character of the country, and the transparency and
    coolness of the water.</p>

  <p>The height of this lake, above the sea, is an object of geographical
    interest, which, in the absence of actual survey, it may subserve
    the purposes of useful inquiry, to estimate. From notes taken on the
    ascent, it cannot be short of one hundred and sixty feet above Cass
    Lake. Adding the estimate of 1330 feet, submitted in 1820, as the
    elevation of that lake, the Mississippi may be considered to originate
    at an altitude of 1490, say 1500 feet, above the Atlantic. Its length,
    assuming former data as the basis, and computing it, through the
    Itascan, or west fork, may be placed at 3160 miles, one hundred and
    eighty-two of which, comprises an estimate of its length above Cass
    Lake. Its general course, in <em>ascending</em>, above the latter point,
    is north of west, as far as Lac Travers. Then south to its primary
    forks which is continued, following up the east fork to Kubbakunna
    Lake, and for some distance further. It then varies a short distance,
    north and north-west, then south-west and south, and finally south-west,
    to its main source in Ossowa Lake. The portage thence to Itasca Lake,
    is west south-west. Both these lakes appear to rise in springs, on the
    height of land. They are separated by about six miles of country. Their
    latitude, we had no means of accurately determining. From daily notes
    of the courses and distances, kept by Lieut. J. Allen, as indicated
    by a compass and watch, their position is, however, shown to be
    <em>south-west</em>, and not, as heretofore supposed, <em>northwest</em>,
    of Cass Lake. They are, in fact, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> little south of west from Leech
    Lake, which is placed, on our best maps, in forty-seven degrees sixteen
    minutes. The highest northing attained by the Mississippi, is on the
    great diluvial plateau, containing the contiguous waters of Lakes
    La Salle, Marquette and Travers, which cannot vary more than a few
    minutes, from forty-eight degrees. These facts will explain the error
    of the elder geographical writers, who supposed that the parallel of
    forty-nine degrees would intersect the Mississippi. Its origin in the
    remote and unfrequented area of country between Leech Lake and Red
    river, probably an entire degree of latitude south of Turtle Lake,
    which still figures on some of our maps as its <em>source</em>, throws
    both the forks of this stream out of the usual route of the fur trade,
    and furnishes, perhaps the best reason why its actual sources have
    remained so long enveloped in obscurity.</p>

  <p>The Mississippi river traverses more degrees of latitude than any other
    river in America, and the remark might, perhaps, be extended to the
    habitable globe. The extremes of its changes in climate and vegetable
    productions, are, consequently, very great. It occupies more than
    three thousand miles of the distance between the arctic circle and the
    equator. Long as it is, however, it has a tributary longer than itself,
    (the Missouri.) Like the Niger, its mouth was discovered by expeditions
    down its current, but unlike that stream, which has so long held the
    geographical world in suspense, its sources have been also sought from
    its central parts. Its entire course is, at length, known. And we may
    now appeal with full certainty to the Balize and to Itasca Lake, as its
    most extreme points. At the latter, it is a placid basin of transparent
    spring water. At the former, it is as turbid as earth in suspension can
    make it, and carries a forest of floating trees on its bosom. Below the
    junction of its primary forks, it expands at very unequal distances,
    into eight sheets of clear water, each of which has features worthy
    of admiration. Four of these, Lac Travers, Cass Lake, Winnepec, and
    Lake Pepin, are lakes of handsome magnitude, and striking scenery. The
    number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> its tributaries of the first, and the second and the third
    class, is so large, that it would furnish a labor of some research,
    to determine it. The Missouri, the Ohio, and the Arkansas, are of the
    noblest class. Whoever has stood at the junction of these streams, as
    the writer has done, must have been impressed with an idea of magnitude
    and power, which words are incapable of conveying. The broadest parts
    of its channel lie in the central portions of its valley. Its depth
    is great in all its lower parts, and increases as it flows on to the
    Gulf, and its general descent and velocity are such as to appear
    very striking characteristics.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Noble views arrest the eye of the
    observer, in every part of its diversified course. Originating in a
    heavy and extensive bed of diluvial soil, superimposed upon primitive
    strata, it soon wears its channel down to the latter, and after running
    over them for several hundred miles, plunges at length, at the Falls of
    St. Anthony, over the carboniferous limestone formation, which is so
    prevalent and so valuable for its mineral deposits, below that point.
    This is finally succeeded by diluvial and alluvial banks, the latter of
    which are semi-annually enriched by fresh deposits, and exhibit a delta
    as broad and as exuberant as the Nile. Like the latter, it has its
    cataracts in the Falls of St. Anthony and Pukaigama, and in numerous
    lesser leaps and cascades, where its current is tossed into foam and
    threatens destruction to the navigation. Such are its physical traits,
    and there is enough in their character, magnitude, and variety to lead our
    contemplations irresistibly “through nature up to nature’s God.”</p>

  <p>Having gratified our curiosity in Itasca Lake, we prepared to leave the
    island, but did not feel inclined to quit the scene without leaving
    some memorial, however frail, of our visit. The men were directed to
    fell a few trees at the head of the island, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>by creating an area,
    for the purpose of erecting a flag staff. This was braced by forked
    stakes, and a small flag hoisted to its place. Taking specimens of the
    forest growth of the island, of a size suitable for walking canes, and
    adding its few species to our collections of plants and conchology,
    we embarked on our descent. The flag which we had erected continued
    to be in sight for a time, and was finally shut out from our view by
    a curve of the lake. We found this curve drawn out in such a manner
    as to form, with the opposite shore, the channel of the outlet. We
    soon felt our motion accelerated by a current, and began to glide,
    with velocity, down a clear stream with a sandy and pebbly bottom,
    strewed with shells and overhung by foliage. Ten feet would, in most
    places, reach from bank to bank, and the depth would probably average
    over a foot. The water was not, however, equally distributed. A strong
    and winding channel, made it a labor of active watchfulness for the
    canoe-men, to keep our frail vessels from being dashed against boulders,
    or torn in pieces by fallen timber or overhanging trees. Chopping
    with the axe, was frequently necessary to clear the passage, and no
    small labor was imposed by getting through the drift wood, piled up at
    almost every sudden bend. We were almost imperceptibly drawn into a
    series of rapids and petty falls where the stream was more compressed,
    and the water deepened; but the danger rendered tenfold greater by
    boulders of blackened rocks, and furious jets of the stream. We were
    rather hurled than paddled through these rapid passes, which increased
    in frequency and fury as we advanced. After being driven down about
    twelve miles of this species of navigation, during which the turns
    are very abrupt, the river displays itself, so to say, in a savannah
    valley, where the channel is wider and deeper, but equally, or more
    circuitous, and bordered with sedge and aquatic plants. This forms the
    first plateau. It extends eight or nine miles. The river then narrows
    and enters another defile, beset with an almost continued series of
    rapids. The sensation, in going down these, where the channel is free
    from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> stones, can be compared to nothing so aptly, as the emotion which
    every one has felt as the enterprise of youth has buoyed him up, in
    directing his tiny sled down a snow covered declivity. The brevity of
    the emotion takes away nothing from the truth of the comparison. The
    frowing rock, often rears its dark head to dispute the passage, and
    calls for the exertion of every muscle, in the canoe-men, to avoid, by
    dexterity of movement, a violent contact. Often it became necessary
    for them to step into the channel, and lead down the canoes, where the
    violence of the eddies made it impracticable otherwise to guide them.
    At a place called Kakábikons, or the Little-rock falls, we made a short
    portage. Two of the canoes, however, made the descent, but not without
    imminent peril, and a delay eventually greater, than if they had been
    carried across the portage. We descended this second series of rapids a
    distance of about nine miles, and encamped, at a late hour, on a high
    fine bank, having come altogether about thirty-two miles below Itasca
    Lake. Wearied with the continued exertion, the frequent wettings, and
    the constant anxiety, sleep soon overshadowed the whole party, “with
    his downy pinions.”</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">We</span> were in motion again a little before five o’clock, in the morning,
    (14th.) The rapids continued. The branches of large trees often hung
    so near to the water, that if we were not in peril of being entangled,
    like the jewish rebel king, we were in a more continual danger of
    having every moveable article swept from the canoes. An accident
    occurred to one of the canoes, about six o’clock in the morning, which
    might have had a fatal termination. My men had paused a few moments at
    the head of a formidable rapid, to determine the best place of going
    down it. Lieut. Allen, who, with his canoe, was behind at the moment,
    soon came up. His bowsman caught hold of my canoe to check his own
    velocity. It produced that effect, but the stern of his canoe swung
    across the stream, so that the steersman caught hold of a branch to
    prevent its being carried broadside over the rapid. Being thus rendered
    tense between bank and bank, the velocity of the water poured over
    the gunnel, and it was instantly reversed, with all its contents.
    This whole oc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>currence could not have occupied half a minute. It was
    impossible to render assistance, and Mr. Allen was hardly conscious
    of the matter, till he found himself in the stream. With no little
    exertion, he recovered himself, so as to be able to keep his feet,
    against the pressure of the current. The water was breast high. The
    canoe-compass was irrecoverably lost. He fetched up his fowling piece
    himself. Other articles went over the falls.</p>

  <p>The character of the stream, made this part of our route a most rapid
    one. Willing or unwilling we were hurried on. But we had every reason
    to desire rapidity. Less time was given to the examination of objects
    than might otherwise have been devoted. Yet I am not aware that any
    important object was neglected. Where there is much sameness in natural
    features, frequent landings are unnecessary, and whoever has devoted
    his time in going thus far up the Mississippi, will have made himself
    so familiar with its plants, soil and productions, that “he who runs
    may read.” The pine, in its varieties, is the prevailing tree; and
    whenever we get out of the narrow alluvions of the valley, arenaceous
    plains appear. Among the plants that border the river, the wild rose,
    which is so conspicuous on all the streams northwest of Lake Superior,
    is very often seen. The salix, so common to the lower Mississippi, and
    so uniformly infested with mosquitoes, presents itself on the first
    plateau, and is afterwards one of the constant shrubs on the savannahs.</p>

  <p>The Indian reed first shews itself distinctly, about the mouth of the
    Piniddiwin, and is here associated with wild rice. The stag and hind
    appear to be the species of deer, which were most frequently seen, and
    were several times fired at by the party, along this branch of the
    river. We also observed the <i lang="la">falco furcatus</i>, or swallow tailed
    hawk, a species not heretofore, thought to inhabit the continent, so
    far north. A small animal of the amphibious kind was here brought
    to our notice, under the name of <i>Ocaut Ekinabic</i>, or legged
    snake, a species of lizard, striped blue, black, and white, with a
    disproportionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> length of tail. It is thus readily distinguished
    from ordinary species. Its most striking peculiarity of habit, is its
    extreme activity and swiftness of motion.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Head landed, during the morning, to fire at a deer,
    which was seen grazing on a meadow, at some distance. He approached
    cautiously, but was unsuccessful in the shot he fired. What most
    excited our surprise, was the rapidity with which he reloaded and
    fired again, before the deer had got without the range of his shot.
    This was effected without the use of wadding to separate the powder
    from the ball. It did not, however, arrest the deer, who pursued
    his flight. The Indian returned to his canoe with a look of marked
    disappointment. Frequent opportunity was given in the course of the
    day, for firing at the various species of water fowl which resort to
    this stream. The saw-billed duck,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which is a common species, has an
    art of protecting its young, which we had frequent opportunities of
    observing. When the mother is surprised with a brood, she affects to
    have a wing broken, and flaps awkwardly on the water, as if unable to
    rise. By thus attracting notice to herself, the young, who are unable,
    at this season, to fly, have an opportunity to screen themselves: and
    the mother then boldly rises from the stream, and puts an end to the
    pursuit.</p>

  <p>The river continues to descend in steps. The second series of rapids
    was followed by a second level, or plateau, in which the channel
    assumes a width nearly, or quite, double to that which it presents on
    the rapids. On this level, the Cano river comes in, as a tributary
    on the right shore. The volume of water is perceptibly increased by
    it. This plateau may extend nine miles. It is succeeded by rapids
    of a milder character, below which the river again displays itself
    in savannahs, with a comparatively wide, winding channel. These are
    finally terminated by short and easy rapids, which bring the river
    out of what, we may designate as its alpine passes. We landed for
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>the purpose of breakfast, on an open pine bank, (left shore,) near
    the termination of the third plateau. Several beautifully clear and
    cool springs were observed running from its base into the river. It
    requires, indeed, but a bare recollection of observed facts, to make
    it evident that the waters of both branches of the Mississippi, have
    their origin in springs of bright and pure water. It may be farther
    observed, that although the Upper Mississippi receives a number of
    colored tributaries, all its larger rivers are pure, and it is itself
    essentially a clear stream, when not in flood, as far as its junction
    with the Missouri.</p>

  <p>At four o’clock, we came to the junction of the Piniddiwin, a
    tributary from the left, having its origin in a lake, and entering the
    Mississippi amidst an extensive marsh of rice, reeds, and rushes, which
    give it rather the appearance of a marsh than a lake. It is, however,
    called <i lang="fr">Lac la Folle</i>. This spot was estimated to be one hundred
    and four miles below Itasca Lake. The name of the river employed above,
    is an abbreviation of the phrase <i>Tah-pinuniddewin</i>, the place
    of violent deaths, in allusion to an inroad and murder committed at
    this place, in former times, by the Sioux. A party of this tribe, had
    previously entrenched themselves on the river above, at a spot which
    concealed their position and gave them command of the river channel.
    After waiting here for a time, without success, they proceeded lower,
    and discovered a Chippewa lodge, not far below the entrance of this
    river. It was cautiously approached, assaulted, and all its inmates
    killed, without distinction of age or sex. This event happened at an
    early period. No persons are now living who were contemporary with the
    victims. And it may be regarded as one of the occurrences which marked
    the Chippewa conquest of this portion of the country.</p>

  <p>About eighteen miles below the junction of the Piniddiwin, we debarked
    for the purpose of cooking supper, and preparing our canoes for a night
    descent, as the channel of the river was now sufficiently broad, deep,
    and equable to justify it. An <i>Ocaut Ekinabic</i>, was killed at
    this place. Lieut. Allen, wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>ing day light, to finish tracing the
    river to its junction with the east fork, encamped here. By the time
    we were ready to embark, clouds had overcast the moon, which afforded
    a clear light before. But we trusted to our experienced guide, on a
    part of the river familiar to him, and we had no cause to repent of our
    confidence. Several shots were fired during the night at deer, standing
    in the edge of the water. The men landed at one spot, and pursued
    an animal, supposed to have been wounded. We found ourselves at the
    junction, about half past one o’clock in the morning, (15th.) Having
    given notices of our ascent of the river thus far, it is unnecessary
    to add to them. We were borne along with the double force of current
    and paddles, and with no care of topographical observation to delay
    our progress. The night air became very damp and chilly. To defend
    ourselves from it, we disposed of our travelling cloaks and blankets
    in the best manner possible. Neither sleep nor rest were, however,
    truly attainable, in a confined position where there was not room
    enough to extend the body, and every limb was so hampered as to make
    it impracticable to afford the relief of a change of position. Day
    light broke upon us in our descent from Lac Travers, and we reached our
    permanent encampment on the island in Cass Lake, at nine o’clock in the
    morning. We had been eleven hours and a half in our canoes. Mr. Allen
    did not rejoin us till four o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>The day being the Sabbath, the Reverend Mr. Boutwell, devoted a part
    of it, as he had done on the previous Sabbaths of our route, in giving
    religious instruction. As three of the soldiers of the party were
    christians, and two of our canoe-men could sing Indian hymns; singing,
    both in English and in Indian, became practicable. Mr. Johnston’s
    readiness in scripture translation, put it in the power of Mr. B. to
    address them on the leading doctrines of the gospel. With what effects
    these exhortations were listened to, on this, or on other occasions,
    cannot be fully stated. Strict attention appeared to be paid by the
    Indians, during these little forest meetings, which were gener<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>ally
    held under some spreading tree, or on the grassy area of some sheltered
    glade, contiguous to the camp. Incredulity and bold cavilings, were
    more observable, I think, at the most remote points of our route; and
    most interest manifested in the subject, in the villages situated
    nearest the frontier posts. Whatever were the results, it is to be
    hoped that no circumstances will prevent Mr. B. from communicating his
    observations to the christian public, at an early period.</p>

  <p>The field for missionary labor, in all the region northwest of St.
    Mary’s and Michilimackinac, is certainly a very extensive and important
    one. And the incitements to its occupancy, at the present era, may be
    said to be decidedly greater, than they have been at any time, since
    the discovery of the country. No very strong barriers appear to stand
    in the way of the introduction of christianity among the northern
    tribes. Their institutions, moral and political, are so fragile, as to
    be ready to tumble on the application of the slightest power. They are
    not worshippers of the sun, or the moon. They have no list of imaginary
    gods, of the horrid character, which belong to the idolatrous nations
    of Asia and Africa. A Hindoo worshipper would hardly be able to impose
    his tale of multiform incarnations, and transmigratory existence,
    upon their belief. And a votary of Juggernaut, would verily be looked
    on by them, as little better than a mad man. It is not, however, to
    be inferred that because these gross forms of idolatry do not exist,
    they have no idolatry at all. Their <em>medicinism</em>, is nothing
    more nor less than a species of idolatry. They impute supernatural
    powers to certain material substances, which are preserved and guarded
    with religious care. These objects, which are often taken from the
    mineral kingdom, are carried about in sacks, and are appealed to under
    every form of solemnity, to perform cures, and to grant deliverances,
    which would require a miracle. Their lesser <i>monedos</i>, of
    which the number is endless, are expected to operate through these
    idol-medicines. And although they do not bow down to them, nor appear
    to place an implicit confi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>dence in them, they remain in a state of
    mental alarm, which often impels them to resort to their influence.
    Nothing is more common, however, on conversing with them, than to find
    individuals, who are ready to acknowledge, the insufficiency of these
    means, and who appear to be prepared to abandon them, and embrace the
    doctrine of the Savior, the moment the fear of popular opinion among
    <em>their own people</em>, can be removed. No dead man has been deified
    by them, and they have not a name or word in their language, so far as
    known, which represents a god, but that of “Monedo.” This word, I am
    inclined to think, is itself, a derivative from one of the forms of the
    active verb, Momo, to take. But, like other Chippewa verbs, it is so
    buried and clogged with adjuncts, in the nature of prefix and suffix,
    that it might often require a Champollion to decipher it. And here,
    it may be observed, that Indian verbs, have not only the active and
    passive forms, but these forms are indicated by separate words. Thus,
    momo, verb active to take. Odápin, verb passive, to take. Each verb
    has the animate and inanimate forms. As most verbs are transitives,
    and their simplest forms indicate the third person singular of the
    imperative mood, the following conjugations of the verb, to take,
    result:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Momih, verb active, animate, take him.</li>
    <li>Momon, verb active, inanimate, take it.</li>
    <li>Odápin, verb passive, animate, take him.</li>
    <li>Odapinun, verb passive, inanimate, take it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><span class="smcap">Health</span>, and a peaceable intercourse with the natives, had, under
    Providence, preserved our party at the island in Cass Lake, and we
    rejoined them in their encampment, with mutual pleasure. The day
    following our arrival, being Monday, was devoted to the formalities of
    a council with the Indians. I stated to them the objects of my visit
    to the region, so far as these related to them—the desire felt by
    the Government for their welfare, and its anxiety to cultivate their
    friendship—and endeavored to impress upon their minds, the importance
    of terminating their warfare with their hereditary enemies, the Sioux.</p>

  <p>Oza Windib spoke in reply. Thanks, he said, were all they had to
    offer me, and through me, to the Great Chief of America, for the
    charitable feelings which had led to my visit, and the good counsels
    he had received. He should remember these counsels. They would be
    kept in his heart. He would endeavor to act by them. And although not
    himself a Chief, or the son of a Chief, he would exert the influence
    he possessed, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> induce his people to live in peace, and to listen to
    the voice of counsel. He rejoiced to see the American flag displayed
    at this remote point, and should the master of life preserve him
    till another year, it was his fixed purpose to visit the Agency at
    Michilimackinac.</p>

  <p>The son of Neezh Openais, or the Twin Birds, followed him. He said
    his father had received his medal from the American Chief, (the
    present Secretary of War, Hon. Lewis Cass.) who had visited, this
    lake, thirteen summers before. His father was now at Red Lake, but in
    going there, he had carried with him his friendship for the American
    Government, and he had directed him to express it to me, and to unite
    in the promotion of any good measure proposed. He assented to the
    sentiments uttered by Oza Windib. He approved of the advice. He would
    act by it. He thanked me, as being the bearer of it, and he looked to
    me to direct the Chippewas in their affairs, and to make them prosper.</p>

  <p>A deputy from the band at Red Lake, then delivered a peace pipe, with
    its garnished stem, decked with feathers, from Wai Wain Jeegun, a War
    Chief of that lake. He had sent it, it was declared, as a token of
    his friendship—his remembrance of the power that permitted traders to
    come into their country to supply them with goods, and his hope and
    expectation, that his remote position, and limited authority, might not
    operate, to render his present unwelcome. It had been prepared by his
    own hand. Although he had wielded the war club, it was in self defence,
    and to prevent others from saying he is a coward. The peace pipe he
    offered, he smoked, however, with his heart.</p>

  <p>The distribution of presents to the promiscuous assembly of men, women,
    and children, the payment of those who had furnished canoes, and the
    rewarding of the guides, closed the business of the council. I invested
    Oza Windib with a flag and the President’s medal, delivered a flag
    into the hands of Neezh Openais, for his father, and sent a message,
    with an acknowledgment and presents, to Wai Wain Jeegun. These things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
    dispatched, we prepared to embark for the portage to Leech Lake. But
    previous to quitting this lake, it may be proper to subjoin a few
    particulars respecting it, which, from a desire to gain a more perfect
    knowledge of it, were omitted, on first entering it.</p>

  <p>Cass Lake occupies a position on the American continent, and
    particularly in relation to the Upper Mississippi, which makes it
    desirable to acquire more accurate details and observations than it
    fell to our lot to be enabled to make. But in the absence of such
    data, such facts as our means permitted, may be substituted. We were
    impressed with its extent, the picturesque character of its islands,
    and the diversified appearance of its very irregular woodland shores.
    Its geological features are similar to those of Leech Lake and Lake
    Winnipec, being a basin of diluvial formation, spotted with islands,
    occupying a position on the great marine sand district of the Upper
    Mississippi. This district abounds in pure springs, and is so
    impervious in its lower strata, that it has probably retained to the
    present day, more water in the character of lakes, large and small,
    than any other part of the world. The greatest expanse of the lake
    appears to lie in the direction from north to south. Its length is from
    northeast to south-west. From the time consumed in passing through it,
    it cannot fall short of sixteen miles. It has four islands, the largest
    of which Colcaspi or Grand Island, which is itself of a most striking
    shape, occupying a large area in its centre and presenting its green
    forests of elm and oak in striking contrast with the bright expanse of
    waters. Allen’s Bay<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is, properly the head of this lake, receiving
    the Mississippi from the west. Nothing, however, in the mere figure of
    the lake, is so characteristic as the noble bay which puts out from its
    southern shore, presenting an expanse of clear and deep water which
    we were an hour, with every exertion, in crossing transversely. This
    bay was visited on the ice by the late General Pike, in his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>search
    of the sources of the Mississippi in the winter of 1806, and it may
    be appropriately named after a man, who, both as a traveller and a
    soldier, has so fair a claim to remembrance.</p>

  <p>Cass Lake has been estimated to be within a few miles of 3,000 from the
    Gulf of Mexico, and to lie at an elevation of 1,330 feet above that
    point of the Atlantic waters; its distance northwest of Sandy Lake, is
    about two hundred and seventy miles, and of Fond du Lac, four hundred
    and twenty miles. Estimates make it one hundred and eighty-two miles
    below the true source of the Mississippi in Itasca Lake, and sixty
    south of Red Lake. It receives Turtle River on its northern shore.
    This river is ascended through eleven small lakes, a distance of about
    thirty-eight to forty miles to its origin in Turtle Lake, once deemed
    to be the source of the Mississippi.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> There is a portage from the
    lake, for light packages of goods, across the summit level of the
    Mississippi valley into Red Lake, and the fertile valley of Red river.
    The latter embraces the settlements planted by the Earl of Selkirk,
    the inhabitants of which maintained their existence for several years
    against the strenuous opposition of the North West Company, and they
    appear now to be in a state of comparative prosperity under the
    direction of a local governor, council, and clergy.</p>

  <p>The portage from Pike’s Bay, (where we arrived at twelve o’clock in
    the morning, after a two hours journey from the island,) commences
    on the edge of an open pine forest, interspersed with shrub oak. The
    path is deeply worn, and looks as if it might have been used by the
    Indians, for centuries. It lies across a plain presenting the usual
    aridity of similar formations, and exhibiting the usual growth of
    underbrush and shrubbery. I observed the alum root, harebell and sweet
    fern, scattered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>through the more prevalent growth of wortle berry, L.
    latifolia, &amp;c. Markings and hieroglyphic characters were pointed out to
    us on the pines, some of which were said to be so ancient as to have
    been made by the people who occupied the country before the Ojibwais.
    Of the truth of this assertion there did not appear to be any certain
    means of judging. A blaze on the pinus resinosa, if made upon a matured
    tree, may be considered as comparatively permanent, from the fact that
    the outer bark is not apt to close over it, while the gum that exudes
    over the wounded surface, has some of the properties of a varnish. How
    long the rude drawings of birds and animals, made with charcoal would
    thus be preserved, is mere matter of conjecture, and must depend upon
    observations which we had no means of making.</p>

  <p>A portage of nine hundred and fifty yards brought us to the banks of
    a small lake, called Moss Lake, which we were but a short time in
    crossing. The water being clear, large masses appeared to rise from
    the bottom, which had very much the aspect of boulders. On reaching
    down, however, the men brought up on their paddles, a species of moss
    of a coarse fibrous character. And this moss seemed to be quite a
    characteristic trait of the lake. There is a slight relief, to both
    mind and body, in these changes from land to water transportation,
    even where the distance is very short; and the men resume their labor,
    in carrying, with greater alacrity. We found it so on the present
    occasion. No change however appeared in the general character of the
    country. We crossed a bog of perhaps fifty or sixty yards in extent,
    where the water appeared to have some motion towards the left. All the
    rest of the way consists of an unvaried sand plain, which is sometimes
    brushy, but generally open, presenting facilities for travelling. A
    walk of four thousand and one hundred yards, or about two and a half
    miles brought us out to the edge of Lake Shiba,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> a body of clear
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>water, of moderate dimensions, which has its outlet into an arm of
    Leech Lake. There is a portage path from its southern side which the
    Indians use when they are passing with light canoes.</p>

  <p>The day was well nigh spent, by the time the men brought up all the
    baggage to the banks of this lake. And the fatigue of the route itself
    might have justified our encamping. But whoever has a definite point
    to reach in a given time, will find that the loss of a single hour, or
    half hour of an evening’s journey, on sundry days, will soon combine
    to waste an entire day, which may be the exact time necessary to
    accomplish the route. Besides, when the question of going on, is at a
    spot where a <em>land</em> is to be exchanged for a <em>water</em> journey,
    there is a sensible relief to the men, in the position of sitting and
    being freed from the pressure of the head-strap, or <i>apicun</i>, by
    which they carry. And north-men thus embarked, in a state of fatigue,
    will soon resume their strength and gaiety. I felt this, on the present
    occasion, and directed them not to lose a moment in getting afloat. We
    crossed the lake, with but little effort, and entered its thread-like
    outlet, so tangled and wound about, in a shaking savannah, covered
    with sedge, that every point of the compass seemed to be alternately
    pursued. In this maze it was joined, from the right by a tributary of
    its own size, very welcome for its accession of waters, but not aiding
    to straighten the channel. Another tributary flows in directly opposite
    the Indian portage before referred to. This tributary appears to be
    the outlet of a contiguous, narrow and long lake, which can be, in
    part observed. The channel is suddenly enlarged by it, and it is soon
    after still further swelled by a similar inlet. Both these inlets are
    referred to by the Indians, by the phrase, “Kapucka Sagitowag.” The
    stream is so enlarged by them, as not only to assume the character of
    a river, but it is a river of handsome magnitude, broad and deep but
    without strong current. Its shores assume a low and marshy character,
    and they are fringed with extensive fields of wild rice. Amidst these,
    the river opens into an arm of Leech Lake. The last glimpses of day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
    light here left us. We pursued our way by moonlight for a time. The sky
    was overcast before we effected our first traverse. Sometime previous
    to landing it became quite dark. Even with the knowledge of an Indian
    guide, it was necessary to fire guns, to ascertain the position of the
    principal village. It was ten o’clock, on our landing, and it was an
    hour later before the military canoes came up. Salutes were separately
    fired by the Indians through the top openings of their lodges. In
    the morning, (17th,) a more formal salute was given. Fresh fish and
    wortle-berries were brought in: and an invitation to breakfast sent
    from the presiding chief.</p>

  <p>Leech Lake is one of the most irregular shaped bodies of water that
    can be conceived of. It is neither characteristically long, spherical,
    or broad, but rather a combination of curves, in the shape of points,
    peninsulas, and bays, of which nothing short of a map can convey an
    accurate idea. The Indians, whom I requested to draw a sketch of it,
    began by tracing an oblong as large as half a sheet of foolscap would
    admit of. They filled it up by projecting points inwardly, or extended
    it by tracing bays outwardly. Ten islands were drawn in different
    parts of it, and seven rivers and creeks made to enter it. Its outlet
    is called by them the great river, and is towards the northeast. The
    lake cannot be less than twenty miles across the extreme points of
    the waters. Its principal peninsula resembles in shape the letter
    T. Ottertail Point is a part of its northern shore. Its waters are
    deep and clear in all its central parts, and yield the white-fish and
    other species. Its numerous and extensive bays abound in wild rice,
    and attract in the proper season, a great variety of water fowl. The
    pelican, swan, brant, and cormorant, are the largest of the species
    that annually visit it. Its shores yield the deer and bear. Beavers
    were formerly abundant, but they have, in a great measure, disappeared.
    The muskrat and marten are now the principal items of its fine furs.
    The subjoined sketch is from the notes of Lieut. Allen.</p>

  <p>“My intercourse with the Indians at this lake occupied the day
    after my arrival. The population was reported at eight hundred and
    thirty-two souls. Seven eights of this number, are of the band called
    Mukkundwais, or Pillagers, a term derived from occurrences in their
    early history. The remainder are locally denominated the Bear Island
    Indians. The principal chiefs are Aish Kibug Ekozh, or The Gueule
    Plat, and The Elder Brother, and Chianoquot. This band appear to have
    separated themselves from the other Chippewas, at an early day, and to
    have taken upon themselves the duty which Reuben, Gad, and Menasseh
    assumed, when they crossed the Jordan. They have “passed armed before
    their brethren,” in their march westward. Their geographical position
    is one, which imposes upon them the defence of this portion of the
    Chippewa frontier. And it is a defence in which they have distinguished
    themselves as brave and active warriors. Many acts of intrepidity are
    related of them which would be recorded, with admiration, had white men
    been the actors. Perfectly versed in the arts of the forest, they have
    enjoyed the advantage of concealment in the progress of a war, which
    has been directed against the Sioux, a powerful assemblage of tribes,
    who live essentially in plains, but who aim to make up the disadvantage
    of this exposure, by moving habitually in larger bodies. It seems,
    however, indisputable, that, with fewer numbers, the Chippewas have not
    hesitated to fall upon their enemies, and have routed them, and driven
    them before them, with a valor and resolution, which in any period of
    written warfare, would have been stamped as heroic. It is not easy, on
    the part of government, to repress the feelings of hostility, which
    have so long existed, and to convince them, that they have lived into
    an age when milder maxims furnish the basis of wise action. Pacific
    counsels fall with little power upon a people situated so remotely from
    every good influence, and who cannot perceive in the restless spirit of
    their enemies, any safeguard for the continuance of a peace, however
    formally it may have been concluded. This fact was adverted to by one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
    of their chiefs, who observed that they were compelled to fight in
    self defence. Although the Sioux had made a solemn peace with them at
    Tipisagi in 1825, they were attacked by them that very year, and had
    almost yearly since, sustained insidious or open attacks. He said,
    “his own son, his only son,” was among the number, who had been basely
    killed, without an opportunity to defend himself.”</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> domestic manners and habits of a people, whose position is so
    adverse to improvement, could hardly be expected to present any thing
    strikingly different, from other erratic bands of the northwest. There
    is indeed a remarkable conformity in the external habits of all our
    northern Indians. The necessity of changing their camps often, to
    procure game or fish, the want of domesticated animals, the general
    dependence on wild rice, and the custom of journeying in canoes, has
    produced a general uniformity of life. And it is emphatically a life of
    want and vicissitude. There is a perpetual change between action and
    inanity, in the mind, which is a striking peculiarity of the savage
    state. And there is such a general want of forecast, that most of their
    misfortunes and hardships, in war and peace, come unexpectedly. None
    of the tribes who inhabit this quarter, can be said to have, thus far,
    derived any peculiarities from civilized instruction. The only marked
    alteration which their state of society has undergone, appears to be
    referable to the era of the introduction of the fur trade, when they
    were made acquainted with, and adopted the use of, iron, gunpowder,
    and woollens. This implied a considerable change of habits, and of the
    mode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> of subsistence; and may be considered as having paved the way
    for further changes in the mode of living and dress. But it brought
    with it the onerous evil of intemperance, and it left the mental
    habits essentially unchanged. All that related to a system of dances,
    sacrifices, and ceremonies, which stood in the place of religion,
    still occupies that position, presenting a subject which is deemed the
    peculiar labor of evangelists and teachers. Missionaries have been
    slow to avail themselves of this field of labor, and it should not
    excite surprise, that the people themselves are, to so great a degree,
    <em>mentally</em> the same in 1832, that they were on the arrival of the
    French in the St. Lawrence in 1532.</p>

  <p>Partial exceptions in the acquisition of civil information, are to be
    found; and the incident I am about to relate, is the more remarkable
    as connected with the history of a chief, who has passed his life in
    so very unfrequented a part of the continent, with only the advantages
    of occasional short visits to the posts of St. Mary’s, St. Peter’s and
    Michilimackinac. Aish Kibug Ekozh, or the Guelle Plat, is the ruler
    of the Pillager band, exercising the authority of both a civil and
    war chief. And he is endowed with talents which certainly entitle him
    to this distinction. Complying with European customs, he directed his
    young men to fire a salute on the morning of my arrival. Soon after he
    sent one of his officials to invite me to breakfast. I accepted the
    invitation. But not knowing how the meal could be suitably got along
    with, without bread, I took the precaution to send up a tin dish of
    pilot bread. I went to his residence at the proper time, accompanied by
    Mr. Johnston. I found him living in a comfortable log building of two
    rooms, well floored, and roofed, with a couple of small glass windows.
    A mat was spread upon the centre of the floor, which contained the
    break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>fast. Other mats were spread around it, to sit on. We followed
    his example in sitting down after the eastern manner. There was no
    other person admitted to the meal but his wife, who sat near him, and
    poured out the tea, but ate or drank nothing herself. Tea cups, and tea
    spoons, plates, knives and forks, of plain manufacture, were carefully
    arranged, and the number corresponding exactly with the expected
    guests. A white fish, cut up and boiled in good taste, occupied a dish
    in the centre, from which he helped us. A salt cellar, in which pepper
    and salt were mixed in unequal proportions, allowed each the privilege
    of seasoning his fish with both or neither. Our tea was sweetened
    with the native sugar, and the dish of hard bread seemed to have been
    precisely wanted to make out the repast. It needed but the imploring of
    a blessing, to render it essentially a christian meal.</p>

  <p>This chief brought me a letter from the interior some years ago, at St.
    Mary’s, in which he is spoken of as “the most respectable man in the
    Chippewa country.” And if the term was applied to his mental qualities,
    and the power of drawing just conclusions from known premises, and the
    effects which these have had on his standing and influence with his
    own band, it is not misapplied. Shrewdness and quickness most of the
    chiefs possess, but there is more of the character of common sense
    and practical reflection, in the Guelle Plat’s remarks, than, with a
    very extensive acquaintance, I recollect to have noticed in most of
    the chiefs now living, of this tribe.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He is both a warrior and a
    counsellor, and these distinctions he holds, not from any hereditary
    right, for he is a self-made man, but from the force of his own
    character. I found him ready to converse on the topics of most interest
    to him. And the sentiments he uttered on the Sioux war, the fur trade,
    and the location of trading posts and agencies, were such as would
    occur to a mind <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>which had possessed itself of facts, and was capable
    of reasoning from them. His manners were grave and dignified, and his
    oratory such as to render him popular with his tribe.</p>

  <p>During the repast, the room became filled with Indians, apparently the
    relatives and intimate friends of the chief, who seated themselves
    orderly and silently around the room. When we arose, the chief assumed
    the oratorical attitude, and addressed himself to me.</p>

  <p>He expressed his regret that I had not been able to visit them the
    year before, when I was expected.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He hoped I had now come, as I
    came by surprise, to remain some days with them. He said, they lived
    at a remote point, and were involved in wars with their neighbors, and
    wished my advice. They were not insensible to advice, nor incapable of
    following it. They were anxious for counsel, and desirous of living at
    peace, and of keeping the advice which had heretofore been given them.
    They had been told to sit still on their lands, but their enemies would
    not permit them to sit still. They were compelled to get up, and fight
    in self defence. The Sioux continued to kill their hunters. They had
    killed his son, during the last visit he had made to my office. They
    had never ceased to make inroads. And he believed there were white men
    among them, who stirred them up to go to war against the Chippewas. He
    named one person particularly.</p>

  <p>It was necessary, he continued, to take some decisive steps to put a
    stop to these inroads. This was the reason why he had led out the war
    party, which had recently returned. This was the reason why I saw the
    stains of blood before me.</p>

  <p>He alluded, in the last expression, to the flags, war clubs, and
    medals, which decorated one end of the room, all of which had vermilion
    smeared over them to represent blood. I replied, that I would assemble
    the Indians at a general council, at my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>camp, as soon as preparations
    could be made; that notice would be given them by the firing of the
    military, and that I should then lay before them the advice I came to
    deliver from their Great Father, the President, and offer, at the same
    time, my own counsel, on the subjects he had spoken of.</p>

  <p>During the day constant accessions were made to the number of Indians,
    from neighboring places. And before the hour of the council arrived,
    there could have been but little short of a thousand souls present.
    Most of the warriors carried their arms, and were painted and drest
    in their gayest manner. And they walked through the village with a
    bold and free air, in striking contrast with the subdued and cringing
    aspect, which is sometimes witnessed in the vicinity of the posts
    and settlements. Many applications were made for the extraction of
    decayed teeth, and for blood letting, the latter of which appears to
    be a favorite remedy among the northern Indians. Most of the time of
    the surgeon, (Dr. Houghton,) was however employed in the application
    of the vaccine virus, which constituted one of the primary objects
    of the visit. Among the number vaccinated by him, one was past the
    age of eighty, several between sixty and eighty, and a large number
    under the age of ten. Little difficulty was found in getting them to
    submit to the process, and wherever there was hesitancy or refusal, it
    seemed to arise from a distrust of the protective power of the disease.
    None had been previously vaccinated. Of the younger classes, it was
    remarked here, as at other places, that the boys evinced no fear on the
    display of the lancet, but nearly every female child, either came with
    reluctance and entreaty of the parents, or was absolutely obliged to
    be held, during the process. The ravages made by the small pox in this
    quarter, about the year 1782, were remembered with the distinctness
    of recent tradition, and had its effects in preparing their minds,
    generally, not only to receive the vaccine virus, but in imparting a
    solicitude that all might be included, so as to ensure them from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
    recurrence of a pestilence, which they regard with horror. Their name
    for this disease, of Ma Mukkizziwin, suggests the disfiguration of the
    flesh and skin produced by it.</p>

  <p>Among the number of Indians who arrived here, during the day, were a
    party of nine Rainy Lake Indians under the leadership of a man named
    Wai Wizhzhi Geezhig, or The Hole in the Sky. He represented himself and
    party as part of a small band residing at Springing-bow-string Lake,
    in the middle grounds between Lake Winnipec and Rainy Lake. He said,
    they had heard of my passing the post of Winnipec, with an intention
    of returning through Leech Lake. This was the cause of his visit.
    They lived off from the great lake, and seldom saw Americans. He came
    to express his good will, hoping to be remembered, as he now saw his
    father, among his children, &amp;c. I presented him, publicly, with my own
    hand, with a flag, and directed to be laid before him an amount of
    presents, committing to him, at the same time, a short address to be
    delivered to the American portion of the Rainy Lake Indians.</p>

  <p>The hour for the council having arrived, and the Mukkundwa, or
    Pillagers, being present with their chiefs and warriors, women and
    children, I caused the presents intended for this band, to be displayed
    in bulk, on blankets spread on the grass, in front of my tent. I
    called their attention to the subjects named in my instructions,
    the desire of the government for the restoration of peace, and its
    paternal character, feelings, and wishes in relation, particularly, to
    them—reminded them of their solemn treaty of peace and limits with the
    Sioux, at Prairie du Chien in 1825, enforcing the advantages of it,
    in its bearings on their hunting, trade, and well being. The presents
    were then delivered to the chiefs, as an earnest of good will and
    sincerity on the part of the government, and were by them directed to
    be immediately divided and distributed.</p>

  <p>Aish Kibug Ekozh, or the Guelle Plat, was their speaker in reply. He
    called the attention of the warriors to his words. He thanked me for
    the presents, which reminded him, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> amount, of the times when the
    British held possession in that quarter. He pointed across an arm of
    the lake, in front, to the position formerly occupied by the North West
    Company’s fort. He said many winters had now passed since the Americans
    first sent one of their chiefs to that post, (alluding to the visit of
    Pike.) He remembered that visit. I had now come, it appeared, to remind
    them that the American flag was flying in the land, and to offer them
    counsels of peace. He thanked me for them. He had hoped that I was to
    spend more time with them, that they might consult on a reply, but as
    they must speak on the instant, (orders had been given for embarking
    that evening) they would not lose the opportunity of declaring their
    sentiments.</p>

  <p>He had before heard the Americans say, peace, peace! But he thought
    their advice resembled a rushing wind. It was strong and went soon.
    It did not abide long enough to choke up the road. At the treaty of
    Tipisagi,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> it had been promised that the aggressors should be
    punished; but that very year they were attacked by the Sioux; and
    almost yearly since, some of their nation had been killed. They had
    even been fired on by the Sioux, under the walls of the fort at Ishki
    Buggi Seebi,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and four of their number had been killed. He had,
    himself, been present. He here asked one of his subordinates for a
    bundle of sticks, which he handed to me saying, it is the number of
    the Leech Lake Chippewas who have been killed by the Sioux, since they
    signed the treaty of Tipisagi. The number was forty-three.</p>

  <p>He then lifted up four silver medals, attached by a string of wampum,
    and smeared with vermilion. Take notice, he said they are bloody. I
    wish you to wipe off the blood. I am unable to do it. I find myself
    irretrievably involved in a war with the Sioux. I believe it has been
    intended by the creator <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>that we should be at war with this people. I
    am not satisfied with the result of the last war party. My warriors
    are not satisfied. They are brave men. It is to them I owe success,
    and not to myself. Both they, and I, have heretofore looked for help
    where we did not find it. (He alluded to the American government.) We
    are determined to revenge ourselves. If the United States does not aid
    us, I have it in mind to apply for aid elsewhere. (He alluded to the
    British government.) My warriors are in a restless state. I have sent
    my pipe and invitations to my friends around, to continue the war.
    Circumstances control me. I cannot avoid it. My feelings are enlisted
    deeply in the contest. When the enemy killed my son, I resolved never
    to lay down the war club. I have sought death in battle but have not
    met it. All I now can say is this, that perhaps I shall not lead out
    the next war party.</p>

  <p>Other parts of his speech on the war are omitted. This is, however, the
    thread, although a broken thread of his argument, omitting frequent and
    glowing appeals to his warriors, who expressed their approbation at
    every pause.</p>

  <p>He proceeded to accuse persons on the waters of the Upper Mississippi,
    of giving advice to the Sioux to go to war against the Chippewas. He
    said it was the interest of persons in the trade to induce the Sioux
    to extend their hunting grounds across the boundary lines. He evinced
    a familiarity with persons and places. He boldly accused, not only
    traders, but even some persons holding offices under government, of
    participating in this course of mal-advice.</p>

  <p>He complained of the traders. He criticised their conduct with
    severity. He declared their prices to be exorbitant, and said they were
    so intent on getting furs, that they did not deem it necessary to use
    much formality in their dealings. He complained of the exclusion of
    ardent spirits, but at the same time admitted, that formerly it was
    brought in to buy up their wild rice—a practice which left them at the
    beginning of cold weather, in a destitute situation.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

  <p>Much of the sentiment of this address appeared to be uttered for
    popular effect. There was a marked difference between the tone of his
    private conversation, and his public address, of which more will appear
    in the sequel. Such parts of it, as required it, were replied to, and
    the simple truths, political and moral, dictating the visit to them,
    brought clearly before their minds, so as to leave definite impressions.</p>

  <p>So far as related to the traders withdrawing the article of whiskey
    from the trade, I felt it due to say, that no hard feelings should be
    entertained towards them. That it was excluded by the Indian Office.
    They should, therefore, in justice, blame me or blame the government,
    but not the traders. I was satisfied, I added, that the use of whiskey
    was very hurtful to them, in every situation of life, and felt
    determined to employ every means which the control of the agency of the
    northwest gave me, to exclude the article wholly, and rigidly from the
    Chippewas, and to set the mark of disapprobation upon every trader who
    should make the attempt to introduce it.</p>

  <p>It was near the hour of sunset when the council closed. Minor duties
    employed some time after. And while these were in the progress of
    execution, the Guelle Plat, who had been the principal actor during
    the day, gave us occasion to observe, that if he had studied effect in
    speaking, he was also a judge of propriety in dress. At a dinner to
    which I invited him, at my tent, and also during the public council
    following it, he appeared in his native costume. But after the close
    of the council and before we embarked, he came down to the lake shore,
    to bid us fare well, dressed in a blue military frock coat, with red
    collar and cuffs, with white underclothes, a linen ruffled shirt, shoes
    and stockings, and a neat citizen’s hat. To have uttered his speeches
    in this foreign costume, might have been associated in the minds of
    his people, with the idea of servility; but he was willing afterwards
    to let us observe, by assuming it, that he knew we would consider it a
    mark of respect.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

  <p>This chief appears to be turned of sixty. In stature he is about
    five feet nine or ten inches, erect and stout, somewhat inclined to
    corpulency. He is a native of this lake, of the <i>totem</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of
    the Owásissi, a kind of fish. He observed at my table, at St. Mary’s,
    four years ago, that he had been twenty-five times on war parties,
    either as leader or follower, and had escaped without a wound. He was
    once surrounded by a party of Sioux, with only three companions. They
    cut their way out killing two men. He was early drawn into intercourse
    with the British at Fort William, on Lake Superior, where he received
    his first medal. This medal was taken from him by Lieut. Pike, in 1806.
    I renewed it, by the largest class of solid silver medals, July 19th,
    1828.</p>

  <p>Reciprocating the customary compliment in parting, we embarked and
    encamped on a contiguous part of the coast, where we could procure fire
    wood, and be sure of making an early start on the morrow.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Leech</span> Lake has been one of the principal posts of trade in the
    northwest since the region was first laid open to the enterprise of
    the fur trade, and it has probably yielded more wealth in furs and
    skins, than one of the richest mines of silver would have produced.
    European goods were extremely high at the period referred to, at the
    same time, that furs were abundant, and the ability of the Indians to
    pay, consequently, ample. The standard of value and computation in
    this trade, is an abiminikwa, or prime beaver, called <em>plus</em> by
    the French. A plus, tradition states, was given for as much vermilion
    as would cover the point of a case knife, and the same price was paid
    respectively for four charges of powder, or four charges of shot, or
    fifteen balls, or two branches of wampum. It is related that an outfit
    of six bales of goods, worth, say $2000, brought from Athabasca,
    ninety-six packs of beaver, each of which would weigh ninety pounds,
    at a time when prime beaver was worth four dollars per pound. A fine
    gun, worth ten guineas, was sold to a chief at one of the northern
    posts, for one hundred and twenty pounds of beaver, say four hundred
    and eighty dollars. The post of the Pic, alone, is said to have yielded
    one hundred packs of beaver, during a single season. From the MSS.
    of M. Perrault, now before us, referred to in a previous part of our
    narrative, the rates at which furs were reduced to the plus, at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
    lake, in 1784, were the following. A bear was estimated to be one plus,
    an otter, three martens, a lynx, fifteen muskrats, respectively, one
    plus. A buffalo robe, two plus. A keg of mixed rum, which was then
    the kind of spirits used in the trade, was sold at thirty plus, and
    the Indians, when they commenced trading, first put out the furs they
    intended as pay for their liquor.</p>

  <p>The Leech Lake Indians were then stated to be numerous, although, in
    common with other northern bands, they had also suffered from the
    general ravages of the small pox, in this region, two years previous.
    They were, however, then, as now, deemed a turbulent band, and such was
    the fear of giving additional excitement to their passions, that the
    liquor which was sold to them, was put in <em>cache</em> at the entrance
    of the river, that it might not be delivered to them, until the traders
    had finished their traffic, (which on that occasion, occupied but a
    <em>single</em> day,) and embarked on their return for Michilimackinac.
    Besides the original robbery of a principal trader, which drew upon
    them the name of Pillagers, their intercourse with the traders has been
    of a character to require perpetual caution to avoid the recurrence
    of serious difficulties. It is but two years ago that they confined
    a trader to his lodge, and threatened him, in such a manner, that he
    was happy to escape from the country with his life, and has not since
    returned to it.</p>

  <p>During the winter of 1821-22, a man named Relle, who was employed at
    Leech Lake, to collect credits, as it is termed, entered the lodge
    of a hunter named Puganoc i.&nbsp;e. Nutwood, and without much ceremony,
    obtained the Indian’s furs. He had as he conceived, got consent which
    the Indian afterwards withdrew. Relle, however, whose business it was
    to collect furs for his employer, and who had, from long usage, become
    expert in that employment, did not pay that deference to the Indian’s
    wishes, which he probably would have done, could we suppose that he
    considered them to indicate any more, than a mere reluctance to part
    with the furs. On this point we are without particular information.
    Be this as it may, Relle took up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> the furs, and proceeded homewards.
    Puganoc followed him but without any demonstrations of anger. It might
    be supposed that he intended in make a friendly visit to the post, for
    the purpose of further trading, and Relle evidently so considered the
    circumstance of his accompanying him, for he was wholly unsuspicious of
    latent revenge. Silent as this passion was kept, it burned, however, in
    the Indian’s breast, and, in crossing a lake, on the ice, the Indian
    treading in the hindmost step, (a practice in walking with snow shoes,)
    he suddenly discharged his piece. The ball entered his victim’s back
    below the shoulders. He fell dead. Puganoc then drew his knife, cut
    off two of the voyageur’s fingers, to make it appear that he had been
    struggling with an adversary, then threw down the knife on the snow,
    and returned with a report that the man had been killed by the Sioux.</p>

  <p>It may be interesting to notice the fate of Puganoc. Attempts for his
    surrender to the civil authorities were made, but without success.
    Meantime he was regarded as having forfeited his life by a young
    Chippewa of his own band, a relative, perhaps, of the deceased
    voyageur’s Indian wife. While assembled to amuse themselves by firing
    at a mark, this young man, as it became his turn to fire, saw Puganoc
    lifting the cloth door of his tent, and wheeling half a circle in his
    aim, fired his ball through the neck of the assassin, and killed him on
    the spot.</p>

  <p>Pride, and the desire of personal distinction, as in other tribes which
    have not the light of christianity to guide them, may be considered
    as lying at the foundation of the Indian character. For there are no
    tribes so poor and remote as not to have pride. And this passion seems
    always to be coupled with a desire of applause, and with the wish on
    the part of its possessors to be thought better than they really are.
    We have found pride in the remotest Indian lodge we ever visited, and
    have hardly ever engaged in ten minutes conversation with a northern
    Indian, without discovering it not only to exist, but, where there was
    moral energy at all, as constituting the primary motive to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> action.
    It has always been found, however, unaccompanied by one of its most
    constant concomitants, in civilised life—namely, the desire of wealth.</p>

  <p>The workings of this principle may, indeed, be looked upon as the
    chief motive of Indian emigration, and as causing tribe to secede
    from tribe, and leading to that multiplication of petty nations, each
    with some peculiarities of language, which marks the face of the
    northern regions. Did we possess any thing like a clear and connected
    tradition of these migrations, even for a few hundred years, we should
    perhaps have cause to blush that so many blunders had been committed
    in assigning so many primitive stocks, when, in fact, there is great
    reason to believe, that the primitive stocks are few.</p>

  <p>Tradition does not reach far, where there is neither pen nor pencil
    to perpetuate the memory of events. People who are constantly and
    habitually concerned, how they shall subsist, and what they shall wear,
    will soon forget, in the realities before them, occurrences which can
    no longer produce fear or excite hope. And were it otherwise,—were
    they as prone to reflect as they are to act, the very misery in which
    they live, would take away the pleasure of historical reminiscence.
    Oral history is very uncertain at best. Every repetition varies the
    language at least, and it must be a very stoical people, indeed,
    who, in repeating their own story, do not add to the coloring, if
    not the number of circumstances, which serve to give pleasure or to
    flatter pride. Unfortunately such appears to have been the state of
    the north-western Indians, as far as we know any thing of them, that
    they could not, in strict truth, repeat very little of their history,
    without giving pain, or exciting feelings, often of pity, and often
    of humiliation. The few favorable points would naturally grow by the
    process of repetition, out of all proportion. And fiction would often
    be called on, to supply lapses. Hence it is, perhaps, that in looking
    over our printed materials for Indian history, we are so apt to find
    that every tribe arrogates to itself the honor of being original,
    great, brave, magnanimous, above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> its neighbors. Indeed we regard all
    unrecorded Indian tradition, referring to events beyond the close of
    the sixteenth century, as entitled to no confidence.</p>

  <p>The names the Indians bestowed upon themselves, contain no clue to
    their early history. They were, for the most part purely accidental, as
    they are at this day. They do not refer to their origin. They do not
    in some cases, even signify their peculiarities. This is, we think,
    emphatically true of the various tribes of Algonquins. To part of the
    people composing this stock, who were settled in a country abounding
    in lakes and streams, they gave the local name of Nipissings, i.&nbsp;e.
    People of the Place of Waters. Part, who lived on the north shore of
    the Gulf of St. Lawrence, subsisting on fish, they called Popinoshees,
    alluding to a kind of fish. Those who dwelt in swampy grounds, (as
    between that point and Lake Superior,) were called Mushkeegos, from the
    name for swamp. Those who lived in plains, south-west of Lake Michigan,
    Muscotins, from plain. Others having a peculiarity of intonation, were
    called Ojibwas, or Chippewas; a band who lit up a council fire for
    themselves, Pottawattomies; another band, given to trading. Ottawas;
    another who inflicted cruelties in their northern wars, Kenistonos;
    another who lived inland, Nopimings. Others might be added to the list.
    These were all identical people; but not one of the name referred to
    their origin. The French, on their arrival increased the confusion,
    by bestowing a new name upon each, rendering the thread of history
    more entangled, and utterly confounding all attempts to trace their
    affiliation by etymology. They called the first band whom they found
    speaking this language, on the St. Lawrence, Algonquins, probably
    because they subsisted on the oga. This term has become generic. But
    there is no light thrown by it on the history of the race. Nay, there
    is not a particle of proof that the Indians had bestowed it upon
    themselves, or that it was not given like all their other appellations,
    as a mere <i lang="fr">nom de guerre</i>. No wonder should therefore be
    expressed, that classifications founded on etymological proofs should
    have been found defective.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

  <p>But we shall not pursue the subject. The Leech Lake Indians, like
    others of the stock, derive their distinctive appellation from a
    mere accident. They are not, however, separated by any distinctive
    feature, from the rest of the more favorably located Chippewas. Their
    prominent manners and customs, ceremonies and opinions, are the same.
    They migrated by the same track, adopted the same means of living,
    sought the attainment of the same general objects, and speak the same
    language. There are minor peculiarities of speech in most of the bands
    of this nation, separated by a few hundred miles. But they consist
    mostly in accent, with some interchanges of the labial and liquid
    consonants. The vowel sounds are identical. Whatever remarks could be
    made, therefore, on the principles of the language, would be equally
    applicable to the current language of other Chippewa bands.</p>

  <p>This language covers an extensive area in the west, and the north-west.
    It is emphatically the <em>court language</em> of the Indians, being
    the medium of communication, in all general councils. Its copiousness
    and freedom from the barbarities which disfigure many of the native
    languages, were remarked at an early day, and have led to its being
    more studied and spoken, than perhaps any other native American
    language. The regret has been expressed, that where so many good
    points exist, there should be found any defects to mar them. In its
    grammatical structure, it exhibits some peculiarities, which do not,
    perhaps, admit of being strictly classed with other transpositive
    languages, although it has most features in coincidence with them.
    Originally, simple in its character, and consisting of scarcely any
    distinctions of speech, beyond the verb and substantive, and the
    pronominal and other primary particles, the tendency of usage and
    invention has been, to increase the length of words by combination,
    rendering them formidable to the eye, and pompous to the ear. These
    combinations assume almost every shape, in which words can be made
    to coalesce. And the primitives when thus united, are still further
    compoun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>ded by inflections for time and person, for number and quality,
    and sometimes to indicate other circumstances, as if it were the chief
    scope of the speaker to concentrate all the offices of speech in a
    single word, or a single expression. But in this process of accretion,
    as might be expected, clearness and simplicity are often sacrificed to
    sound, and the distinctions of person, and number, and tense, are not,
    perhaps, always accurately preserved. So many letters, and even whole
    syllables, are also dropped, to effect the purposes of a harmonious
    coalescence, agreeably to the Indian ear, that it becomes extremely
    difficult to trace analogies, and one of the usual helps to comparison,
    is thus withdrawn. Number is entirely wanting in the third person of
    the declension of their pronouns and nouns, and in the conjugation
    of their verbs. Nor is there any distinction to mark the sex of the
    third person, although the first and second persons, are uniformly and
    scrupulously thus marked. He and she, him and her, are expressed by the
    same word, or the same pronominal sign. Although there is a positive
    and a conditional future, in the conjugation of their verbs, the
    compound tenses, are generally thought to be defective.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding these deficiencies, the language admits of many fine
    turns of expression, and pointed terms of irony, and in its general
    simplicity, and nervous brevity, will admit of a comparison with some
    terms of scripture phraseology. Among its grammatical forms, there
    are several, which exhibit beautiful and succinct modes of conveying
    thought. All its active verbs can be multiplied as often as there
    are distinct objects of their action, and they are conjugated both
    negatively, as well as positively. Substantives admit of adjective
    terminations, and adjectives of substantive terminations. Both can
    be turned into verbs, and both are endowed with number. Pronouns are
    inflected for time, and in this shape, supply the want of our auxiliary
    verbs. The verb, to be, may be said to characterize this language,
    as differing from some of the Indian languages, although its use is
    restricted, and there is no declarative exis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>tence indicated in the
    ordinary conjugation of verbs. As all nouns assume verbal terminations,
    they undergo all the modifications of other verbs. Possession is
    indicated by an inflection analogous to, but differing from case.
    Locality, diminution, and derogation, may be, either separately, or
    all together, denoted by inflections of the noun. Particles, are very
    copiously used. And this part of speech is very important, making
    the use of words definite or exact, which without these adjuncts,
    would often lack both coherence and exactitude. Adverbs are liberally
    employed, and by their help, the degrees of comparison are formed.
    There is but one degree of comparison formed by an inflection of the
    substantive. There is a numerous list of prepositions, which are not,
    however, disjunctively used, but always as the prefixed syllable or
    syllables, to substantives. Conjunctions, of which the language has
    a number, are not thus restricted, and cannot thus be used. The most
    important distinction, however, which belongs to the language, and that
    which most rigidly pervades its forms, is the separation of words into
    two classes, distinguished as <em>animate</em> and <em>inanimate</em>, or
    personal and impersonal, carrying also, the idea of noble and ignoble.
    This principle, merges the ordinary distinctions of gender, and
    imparts a two-fold character to the verb, substantive, and adjective,
    and consequently creates the necessity of double conjugations and
    declensions. This results from the transitive character of the whole
    language, and its habitual application to material objects. The verb
    which would be used to imply vision, is made to indicate the presence
    or absence of vitality, creating the distinction of the <em>animate</em>
    and <em>inanimate</em> forms. The same principle interdicts the
    promiscuous use of adjectives. A strong man and a strong house,
    require different modifications of the word strong. All its concords
    are directed to the upholding of this rule. This novel and curious
    principle, appears to lie at the foundation of the syntax, and imparts
    to the language its most marked characteristic feature. Whatever
    modifications other rules require, they all coincide in this. It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
    point which every good speaker pays attention to. And as the rule may
    be arbitrarily employed, it enables him to invest the whole inanimate
    creation with life, and thus to throw a charm over the most barren
    waste; an advantage which is very freely resorted to, in their oral
    tales and mythological fables.</p>

  <p>In contemplating such a language, it is impossible to avoid the
    observation of many beauties and many defects. But its beauties do
    not appear to be of a character to entitle them to the enthusiastic
    encomiums which have been bestowed upon some of our Indian languages;
    nor do its defects and barbarisms merit the depreciating terms
    which have been applied to others. Truth, in this, as in many other
    metaphysical investigations, will be found to lie in a mean. If there
    are forms and expressions suited to call forth the applause of the
    speculative philologist, there are also many features for him to
    rectify or condemn. Like the character of the people by whom it is
    spoken, its principles are perpetually verging to extremes. There is
    either a redundancy of forms creating distinctions, not, in all cases,
    of very obvious utility, or an absolute want of them. And the inquirer
    is often led to wonder, how a people who require the nice distinctions
    in the one case, should be able to dispense with distinctions
    altogether in the other.</p>

  <p>From this vacillation between barbarism and refinement, poverty and
    redundance, a method strictly philosophical or purely accidental,
    there might be reason to infer that the people themselves, by whom the
    language is spoken, were formerly in a more advanced and cultivated
    state. And that a language once copious and exact, partaking of the
    fortunes of the people, degenerated further and further into barbarism
    and confusion, as one tribe after another separated from the parent
    stock. Change of accent would alone produce a great diversity of sound.
    Accident would give some generic peculiarities: and that permutation
    of the consonants, which we see among the Algonquin bands, would, in
    the end, leave little besides the vowel sounds, and the interchangeable
    consonants, to identify tribes long separated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> time and by distance,
    without means of intercommunication, without letters, and without
    arts. If compared by these principles there is reason to believe,
    philologists would find the primitive languages of America extremely
    few, and their grammatical principles, either identical or partaking
    largely of the same features. And to this result, the tendency of
    inquiry on this side the Atlantic is slowly verging, however it may
    contravene the theories of learned and ingenious philologists in
    Europe. The inquiry is fraught with deep interest to the philosophical
    mind; and it offers a field for intellectual achievement, which it
    may be hoped will not be left uncultivated by the pens of piety,
    philosophy, or genius.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving the Gueule Plat’s village, the Surgeon and Interpreter, with
    Lieut. Allen’s command, were left behind to complete the vaccination
    of the Indians, while the rest of the party went forward a couple of
    leagues, to form the night’s encampment. It was after seven o’clock
    before they came up, and we waited some time after supper, which is
    generally a late meal in voyaging, for the arrival of the Indian
    guides, who had been promised to conduct us next day, to the landing
    of the portage to the river De Corbeau. Morning, however, came without
    them, and we embarked, (18th,) and proceeded towards the southern
    shore of the lake, under the hope of being able to find the portage,
    from the descriptions which had been given of it. Our course lay,
    for a distance, along the peninsula, on which we had encamped. Its
    trending too far to the east, induced us to hold a southerly course
    across a spacious bay. On gaining its centre, doubts arose, as to
    the proper course. A separation of the party was made. Part of the
    canoes took a south, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> part, a south-east course, having agreed
    to concentrate on the firing of a gun, a signal which was eventually
    given, by the southern canoes under Mr. Johnston and Lieut. Allen.
    They had discovered a path, having every appearance of a portage,
    being in the required direction. Examination served to confirm this
    opinion. The baggage was immediately landed, the loose articles put in
    a portable shape, and the order of march on a portage, taken up. For
    this purpose, every article of the outfit, is originally put up in the
    most compact and convenient form, not exceeding ninety pounds weight.
    Pork is packed in kegs, flour in sail cloth bags, groceries in wooden
    or tin canisters, goods in corded bales. These are carried on the back,
    by a strong strap of leather passed around the forehead, and tied by
    its tapering ends, to the bag, or other article, forming the first,
    or lower piece. This is swung over the shoulders, and other pieces
    laid on, to the number of two, or sometimes three, according to the
    carrier’s strength. He then bends strongly forward, and proceeds at a
    half trot. He goes on the length of a <em>pause</em>, say half a mile,
    where the burden is put down, the strap untied, and the carrier, after
    a few moments rest, briskly returns, for another load. This process is
    continued till all the goods, are brought up to the first <em>pause</em>.
    The canoe and its apparatus, are then brought up, when the men commence
    making the second <em>pause</em>, and this order is repeated at every
    <em>pause</em>. This is a severe labor, and requires able bodied men,
    well practiced. And where the ground is low or swampy and often
    travelled, it soon becomes a perfect bed of mire.</p>

  <p>The present portage, however, was found to lie across a pine plain,
    offering a clean beach of sand to debark on, and a dry smooth path to
    travel. A portage of 1,078 yards, brought us to the banks of a small
    lake, after crossing which we came to the entrance of a small clear
    brook, having not over two or three inches depth of water, spread over
    a bed of yellow sand. It seemed impossible to ascend it, especially
    with the larger canoe, but by the men’s first carrying the lading,
    by widening the channel in cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>ting down the banks with paddles, and
    then by walking in the stream and lifting the canoe by its gunnels,
    they succeeded in getting it up to another lake, called Little Long
    Lake. We were twenty-four minutes in crossing this latter lake, and
    found its inlet to be connected with four other small lakes of a pondy
    character, redolent with nymphæ odorata, through which we successively
    passed, and debarked at the head of the last lake on a shaking bog,
    being the commencement of portage <i>Ple</i>. This portage is quite
    short and dry, lies over a hill-prairie, and terminates on the banks
    of a transparent, bowl-shaped lake, with elevated shores, where we
    made our breakfast, at twelve o’clock. This lake, which we may refer
    to as the Lake of the Mountains, notwithstanding the liveliness and
    purity of its waters, has no visible outlet, a characteristic of which
    it partakes in common with a very great number of the small lakes of
    this quarter, which may be supposed to lie in aluminous strata. Next,
    in the order of travelling south of it, is the Mountain Portage,
    appropriately so called. Its extent is nine hundred and ten yards.
    The elevation is considerable, but no rock strata appear in situ. The
    soil is diluvial, with boulders. The growth, yellow pine, with small
    maples and underbrush. It terminates on the Lake of the Island. There
    is then a portage of two pauses, or 1,960 yards into another lake,
    quite pond-like, where it is first entered, but assuming a clear and
    bright surface after turning a prominent point. There is then a further
    portage of one pause, a part of it, through a morass, but terminating
    on highlands, surrounding the head and shores of a handsome and
    comparatively extensive sheet of water called Kagi Nogumaug, or The
    Long Water, where we encamped for the night. This day’s journey was
    a hard and fatiguing one, to the men. The Gueule Plat, who with one
    of the minor chiefs from Leech Lake, overtook us on the banks of the
    Lake of the Island, expressed his surprise that, with all our baggage
    and heavy canoes, we had pushed on so far. It was, however, a definite
    point in the journey. We were now on the source of the Kagági, or
    De<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> Corbeau river. To have stopped short of it, would have seriously
    broken in on the labors of the following day; and the knowledge
    that the series of portages terminated there, and the downward
    passage commenced, buoyed up the men to make exertions. The day was
    particularly severe upon the soldiers, who were less accustomed to this
    species of fatigue. Never were the shadows of night more grateful to
    men, who had employed the morning, and the noon, and the evening of the
    day, in hard labor. We had now reached the <em>fourth</em> source of the
    primary rivers of the Mississippi, and all heading on the elevation of
    the Hauteur des Terres, within a circle of perhaps seventy miles. These
    sources are Itasca Lake, its primary, Ossowa, east fork, Shiba Lake and
    river, source of Leech Lake, and the present source, The Long Water,
    being the source of the De Corbeau, or Crow-wing river.</p>

  <p>Gueule Plat, with his Indian secretary, so to call him, or Mishinowa,
    and their families, came and encamped with us. The chief said that he
    had many things to speak of, for which he had found no time during my
    visit. I invited him to sup with the party. Conversation on various
    topics ensued, and the hour of midnight imperceptibly arrived, before
    he thought of retiring to his own lodge. I was rather confirmed in the
    favorable opinions I have before expressed of him, and particularly
    in the ordinary, sober routine of his reflections, and the habitual,
    easy manner, which he evinced of arriving at correct conclusions. I
    could not say as much for his companion and pipe-lighter, Maji Gabowi,
    a very tall, gaunt, and savage looking warrior, who appeared to be
    made up, body and mind, of sensualities. And although he appeared to
    be quiet and passive, and uttered not a single expression that implied
    passion or vindiction, I could not divest my mind of the recollection
    that I was in company with the murderer of Gov. Semple. Whoever has
    given much attention to north-western affairs, will recollect that
    this event occurred in the fierce strife carried on between the North
    West and Hudson’s Bay Company. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> that, in the desperate struggles
    which these corporations made for the possession of the fur trade, the
    Indians often became the dupes of whichever party appeared, at the
    moment, to possess the power of influencing them. The event referred
    to, took place near the close of a long struggle in which the spirit of
    opposition had reached its acme, in which company was furiously arrayed
    against company, charter against charter, and agent against agent. A
    period, at which, like the increasing energies of two powerful bodies
    moving towards each other, they were destined to come into violent
    contact, and the destruction of one, or both, seemed inevitable. The
    dispute respecting territory which imbittered the strife, appeared to
    be carried on, not so much from political ambition or the intrinsic
    value of the soil, as to decide which party should have the exclusive
    right of gleaning from the lodges of the unfortunate natives, the only
    commodity worth disputing for—their furs and peltries. A question, in
    which the Indians, in reality, had no other interest, but that which a
    serf may be supposed to feel on an exchange of masters, in which he has
    neither the right to choose nor the power to reject. Whichever party
    prevailed, they were sure to loose or gain nothing, if they kept aloof
    from the contest, or if they had any hopes from its effects upon their
    condition, they arose more from a prolongation, than a termination of
    the rivalry, as they were sure to fare better, both “in script and
    store,” so long as they possessed the option of rival markets.</p>

  <p>Semple had accepted a governorship, which the late John Johnston, Esq.
    had the forecast to refuse. He appeared to be a man zealously devoted
    to the objects of the company (the Hudson’s Bay) whose interests were
    committed to him. But he does not appear clearly to have perceived
    the great difference which circumstances had interposed between a
    magistracy in an English or Scottish county, and the naked solitudes
    of Red River. He sallied forth himself, with a considerable retinue,
    to read the riot act, to a disorderly and threatening assembly of all
    kinds of a northwest population, on the plains. The agents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> and factors
    of the North West Fur Company, were accused of being at the bottom
    of this uproar, and it is certain that some of their servants were
    engaged, either as actors or abettors. It is among the facts recorded
    in a court of justice, that when certain of the clerks or partners of
    the North West Company heard of the tragic result of this sally, they
    shouted for joy.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

  <p>While the act was in the process of being read, one of the rioters
    fired his piece. This was taken as a signal. A promiscuous and
    scattering firing commenced. Semple was one of the first who received a
    wound. He was shot in the thigh, and fell from his horse. He was unable
    to sit up. At this moment a rush was made by the Indians in the North
    West interest, and a total and most disastrous route of the Hudson’s
    Bay party ensued. Panic, in its wildest forms, seized upon Semple’s
    men. He was himself one of the first victims despatched. Maji Gabowi,
    (one of our guests this evening) coming up, struck his tomahawk in his
    head. He was then scalped.</p>

  <p>We embarked at sunrise, on the 19th, bidding adieu to the Leech Lake
    chief and his companion, who returned from this point, after having
    requested, and received a lancet, with directions from Dr. Houghton,
    for vaccinating such of his people as had not been present on the 17th.
    We were forty minutes in passing the Kagi Nogumaug, which is a handsome
    sheet of pure water presenting a succession of sylvan scenery. Its
    outlet is a narrow brook overhung with alders. It may average a width
    of six feet, but the bends are so extremely abrupt, and the channel so
    narrowed with brushwood, that it became necessary to dig down the acute
    points, and to use the axe in cutting away branches, to veer about a
    canoe thirty-two feet in length. We were just half an hour in clearing
    this passage, when the stream opened into another lake, denominated on
    our travelling map, Little Vermillion Lake. The growth on the banks
    of this lake <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>is birch and aspen, with pines in the distance. We were
    twenty minutes in passing it. The outlet is full doubled in width, and
    free from the embarrassments encountered above. Tamarack is a frequent
    tree on the shores, and the pond lily, flag and Indian reed, appear in
    the stream. This outlet is followed about eight miles, where it expands
    into a small lake, called Birch Lake, which we were only thirteen
    minutes in passing. Its outlet exhibits a pebbly bottom, interspersed
    with boulders, which produce so much inequality in the depth, that the
    men were obliged often to wade. Not more than seven or eight minutes
    were thus occupied, in the course of which we passed through a broken
    fish-dam, when we entered another expanse called <i lang="fr">Lac Ple</i>.</p>

  <p>Lac Ple is about three and a half, or four miles long. Vegetation here
    appears to show a more southerly character. Part of its shores are
    prairie, interspersed with small pines. It is particularly deserving
    of notice, as being the point, from which a series of portages is made
    to Ottertail Lake. A map of these furnished by the traders, who often
    use this route, exhibits the following features. First, a portage of
    four pauses, to Island Lake, then a portage of one pause, into a small
    lake, which has an outlet, through another small lake into Lake Lagard,
    having a transverse position. Thence half a pause, into a small lake, a
    pause and a half into another small lake, and thence four pauses into
    Migiskun Aiaub, or Fish-line Lake. Thence one pause into Pine Lake, and
    five into a small river which falls into Scalp Lake. The latter has
    an outlet which expands into three lakes, at nearly equal distances
    apart, and is finally received by Lac Terrehaut, on the Height of Land.
    The outlet of the latter is twice expanded into the form of a Lake,
    the last of which is, from its peculiarities called the Two Lakes,
    and is finally discharged west of the Height of Land, into Ottertail
    Lake. I had designed to come down this route, or down Leaf river, had
    circumstances favored my going into Red river, from the sources of the
    Mississippi. But these sources were found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> so much further south, than
    it had been supposed, and so considerably removed from any practicable
    route into Red river that I found it would be a consumption of time
    altogether disproportionate to the anticipated results; and it was,
    therefore, given up.</p>

  <p>On going out of Lac Ple, the channel exhibits numerous fresh water
    shells driven up against the shore, or lodged against inequalities
    in the bottom.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> And these productions are afterwards seen in all
    the subsequent outlets which connect the numerous lakes of this
    river. But little variety was, however, noticed among the species,
    although greater attention than we could bestow, might elicit new
    characteristics. Generally, they were small, or middle sized, often
    decorticated and broken. Soon after entering this channel, one of my
    men fired at, and brought down, a fork-tailed hawk, a species which
    had before been noticed on the wing, but we had now an opportunity of
    closer scrutiny. We did not observe any characteristics in which it
    differed from the described species. And if we except the numerous
    species of duck, the colomba migratoris, catbird, and some other land
    species almost equally common, this constitutes the substance of our
    observations, on the birds of this river. We saw the deer, of which
    there are apparently two species. And we had frequent occasion to
    observe the antlers and bones of these animals around deserted camps,
    evincing their abundance in this part of the country.</p>

  <p>We had been three fourths of an hour in descending this outlet,
    when we entered a lake called Boutwell, with banks of rather sombre
    vegetation, which we were nineteen minutes in passing. Its outlet, of
    a spreading, sandy, shelly character, is about a mile and a half in
    extent, at which distance it expands into Lac Vieux Desert, or the Lake
    of the Old Wintering Ground, where we halted long enough to prepare
    breakfast. This lake we were twenty-six minutes in passing through. Its
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>outlet is about two miles long, where it again expands into a lake of
    about two and a quarter miles extent, which may, from its position, be
    denominated Summit Lake. The course, which, from the Kagi Nogumaug,
    is thus far generally south-west, here suddenly veers to the east and
    northeast, and after a striking circuit, comes round to the south-east,
    and eventually again to the south-west, before its junction with Shell
    River. And the stream which thus far seems to have its course on a
    level or summit, is here deflected into a valley, and is beset with
    rapids, and by the flood wood lodged upon its banks, and their partial
    denudation, puts on the appearance of a stream which must sometimes
    assume the fury of a torrent. It probably, at such times, is a turbid
    stream, but was now clear with a gravelly bottom. We were hurried along
    through this channel for the space of two hours and fifteen minutes,
    when it expanded into Long-rice Lake. We were thirty-five minutes in
    passing this lake. Shortly below it, the channel expands again into a
    lake, which from Lieut. Allen’s exploring it, we called Allen’s Lake.
    It is probably the largest of the series below the Kagi Nogumaug. It
    receives a tributary from the northwest, which was visited by Lieut.
    Allen.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere had for some time admonished us of a storm, and it
    broke upon us, on entering this lake. Dark clouds rolled over each
    other, until the light of day was sensibly and suddenly obscured. We
    have seldom known an equal quantity of the electric fluid discharged
    in so short a space of time, or with the incessant repetition of an
    electric light, so subtle and painful to be endured. The rain fell in
    a heavy and continued torrent, and it began with gusts of wind which
    threw the canoe-men into alarm. They veered the canoe for the nearest
    shore, but before reaching it, the tempest settled, and the rain fell
    less violently. We therefore, continued our way without landing, and
    passed out of the lake. A short channel, on the banks of which the
    elm and oak appeared conspicuously, terminated in a moderate sized
    lake of handsomely elevated hard wood and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> pine shores, for which, as
    our maps afforded neither Indian nor French name, we made use of the
    circumstance of Mr. Johnston’s landing to fire at a deer, to name it
    after him. On going out of this lake, we had our attention excited
    by an unextinguished fire, on the banks of the outlet. But no person
    appeared, nor was there any canoe ashore, nor lodge-poles, which there
    would have been, in the case of a travelling Chippewa family. These
    evidences were deemed conclusive by the canoe-men, of the presence of
    Sioux, who, it is supposed, perceiving the character of the party,
    had concealed themselves. And the circumstance was suited to alarm
    a class of men, who, being of the Gallic-Chippewa race, retain very
    strong attachments to the Chippewas, and have imbibed with very little
    abatement, all the prejudices which this people feel for a powerful
    hereditary enemy.</p>

  <p>An hour’s voyage from this spot brought us to the entrance and merely
    to the entrance of the eleventh, and last lake of the series called
    Kaichibo Sagitowa, or the Lake which the River passes through one End
    of, or Lake Leelina. Not many miles below this point, the river forms
    its first forks, by the junction of Shell river, a considerable stream
    of nearly equal size with itself. Below this point, there is always
    water enough, although the channel exhibits numerous rapids, and is
    often spread over a wide bed, giving rise to shallows. We descended
    about fourteen miles below the junction, and encamped. It was after
    eight o’clock when we put ashore. The rain had fallen, with steadiness
    for some hours previous. And the flashes of lightning, which lit up the
    sombre channel of the stream, excited a feeling of no very pleasant
    kind. We landed wet, cold and cheerless. The rain continued to fall.
    But the cheerfulness and activity of our canoe-men did not desert them.
    They searched among the prostrate vegetation, to discover dry fibres,
    or the unwetted parts that could be pulled from the nether rind of
    fallen trees. They ignited the mass with spunk, and soon sent up the
    gladdening flames of an ample camp fire. To pitch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> the tent, arrange
    its interior furniture, and place the heavy baggage under oil-cloths,
    secure from rain, or night dews, is the work of a few moments with
    these people—and he who would travel fast over an intricate interior
    route and be well served on the way, should not fail to prepare himself
    with a canoe <i lang="fr">allége</i> and a crew of <i lang="fr">voyagèurs</i>. They will
    not only go, when they are bid to go, but they will go unmurmuringly.
    And after submitting to severe labor, both of the night and day, on
    land and water, they are not only ready for further efforts, but will
    make them under the enlivening influence of a song.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> ensuing portion of our voyage down this stream, occupied a day and
    a half, during which we probably descended a hundred and twenty miles.
    Its general course, from the forks, is south-east. It is swelled by
    two principal tributaries from the west, called Leaf and Long Prairie
    rivers, each of which brings in an ample volume, and both bear the
    impress of draining an extensive area. On the other bank, it is joined
    by the Kioshk, or Gull River, a stream of inferior size. Lesser streams
    or creeks, were noticed at several points, on either shore, by which
    the mass of water is considerably augmented. Altogether it is a stream
    of noble size, and is driven on through a diluvial formation, with a
    velocity indicating no small ratio of descent. There is no part of it,
    which can be called still water; much of it is rapid. For about seventy
    miles below the junction of Shell River, there is a regular series of
    distinct rapids, in each of which, the descent is several feet, and
    it requires dexterity to avoid running against the boulders, or “lost
    rocks,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> which shew themselves above the water. Below the junction
    of Leaf River, this characteristic becomes less noticeable, and it
    disappears entirely, below the entrance of the Long Prairie branch.
    Its banks are elevated, presenting to the eye, a succession of pine
    forests, on the one hand, and an alluvial bend, bearing elms and soft
    maple, on the other. There is a small willow island about eighteen
    miles below the junction of Shell river, and several small elm islands
    in its central parts; but nothing at all comparable, in size, soil and
    timber, with the large and noted island, called <i lang="fr">Isle De Corbeau</i>,
    which marks its junction with the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>Long Prairie River is the avenue through which the Chippewas ascend,
    in their war excursions against the Sessitons and Yanktons. And many
    tales are related of mishaps and adventures on this stream, and
    the plains contiguous to it. Some of these it may be supposed, are
    <em>tales</em> merely. Others are the events of Indian history. But
    truth and fiction appear to be so blended in the accounts, that the
    separation of the one, from the other, must be often difficult, if not
    impossible. The recent war party, of which we saw one of the trophies,
    while encamped on the island of Colcaspi, went up this river in canoes.
    They encountered the Sioux, as they affirm, coming out against them.
    A fight ensued in the prairies, and was continued with changes of
    position throughout the day. Three Sioux and one Chippewa fell. The
    Sioux withdrew to a more remote position near their village. And the
    Chippewas returned to exult over the scalps of their enemy, and to
    meditate another blow. We saw several traces of this war party in our
    descent of the De Corbeau, in their places of hasty encampment, and
    also in remains of very small fires, tracks in landing on an open sand
    bank, and abandoned canoes, stranded and partly sunk, on the shores.</p>

  <p>This war, between the Chippewas and Sioux, appears to be of ancient
    origin. It is at least coeval with the discovery of the country.
    Although the Chippewas are confessedly conquerors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> of the country
    they possess on this border, the conquests are of remote date. For
    the French, in exploring northward, found them already seated here.
    The part the Leech Lake Indians have played in this war, has rendered
    them conspicuous in their nation, and as before indicated, led to
    the appellation of Mukkundwais, or Pillagers, by which they are
    distinctively known. The circumstances which imposed upon them this
    name, are these.</p>

  <p>Tradition asserts that in the interval which happened between the first
    attack on the French power in Canada, and the final acknowledgment
    of English supremacy, great irregularities existed in the fur trade
    in this quarter. The French were loved by the Indians, and naturally
    retained their influence to the last. And when the English entered
    the field of the trade, they were essentially dependent upon French
    clerks, and wholly so, on French or Canadian boatmen. During this era,
    a Mr. Berti entered the country, with a large assortment of goods. He
    took his station at the mouth of the De Corbeau, where he carried on a
    lucrative trade with the Chippewas. He had, however, more goods than
    these had furs to purchase, and among them, guns and ammunition, which
    he very well knew would find a ready sale among the Sioux. But, the
    Leech Lake Indians, forbid his going into the Sioux country, alleging
    that the Sioux were their enemies, and that the putting of guns and
    powder in their hands, would be to join their cause. Mr. Berti did
    not probably consider these declarations as absolutely final, for he
    proceeded towards the mouth of the Long Prairie River, in order to go
    to the Sioux. The result, however, was most disastrous to him. This
    band arrested his progress, and with arms in their hands, robbed him
    of all his goods without discrimination, but spared his own life and
    the lives of his men, who were suffered to go back, with their private
    effects. Mr. Berti was probably overwhelmed by this misfortune, for
    he never returned from the country, but soon after this event, died a
    natural death, and was buried in the region about Sandy Lake.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

  <p>The forest of this fork of the Mississippi, abounds in almost every
    variety of the pine family. We observed the sugar maple less frequently
    on our whole route, than would be inferred from the knowledge,
    that this tree is spread over the sources of the Mississippi, and
    flourishes, even in its most northern latitudes; and that the sugar
    made from it, is relied on by the Indians, as one of the regular of the
    minor means of their subsistence. This may be accounted for, perhaps
    satisfactorily, from knowing that river alluvions, and low grounds
    generally, are unfavorable to its growth. Its true position is the
    uplands, to which the Indians are known to resort, in the season of
    sugar making. Other species of the maple, frequently exhibited their
    soft foliage, over the stream, together with the elm, and the ash, and
    some varieties of the oak. Pine is, however, by far the most abundant
    and valuable timber tree, disclosed along the immediate banks of this
    river, and it affords a repository of this species, which will be
    much resorted to, when the agricultural plains above the falls of St.
    Anthony, shall teem with their destined population.</p>

  <p>The mere exhibition of woods and waters, however inspiring in their
    effects, is not sufficient to keep the attention from flagging, if
    there be no striking succession of variety in their character. It
    seems not less a physical, than a moral truth, that “uniformity will
    tire, though it be uniformity of excellence.” The eye is perpetually
    searching for something new, and however it may have been with other
    explorers, I think we may venture to say, that with us, novelty has
    been a far more constant or immediate passion, than utility. The
    “lightning splintered” pine, which raises its dead arms, amid the
    living foliage, is suited to call forth a remark. The waterfowl with a
    tuft, or the shell with a deep cicatrice or a pearly interior, gives
    occasion for interrupting the silence, that plainer species would have
    left unbroken. And it is this search for something distinctive or
    peculiar, that gives an edge to the zeal of discovery.</p>

  <p>On the third day of our voyage down this river, towards noon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> the
    monotony of its incidents, was relieved by descrying an Indian canoe,
    ascending the channel before us. A simultaneous yell of recognition,
    both from it, and from our men, shewed the accuracy, with which each
    could identify, on a first glance, and at a distance, the approach of
    friends, for it proved to be a Chippewa with his family. Our flag-staff
    was instantly placed in its socket, in the stern of the canoe, and the
    distance between us and them, made to appear less, under the influence
    of <i lang="fr">un chanson du voyageur</i>. The Indian, who, on reaching him,
    seemed pleased, informed us that we were at no great distance from
    the mouth of the river, where the Sandy Lake and Mille Lac bands were
    assembled, awaiting our arrival. And that the count, by which they
    were assured of the day appointed for meeting them, would be finished
    with the setting of this day’s sun. We had pushed forward to attain
    the object, and were highly gratified, that it had pleased a favoring
    Providence, to enable us to keep our word, with them. Every face in
    this canoe, appeared to wear a smile, and the <i>maja! maja!</i> which
    the owner of it uttered on parting, conveyed with a truth, which could
    hardly be mistaken, the equivalent English sentiment of “God speed you!”</p>

  <p>The remainder of the distance was easily despatched. We reached the
    parting of the channels, which encloses the large island of <i lang="fr">De
    Corbeau</i>, about twelve o’clock. On issuing out of the upper channel,
    and entering the broad current of the majestic Mississippi, we beheld
    the opposite shore lined with Indian lodges, with the American flag
    conspicuously displayed. The Indians commenced firing a salute the
    instant we hove in sight, and continued it, with yells of joy, to the
    moment of our landing. A throng then crowded the banks, among whom I
    recognized the two principal chiefs, who, with their retinue, evinced,
    both by word and act, the gratification they felt; not only at the
    meeting, but the punctuality with which it had been observed. We were
    gratified on being told, within a few hours of our arrival, that our
    canoe, with the goods and supplies from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> Sandy Lake, was in sight; and
    soon found the event verified, in the safe arrival of the men, and the
    landing of the packages.</p>

  <p>Being thus enabled to proceed with the council, it was determined
    immediately to assemble the Indians, and state to them, in a more full
    and formal manner than had been done at Sandy Lake, the objects of the
    visit. On closing the address, the presents and provisions designed
    for these bands, were issued to them. Kwiwizainsish, or the Grosse
    Gueule, Soangikumig, or the Strong Ground, White Fisher, and the son of
    Pugusainjigun, were the principal speakers in reply. The peculiarities
    in the speech of each, may be adverted to.</p>

  <p>The Grosse Gueule, observed, that, as the line was a question between
    the Chippewas and Sioux, a firm peace could never exist, until the line
    was surveyed and marked, so that each party could see where it ran.
    This was wanted in the section of country, immediately west of them.
    The Sioux, were in the habit of trespassing on it. And when their own
    hunters went out, in the pursuit of game, they did not like to stop
    short of the game, and they saw no marked line to stop them. He said
    that it had been promised at the treaty at Prairie du Chien, that
    the line should be run, and he wished me to convey his words on the
    subject, to the President. He was in favor of peace now as he had been,
    when he had met the Government in council at Tipisagi, and at Fond du
    Lac.</p>

  <p>Soangikumig,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> said, through his brother, that he had taken a part in
    defending the lines. He hoped that they might be made plain, so that
    each party could see them. As it was, a perpetual pretence was given,
    for crossing the path, (or lines.) It must be expected that the peace
    would often be broken, when it could be, so easily.</p>

  <p>Wabojeeg, or the White Fisher, stated that he had given his influence
    to peace counsels. He had been present at the treaty <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>of Fond du Lac.
    The Sandy Lake Indians had been lately reproached, as it were, for
    their pacific character, by hearing the Leech Lake war party passing
    so near to them. (This party went up Long Prairie River.) He hoped the
    same advice given to Chippewas, would be given to Sioux. If the Sioux
    would not <em>come</em> over the lines, they, (the Chippewas,) would not
    <em>go</em> over them. He thought the lines might have been differently
    run. Their hunters always came out of Sauc river, which had been given
    up to the Sioux. But as they had been agreed to, by their old Chiefs,
    who were now gone, (he referred particularly to the late Katawabida,
    and Babisikundadi,) it would be best to let them remain.</p>

  <p>Nittum Egabowa, or the Front Standing Man, confined his speech to
    personal topics. He said the medal he wore, and by virtue of which, he
    claimed the Chieftainship, had been presented to his deceased father,
    at the treaty of Prairie du Chien. He presented a pipe.</p>

  <p>Ascertaining the trading house of a Mr. Baker to be near our
    encampment, after closing the council, we embarked and descended
    the Mississippi about eighteen miles to <i lang="fr">Prairie Piercée</i>.
    Intelligence had reached this place a few days before, by way of St.
    Peter’s, of open hostilities among the Saucs and Foxes, and we here saw
    a western paper, giving an account of an action with the militia on
    River Rock, the murder of St. Vrain, the agent for these tribes, and
    other particulars indicating the frontier to be irretrievably plunged
    into an Indian war.</p>

  <p>At this point, (i.&nbsp;e. the mouth of the De Corbeau) a remote point in
    our north-western geography, the route, of which the preceeding sketches
    give an outline, intersects that of the expedition to the sources of
    the Mississippi, under the direction of the present Secretary of War,
    Gov. Cass, in 1820. And in order that no part of the present volume
    may be considered as going over grounds pre-occupied by the details
    embraced in our “Narrative Journal of Travels,” the account of the
    present expedition is here terminated.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

  <p>In submitting it to the public, it is conceived suitable to remark,
    that it has been accomplished, from beginning to end, without the use
    of so much as a drop of ardent spirits, of any kind, either by the
    men upon whom the fatigues of the labor fell, or by the gentlemen who
    composed the exploring party. This fact itself might be deemed an empty
    annunciation, were it not in my power to add the gratifying result,
    that no diminution of the strength or capacity of the men to perform
    their labor has been, at any time experienced; nor has any sickness
    at all supervened. At no stage of the journey, have the men, who were
    originally engaged with a distinct understanding on this point, asked
    for or required any liquor, or evinced any murmuring that it had been
    excluded from the supplies. But even, where the labor was most severe,
    on portages, in morasses, or in crossing highlands, they have evinced
    a readiness, a cheerfulness, and an ability for sustaining continued
    fatigue, which has often been the subject of remark and commendation by
    the party. Often when the day’s work was done, when they had labored
    hard at the paddle or carrying-strap, and sometimes when even a portion
    of the night had been added to it, they showed a joyful spirit in
    the encampment. And they frequently went to gather wood, after such
    fatigues, for supplying the night fires, with the boatman’s song.</p>

  <p>Another fact, may, with equal pleasure, be recorded, and it seems
    intimately connected, in its influence with the preceeding. No Sabbath
    day was employed in travelling. It was laid down as a principle, to
    rest on that day, and wherever it overtook us, whether on the land,
    or on the water, the men knew that their labor would cease, and
    that the day would be given them for rest. Such of them as felt the
    inclination, had the further privilege of hearing a portion of the
    scriptures read, or expounded, or uniting in other devotional rites.
    There were but a few hours of a single morning and a few hours of a
    single evening, of separate Sabbaths, at distant points, which were
    necessarily employed in reaching particular places. And the use of
    these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> appeared to be unavoidable under the particular circumstances
    of our local position. It may, perhaps, be thought, that the giving up
    of one seventh part of the whole time, employed on a public expedition
    in a very remote region, and with many men to subsist, must have, in
    this ratio, increased the time devoted to the route. But the result
    was far otherwise. The time devoted to recruit the men, not only gave
    the surgeon of the party an opportunity to heal up the bruises and
    chafings they complained of, but it replenished them with strength;
    they commenced the week’s labor with renewed zest, and this zest was,
    in a measure, kept up by the reflection, that the ensuing Sabbath
    would be a day of rest. It was found by computing the whole route,
    and comparing the time employed, with that which had been devoted on
    similar routes, in this part of the world, that an equal space had been
    gone over, in less time, than it had ever been known to be performed,
    by loaded canoes, or (as the fact is) by light canoes, before. And the
    whole expedition, its incidents and results, have been of a character
    furnishing strong reasons for uniting in ascriptions of praise to
    that Eternal Power, who hath been our shield from “the pestilence
    that walketh in darkness, and from the destruction that wasteth at
    noon-day.”</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal points at which the waters of the Mississippi river
      communicate, by interlocking rivers and portages, with the lakes,
      are the following, proceeding from south to north, namely,</p>

    <p>1. By the Illinois and Chicago Creek, (with Lake Michigan.)</p>

    <p>2. By the Wisconsin and Fox Rivers, (with Green Bay.)</p>

    <p>3. By the Chippewa and Mushkee (or Mauvais) Rivers, (with Lake
      Superior.)</p>

    <p>4. By the St. Croix and Burntwood (or Brulé) Rivers, (do.)</p>

    <p>5. By the Savanne and St. Louis Rivers, (do.)</p>

    <p>The routes by the Illinois, and by the Wisconsin, were first
      laid open by French enterprise, and have been used for canoes
      and flat-bottomed boats in their natural state, and without any
      practical improvement which as yet, facilitates the communication,
      about a hundred and sixty years. They are so familiar in our
      geography, have been so much explored, and are so well appreciated,
      as prominent points for effecting canal and railroad routes, that
      it is only to be desired that early and efficient measures should
      be taken for opening them.</p>

    <p>The route of the Chippewa (or Sauteaux) River, is imperfectly
      known, and has never been fully and accurately delineated and
      described. It is a long river, having a number of fingered
      branches, which spread over a large area of interior midland
      country. They are connected, at distant points, with the principal
      sources of the St. Croix and the Wisconsin of the Mississippi; with
      the Mushkee, the Montreal, and the Ontonagon of Lake Superior; and
      with the Monomonee, and the North Branch of Fox River of Green Bay.
      The portages are of no great length, but being at considerable
      altitudes above both the Mississippi and the lakes, and remote from
      either, they are impracticable for boats.</p>

    <p>In 1766 or ’67, J. Carver ascended the Chippewa River to the Ottawa
      Fork. He ascended it no higher, and his delineations of it, on
      the map which accompanied his original work, published in London,
      cannot now be referred to. Dr. Douglass Houghton, and Lieut.
      Robert E. Clary, U. S. A. delineated this stream, in 1831, to the
      junction of the Red Cedar Fork, and up that fork to its source in
      Lac Chetac; they continued the delineation of the route thence,
      by portages, into the Ottawa Fork of the Chippewa, up that river
      to Lac Courtorielle, or Ottawa Lake, and thence by a series of
      short portages, to the Namakagon Branch of the St. Croix, and up
      that branch, to the commencement of the series of porta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>ges, which
      connect it with the Mushkee or Mauvais River of Lake Superior.
      The latter river was delineated in its entire length. These
      topographical observations, were commenced at the most easterly
      point of the route. They remain in manuscript. Duplicates of them
      have been communicated to the government.</p>

    <p>The route of the St. Croix and Brulé, describes a shorter line
      between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, than the preceeding; and
      it is one, that has been, and continues to be, much used by the
      traders and by the resident Indian population. We cannot refer,
      however, to any accurate delineation of it, or to any printed
      account of the country. Carver, in his way to the Kiministiquoia,
      or Grand Portage, visited the upper forks of the St. Croix, and
      descended the Burntwood, or Brulé, to which he gave the name of
      Goddard’s River.</p>

    <p>The channel of communication which exists through the Savanne and
      St. Louis Rivers, was delineated by Capt. D. B. Douglass, as a
      member of the expedition sent into that quarter by the government
      in 1820. But the result of his observations, has not been given to
      the public. The route has been again delineated with care, in its
      whole extent, from Fond du Lac to Sandy Lake, during the present
      year, by Lieut. James Allen, of the U. S. Army, and will with his
      other delineations, be transmitted for the use of the Topographical
      Bureau at Washington.</p>

    <p>Lieut. Allen’s delineations, also, embrace the St. Croix and
      Burntwood Rivers, in their whole length; and exhibit the first
      actual survey of these streams, which the topographical history of
      the region, presents.</p>

    <p>Portions of these surveys have been prepared by the officer making
      them, to illustrate the present volume, together with the octavo
      sketches, which accompany the Narrative to Itasca, Cass and Leech
      Lakes.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">That</span> portion of the Upper Mississippi, lying between the junction
    of the De Corbeau and St. Anthony’s Falls, presents to the eye a
    succession of prairie and forest land, which has the characteristics
    of a valuable agricultural country. It is difficult in passing it, to
    resist the idea, that it will, at some future day, sustain a dense
    population. It is so elevated above the bed of the Mississippi, as to
    be out of the reach of its periodical floods. The banks are rendered
    permanent by resting upon a basis of fixed rocks, (the primitive,)
    which appear in the channel of the river. The soil is arable upland,
    apparently light, but of that ferruginous character, which has turned
    out so durable and fertile in Michigan. Like the prairies of the
    latter, the plough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> might be set in motion, without the labor of
    clearing and grubbing, and a farm reclaimed with no additional labor
    but that of fencing. Wood is often wanting on the immediate margin
    of the river. It is not always so; and when thus wanting, forests
    may be observed on the hilly grounds, at a distance. Wild hay might
    be cut in any quantity. It is among the facts which mark the natural
    history of the region, that the buffalo, or more strictly speaking,
    the bison, which fed on these plains, in 1820, has not appeared here
    since. The Virginia deer and the elk are, however, still abundant. The
    absence of lime stone will probably prove the most formidable bar to
    its settlement. Nothing of this kind is found except in its southern
    borders. There appears to be no formations of rock elevated above the
    soil, but the limited district called the <i lang="fr">Pètites Roches</i>. And
    the strata here are exclusively referable to the primitive series.</p>

  <p>The entrances of a small river called Nokassippi, about two hundred
    miles above St. Anthony’s Falls, may be considered as the termination
    of this tract. Above this point, although the Mississippi has some rich
    alluvions, as at the mouth of Sandy Lake River, its vegetation assumes
    generally an alpine character, and a large portion of the wide area of
    its valley, is traversed by pine ridges, with innumerable intervening
    lakes, and extensive tracts of, what the natives denominate, mushkeegs.</p>

  <p>On crossing through the forty-fifth parallel of latitude, the
    Mississippi exhibits a change in the materials of its banks preparatory
    to its entering the limestone region. This is first rendered strikingly
    visible on the rapids immediately above the Falls of St. Anthony. The
    fall itself is an imposing exhibition of geological scenery. The river
    here sinks its level about forty feet, in the distance of, say 1,500
    yards.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Sixteen feet of this has been estimated to consist of a
    perpendicular fall, reaching, with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>irregularities from shore to shore.
    Debris is accumulated in rude masses below, and the rapids are filled
    with fallen or rolled rocks which impart a character of wildness to the
    scene. We made a portage of 1,250 yards, having descended nearer to
    the brink of the fall than is common. Fort Snelling is situated at the
    estimate distance of nine miles below the falls, at the junction with
    the river St. Peter’s. It occupies a commanding position, and exercises
    it may be inferred, an important influence over the contiguous Indian
    tribes, and the Indian trade. We reached this post on the 24th of
    July. Capt. Jouett, the commanding officer, promptly afforded every
    facility for communicating the object of the visit to the Sioux, and
    requesting their concurrence, which was promised by the chiefs, in a
    council convened at the Agency House. We refer to the subjoined report
    for its results. No recent details of the progress of the Sauc war, had
    been received. Having accomplished the object we proceeded down the
    Mississippi, and reached the mouth of the St. Croix, at three o’clock
    in the afternoon of the 26th, five days before the decisive action of
    Gen. Atkinson with the combined Saucs and Foxes below.</p>

  <p>The River St. Croix has one peculiarity, to distinguish it from all
    other American rivers. It has its source and its termination in a
    lake, and each of these bears the same name with itself. The lake at
    its mouth is not less than thirty miles in length, and is, probably,
    no where, much over a mile wide. Its banks are high and afford a
    series of picturesque views, which keep the eye constantly on the
    stretch. The country is an upland prairie, interspersed with groves
    and majestic eminences. The waters are beautifully transparent, and
    the margin exhibits a pebbly beach, so cleanly washed, that it would
    scarcely afford earth enough to stain the fairest shoe. If “Loch
    Katrine” presents a more attractive outline of sylvan coast, it must be
    beautiful indeed. We went up it, turning point after point, with the
    pleasure that novelty imparts, aided by the chanting of our canoe-men.
    We were in hourly expectation of reaching its head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> for our night
    encampment; but we saw the sun set, casting its golden hues and its
    deep shadows over the water, and going down in a gorgeous amphitheatre
    of fleecy clouds. The moon almost imperceptibly shone out, to supply
    its place, creating a scene of moonlight stillness, which was suited to
    fix a living impression of</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“The silence that is in the starry sky,</div>
        <div class="i1">The sleep that is among the lonely hills.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Nothing could present a greater contrast, to the noisy scene of horses
    and horsemen, war and bloodshed, which, we were then unconscious,
    was about being acted, so near to us. We allude to the pursuit and
    destruction of the Black Hawk’s army.</p>

  <p>We encamped at a late hour, near a lofty eminence, which exhibited
    on its summit, a number of small mounds or barrows strongly relieved
    by the moonlight, which shone across the eminence, and left us in
    the shade. We resumed our way again, before the hour of five in the
    morning, (27th) and were still something more than two hours in
    reaching the head of the lake. In going out of this beautiful sheet
    of water, we would revert to some traits in its natural productions
    which serve to distinguish it, as well as its prominent scenery,
    although there are none equally distinctive. The great carboniferous
    limestone formation,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which fills the Mississippi valley, also
    reaches here, although there is now reason to believe that it reaches
    but little farther north. Its vegetation has little that is peculiar.
    The red cedar is found, hanging from some of its craggy shores on the
    lower part. Some fresh water shells, generally thin and small, with
    primary and lateral teeth wanting, characterize the sandy portions of
    its shore. There are some willow islands at the point where the River
    St. Croix enters it. And this point of the ingress of a large stream,
    presents the characteristics of what <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>have been, not inaptly, called
    <em>drowned lands</em>, i.&nbsp;e. land bearing trees permanently standing in
    the water.</p>

  <p>The St. Croix above this point exhibits the appearance of a wide,
    deep, ample river, with prominent banks, and forests of hard wood, and
    pine species. Its islands consist of rich alluvions, heavily timbered
    and subject to inundations. About two o’clock we passed the “Standing
    Cedars,” a point called so, in the treaty of limits between the Sioux
    and Chippewa tribes, and described in the inexact phraseology of the
    Indians, to be “about a day’s paddle, in a canoe, above the lake.”
    Howbeit, we were but a few minutes over nine hours, in performing the
    distance, with a strong crew of engagés, however, in light canoes, and
    with every appliance in pushing forward.</p>

  <p>As evening approached, we encountered a man descending the river,
    having four canoes in company, with several Frenchmen and their Indian
    families. It turned out to be a Mr. B. who had been engaged in trade,
    in the Chippewa country. We examined his papers to determine whether
    he had been legally licensed, and caused a search of his canoes in
    quest of whiskey. None of this article, or strong drink of any kind was
    discovered. Little doubt had been felt, from information, which was
    not, however proved, of his having used this article in the course of
    his trade; whether with or without permission, could not be determined.
    We revoked his license for the unexpired part of the time specified in
    it, and permitted him to proceed out of the country, with the canoes
    and the very trifling property which he possessed, which seemed,
    indeed, to be essential to the mere subsistence of the numerous persons
    with him.</p>

  <p>The narrowing of the valley, and increased rapidity of the current,
    had, for some time, admonished us of our approach to the falls. About
    six o’clock we entered through a defile, formed by perpendicular walls
    of rock on either shore. Its seamed and mossy surface did not permit us
    to determine its character, without getting a fresh fracture. It proved
    to be greenstone. We were in the midst of a formation of this rock, and
    for two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> hours, urged our way up rapids and swift channels, made by the
    broken and angular character of this stratum. We reached the foot of
    the falls, and encamped there at eight o’clock in the evening.</p>

  <p>The word “falls,” as applied here, is but another name for
    impracticable rapids. The river tears its way through a vast bed of
    greenstone, whose black and square masses, stand on either side, and
    in the bed of the stream. Common quartz, imperfectly chrystalized, is
    seen in the mass, and is the sole mineral apparent, although a more
    attentive search may disclose others. A portage of four hundred yards
    is made to avoid the falls. But there is still a series of rapids,
    extending, with short interruptions, several miles above.</p>

  <p>The physical character of this spot is such as to arrest a passing
    attention; but it is inferior to the moral interest arising out of it.
    It is the battle ground of Wahb Ojeeg, a celebrated Chippewa war chief
    of the last century, and testifies to an event in Indian tradition,
    which is not so remote as to be added to the events of the oblivious
    years of their residence upon this continent. We have neither time nor
    space to enter into details of this kind, and can merely advert to the
    incident we have named. Like most of the incidents of Indian warfare
    in the region, it is connected with the restless spirit, erratic
    adventure, and ambitious daring of the tribes who are, this season,
    (1832,) arrayed in hostility to the settlements on the Wisconsin. It
    is one of the links of the curious chain of history, of the Sauc and
    Fox tribes, who have fought their way from the St. Lawrence, thus
    far across the continent, and been successively embroiled, with each
    of the white powers, and, perhaps with some exceptions, with each of
    the Indian tribes of the north. They appear, by their language and
    traditions, to be Algonquins, and may be traced, as a starting point,
    to the north shores of Lake Ontario. They appear to have been driven
    thence for perfidy. They attacked the fort of Detroit, unsuccessfully.
    They lived long at, and gave name to Sagana. They went to the Fox
    River of Green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> Bay which is named after them, and here embroiled
    themselves with the Monomonees, the Chippewas and the French. They were
    finally driven thence by force of arms. They fled to the Wisconsin
    where Carver speaks of their villages in 1766, thence to their recent
    residence on Rock River, and by the last tragic act in their history,
    are confined to a limit commencing west of the Mississippi. We speak
    of the Saucs and Foxes as connected, in the gauntlet-like warfare they
    have maintained, for they appear to have been intimate allies from the
    earliest times. The Indian name of the one tribe signifies, Those who
    went out of the land, (Osaukee,) and the other, Redearths, (Miskwakee,)
    known by the <i lang="fr">nom de guerre</i>, of Foxes.</p>

  <p>While resident at Green Bay, they occupied also Lac du Flambeau, and
    extended themselves to Lake Superior, and south-west of its shores, to
    the Sauc and Little Sauc Rivers, above the Falls of St. Anthony. While
    thus located, they appear to have fallen out with the Chippewas, their
    cousins-german, and leagued with the Sioux, whom they have, of late,
    so strenuously fought. With the aid of the latter, at first covertly
    given, they maintained the possession of the rice lakes and midland
    hunting grounds. But they were finally overthrown in a general defeat,
    at these falls, by the combined Chippewa bands of Lake Superior.
    The latter came down the St. Croix, by its Namakagon branch. They
    were led by Wahb Ojeeg. Their spies reached the falls without having
    encountered an enemy, but they unexpectedly found the Foxes, (whom
    they call Ootaigahmees,) with their allies, encamped at the other end
    of the portage. A partial action ensued. It was rendered general by
    the arrival of the whole Chippewa force. It was a fierce and bloody
    action. The Foxes made a resolute stand. But they were overpowered and
    fled. And they have not since re-appeared in the region. Among the
    slain several Sioux were found, and this is said to be the first actual
    testimony of the Sioux being leagued with them, in the war against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> the
    Chippewas. But this assertion is hardly reconcileable with the date of
    the war in other places.</p>

  <p>Wahb Ojeeg, or the White Fisher, who is noticed as the leader on this
    occasion, is said to have led out seven other expeditions against the
    Foxes and Sioux. He died at Chegoimegon, in Lake Superior, in 1793.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">We</span> pursued our way as early on the morning (28th) as the clearing up
    of the fog would permit. Soon after reaching the head of the series of
    rapids, we observed a couple of buildings of logs, upon the left shore,
    and landed to examine them. They proved to be deserted cabins which had
    been occupied by traders, with their doors open, and containing nothing
    of value. As these had been erected contrary to decisions of the Indian
    office, made under the law of Congress regulating trading posts, and at
    a point where the Sioux and Chippewas are thus improperly brought into
    contact, we directed them to be burned. The remainder of the day was
    diligently employed in the ascent. The following day being the Sabbath,
    was devoted to rest. The water in the river appeared to be very low,
    and was momently falling. We removed our place of encampment in the
    evening, about ten miles. A Chippewa whom we met with his family, in a
    canoe, informed us that Snake River was baishoo, a term denoting near
    at hand.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

  <p>The next morning, (30th,) after about three hours paddling, we reached
    the mouth of the Kinábic, or Snake River. We found Pezhicki, (or the
    Buffalo,) the principal chief of that place, and his band, encamped
    on the small peninsula which is formed by the junction. They fired a
    salute, and crowded down to the shore, to welcome us. This chief was
    one of a delegation who visited Washington, some years ago. He came
    back with a profusion of ornaments, and a sword and tassels. These were
    of no real utility, and have long since disappeared. The visit had
    the effect to shew him the strength and resources of the Americans.
    With little force of character, he has been pacific, so far at least,
    as relates to white men. He was present at the treaties of Prairie du
    Chien, and Fond du Lac. He is not the war chief of the Snake River
    band. We know not, that he encountered in his journey, any teacher or
    preacher to inform him that there was a savior.</p>

  <p>Official business occupied a part of the morning. We found not the
    slightest evidence of any participation, or disposition to participate,
    in the hostile schemes of the Saucs and Foxes. Pezhicki approved of the
    requests made by the Chippewas of the Upper Mississippi, for having
    their lines surveyed, and united strongly in the measure. He said that
    the Sioux had manifested a disposition to claim the country above the
    Standing Cedars, and that they had, and still continued to trespass on
    it. He said, that they had this season, crossed through the Chippewa
    hunting grounds on the St. Croix to go against the band at Rice Lake
    on the Red Cedar Fork of the Chippewa River. He cheerfully promised to
    assist the military canoes, in their ascent and immediately sent three
    young men for that purpose.</p>

  <p>Snake River is an important tributary of the St. Croix. It constitutes
    an established post of trade, for which licences are granted by the
    Indian department. Its Indian population is reported at three hundred
    and one souls. Persons of the mixed cast, thirty-eight. This river
    is connected, by an easy portage, with Rum River, a route much used
    by Indians going to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> Mille Lac and Sandy Lake borders. Masses
    of native copper have been brought out of its bed by the Indians,
    who report the existence of further indications of its presence. The
    North West Company formerly held a post on this river, and it remained
    for several years, a central place of trade for the Indians of the
    lower St. Croix. The influence of this company over the Indians was
    every where visible, and so far as this influence was connected with
    political feelings, it was, as a matter of course, exerted in favor of
    the British government. As not more than twenty years have elapsed,
    since the authority of the American government began at all to be
    exercised in this quarter, and a much shorter period must be assigned
    for any active influence from its posts and agencies, it should not
    excite surprise that the elder Indians should, as they do, feel an
    attachment for that government. Nor is it strange, that ambitious and
    designing men among them, should occasionally form combinations for
    open resistance, of the character of that which has recently been
    witnessed among the Saucs and Foxes. Time, and judicious counsels, will
    afford the surest corrective.</p>

  <p>In looking back to the condition of the trade, as it existed here,
    fifty years ago, some striking changes have supervened. A Mr. Harris,
    who is still living at the age of about eighty-four, informed me, that
    about the close of the American war, when he first came to this river,
    rum was an article in high request among the Indians. When they had
    purchased a keg of it, it was customary to pour it out into a large
    kettle and place it over a fire. A hand of tobacco was then put in.
    After being heated and stirred about for a time, the mixture was drank.</p>

  <p>The distance from Snake River to Yellow River is about thirty-five
    miles. We employed the 30th, from about eleven in the morning till
    eight at night, and the 31st until eight o’clock in the morning, in
    performing this distance. The water was very low, and it frequently
    required the men to get out and wade. The Kettle Rapids, nine miles
    in extent, are, however, the most formidable obstacle. The St. Croix
    receives, in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> distance, the Akeek or Kettle River, from the left,
    and the Aissippi, or Shell River, from the right. The latter takes
    its rise in a lake, which is noted for the number and large size of
    its fresh water shells. Hence its name. We met a number of Indians,
    on this day’s journey who evinced a friendly feeling. We encamped at
    eight o’clock, with a party of Indian boys, who had come down the river
    hunting. They were rejoiced on seeing us approach, and spent much of
    their ammunition in saluting us, which a colder feeling of foresight,
    might have induced them to reserve for the chase. And they offered us
    some of the scanty products of their evening’s labour, thus evincing
    the truth of the remark,</p>

  </div>

  <p>One of the canoe-men lacerated his foot on the angular masses of
    greenstone, which form a shore of angular pebbles, near Snake River.
    And this rock appeared again distinctly, in place, on the Kettle
    rapids. Masses of it, were frequently seen in the bed of the river
    and incumbering its shores, below that point. They were observed to
    decrease in size and frequency above these rapids, from which it may be
    inferred, that the rapids themselves are situated near the limits of
    the formation.</p>

  <p>At Yellow River, we found a considerable assembly of Indians, who, as
    they saw our approach for some distance, ranged themselves along the
    shore, and fired a formal salute. I had visited this place, the same
    month and nearly the same day, in 1831, and then entered the mouth of
    the river to form my encampment. But on attempting again to reach the
    same spot, the water was found so low, that it was impracticable, and
    I came to the landing in front of a naked eminence, which, the Indians
    call Pokonokuning, or Place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> of the Hip Bone,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> a term by which the
    river itself is (by them) designated.</p>

  <p>This river is a post of trade, containing a population estimated at
    three hundred and eighty-two souls. The lands are fertile, and afford
    in connection with Ottawa Lake, and the adjacent country, a good
    location for a mission and school. The river originates near the head
    of Long River of the Red Cedar Fork of the Chippewa, to which there
    is a canoe portage. It expands at unequal distances, beginning at its
    source, into Lac Vaseux, Rice Lake, and Yellow Lake. Wild rice is one
    of its productions, and is among the means of subsistence on which the
    natives rely. Its natural history is further deserving of remark, as
    yielding abundantly, univalve shells of a fine size. The purple winged
    unio is found in abundance; and the natives make use of this species,
    for spoons, by rubbing off the alatæ and rounding the margin—a process
    by which they are rendered of no value as specimens of the species.
    The copper-head snake is said to exist in the waters of this river.
    Its banks afford much of the open grounds which are favorable to the
    thirteen striped, or prairie squirrel, (S. tredecem, of Mitchill.)
    The Indians exhibited to me the skin of this little animal, which is
    peculiarly marked with alternations of stripes and spots.</p>

  <p>We observed among the group of Indians at this place, the widow and
    children of Waimit-Egozhains, a Chippewa, having an admixture of
    white blood, who, with three others, was murdered by the Sioux while
    descending the lower part of the St. Croix, in a canoe, in the fall of
    1830. We directed the interpreter to say to her, that as providence
    had removed her natural protector, and her means of subsistence must
    be small, the elder of her boys, who was present, would be taken and
    sent to school, and also taught the arts of an industrious life, if she
    would direct him to embark in one of our canoes. She ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>peared to be
    pleased but at the same time embarrassed. She consulted with a brother
    who was one of the Indians present, and then replied that the boy was
    not altogether useless in aiding her to get a support, as he could fish
    and kill partridges. She did not feel willing thus suddenly to part with
    him, but observed that she would send him out in the spring.</p>

  <p>We were five hours and a half in going from Yellow River to the Forks
    of the St. Croix. The distance is probably not over thirteen miles.
    These data will show how slowly we proceeded, with every exertion,
    against the obstacles of a very low state of water. And at this spot we
    knew that we were to lose, at least, one half of the entire volume. The
    loss is indeed greater, for the Namakágon, or right hand fork, which we
    were here to leave, is decidedly the largest of the two.</p>

  <p>The Namakágon Branch has its rise in a lake, which the Indians call
    Mattedhair Lake, very near the source of the Mushkee or Mauvais River
    of Lake Superior. Neither of these streams can, however, be ascended
    to their sources. There is a portage across the intervening grounds,
    interspersed with small lakes which is practicable for canoes and
    packages of goods, carried after the northwest manner. The Namakágon
    has another portage, at a lower point to Ottawa Lake, the source of
    one of the navigable branches of the Chippewa River. This river, after
    running about one hundred and seventy miles, joins the northwest branch
    at the Forks of the St. Croix, and from this point, the joint volume,
    increased by a number of tributaries is carried on, to swell the mass
    of the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>We found the chief Kabamappa, with others, encamped at the Forks. They
    evinced the same feeling of welcome, and pleasure we had met from the
    Chippewas on the lower part of the stream. Kabamappa said that nothing
    had been very recently heard from the direction of Lac du Flambeau and
    the borders of the Sauc disturbances. He readily communicated many
    facts respecting the existing difficulties, and the means taken to
    enlist the Indians in a general war. He said, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> confederacy, as
    it is, had been reported to consist of nine tribes, whom he named.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
    With respect to a permanent peace with the Sioux, he cordially
    approved it. He had, he observed, given much of his thoughts and his
    time to that object, and particularly so since our previous visit. It
    was, primarily, through the influence of this chief that a general
    peace-council had been held by the Sioux and Chippewas, during the fall
    of 1831, on Snake River.</p>

  <p>As to the state of the water his expression was, “iscutta! iscutta!”
    indicating an exhausted state. He added, that though we had encountered
    difficulties on the stream below, they would be multiplied on the
    branch we were about to ascend. Even within sight of his lodge, he
    pointed to shallows, where it would be impossible to ascend without
    wading in the stream and carrying all the baggage. The river, he
    said, was uncommonly low for the season, and was daily getting lower.
    Under these circumstances, we had no time to lose. We employed the
    remainder of the day in going about seven miles, and encamped after
    dark at a place called the Women’s Portage. Just before encamping,
    and when we were seeking a spot along the thick brushy shore, to
    debark at, Kabamappa suddenly appeared standing on the bow of his
    canoe, and pointing onwards, guided us to the spot of our encampment.
    Daylight had completely disappeared and it was barely possible, in a
    dark atmosphere, to discern contiguous objects. As the tall and gaunt
    form of the chief glided by, with his spear-pole elevated in the
    direction we were to go, it might have needed but little power of the
    imagination, to transform him into a spirit of supernatural power.
    Owing to the darkness we found it difficult to procure fire-wood for
    the night. It was sought with torches. The chief joined us at our
    evening meal. We were pleased with his urbanity.</p>

  <p>A fog detained us at our encampment until after daylight, (1st Aug.)
    We were enabled to proceed at five o’clock. Our <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>first labor was
    the ascent of a rapid, our <em>second</em>, our <em>third</em>, and our
    <em>fourth</em> labors, were also rapids. In short, rapid succeeded to
    rapid, and with such short intervals, that it would be impracticable
    from any notes preserved of the route, to speak of this part of the
    stream, in any other light than as a continued series of rapids. We
    often thought ourselves above them but we as often found, in the
    language of our canoe-men, “<i lang="fr">encore un</i>.” About two o’clock in the
    afternoon we came to still waters with sedgy shores, and at seven in
    the evening reached and landed at Kabamappa’s village. The distance may
    be twenty-five miles above the Women’s Portage. We encamped here.</p>

  <p>The village is situated on a part of the river called Namai Kowagon,
    or Sturgeon Dam. It occupies an eligible prairie bank, and exhibits in
    the style of the lodges and gardens, considerable industry and regard
    to comfort. It would seem to be no difficult effort to induce Indians,
    who had proceeded thus far in fixed industry, to labor on their lands
    more extensively and effectually. The lodges represent, on the ground
    plan, oblongs enclosed with strong elm bark, sustained on a frame
    work of saplings, tied on posts firmly set in the ground. They have a
    moveable piece or door, at each end, and an opening in the centre of
    the lodge, in the place of a chimney. Corn and potatoe fields, covered
    the surrounding grounds. The corn was in tassel, but the wilting of
    its blades, indicated, that they had been touched by a slight frost.
    Its effects were particularly apparent in some vines near one of the
    lodges. Although the lodges had been carefully closed, the chief said
    during his absence, a wolf had broken into his lodge and committed
    depredations. He observed, in speaking of game, that the red deer was
    found on the adjoining plains. In order to hunt the moose an animal
    formerly abundant in the region, he observed that it was necessary
    to go to one of the remote forks of the Burntwood or Brulé River. He
    represented the population of his village at eighty-eight souls, of
    whom twenty-eight were men, This estimate was understood to include the
    minor chief Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>bird and his followers, who are sometimes referred to
    as a distinct band. We asked the chief, while sitting at the camp-fire
    in the evening, whether he did not feel tired, having observed that
    during the day, he had alone, with the aid only of his wife, poled up
    his canoe and managed to keep ahead, so as to guide, our canoe with
    seven men. He was evidently fatigued, but replied, smiling, no.</p>

  <p>We parted with this chief, who has become respectable for his influence
    in this part of the country, at four o’clock on the next morning,
    (2d.) We had now got above all the strong rapids, and attained very
    nearly the height of land. The river, above this point, receives the
    Clearwater and Buffalo Rivers, as tributaries on the right bank. It
    is finally traced to Lake St. Croix, a handsome sheet of clear water,
    about six miles long. This lake has an island<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which is the site of
    a small village. Its head is perhaps ten or eleven leagues distant from
    the Namai Kowagon.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">On</span> entering lake St. Croix we were favored with a fair wind, and made
    use of our sails in passing it. As we approached its head, we found the
    swell formidable, but were able, nevertheless, to keep the lake. We
    debarked, on a marshy margin at its head, being the commencement of the
    portage to the Brulé. As the river St. Croix has its origin here, a few
    general remarks on its geographical features, may be subjoined.—This
    stream is an important tributary to the Upper Mississippi, originating
    on elevated grounds, and consequently, having a rapid mean descent.
    Although not remarkable for its length, its waters spread in a lateral
    line, an unusual distance. It has many tributaries, connecting it,
    on the north, with Rum river, on the south, with Chippewa river,
    and towards the east with the Mauvais and the Brulé rivers of Lake
    Superior. The main channel may be estimated, by its windings, at two
    hundred miles. The length of its Namakagon fork, is estimated to be
    one hundred and seventy miles, while that of its northern branch does
    not probably exceed sixty-five miles. Both branches, together with its
    lower tributaries, and their numerous lakes, yield the northern rice
    plant. The abundance of the plant, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> led to the local term of the
    Folle Avoine country, a name by which it is particularly known in the
    transactions of the Fur Trade.</p>

  <p>It has a comparatively mild climate, and rich soil, and in addition to
    the small fur bearing animals, on the sale of which the Indians rely
    for their woollens, arms, and ammunition; it affords the spontaneous
    means of subsistence, more fully, perhaps, than most other parts of
    the northwest regions. Its present aggregate population has been
    estimated the present year, at eight hundred and ninety-five, say nine
    hundred souls, numbering those only who are permanently located in
    its valley.—What quantity of furs and peltries is annually got from
    it, and what amount of Indian goods are required to pay for them,
    are questions which might be ascertained, with general accuracy, by
    consulting official records. But it is sufficient for the purposes of
    moral enquiry, to remark, that both the supplies and the returns, are
    less than they were in former years, and that there is a declension in
    the trade, which must at length produce a migration of the Indians, or
    induce them to become agriculturists. The fate that has overtaken other
    tribes, enjoying a more southerly position, must inevitably overtake
    these bands. And the period will probably arrive earlier, than it might
    be anticipated. They occupy a portion of the Mississippi valley, which
    is adapted for agriculture. Many parts of it, possess a rich soil,
    and are well timbered. Other portions are prairie land, suited for
    pasturage. Its most arid tracts abound in pine, and there is hardly a
    stream, of its many tributaries which does not afford numerous eligible
    seats for saw and grist mills. Hunting seems the only occupation, which
    cannot be a permanent one. But,</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“While thus the chase declines, and herds depart,</div>

        <div class="i1">To mend his fortunes, and to save his kind.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The portage from the St. Croix to the Burntwood, begins at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> the head
    of (the Upper) lake St. Croix. It lies over an elevated sandy pine
    ridge, which divides the two streams. The distance which the canoes and
    packages require to be carried, is 3,350 yards, or nearly two miles. On
    the left hand, in carrying from the St. Croix, there is a deep tamerac
    valley, which is said to afford the head springs of both streams. On
    the right, is seen, at some distance, a small lake, which is stated
    to yield the black bass, and to have no outlet. Its existence in a
    sand formation, indicates perhaps, coral rag, hardpan, or some firmer
    material below. This sand is apparently of marine deposition, and
    agrees, in this respect, with the extensive formations at the sources
    of the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>The goods after being carried this distance, are put down, on the
    banks of a sandy bottomed brook of very clear cold water, overhung
    with alders. Any other person, but one who had become familiar with
    northwest portages, would be apt to say, on being ushered to this
    secluded spot, “well, this is certainly an eligible spot to quench
    one’s thirst at, but as for embarking on this rill, with a canoe and
    baggage, the thing seems to be preposterous.” And so it certainly
    appeared, on our arrival.—There was not an average depth of water of
    more than two to four inches. But by going some distance below, and
    damming the stream, it rose in a short time, high enough to float a
    canoe, with a part of its lading. The men walking in the stream, then
    led the canoes, cutting away the brush to veer them, and carrying such
    parts of the lading as could not, from time to time, be embarked. We
    did not begin the descent, till six o’clock, in the evening, and went
    about a mile during the first hour and a half. It then became so dark,
    that it was necessary to encamp. And to encamp in such a place, seemed
    impossible. We could not, however, hesitate. There was no alternative,
    we could neither advance nor recede, and we were surrounded with a
    shaking bog. We slept on a kind of bog, which the men, call <i lang="fr">têtes
    des femmes</i>. Some rain fell during the night, but we were happily
    relieved from the fear of inundation, by the showers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> passing off. The
    next morning brought with it, a resumption of the toil of the evening.
    Tho canoes were sent on entirely empty. All the baggage was carried
    about a mile, at which distance the stream is perhaps doubled in width,
    and more than doubled in depth. The next mile rendering the going quite
    easy. At this point, say three miles from the portage, we embarked all
    our baggage, and after this, found no want of water, till we came to
    the rapids. These, commence about twenty-four miles below the portage,
    and they extend with intervals of smooth water, “few and far between,”
    to within three or four miles of the point of the entrance of the
    river, into Lake Superior. The entire length of this river may be
    estimated at one hundred miles, more than eighty miles of this distance
    consists of rapids. It has been said that there are two hundred and
    forty distinct rapids. At most of these, there is several feet fall.
    At some of them eight to ten feet. Four of them require portages of
    short extent. Six or seven hundred feet would not appear to be an
    extravagant estimate for the entire fall. The river itself is a perfect
    torrent; often on looking down its channel, there are wreaths of foam
    constituting a brilliant vista, overhung with foliage. It would never
    be used at all, for the purposes of the trade, were it not, that there
    is much water on the rapids, so that experienced men can conduct loaded
    canoes both up and down them. The river might appropriately be called
    Rapid, or Mad River, or almost any thing else, but by its popular
    name of <i lang="fr">Brulé</i>. This is, in fact, rather a departure, than a
    derivative from the Indian, Wisákoda, i.&nbsp;e. burnt-pines, or burnt-wood,
    in allusion to a signal destruction of its pine forests, by fire. We
    were two days, and part of an evening, in effecting the descent, and
    regained our outward track, at the point of its discharge into the Fond
    du Lac of lake Superior. We reached this point on the fourth of August,
    late at night, having gone later than usual, from the fact of finding
    ourselves below the rapids, and consequently know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>ing that we must be
    near the lake. Our first certain indication of our proximity to it,
    was, however, given by hearing the monotonous thump of an Indian drum.
    We soon after came in sight of camp fires, with Indian forms passing
    before them.—And we found ourselves, on landing, in the midst of former
    Indian acquaintances. Among them were Mongazid (Loon’s Foot,) the
    second Chief of Fond du Lac, and Chamees, (Pouncing Hawk,) a young man
    who had first recommended himself to notice in 1820, by guiding a part
    of Governor Cass’ expedition above the Knife Portage, and who evinced
    the same disposition, during the forepart of the present summer, by
    acting as a guide to the party, between Fond du Lac and Sandy Lake. We
    were pleased on observing the military boat, used by Lieutenant Allen
    on the lake, safely moored, with its sails and tackle, within the
    mouth of the river, having been brought down, agreeably to promise, by
    Mongazid, who had faithfully remained in charge of it.</p>

  <p>The day following, being the Sabbath, was spent at this place. And the
    narrative of our route from the Mississippi, may here be appropriately
    closed. Some remarks arising from observations on the condition of the
    Indians, among whom we have passed, it may be proper to add; but from
    the little leisure we can command, they are necessarily few and brief.</p>

  <p>The Chippewas are spread over a very large area in the north, divided
    into local bands, and separated by extensive tracts which are, in great
    part, sterile. They are not fixed in their habitations at any point,
    during the whole of the year, being compelled to go in search of the
    game, fish, and other spontaneous productions, on which they depend.
    The space which each band periodically traverses, in this effort, is
    extensive, and subjects them to casualties, which they would otherwise
    escape. Their condition is still further imbittered by hostilities
    with the Sioux tribes, who occupy the whole line of their western
    frontier. They cover the entire north-western angle of the United
    States, extending down the Mississippi valley on both banks, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> low
    as the Wadub, being the first stream above Sac river. At this point
    their territorial line crosses from the west to the east banks of the
    Mississippi, pursuing a southerly course, at the distance of about
    forty miles from it, until it intersects the lands of the Winnebagoes,
    north of the Wisconsin. This portion of the territory affords decidedly
    the largest and best body of farming lands in their possession, and
    will, probably, hereafter yield them, either by the proceeds of its
    sale, or cultivation, a more sure reliance at a period when the land
    becomes divested of game. The climate of this area is comparatively
    mild, and the Indians who inhabit it, notwithstanding their partial
    losses from wars, have evidently increased in population. They might
    be concentrated here, could the agricultural be substituted for the
    hunter life—a result which may be expected to follow, but cannot in
    any reasonable estimate be expected to precede, their conversion to
    christianity.</p>

  <p>This tribe offer no prominent obstacles to the introduction of the
    gospel. We have before adverted to the slender frame work of their
    native religion, which seems to be made up, primarily of certain
    superstitious ceremonies, winding themselves about the subject of
    medicine. It appears to occupy that void in the barbaric mind, which
    the soothsayers and magii of other lands, pressed forward, in the
    absence of revelation, to fill. But we do not know that the ritual
    has any striking features in common. The principal obstacle which
    missionaries will have to contend with, is a want of the knowledge
    of their language. And to surmount this is a labor which they cannot
    too early begin nor too zealously persevere in. The language itself,
    as we have before indicated, (vide <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chap. X.</a>) presents a copious
    vocabulary, and is capable of being made the medium of religious
    instruction. It has some defects which will require to be supplied, and
    some redundancies which will demand curtailment, when it comes to be
    written. But they offer very slight obstacles to oral communication.
    It is obviously better suited to convey narrative than disquisitive
    matter. And has been so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> long applied to corporeal objects, that
    it requires caution and a familiar knowledge of its idioms, in the
    conveyance of intellectual and still more of spiritual conceptions.</p>

  <p>In mere externals, the Chippewas are not essentially different from
    other tribes of the Algonquin stock in the western country. And the
    points in which a difference holds, may be supposed to have been, for
    the most part, the effects of a more ungenial climate. They are, to a
    less extent than most of the tribes, cultivators of the soil, and more
    exclusively hunters and warriors. Living in a portion of the continent,
    remarkable for the number of its large and small lakes, they find a
    common resource in fish, and along with this, enjoy the advantage of
    reaping the wild rice.</p>

  <p>Their government has been deemed a paradox, at the same time
    exercising, and too feeble to exercise power. But it is not more
    paradoxical than all patriarchal governments, which have their tie in
    filial affection, and owe their weakness to versatility of opinion.
    War and other public calamities bring them together, while prosperity
    drives them apart. They rally on public danger, with wonderful
    facility, and they disperse with equal quickness. All their efforts are
    of the partizan, popular kind. And if these do not succeed they are
    dispirited. There is nothing in their institutions and resources suited
    for long continued, steady exertion.</p>

  <p>The most striking trait in their moral history is the institution
    of the Totem—a sign manual, by which the affiliation of families is
    traced, agreeing, more exactly, perhaps, than has been supposed, with
    the armorial bearings of the feudal ages. And this institution is kept
    up, with a feeling of importance, which it is difficult to account
    for. An Indian, as is well known, will tell his specific name with
    great reluctance, but his generic or family name—in other words, his
    <i>Totem</i>, he will declare without hesitation, and with an evident
    feeling of pride.

  <p>None of our tribes have proceeded further than the first rude steps
    in hieroglyphic writing. And it is a practice in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> Chippewas
    are peculiarly expert. No part of their country can be visited without
    bringing this trait into prominent notice. Every path has its blazed
    and figured trees, conveying intelligence to all who pass, for all
    can read and understand these signs. They are taught to the young
    as carefully as our alphabet, with the distinction, however, that
    hieroglyphic writing, is the prerogative of the males. These devices
    are often traced on sheets of birch bark attached to poles. They are
    traced on war-clubs, on canoe paddles, bows or gun stocks. They are
    often drawn on skins, particularly those used as back dresses, by
    warriors. They have also other hieroglyphic modes of communicating
    information, by poles with knots of grass attached to them, or rings of
    paint. and often by antlers, or animals’ heads suspended by the banks
    of rivers.</p>

  <p>The following tale is added as an example of the kind of imaginative
    lore indicated by it.</p>

  <div class="center mt2 mb2">ORIGIN OF THE WHITE-FISH.</div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In ancient times when the Indians were better than they now are, when
      their laws were enforced by the chiefs, and when every crime was
      promptly punished, there lived a noted hunter and a just man, at a
      remote point on the north shore of Lake Superior. He had a wife and two
      sons, who were usually left in the lodge, while he went out in quest of
      the animals upon whose flesh they subsisted. As game was then abundant,
      his exertions were well rewarded, and he lived in the enjoyment of
      every blessing. But there was at this time a venom preparing for
      his heart, which was not the less poisonous, because it was for a
      time kept in secret. His two little sons had observed the visits of
      a neighboring hunter, during the absence of their father, and they
      ventured to remonstrate with their mother on the propriety of receiving
      clandestine visits, but she was in no temper to be reasoned with. She
      rebuked them sharply, and finally, on their intimation of disclosing
      the secret, threatened to kill them if they made any disclosure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> They
      were frightened into silence. But observing the continuance of an
      improper intercourse, kept up by stealth as it were, they resolved at
      last to disclose the whole matter to their father. The result was such
      as might be anticipated. The father being satisfied with the infidelity
      of his wife, took up a war club at a moment when he was not perceived,
      and with a single blow despatched the object of his jealousy. He then
      buried her under the ashes of his fire, took down his lodge, and
      removed to a distant position.</p>

    <p>But the spirit of the woman haunted the children who were now grown
      up to the estate of young men. She appeared to them in the shadows of
      evening. She terrified them in dreams. She harassed their imaginations
      wherever they went, so that their life was a life of perpetual terrors.
      They resolved to leave the country, and commenced a journey of many
      days towards the south. They at length came to the Poiwateeg falls.
      (St. Mary’s.) But they had no sooner come in sight of these falls, than
      they beheld the skull of the woman (their mother) rolling along the
      beach after them. They were in the utmost fear, and knew not what to
      do, to elude her, when one of them observed a large crane sitting on a
      rock in the rapids. They called out to the bird. “See, Grandfather, we
      are persecuted by a spirit. Come and take us across the falls so that
      we may escape her.”</p>

    <p>This crane was a bird of extraordinary size and great age. And when
      first descried by the two sons, sat in a state of stupor, in the midst
      of the most violent eddies of the foaming water. When he heard himself
      addressed, he stretched forth his neck, with great deliberation, and
      then raising himself on his wings flew across to their assistance.
      “Be careful” said the crane, “that you do not touch the back part of
      my head. It is sore, and should you press against it, I shall not be
      able to avoid throwing you both into the rapids.” They were, however,
      attentive on this point, and were both safely landed on the south<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> side
      of the river. The crane then resumed its former position in the rapids.</p>

    <p>But the skull now cried out. “Come Grandfather and carry me over, for
      I have lost my children, and am sorely distressed.” The aged bird flew
      to her assistance, but carefully repeated his injunction, that she must
      by no means touch the back part of his head, which had been hurt, and
      was not yet healed. She promised to obey, but she soon felt a curiosity
      to know, where the head of her carrier had been hurt, and how so aged
      a bird could have acquired such a bad wound. She thought it strange,
      and before they were half way over the rapids, could not resist the
      inclination she felt to touch the affected part. Instantly the crane
      threw her into the rapids. The skull floated down from rock to rock,
      striking violently against their hard edges, until it was battered to
      fragments, and the sons were thus happily and effectually relieved from
      their tormentor. But the brains of the woman, when the skull was dashed
      against the rocks, fell into the water, in the form of small white
      roes, which soon assumed the shape of a novel kind of fish, possessing
      a whiteness of color peculiar to itself; and these rapids have ever
      since been well stocked with this new and delicious species of fish.</p>

    <p>The sons meantime took up their permanent abode at these Falls,
      becoming the progenitors of the present tribe, and in gratitude to
      their deliverer adopted the Crane<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> as their Totem.</p>

  <p>1. <span class="smcap">Helix albolabris</span>, <cite>Say</cite>. Near Lake Michigan.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="smcap">Helix alternata</span>, <cite>Say</cite>. Banks of the Wabash, near
    and above the Tippecanoe. Mr. Say remarks, that these two species, so
    common in the Atlantic states, were not met with in Major Long’s second
    expedition, until their arrival in the secondary country at the eastern
    extremity of Lake Superior.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">PLANORBIS.</div>

  <p>10. <span class="smcap">Melania virginica</span>, <cite>Say</cite>. Lake Michigan.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">ANODONTA.</div>

  <p>11. <span class="smcap">Anodonta cataracta</span>, <cite>Say</cite>. Chicago, Lake Michigan.
    This species, Mr. Lea remarks, has a great geographical extension.</p>

  <p>12. <span class="smcap">Anodonta corpulenta</span>, <cite>Nobis</cite>. Shell thin and fragile,
    though less so than others of the genus; much inflated at the umbones,
    margins somewhat compressed; valves connate over the hinge in perfect
    specimens; surface dark brown, in old shells; in younger, of a pale
    dingy green, and without rays, in all I have examined; beaks slightly
    undulated at tip. The color within is generally of a livid coppery hue,
    but sometimes, also, pure white.</p>

  <p>Length of a middling sized specimen, four and a half inches, breadth,
    six and a quarter. It is often eighteen inches in circumference, round
    the border of the valves, with a diameter through the umbones of three
    inches. Inhabits the Upper Mississippi, from Prairie du Chien to Lake
    Pepin.</p>

  <p>This fine shell, much the largest I have seen of the genus, was first
    sent by Mr. Schoolcraft, to the Lyceum, several years ago. So far as I
    am able to discover, it is undescribed, and a distinct and remarkable
    species. It may be known by its length being greater in proportion to
    its breadth than in the other American species, by the subrhomboidal
    form of the posterior half, and, generally, by the color of the nacre,
    though this is not to be relied on. It appears to belong to the genus
    <span class="smcap">Symphynota</span> of Mr. Lea.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">ALASMODONTA.</div>

  <p>13. <span class="smcap">Alasmodonta complanata</span>, <cite>Barnes</cite>. <span class="smcap">Symphynota

    measure nineteen inches in circumference.</p>

  <p>14. <span class="smcap">Alasmodontab rugosa</span>, <cite>Barnes.</cite> St. Croix River, and

  <p>16. <span class="smcap">Alasmodonta edentula</span>? <cite>Say.</cite> <span class="smcap">Anodon
      areolatus</span>? <cite>Swainson.</cite> Lake Vaseux. The specimens of this
    shell are too old and imperfect to be safely determined.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">UNIO.</div>

  <p>17. <span class="smcap">Unio tuberculatus</span>, <cite>Barnes</cite>. Painted Rock, Upper

    Chien, to Lake Pepin.</p>

  <p>19. <span class="smcap">Unio verrucosus</span>, <cite>Barnes</cite>, <cite>Lea</cite>. St. Croix
    River of the Upper Mississippi.</p>

  <p>20. <span class="smcap">Unio plicatus</span>, <cite>Le Sueur</cite>, <cite>Say</cite>. Prairie du
    Chien, and River St. Croix.</p>

  <p>The specimens of <span class="smcap">U. plicatus</span> sent from this locality by Mr.
    Schoolcraft have the nacre beautifully tinged with violet, near the
    posterior border of the shell, and are also much more ventricose them
    those found in more eastern localities, as Pittsburgh, for example;
    at the same time, I believe them to be of the same species. Similar
    variations are observed in other species; the specimens from the south
    and west generally exhibiting a greater development.</p>

  <p>21. <span class="smcap">Unio trigonus</span>, <cite>Lea</cite>. From the same locality as the
    last, and like it unusually ventricose.</p>

  <p>22. <span class="smcap">Unio ebenus</span>, <cite>Lea</cite>. Upper Mississippi, between
    Prairie du Chien and Lake Pepin.</p>

  <p>23. <span class="smcap">Unio gibbosus</span>, <cite>Barnes</cite>. St. Croix River, Upper
    Mississippi.</p>

  <p>24. <span class="smcap">Unio rectus</span>, <cite>Lamarck</cite>. <span class="smcap">U. prælongus</span>,
    <cite>Barnes</cite>. Upper Mississippi, from Prairie du Chien to Lake Pepin,
    and the River St. Croix. The specimens collected by Mr. Schoolcraft,
    vary much in the color of the nacre. Some have it entirely white,
    others, rose purple, and others entirely of a very fine dark salmon
    color. This species inhabits the St. Lawrence as far east as Montreal.</p>

  <p>25. <span class="smcap">Unio siliquoideus</span>, <cite>Barnes</cite>, and <span class="smcap">U.
      inflatus</span>, <cite>Barnes</cite>. Upper Mississippi, between Prairie du

  <p>26. <span class="smcap">Unio complanatus</span>, <cite>Lea</cite>. <span class="smcap">U. purpureus</span>,
    <cite>Say</cite>. Lake Vaseux, St. Mary’s River. Lake Vaseux is an expansion
    of the River St. Mary, a tributary of the upper lakes. This shell does
    not appear to exist in any of the streams flowing into the Mississippi.
  </p>

  <p>27. <span class="smcap">Unio crassus</span>, <cite>Say</cite>. Upper Mississippi, Prairie du
    Chien.</p>

  <p>28. <span class="smcap">Unio radiatus</span>, <cite>Barnes</cite>. Lake Vaseux. The specimen is
    old and imperfect, but I believe it to be the <span class="smcap">U. radiatus</span> of
    our conchologists, which is common in Lake Champlain and also inhabits
    the St. Lawrence.</p>

  <p>29. <span class="smcap">Unio occidens</span>, <cite>Lea</cite>. <span class="smcap">U. ventricosus</span>,

  <p>30. <span class="smcap">Unio ventricosus</span>, <cite>Barnes</cite>. Upper Mississippi, from
    Prairie du Chien to Lake Pepin and Shell Lake. The varieties of this,
    and the preceding pass insensibly into each other. Those from Shell

  <div class="center mt5">CLASS I. <i>Bodies not metallic, containing an acid.</i></div>

  <p>1. <span class="smcap">Calcareous spar.</span> Keweena Point, Lake Superior. Imbedded in
    small globular masses, in the trap rock; also forming veins in the same
    formation. Some of the masses break into rhombic forms, and possess
    a certain but not perfect degree of transparency; others are opaque,
    or discolored by the green carbonate of copper. Also in the trap rock
    between Fond du Lac and Old Grand Portage, Lake Superior, in perfect,
    transparent rhombs, exhibiting the property of double refraction. Also,
    at the lead mines, in Iowa county, in the marly clay formation, often
    exhibiting imperfect prisms, variously truncated.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="smcap">Calcareous tufa.</span> Mouth of the River Brulé, of Lake
    Superior. In small, friable, broken masses, in the diluvial soil. Also,
    in the gorge below the Falls of St. Anthony. In detached, vesicular
    masses, amidst debris.</p>

  <p>3. <span class="smcap">Compact carbonate of lime.</span> In the calcareous cliffs
    of horizontal formation, commencing at the Falls of St. Anthony.
    Carboniferous.</p>

  <p>4. <span class="smcap">Septaria.</span> In the reddish clay soil, between Montreal River,

  <p>6. <span class="smcap">Carbonate of magnesia.</span> Serpentine rock, at Presque Isle,
    Lake Superior. Compact.</p>

  <p>7. <span class="smcap">Hydrate of magnesia?</span> With the preceding.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">CLASS II. <i>Earthy compounds, amorphous or crystalline.</i></div>

  <p>8. <span class="smcap">Common quartz.</span> Huron Islands, Lake Superior, also the

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

  <p>11. <span class="smcap">Amethyst.</span> With the preceding. Also, at the Pic Bay, and at
    Gargontwa, north shore of Lake Superior, in the trap rock, in perfect
    crystals of various intensity of color.</p>

  <p>12. <span class="smcap">Chalcedony.</span> Keweena Point, Lake Superior. In globular or
    orbicular masses, in amygdaloid rock. Often, in detached masses along
    the shores.</p>

  <p>13. <span class="smcap">Carnelian.</span> With the preceding.</p>

  <p>14. <span class="smcap">Hornstone.</span> In detached masses, very hard, on the shores
    of Lake Superior. Also, at Dodgeville, Iowa county, Mich. Ter. in
    fragments or nodular masses in the clay soil.</p>

  <p>15. <span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> In the preceding locality. Common and striped,
    exceedingly difficult of being acted on, by the wheel. Not observed in
    situ.</p>

  <p>16. <span class="smcap">Agate.</span> Imbedded in the trap rocks of Lake Superior,
    and also detached, forming a constituent of its detritus. Variously
    colored. Often made up of alternate layers of chalcedony, carnelian,
    and cacholong. Sometimes zoned, or in fortification points. Specimens
    not taken from the rock are not capable of being scratched by quartz or
    flint, and are incapable of being acted on by the file; consequently
    <em>harder</em> than any of the described species.</p>

  <p>17. <span class="smcap">Cyanite.</span> Specimens of this mineral, in flat, six-sided
    prisms imbedded in a dark primitive rock, were brought out from Lac du
    Flambeau outlet, where the rock is described as existing in situ. The
    locality has not been visited, but there are facts brought to light
    within the last two or three years, to justify the extension of the
    primitive to that section of country.</p>

  <p>18. <span class="smcap">Pitchstone.</span> A detached mass of this mineral, very black
    and lava-like, was picked up in the region of Lake Superior, where the
    volcanic mineral, trachyte, is common among the rolled masses. Neither
    of these substances have been observed in situ.</p>

  <p>19. <span class="smcap">Mica.</span> Huron Islands, Lake Superior. In granite.</p>

  <p>20. <span class="smcap">Schorl.</span> Common. Outlet of Lac du Flambeau. Also, in a

  <p>24. <span class="smcap">Zeolite.</span> Mealy. With the preceding.</p>

  <p>25. <span class="smcap">Zeolite.</span> Radiated. Lake Superior. This mineral consists
    of fibres, so delicate and firmly united as to appear almost compact,
    radiating from a centre. Some of the masses produced by this radiation,
    measure 2.5 inches in diameter. They are of a uniform, pale, yellowish
    red. This mineral has not been traced in situ, being found in detached
    masses of rock, and sometimes as water-worn portions of radii. Its true
    position would seem to be the trap rock.</p>

  <p>26. <span class="smcap">Asbestos.</span> Presque Isle, Lake Superior. In the serpentine
    formation.</p>

  <p>27. <span class="smcap">Hornblende.</span> Very abundant as a constituent of the
    primitive rocks on the Upper Mississippi, and in the basin of Lake
    Superior. Often in distinct crystals.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

  <p>28. <span class="smcap">Diallage, green.</span> Lake Superior. In detached masses,
    connected with primitive boulders. <em>Harder</em> than the species.</p>

  <p>30. <span class="smcap">Serpentine, precious.</span> With the preceding. Color a light
    pistachio green, and takes a fine polish. Exists in veins in the common
    variety.</p>

  <p>31. <span class="smcap">Pseudomorphous serpentine.</span> With the preceding. This
    beautiful green mineral constitutes a portion of the veins of the
    precious serpentine. Its crystalline impressions are very distinct.</p>

  <p>32. <span class="smcap">Argillite.</span> River St. Louis, northwest of Lake Superior.
    Nearly vertical in its position.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">CLASS III. <i>Combustibles.</i></div>

  <p>33. <span class="smcap">Peat.</span> Marine sand formation composing the shore of Lake
    Superior, between White-fish Point and Grand Marrais. Also, on the
    island of Michilimackinac.</p>

  <div class="center mt5">CLASS IV. <i>Ores and Metals.</i></div>

  <p>34. <span class="smcap">Native copper.</span> West side of Keweena Point, Lake Superior.
    Imbedded in a vein with carbonate of copper, and copper black, in the
    trap rock.</p>

  <p>35. <span class="smcap">Copper black.</span> With the preceding.</p>

  <p>36. <span class="smcap">Carbonate of copper, green.</span> With the preceding.</p>

  <p>These two minerals (35 and 36) characterize the trap rock of the
    peninsula of Keweena, Lake Superior, from Montreal Bay, extending to,
    and around its extremity, west, to Sand-hill Bay. The entire area may
    be estimated to comprise a rocky, serrated coast of about seventy-five
    miles in length, and not to exceed seven or eight miles in width. The
    principal veins are at a point called <i lang="fr">Roche Verd</i>, and along
    the coast which we refer to as the Black Rocks. At the latter, native
    copper is one of the constituents of the vein.</p>

  <p>Green and blue carbonate of copper, was also observed in limited
    quantity, in small rounded masses at one of the lead diggings near
    Mineral Point, Iowa county.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Most</span> of the researches which have been directed to the Indian
    languages, have resulted in elucidating the principles governing the
    use of the verb, which has been proved to be full and varied in its
    inflections. Either, less attention has been paid to the other parts
    of speech, or results less suited to create high expectations of
    their flexibility and powers, have been attained. The Indian verb has
    thus been made to stand out, as it were in bold relief as a shield
    to defects in the substantive and its accessories, and as, in fact,
    compensating, by its multiform appendages of prefix and suffix—by
    its tensal, its pronominal, its substantive, its adjective, and its
    adverbial terminations; for barrenness and rigidity in all other parts
    of speech. Influenced by this reflection, I shall defer, in the present
    inquiry, the remarks I intend offering on the verb, until I have
    considered the substantive, and its more important adjuncts.</p>

  <p>Palpable objects, to which the idea of sense strongly attaches, and
    the actions or condition, which determine the relation of one object
    to another, are perhaps, the first points to demand attention in the
    invention of languages. And they have certainly imprinted themselves
    very strongly, with all their materiality, and with all their local,
    and exclusive, and personal peculiarities upon the Indian. The noun and
    the verb not only thus constitute the principal elements of speech, as
    in all languages; but they continue to perform their first offices,
    with less direct aid from the auxiliary parts of speech, than would
    appear to be reconcileable with a clear expression of the circumstances
    of time and place, number and person, quality and quantity, action and
    repose, and the other accidents, on which their definite employment
    depends. But to enable the sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>stantives and attributives to perform
    these complex offices, they are provided with inflections, and undergo
    changes and modifications, by which words and phrases become very
    concrete in their meaning, and are lengthened out to appear formidable
    to the eye. Hence the polysyllabic, and the descriptive character of
    the language, so composite in its aspect and in its forms.</p>

  <p>To utter succinctly, and in as few words as possible the prominent
    ideas resting upon the mind of the speaker, appear to have been
    the paramount object with the inventors of the language. Hence
    concentration became a leading feature. And the pronoun, the adjective,
    the adverb and the preposition, however they may be disjunctively
    employed in certain cases, are chiefly useful as furnishing materials
    to the speaker, to be worked up into the complicated texture of the
    verb and the substantive. Nothing, in fact, can be more unlike,
    than the language, viewed in its original, elementary state,—in a
    vocabulary, for instance, of its primitive words, so far as such a
    vocabulary can now be formed, and the same language as heard under its
    oral, amalgamated form. Its transpositions may be likened to a picture,
    in which the copal, the carmine and the white lead, are no longer
    recognized as distinct substances, but each of which has contributed
    its share towards the effect. It is the painter only who possesses the
    principle, by which one element has been curtailed, another augmented,
    and all, however seemingly discordant, made to coalesce.</p>

  <p>Such a language may be expected to abound in derivatives and compounds;
    to afford rules for giving verbs substantive, and substantives verbal
    qualities; to concentrate the meaning of words upon a few syllables,
    or upon a single letter, or alphabetical sign; and to supply modes
    of contraction and augmentation, and, if I may so say, <em>short
    cuts</em>, and <em>by paths</em> to meanings, which are equally novel and
    interesting. To arrive at its primitives, we must pursue an intricate
    thread, where analogy is often the only guide. We must divest words of
    those accumulated syllables, or particles, which, like the molecules of
    material matter, are clustered around the primitives. It is only after
    a process of this kind, that the <em>principle of combination</em>—that
    secret wire, which moves the whole machinery can be searched for, with
    a reasonable prospect of success. The labor of analysis is one of the
    most interesting and important, which the subject presents. And it is
    a labor which it will be expedient to keep constantly in view, until
    we have separately considered the several parts of speech, and the
    grammatical laws by which the lan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>guage is held together; and thus
    established principles and provided materials wherewith we may the more
    successfully labor.</p>

  <p>1. In a general survey of the language as it is spoken, and as it
    must be written, there is perhaps no feature which obtrudes itself
    so constantly to view, as the principle which separates all words,
    of whatever denomination, into animates and inanimates, as they are
    applied to objects in the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom.
    This principle has been grafted upon most words, and carries its
    distinctions throughout the syntax. It is the gender of the language;
    but a gender of so unbounded a scope, as to merge in it the common
    distinctions of a masculine and feminine, and to give a two-fold
    character to the parts of speech. The concords which it requires,
    and the double inflections it provides, will be mentioned in their
    appropriate places. It will be sufficient here to observe, that animate
    nouns require animate verbs for their nominatives, animate adjectives
    to express their qualities, and animate demonstrative pronouns to
    mark the distinctions of person. Thus, if we say, I see a man; I see
    a house, the termination of the verb must be changed. What was in the
    first instance wâb imâ, is altered to wâb indân. Wâb, is here the
    infinitive, but the root of this verb is still more remote. If the
    question occur, Is it a good man, or a good house, the adjective,
    which, in the inanimate form is onishish-í, is, in the animate
    onishish-in´. If the question be put, Is it this man, or this house,
    the pronoun this, which is mâ bum, in the animate, is changed to mâ
    ndun, in the inanimate.</p>

  <p>Nouns animate embrace the tribes of quadrupeds, birds, fishes,
    insects, reptiles, crustaceæ, the sun and moon and stars, thunder and
    lightning, for these are personified; and whatever either possesses
    animal life, or is endowed, by the peculiar opinions and superstitions
    of the Indians, with it. In the vegetable kingdom, their number is
    comparatively limited, being chiefly confined to trees, and those
    only while they are referred to, as whole bodies, and to the various
    species of fruits, and seeds, and esculents. It is at the option of
    the speaker to employ nouns, either as animates or inanimates: but
    it is a choice seldom resorted to, except in conformity with stated
    exceptions. These conventional exceptions are not numerous, and the
    more prominent of them, may be recited. The cause of the exceptions it
    is not always easy to perceive. It may, however, generally be traced
    to a particular respect paid to certain inanimate bodies, either from
    their real or fancied properties,—the uses to which they are applied,
    or the ceremonies to which they are dedicated. A stone, which is the
    altar of sacrifice to their Manitoes; a bow, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>merly so necessary in
    the chase; a feather, the honored sign of martial prowess; a kettle,
    so valuable in the household; a pipe, by which friendships are sealed
    and treaties ratified; a drum, used in their sacred and festive dances;
    a medal, the mask of authority; vermillion, the appropriate paint of
    the warrior; wampum, by which messages are conveyed, and covenants
    remembered. These are among the objects, in themselves inanimates,
    which require the application of animate verbs, pronouns, and
    adjectives, and are thereby transferred to the animate class.</p>

  <p>It is to be remarked, however, that the names for animals, are only
    employed as animates, while the objects are referred to, as whole and
    complete species. But the gender must be changed, when it becomes
    necessary to speak of separate numbers. Man, woman, father, mother, are
    separate nouns, so long as the individuals are meant; but hand, foot,
    head, eye, ear, tongue, are inanimates. Buck, is an animate noun, while
    his entire carcass is referred to, whether living or dead; but neck,
    back, heart, windpipe, take the inanimate form. In like manner, eagle,
    swan, dove, are distinguished as animates, but beak, wing, tail, are
    arranged with inanimates. So oak, pine, ash, are animate; branch, leaf,
    root, inanimates.</p>

  <p>Reciprocal exceptions, however, exist to this rule,—the reasons for
    which, as in the former instance, may generally be sought, either
    in peculiar opinions of the Indians, or in the peculiar qualities
    or uses of the objects. Thus the talons of the eagle, and the claws
    of the bear, and of other animals, which furnish ornaments for the
    neck, are invariably spoken of, under the animate form. The hoofs and
    horns of all quadrupeds, which are applied to various economical and
    mystic purposes; the castorum of the beaver, and the nails of man,
    are similarly situated. The vegetable creation also furnishes some
    exceptions of this nature; such are the names for the outer bark of all
    trees, (except the birch,) and the branches, the roots, and the resin
    of the spruce, and its congeners.</p>

  <p>In a language, which considers all nature as separated into two classes
    of bodies, characterized by the presence or absence of life; neuter
    nouns, will scarcely be looked for, although such may exist without
    my knowledge. Neuters are found amongst the verbs and the adjectives,
    but it is doubtful whether they render the nouns to which they are
    applied, neuters, in the sense we attach to that term. The subject in
    all its bearings, is interesting, and a full and minute description
    of it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> would probably elicit new light respecting some doubtful
    points in the language, and contribute something towards a curious
    collateral topic—the history of Indian opinions. I have stated the
    principle broadly, without filling up the subject of exceptions, as
    fully as it is in my power, and without following its bearings upon
    points, which will more properly come under discussion, at other
    stages of the inquiry. A sufficient outline, it is believed, has been
    given, and having thus met, at the threshold, a principle deeply laid
    at the foundation of the language, and one which will be perpetually
    recurring, I shall proceed to enumerate some other prominent features
    of the substantive.</p>

  <p>2. No language is perhaps so defective, as to be totally without
    number. But there, are, probably, few which furnish so many modes of
    indicating it, as the Ojibwai. There are as many modes of forming the
    plural, as there are vowel sounds, yet there is no distinction between
    a limited and unlimited plural; although there is, in the pronoun, an
    <em>inclusive</em> and an <em>exclusive</em> plural. Whether we say man
    or men, two men or twenty men, the singular, inin´i, and the plural
    inin´iwug, remains the same. But if we say we, or us, or our men, (who
    are present,) or we, or us, or our Indians, (in general,) the plural
    we, and us, and our—for they are rendered by the same form—admit of a
    change to indicate whether the objective person be <em>included</em> or
    <em>excluded</em>. This principle, of which full examples will be given
    under the appropriate head, forms a single and anomalous instance of
    the use of particular plurals. And it carries its distinctions, by
    means of the pronouns, separable and inseparable, into the verbs and
    substantives, creating the necessity of double conjugations and double
    declensions, in the plural forms of the first person. Thus, the term
    for Our Father, which, in the inclusive form, is Kôsinân, is, in the
    exclusive, Nôsinân.
  </p>

  <p>The particular plural, which is thus, by the transforming power of the
    language, carried from the pronoun into the texture of the verb and
    substantive, is not limited to any fixed number of persons or objects,
    but arises from the operations of the verb. The general plural is
    variously made. But the plural, making inflections take upon themselves
    an additional power or sign, by which substantives are distinguished
    into animate and inanimate. Without this additional power, all nouns
    plural, would end in the vowels a, e, i, o, u. But to mark the gender
    the letter g, is added to animates, and the letter n, to inanimates,
    making the plurals of the first class, terminate in âg, eeg, ig, ôg,
    ug, and of the second class in ân, een, in, ôn, un. Ten modes of
    forming the plural are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> thus provided, five of which are animate, and
    five inanimate plurals. A strong and clear line of distinction is thus
    drawn between the two classes of words, so unerring indeed, in its
    application, that it is only necessary to inquire how the plural is
    formed, to determine whether it belong to one, or the other class. The
    distinctions which we have endeavored to convey, will perhaps, be more
    clearly perceived, by adding examples of the use of each of the plurals.</p>

  <p>Where a noun terminates with a vowel in the singular, the addition
    of the g, or n, shows at once, both the plural and the gender. In
    other instances, as in peenai, a partridge—seebi, a river—it requires
    a consonant to precede the plural vowel, in conformity with a rule
    previously stated. Thus, peenai, is rendered peenai-wug—and seebi,
    seebi-wun. Where the noun singular terminates in the broad, instead
    of the long sound of a, as in ôgimâ, a chief ishpatinâ, a hill, the
    plural is ogim-ag, ishpatinân. But these are mere modifications of two
    of the above forms, and are by no means entitled to be considered as
    additional plurals.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Others may be found, and indeed, a few others are known. But it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
    less an object, in this lecture to pursue exceptions into their
    minutest ramifications, than to sketch broad rules, applicable, if not
    to every word, to at least a majority of words in the language.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one exception from the general use of number, so
    peculiar in itself, that not to point it out, would be an unpardonable
    remissness, in giving the outlines of a language, in which it is an
    object, neither to extenuate faults, nor to overrate beauties. This
    exception consists in the want of number in the <em>third person</em>
    of the declensions of animate nouns, and the conjugation of animate
    verbs. Not, that such words are destitute of number, in their simple
    forms, or when used under circumstances requiring no change of these
    simple forms—no prefixes and no inflections. But it will be seen, at
    a glance, how very limited such an application of words must be, in a
    transpositive language.</p>

  <p>Thus mang and kâg (loon and porcupine) take the plural inflection wug,

  <p>But his loon, or loons, (o mang oom un) his porcupine or porcupines,
    (o gâg oom un) are without number. The rule applies equally to the
    class of words, in which the pronouns are inseparable. Thus, my father
    and thy father, nôs and kôs, become my fathers and thy fathers, by
    the numerical inflection ug, forming nôsug and kôsug. But ôsun, his
    father or fathers is vague, and does not indicate whether there be
    one father or twenty fathers. The inflection un, merely denotes the
    <em>object</em>. The rule also applies equally to sentences, in which
    the noun is governed by, or governs the verb. Whether we say, I saw
    a bear—ningi wâbumâ mukwah, or a bear saw me—mukwah ningi wâbumig,
    the noun, itself, undergoes no change, and its number is definite.
    But ogi wâbum-ân muk-wun, he saw bear, is indefinite, although both
    the verb and the noun have changed their endings. And if the narrator
    does not subsequently determine the number, the hearer is either
    left in doubt, or must resolve it by a question. In fine, the whole
    acts of the third person are thus ren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>dered questionable. This want
    of precision, which would seem to be fraught with so much confusion,
    appears to be obviated in practice, by the employment of adjectives,
    by numerical inflections in the relative words of the sentence, by
    the use of the indefinite article, paizhik, or by demonstrative
    pronouns. Thus, paizhik mukw<i>un</i> ogi wâbum<i>ân</i>, conveys
    with certainty the information—he saw <em>a</em> bear. But in this
    sentence both the noun and the verb retain the objective inflections,
    as in the former instances. These inflections are not uniformly un,
    but sometimes een, as in ogeen, his mother, and sometimes ôn, as in
    odakeek-ôn, his kettle, in all which instances, however, the number
    is left indeterminate. It may hence be observed, and it is a remark
    which we shall presently have occasion to corroborate, that the plural
    inflection to inanimate nouns, (which have no objective form,) forms
    the objective inflection to animate nouns, which have no number in the
    third person.</p>

  <p>3. This leads us to the consideration of the mode of forming
    possessives, the existence of which, when it shall have been indicated
    by full examples, will present to the mind of the inquirer, one of
    those tautologies in grammatical forms, which, without imparting
    additional precision, serve to clothe the language with accumulated
    verbiage. The strong tendency to combination and amalgamation,
    existing in the language, renders it difficult, in fact to discuss
    the principles of it, in that elementary form which, could be wished.
    In the analysis of words and forms we are constantly led from the
    central point of discussion. To recur, however, from these collateral
    unravelings, to the main thread of inquiry, at as short and frequent
    intervals as possible, and thus to preserve the chain of conclusions
    and proofs, is so important that without keeping the object distinctly
    in view, I should despair of conveying any clear impressions of those
    grammatical features, which impart to the language its peculiar
    character.</p>

  <p>It has been remarked that the distinctions of number, are founded upon
    a modification of the five vowel sounds. Possessives are likewise
    founded upon the basis of the vowel sounds. There are five declensions
    of the noun to mark the possessive, ending in the possessive in âm,
    eem, im, ôm, um, oom. Where the nominative ends with a vowel, the
    possessive is made by adding the letter m, as in maimai, a woodcock, ni
    maimaim, my woodcock, &amp;c. Where the nominative ends in a consonant, as
    in ais, a shell, the full possessive inflection is required, making nin
    dais-im, my shell. In the latter form the consonant d, is interposed
    between the pronoun and noun, and sounded with the noun, in conformity
    with a general rule. Where the nominative ends in the broad, in lieu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
    of the long sound of a, as in ogimâ, a chief—the possessive is âm. The
    sound of i, in the third declension, is that of i in pin, and the sound
    of u, in the fifth declension, is that of u in bull. The latter will be
    uniformly represented by oo.</p>

  <p>The possessive declensions run throughout both the animate and
    inanimate classes of nouns, with some exceptions in the latter—as
    knife, bowl, paddle, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Inanimate nouns are thus declined.</p>

  <p>Animate substantives are declined precisely in the same manner as
    inanimate, except in the third person, which takes to the possessive
    inflections, aim, eem, im, ôm, oom, the objective particle un, denoting
    the compound inflection of this person, both in the singular and
    plural, aimun, eemun, imun, ômun, oomun, and the variation of the
    first vowel sound, âmun. Thus, to furnish an example of the second
    declension, pizhik’i, a bison, changes its forms to nim, bizhik-im, my
    bison—ke bizhik-im, thy bison, O bizhik-imun, his bison, or bisons.</p>

  <p>The cause of this double inflection in the third person, may be left
    for future inquiry. But we may add further examples in aid of it. We
    cannot simply say, The chief has killed a bear, or, to reverse the
    object upon which the energy of the verb is exerted, The bear has
    killed a chief. But, ogimâ ogi nissân mukwun, literally, <em>Chief he
    has killed him bear</em>, or, mukwah ogi nissân ogimân, <em>Bear he has
    killed him chief</em>. Here the verb and the noun are both objective in
    <i>un</i>, which is sounded ân, where it comes after the broad sound of
    a, as in nissân, objective of the verb to kill. If we confer the powers
    of the English possessive, (’s)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> upon the inflections aim, eem, im, ôm,
    oom, and âm respectively, and the meaning of <em>him</em>, and of course
    he, her, his, hers, they, theirs, (as there is no declension of the
    pronoun, and no number to the third person) upon the objective particle
    un, we shall then translate the above expression, o bizhik-eemum,
    <em>his bison’s hisn</em>. If we reject this meaning, as I think we
    should, the sentence would read, His bison—him—a mere tautology.</p>

  <p>It is true, it may be remarked, that the noun possessed, has a
    corresponding termination, or pronominal correspondence, with the
    pronoun possessor, also a final termination indicative of its being
    the <em>object</em> on which the verb exerts its influence—a mode of
    expression, which, so far as relates to the possessive, would be deemed
    superfluous, in modern languages; but may have some analogy in the
    Latin accusatives am, um, em.</p>

  <p>It is a constant and unremitting aim in the Indian languages to
    distinguish the actor from the object, partly by prefixes, and partly
    by inseparable suffixes. That the termination <i>un</i>, is one of
    these inseparable particles, and that its office, while it confounds
    the number, is to designate the object, appears probable from the fact,
    that it retains its connexion with the noun, whether the latter follow
    or precede the verb, or whatever its position in the sentence may be.</p>

  <p>Thus we can, without any perplexity in the meaning say,
    <i>Waimittigôzhiwug ogi sagiân Pontiac-un</i>, Frenchmen they did
    love Pontiac him. Or to reverse it, <i>Pontiac-un Waimittigôzhiwug
    ogi sagiân</i>, Pontiac, he did Frenchmen he loved. The termination
    un in both instances, clearly determines the object beloved. So in
    the following instance, <i>Sagunoshug ogi sagiân Tecumseh-un</i>,
    Englishmen, they did love Tecumseh, or <i>Tecumseh-un Sagunoshug oji
    sagiân</i>, Tecumseh, he did Englishmen he loved.
  </p>

  <p>In tracing the operation of this rule, through the doublings of the
    language, it is necessary to distinguish every modification of sound,
    whether it is accompanied, or not accompanied by a modification of
    the sense. The particle un, which thus marks <em>the third person
    and persons</em>, is sometimes pronounced <i>wun</i>, and sometimes
    <i>yun</i>, as the harmony of the word to which it is suffixed, may
    require. But not the slightest change is thereby made in its meaning.</p>

  <p>Wâbojeeg ogi meegân-ân nâdowaisi-wun.</p>

  <p>Wâbojeeg fought his enemies. L. W. he did fight them, his enemy, or
    enemies.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <p>O sâgi-ân inini-wun.</p>

  <p>He, or she loves a man. L. He, or she, loves him-man, or men.</p>

  <p>Kigo-yun waindji pimmâdizziwâd.</p>

  <p>They subsist on fish. L. Fish or fishes, they upon them, they live.</p>

  <p>Ontwa o sagiân odi-yun.</p>

  <p>Ontwa loves his dog. L. O. he loves him, his dog, or dogs.</p>

  <p>In these sentences the letters w and y are introduced before the
    inflection un, merely for euphony’s sake, and to enable the speaker
    to utter the final vowel of the substantive, and the inflective
    vowel, without placing both under the accent. It is to be remarked in
    these examples, that the verb has a corresponding inflection with the
    noun, indicated by the final consonant n, as in sagiâ-n, objective
    of the verb to love. This is merely a modification of un, where it
    is requisite to employ it after broad a (aw,) and it is applicable
    to nouns as well as verbs whenever they end in that sound. Thus, in
    the phrase, he saw a chief, O wâbumâ-n O gimâ-n, both noun and verb
    terminate in n. It is immaterial to the sense, which precedes. And this
    leads to the conclusion, which we are, in some measure, compelled to
    state, in anticipation of our remarks on the verb. That verbs must not
    only agree with their nominatives in number, person and <em>gender</em>
    (we use the latter term for want of a more appropriate one,) but
    also with their objectives. Hence the objective sign n, in the above
    examples. Sometimes this sign is removed from the ending of the verb,
    to make room for the plural of the nominative person, and is subjoined
    to the latter. Thus,</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">O sagiâ(wâ)n.</div>
        <div class="i0">They love them, him or them.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In this phrase the interposed syllable (wâ) is, apparently, the
    plural—it is a reflective plural—of <i>he</i>—the latter being,
    indicated as usual, by the sign O. It has been observed, above, that
    the deficiency in number, in the third person, is sometimes supplied
    “by numerical inflections in the relative words of the sentence,” and
    this interposed particle, (wâ) affords an instance in point. The number
    of the nominative pronoun appears to be thus rendered precise, but the
    objective is still indefinite.</p>

  <p>When two nouns are used without a verb in the sentence, or when two
    nouns compose the whole matter uttered, being in the third person, both
    have the full objective inflection. Thus,</p>

  <div class="center">Os-(un.) Odi-(yun.)</div>

  <p>His father’s dog. L. His father—his dog or dogs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

  <p>There are certain words, however, which will not admit the objective
    <i>un</i>, either in its simple or modified forms. These are rendered
    objective in een, or ôn.</p>

  <p>O wâbumâ-(n,) ossin-(een.)</p>

  <p>He sees the stone. L. He sees him—stone or stones.</p>

  <p>O wâbumâ-(n) mittig o mizh-(een.) L. He sees him, tree or trees.</p>

  <p>He sees an oak tree.</p>

  <p>O mittig wâb (een,) gyai o bikwuk-(ôn.)</p>

  <p>His bow and his arrows. L. His bow him, and his arrows him or them.</p>

  <p>Odyâ | wâ | wâ (n,) akkik-(ôn.)</p>

  <p>They possess a kettle. L. They own them, kettle or kettles.</p>

  <p>The syllable wâ, in the verb of the last example included between bars,
    (instead of parentheses,) is the reflective plural <em>they</em>, pointed
    out in a preceding instance.</p>

  <p>The abbreviations, <i>in.</i> and <i>ex.</i> in these declensions, mark
    the inclusive and exclusive forms of the pronoun plural. The inflection
    of the third person, as it is superadded to the first and second, is
    included between parentheses, that the eye, unaccustomed to these
    extended forms, may readily detect it.</p>

  <p>Where the inseparable, instead of the separable pronoun is employed,
    the possessive inflection of the first and second person is dispensed
    with, although the inflection of the third is still retained.</p>

  <p>The word <i>Dy</i> which supplies this declension is derived from
    <i>Indyiàm</i> mine. <i>pron. an.</i>—a derivative form of the word,
    which is, however exclusively restricted, in its meaning, to the dog.
    If the expression Nin Dy or N’ Dy, is sometimes applied to the horse,
    it is because it is thereby intended to call him, my dog, from his
    being in a state of servitude similar to that of the dog. It must be
    borne in mind, as connected with this subject, that the dog, in high
    northern latitudes, and even as far south as 42 deg. is both a beast
    of draught and of burden. He is compelled during the winter season to
    draw the <i>odàban</i>, or Indian sleigh; and sometimes to support the
    burden upon his back, by means of a kind of drag constructed of slender
    poles.</p>

  <p>A review of the facts which have been brought together respecting the
    substantive, will show that the separable or inseparable pronouns under
    the form of prefixes, are throughout required. It will also indicate,
    that the inflections of the first and second persons which occupy
    the place of possessives, and those of the third person, resembling
    objectives, pertain to words, which are either primitives, or denote
    but a single object, as moose, fire. There is, however another class of
    substantives, or substantive expressions, and an extensive class—for
    it embraces a great portion of the compound descriptive terms—in the
    use of which, no pronominal prefixes are required, The distinctions
    of person are, exclusively, supplied by pronominal suffixes. Of this
    character are the words descriptive of country, place of dwelling,
    field of battle, place of employment, &amp;c. The following example will
    furnish the inflexions applicable to this entire class of words.</p>

    the properties of this part of speech.</i>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> the view which has been taken of the substantive in the preceding
    lecture, it has been deemed proper to exclude several topics, which,
    from their peculiarities, it was believed, could be more satisfactorily
    discussed in a separate form. Of this character are those modifications
    of the substantive by which locality, diminution, a defective quality,
    and the past tense are expressed; by which various adjective and
    adverbial significations are given; and finally, the substantives
    themselves converted into verbs. Such are also the mode of indicating
    the masculine and feminine (both merged, as we have shown, in the
    animate class) and those words which are of a strictly <em>sexual</em>
    character, or are restricted in their <em>use</em> either to males or
    females. Not less interesting is the manner of forming derivatives, and
    of conferring upon the derivatives so formed, a <em>personality</em>,
    distinguished as either animate or inanimate, at the option of the
    speaker.</p>

  <p>Much of the flexibility of the substantive is derived from these
    properties, and they undoubtedly add much to the figurative character
    of the language. Some of them have been thought analogous to case,
    particularly that inflection of the noun which indicates the locality
    of the object. But if so, then there would be equally strong reasons
    for establishing an <em>adjective</em>, and an <em>adverbial</em>, as
    well as a <em>local</em> case, and a plurality of forms in each. But
    it is believed that no such necessity exists. There is no regular
    declension of these forms, and they are all used under limitations and
    restrictions incompatible with the true principles of case.</p>

  <p>It is under this view of the subject, that the discussion of these
    forms has been transferred, together with the other accidents of the
    substantive just adverted to, and reserved, as the subject matter of a
    separate lecture. And in now proceeding to express the conclusions at
    which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> have arrived touching these points, it will be an object so
    to compress and arrange the materials before us, as to present within a
    small compass, the leading facts and examples, upon which each separate
    position depends.</p>

  <p>1. That quality of the noun, which, in the shape of an inflection,
    denotes the relative situation of the object, by the contiguous
    position of some accessory object, is expressed in the English
    language, by the prepositions <em>in</em>, <em>into</em>, <em>at</em>, or
    <em>on</em>. In the Indian they are denoted by an inflection. Thus
    the phrase, In the box, is rendered in the Indian by one word,
    <i>mukukoong</i>. Of this word, mukuk, simply, is box. The termination
    <i>oong</i>, denoting the locality, not of the box, but of the object
    sought after. The expression appears to be precise, although there is
    no definite article in the language.</p>

  <p>The substantive takes this form, most commonly, after a question has
    been put, as, Anindl ni môkoman-ais? where is my penknife? Mukukoong,
    (in the box,) addôpowin-ing, (on the table,) are definite replies
    to this question. But the form is not restricted to this relation.
    Chimân-ing n’guh pôz, I shall embark in the canoe; wakyigun n’guh izhâ,
    I shall go into the house, are perfectly correct, though somewhat
    formal expressions, when the canoe or the house are present to the
    speaker’s view.</p>

  <p>The meaning of these inflections has been restricted to <em>in</em>,
    <em>into</em>, <em>at</em>, and <em>on</em>. But they are the more
    appropriate forms of expressing the three first senses, there being
    other modes beside these of expressing the preposition <em>on</em>. These
    modes consist in the use of prepositions and will be explained under
    that head. The choice of the one, or the other, is, however, with the
    speaker. Generally, the inflection is employed, when there is some
    circumstance or condition of the noun, either concealed, or not fully
    apparent. Thus, Muzzinyigun-ing, is the appropriate term for <em>in the
    book</em>, and <em>may</em> also be used to signify <em>on the book</em>.
    But if it is meant only to signify <em>on</em> the book, something
    visible being referred to, the preposition <i>ogidj</i> would be used,
    that word indicating with certainty <em>on</em>, and never <em>in</em>.
    Wakyigun-ing indicates with clearness, <em>in the house</em>; but if it
    is necessary to say <em>on the house</em>, and it be meant at the same
    time to exclude any reference to the interior, the expression would be
    changed to <i>ogidj wakyigun</i>.</p>

  <p>It will be proper further to remark, in this place, in the way of
    limitation, that there is also a separate preposition signifying
    <em>in</em>. It is <i>pinj</i>. But the use of this word does not, in
    all cases, supersede the necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> of inflecting the noun. Thus
    the expression <i>pindigain</i>, is literally <em>walk in</em>, or
    enter. But if it is intended to say, walk in the house, the local,
    and not the simple form of house must be used; and the expression
    is—Pindigain waky´igun-ing, <em>Enter in the house</em>,—the verbal form
    which this preposition pinj puts on, having no allusion to the act of
    <em>walking</em>, but merely implying position.</p>

  <p>The local inflection, which in the above examples, is <i>ing</i> and
    <i>oong</i>, is further changed to <i>aing</i> and <i>eeng</i>, as
    the ear may direct—changes which are governed chiefly by the terminal
    vowel of the noun. Examples will best supply the rule, as well as the
    exceptions to it.</p>

  <p>An attentive inspection of these examples will show, that the
    local form pertains either to such nouns of the animate class, as
    are in their nature inanimates, or at most possessed of vegetable
    life. And here another conclusion presses upon us—that where these
    local terminations, in all their variety, are added to the names of
    animated beings, when such names are the nominatives of adjectives or
    adjective-nouns, these words are converted into terms of qualification,
    indicating <em>like</em>, <em>resembling</em>, <em>equal</em>. Thus,
    if we wish to say to a boy, he is like a man, the expression is,
    Inin-ing izzhinâgozzi; or if to a man, he is like a bear, Mukk-oong
    izzhinâgozzi; or to a bear, he is like a horse, Pabaizhikogâzh-ing
    izzhinâgozzi. In all these expressions the word <i>izzhi</i>, is
    combined with the pronominal inflection <i>â</i> (or nâ) and the
    animate termination <i>gozzi</i>. And the inflection of the nominative
    is merely an adjective correspondence with <i>izzhi</i>:—a term
    indicative of the general qualities of persons or animated beings.
    Where a comparison is instituted or a resemblance pointed out between
    inanimate instead of animate objects, the inflection <i>gozzi</i>,
    is changed to <i>gwud</i>, rendering the expression, which was,
    in the animate form, izzhinâ<i>gozzi</i>, in the inanimate form,
    izzhinâ<i>gwud</i>.</p>

  <p>There is another variation of the local form of the noun, in addition
    to those above instanced, indicative of locality in a more general
    sense. It is formed by <i>ong</i> or <i>nong</i>—frequent terminations
    in geographical names. Thus from Ojibwai, (Chippewa), is formed
    Ojibwai<i>nong</i>, Place of the Chippewas. From Wamittigozhiwug,
    Frenchmen, is formed Wamittigozhi<i>nong</i>, Place of Frenchmen. From
    Ishpatinâ hill, Ishpat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>inong, Place of the hill, &amp;c. The termination
    <i>ing</i>, is also sometimes employed in this more general sense, as
    in the following names of places.  </p>

  <div class="ml5">
    Monomonikân<i>ing</i>. In the place of wild rice.<br />
    Moninggwunikân<i>ing</i>. In the place of Sparrows<br />
    Ongwashagoosh<i>ing</i>. In the place of the fallen tree.&nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;c.
  </div>

  <p>2. The diminutive forms of the noun are indicated by ais, eas, ôs,
    and aus, as the final vowel of the word may require. Thus Ojibwai,
    a Chippewa, becomes Ojibw-ais, a little Chippewa: Iniṅ´i, a man,
    inin-ees, a little man: Amik, a beaver, amik-ôs, a young beaver: Ogimâ,
    a chief, ogim-âs, a little chief, or a chief of little authority.
    Further examples may be added.</p>

  <p>In the four last examples, the letter n, of the diminutive, retains its
    full sound.</p>

  <p>The use of diminutives has a tendency to give conciseness to the
    language. As far as they can be employed they supersede the use
    of adjectives, or prevent the repetition of them. And they enable
    the speaker to give a turn to the expression, which is often very
    successfully employed in producing ridicule or contempt. When applied
    to the tribes of animals, or to inorganic objects, their meaning,
    however, is, very nearly, limited to an inferiority in size or age.
    Thus, in the above examples, pizhik-ees, signifies a calf, omim-ees, a
    young pigeon, and ossin-ees, a pebble &amp;c. But inin-ees, and ogim-âs,
    are connected with the idea of mental or conventional as well as bodily
    inferiority.</p>

  <p>1. I saw a little chief, standing upon a small island, with an inferior
    medal about his neck.</p>

  <p>Ogimâs n’gi wâbumâ nibowid minnisainsing onâbikowân shoniâsun.</p>

  <p>2. Yamoyden threw at a young pigeon.</p>

  <p>Ogi pukkitalwun omimeesun Yamoyden.</p>

  <p>3. A buffalo calf stood in a small stream.</p>

  <p>Pizhikees ki nibowi sibeesing.</p>

  <p>4. The little man fired at a young moose.</p>

  <p>Ininees ogi pâshkizwân môzôsun.</p>

  <p>5. Several diminutive looking bass were lying in a small bowl, upon a
    small table.</p>

  <p>Addôpowinaising attai onâgâns abbiwâd ogâsug.</p>

  <p>Some of these sentences afford instances of the use, at the same
    time, of both the local and diminutive inflections. Thus the word
    minnisainsing, signifies literally, <em>in the little island</em>;
    seebees ing, <em>in the little stream</em>; addôpowinais ing, <em>on the
    small table</em>.</p>

  <p>3. The preceeding forms are not the only ones by which adjective
    qualities are conferred upon the substantive. The syllable <i>ish</i>
    when added to a noun indicates a bad or dreaded quality, or conveys
    the idea of imperfection or decay. The sound of this inflection is
    sometimes changed to eesh oosh, or aush. Thus, Chimân, a canoe, becomes
    Chimânish, a bad canoe; Ekwai, a woman, Ekwaiwish, a bad woman; nibi,
    water, becomes nibeesh, turbid or strong water; mittig, a tree, becomes
    mittigoosh, a decayed tree; akkik, a kettle, akkikoosh, a worn-out
    kettle. By a further change, wibid, a tooth, becomes wibid<i>âsh</i>,
    a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> decayed or aching tooth, &amp;c. Throughout these changes the final
    sound of <i>sh</i> is retained, so that this sound alone, at the end of
    a word, is indicative of a faulty quality.</p>

  <p>In a language in which the expressions bad-dog, and faint-heart
    are the superlative terms of reproach, and in which there are few
    words to indicate the modifications between positively good, and
    positively bad, it must appear evident, that adjective inflections
    of this kind, must be convenient, and sometimes necessary modes of
    expression. They furnish a means of conveying censure and dislike,
    which though often mild, is sometimes severe. Thus if one person has
    had occasion to refuse the offered hand of another—for it must be borne
    in mind, that the Indians are a hand-shaking people, as well as the
    Europeans—the implacable party has it at his option in referring to the
    circumstance, to use the adjective form of hand, not <i>onindj</i>, but
    oninj<i>eesh</i>, which would be deemed contemptuous in a high degree.
    So also, instead of odâwai winini, a trader, or man who sells, the
    word may be changed to odâwai winini-<i>wish</i>, implying a bad or
    dishonest trader. It is seldom that a more pointed, or positive mode
    of expressing personal disapprobation or dislike is required, for,
    generally speaking, more is implied by these modes than is actually
    expressed.</p>

  <p>The following examples are drawn from the inorganic as well as organic
    creation, embracing the two classes of nouns that the operation of
    these forms may be fully perceived.</p>

  <p>These forms cannot be said, strictly, to be without analogy in
    the English, in which the limited number of words terminating in
    <i>ish</i>, as saltish, blackish, furnish a correspondence in sound,
    with the first adjective form.</p>

  <p>It may subserve the purposes of generalization to add, as the result of
    the foregoing inquiries, that substantives have a diminutive form, made
    in ais, ees, ôs, or âs; a derogative form, made in ish, eesh, oosh, or
    âsh; and a local form, made in aing, eeng, ing, or oong. By a principle
    of accretion, the second, or third, may be added to the first form, and
    the third to the second.</p>

  <p>4. More attention has, perhaps, been bestowed upon these points, than
    their importance demanded, but in giving anything like a comprehensive
    sketch of the substantive, they could not be omitted; and if mentioned
    at all, it became necessary to pursue them through their various
    changes and limitations. Another reason has presented itself. In
    treating of an unwritten language of which others are to judge chiefly
    from examples, it appeared desirable that the positions advanced
    should be accompanied by the data upon which they respectively rest—at
    least, by so much of the data employed, as to enable philologists to
    appreciate the justice or detect the fallacy of our conclusions. To the
    few, who take any interest in the subject at all, minuteness will not
    seem tedious, and the examples will be regarded with deep interest.</p>

  <p>As much of our time as we have already devoted to these lesser points
    of inquiry, it will be necessary, at this place, to point out other
    inflections and modifications of the substantive, to clear it from
    obscurities, that we may go into the discussion of the other parts of
    speech, unencumbered.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

  <p>Of these remaining forms, none is more interesting than that, which
    enables the speaker by a simple inflection, to denote that the
    individual named has ceased to exist. This delicate mode of conveying
    melancholy intelligence, or alluding to the dead, is effected by
    placing the object in the past tense.</p>

  <p>Aiekid-ôpun aieko Garrangula-bun.</p>

  <p>So the deceased Garrangula spoke.</p>

  <p>The syllable <i>bun</i>, in this sentence, added to the noun, and
    <i>ôpun</i> added to the verb, place both in the past tense. And
    although the death of the Indian orator is not mentioned, that fact
    would be invariably inferred.  </p>

  <p>Names which do not terminate in a vowel sound, require a vowel prefixed
    to the tensal inflection, rendering it <i>ôbun</i>, or <i>ebun</i>.
    Inanimate, as well as animate nouns take these inflections.</p>

  <p>5. Sexual nouns. The mode of indicating the masculine and feminine,
    having been omitted in the preceding lecture, as not being essential to
    any concordance with the verb or adjective, is nevertheless connected
    with a striking peculiarity of the language—the exclusive use of
    certain words by one or the other sex. After having appeared to the
    founders of the language, a distinction not necessary to be engrafted
    in the syntax, there are yet a limited number of words, to which the
    idea of sex, so strongly attaches, that it would be deemed the height
    of impropriety in a female to use the masculine, and in male to use the
    feminine expressions.</p>

  <p>Of this nature are the words <i>Neeji</i>, and <i>Nindongwai</i>, both
    signifying my friend, but the former is appropriated to males, and
    the latter to females. A Chippewa cannot therefore say to a female my
    friend, nor a Chippewa woman to a male, my friend. Such an interchange
    of the terms would imply arrogance or indelicacy. Nearly the whole of
    their interjections—and they are numerous—are also thus exclusively
    appropriated; and no greater breach of propriety in speech could
    be committed, than a woman’s uttering the masculine exclamation of
    surprise <i>Tyâ!</i> or a man’s descending to the corresponding female
    interjection <i>N’yâ!</i></p>

  <p>The word <i>neenimoshai</i>, my cousin, on the contrary, can only
    be applied, like husband and wife, by a male to a female, or a
    female to a male. If a male wishes to express this relation of a
    male, the term is <i>Neetowis</i>: and the corresponding female term
    <i>Neendongwooshai</i>.  </p>

  <p>The terms for uncle and aunt, are also of a two-fold character, though
    not restricted like the preceding in their use. Neemishomai is my
    uncle by the father’s side: Neezhishai, my uncle by the mother’s side.
    Neezigwoos is my paternal aunt, neewishai my maternal aunt.</p>

  <p>There are also exclusive words to designate elder brother, and younger
    brother: But what would not be expected after the foregoing examples,
    they are indiscriminately applied to younger brothers and sisters.
    Neesgai, is my elder brother, and neemissai my elder sister. Neeshemai,
    my younger brother, or younger sister, and may be applied to any
    brother or sister except the eldest.</p>

  <p>The number of words to which the idea of sex is attached, in the usual
    acceptation, is limited. The following may be enumerated.</p>

  <p>6. Reciprocal changes of the noun. The pronominal particles with which
    verbs as well as substantives, are generally encumbered and the habit
    of using them in particular and restricted senses, leaves but little
    occasion for the employment of either the present or past infinitive.
    Most verbs are transitives. A Chippewa does not say, I love, without
    indicating, by an inflection of the verb, the object beloved; and thus
    the expression is constantly, I love him, or her, &amp;c. Neither does the
    infinitive appear to be generally the ultimate form of the verb.</p>

  <p>In changing their nouns into verbs, it will not therefore be expected,
    that the change should uniformly result in the infinitive, for which
    there is so little use; but in such of the personal forms of the
    various moods as circumstances may require. Most commonly the third
    person singular of the indicative, and the second person singular of
    the imperative, are the simplest aspects under which the verb appears;
    and hence these forms have been sometimes mistaken for, and reported
    as the present infinitive. There are some instances, in which the
    infinitive is employed. Thus, although an Indian cannot say, I love,
    thou lovest, &amp;c. without employing the objective forms of the verb
    to love: yet he can say I laugh, I cry, &amp;c. expressions in which the
    action being confined to the speaker himself, there is no transition
    demanded. And in all similar instances the present infinitive, with the
    proper pronoun prefixed, is employed.</p>

  <p>There are several modes of transforming a substantive into a verb. The
    following examples will supply the rules, so far as known, which govern
    these changes.</p>

    These changes are reciprocated by the verb, which, as often as occasion
    requires, is made to put on a substantive form. The particle <i>win</i>

  <p>In order to place the substantives thus formed, in the third person,
    corresponding with the indicative from which they were changed, it is
    necessary only to prefix the proper pronoun. Thus, Ogeezhaiwâdizziwin,
    his generosity, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>7. Compound substantives. The preceding examples have been given
    promiscuously from the various classes of words, primitive and
    derivative, simple and compound. Some of these words express but
    a single idea, as, ôs, father—gah, mother—môz, a moose—kâg, a
    porcupine—mang, a loon—and appear to be incapable of further division.
    All such words may be considered as primitives, although some of them
    may be contractions of dissyllabic words. There are also a number
    of dissyllables, and <em>possibly</em> some trisyllables, which, in
    the present state of our analytical knowledge of the language, may
    be deemed both simple and primitive. Such are neebi, water; ossin,
    a stone; geezis, the sun; nodin, wind. But it may be premised, as
    a principle which our investigations have rendered probable, that
    all polysyllabic words, all words of three syllables, <em>so far as
    examined</em>, and most words of two syllables, are compounds.</p>

  <p>The application of a syntax, formed with a view to facilitate the rapid
    conveyance of ideas by consolidation, may, it is presumable, have early
    led to the coalescence of words, by which all the relations of object
    and action, time and person, were expressed. And in a language which
    is only spoken, and not written, the primitives would soon become
    obscured and lost in the multiform appendages of time and person,
    and the recondite connexion of actor and object. And this process of
    amalgamation would be a progressive one. The terms that sufficed in
    the condition of the simplest state of nature, or in a given latitude,
    would vary with their varying habits, institutions and migrations. The
    introduction of new objects and new ideas would require the invention
    of new words, or what is much more probable, existing terms would be
    modi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>fied or compounded to suit the occasion. No one who has paid much
    attention to the subject, can have escaped noticing a confirmation
    of this opinion, in the extreme readiness of our western Indians to
    bestow, on the instant, names, and appropriate names—to any new object
    presented to them. A readiness not attributable to their having at
    command a stock of generic polysyllables—for these it would be very
    awkward to wield—but as appears more probable, to the powers of the
    syntax, which permits the resolution of new compounds from existing
    roots, and often concentrates, as remarked in another place, the entire
    sense of the parent words, upon a single syllable, and sometimes upon a
    single letter.</p>

  <p>Thus it is evident that the Chippewas possessed names for a living tree
    <i>mittig</i>, and a string <i>aiâb</i>, before they named the bow
    <i>mittigwâb</i>,—the latter being compounded under one of the simplest
    rules from the two former. It is further manifest that they had named
    earth <i>akki</i>, and (any solid, stony or metallic mass) <i>âbik</i>,
    before they bestowed an appellation upon the kettle, <i>akkeek</i>, or
    <i>akkik</i>, the latter being derivatives from the former. In process
    of time these compounds became the bases of other compounds, and thus
    the language became loaded with double and triple, and quadruple
    compounds, concrete in their meaning and formal in their utterance.</p>

  <p>When the introduction of the metals took place, it became necessary
    to distinguish the clay from the iron pot, and the iron, from the
    copper kettle. The original compound, <i>akkeek</i>, retained its
    first meaning, admitting the adjective noun <i>piwâbik</i> (itself
    a compound) iron, when applied to a vessel of that kind, piwâbik
    akkeek, iron kettle. But a new combination took place to designate
    the copper kettle, <i>miskwâkeek</i>, red-metal kettle; and another
    expression to denote the brass kettle, <i>ozawâbik akkeek</i>, yellow
    metal kettle. The former is made up from miskôwâbik, copper (literally
    <i>red-metal</i>—from miskwâ, red, and <i>âbik</i>, the generic
    above mentioned) and <i>akkeek</i>, kettle. Ozawâbik, brass, is from
    <i>ozawâ</i> yellow, and the generic <i>âbek</i>—the term akkeek, being
    added in its separate form. It may, however, be used in its connected
    form of wukkeek, making the compound expression <i>ozawâbik wukkeek</i>.</p>

  <p>In naming the horse paibâizhikôgazhi, i.&nbsp;e. the animal with solid
    hoofs, they have seized upon the feature which most strikingly
    distinguished the horse, from the cleft-footed animals which were
    the only species known to them at the period of the discovery. And
    the word itself affords an example, at once, both of their powers of
    concentration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> and brief, yet accurate description, which it may
    be worth while to analyse. Paizhik, is one, and is also used as the
    indefinite article—the only article the language possesses. This
    word is further used in an adjective sense, figuratively indicating,
    united, solid, undivided. And it acquires a plural signification by
    doubling, or repeating the first syllable, with a slight variation of
    the second. Thus, Pai-baizhik, denotes not <em>one</em>, or <em>an</em>,
    but several; and when thus used in the context, renders the noun
    governed, plural. Oskuzh, is the nail, claw, or horny part of the foot
    of beasts, and supplies the first substantive member of the compound
    <i>gauzh</i>. The final vowel is from <i>akwaisi</i>, a beast; and the
    marked o, an inseparable connective, the office of which is to make
    the two members coalesce, and harmonize. The expression thus formed
    becomes a substantive, specific in its application. It may be rendered
    plural like the primitive nouns, may be converted into a verb, has its
    diminutive, derogative and local form, and in short, is subject to all
    the modifications of other substantives.</p>

  <p>Most of the modern nouns are of this complex character. And they
    appear to have been invented to designate objects, many of which were
    necessarily unknown to the Indians in the primitive ages of their
    existence. Others, like their names for a copper-kettle and a horse,
    above mentioned, can date their origin no farther back than the period
    of the discovery. Of this number of nascent words, are most of their
    names for those distilled or artificial liquors, for which they are
    indebted to Europeans. Their name for water, <i>neebi</i>, for the
    fat of animals, <i>weenin</i>, for oil or grease, <i>pimmidai</i>,
    for broth, <i>nâbôb</i>, and for blood, <i>miskwi</i>, belong to a
    very remote era, although all but the first appear to be compounds.
    Their names for the tinctures or extracts derived from the forest, and
    used as dyes, or medicines, or merely as agreeable drinks, are mostly
    founded upon the basis of the word <i>âbo</i>, a liquid, although this
    word is never used alone. Thus—</p>

  <p>In like manner their names for the various implements and utensils of
    civilized life, are based upon the word <i>Jeegun</i>, one of those
    primitives, which, although never disjunctively used, denotes, in its
    modi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>fied forms, the various senses implied by our words instrument,
    contrivance, machine, &amp;c. And by prefixing to this generic, a
    substantive, verb, or adjective, or parts of one or each, an entire new
    class of words is formed. In these combinations, the vowels e, and o,
    are sometimes used as connectives.</p>

  <p>An interesting class of substantives is derived from the third person
    singular of the present indicative of the verb, by changing the
    vowel sound of the first syllable, and adding the letter d to that
    of the last, making the terminations in aid, âd, eed, id, ood. Thus,
    Pimmoossâ, he walks, becomes pâmoossâd, a walker.</p>

  <p>This class of words is rendered plural in ig,—a termination, which,
    after d final in the singular, has a soft pronunciation, as if written
    <i>jig</i>. Thus, Nâmid, a dancer, nâmidjig, dancers.</p>

  <p>The derogative form is given to these generic substantives by
    introducing ish, or simply sh, in place of the d, and changing the
    latter to <i>kid</i>, making the terminations in ai, aishkid, in
    â, âshkid, in e, eeshkid, in i, ishkid, and in oo, ooshkid. Thus,
    naindowainjeegaid, a hunter, is changed to naindowainjeegaishkid, a bad
    or unprofitable hunter. Naibâd, a sleeper, is changed to naibâshkid, a
    sluggard. Jossakeed, a juggler, to jossakeeshkid, a vicious juggler.
    Wâsinnid, an eater, to wâssinishkid, a gormandizer. Kâgidood, a
    speaker, kâgidooshkid, a babbler. And in these cases the plural is
    added to the last educed form, making kâgidooshkidjig, babblers, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

  <p>The word nittâ, on the contrary, prefixed to these expressions, renders
    them complimentary. For instance, nittâ naigumood, is a fine singer,
    nittâ kâgidood, a ready speaker, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Flexible as the substantive has been shown to be, there are other forms
    of combination that have not been adverted to—forms, by which it is
    made to coalesce with the verb, the adjective, and the preposition,
    producing a numerous class of compound expressions. But it is deemed
    most proper to defer the discussion of these forms to their several
    appropriate heads.</p>

  <p>Enough has been exhibited to demonstrate its prominent grammatical
    rules. It is not only apparent that the substantive possesses number,
    and gender, but it also undergoes peculiar modifications to express
    locality and diminution, to denote adjective qualities and to indicate
    tense. It exhibits some curious traits connected with the mode of
    denoting the masculine and feminine. It is modified to express person
    and to distinguish living from inanimate masses. It is rendered
    possessive by a peculiar inflection, and provides particles, under the
    shape either of prefixes or suffixes, separable or inseparable, by
    which the actor is distinguished from the object—and all this, without
    changing its proper substantive character, without putting on the
    aspect of a pseudo adjective, or a pseudo verb. Its changes to produce
    compounds, are, however, its most interesting, its most characteristic
    trait. Syllable is heaped upon syllable, word upon word, and derivative
    upon derivative, until its vocabulary is crowded with long and pompous
    phrases, most formidable to the eye.</p>

  <p>So completely transpositive do the words appear, that like chessmen on
    a board, their elementary syllables can be changed at the will of the
    player, to form new combinations to meet new contingencies, so long
    as they are changed in accordance with certain general principles and
    conventional rules; in the application of which, however, much depends
    upon the will or the skill of the player. What is most surprising—all
    these changes and combinations, all these qualifications of the object,
    and distinctions of the person, the time, and the place, do not
    supersede the use of adjectives, and pronouns, and verbs, and other
    parts of speech woven into the texture of the noun, in their elementary
    and disjunctive forms.</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I hasten to inform you that I yesterday returned from
      my expedition to the northwest. On reaching the Mississippi I found
      the state of the water favorable for ascending. No difficulty was
      experienced in reaching the highest point, to which this stream has
      hitherto been explored. At this point, I procured canoes of the
      smallest class, and ascended, with Indian guides, to its actual source
      in Itasca Lake.</p>

    <p>Upwards of two thousand Chippewas have been met in council, in
      their villages, or in detached parties on the way. At every point,
      vaccinations have been made, under the authority of the act of the
      last session of Congress. No opportunity has been omitted to enforce
      the objects of the instructions respecting their hostilities with each
      other, and to point out and make clear to their comprehension, their
      true relation to the United States. The efforts made to procure the
      assent of the Chippewas to the advice given them on this head, were
      stated to the Sioux in a council to which I invited them at the Agency
      of St. Peter’s.</p>

    <p>The acquisition of data respecting the trade and population, and the
      geographical distribution of the bands, has been, with other details,
      resulting from my instructions, at all times, kept in view. I shall
      devote the earliest attention I can spare from the accumulated duties
      of the office, in drawing up a detailed report.</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to inform you that I returned from
      my visit to the Chippewa bands on the Upper Mississippi, yesterday
      evening. The state of feeling among them, partakes of the excitement
      growing out of a knowledge of the disturbances existing near their
      southern boundary. But their friendly position with respect to the
      United States, is not altered by events, thus far. Such of them as
      had received invitations to join in the Sauc league, have refused
      their assent. And notwithstanding the complacency with which some
      of the bands regard the hostile efforts of a people, with whom they
      are connected by the ties of language, and the decided preference
      others feel, and have expressed, for the counsels and government of
      Great Britain, as exercised in the Canadas, I feel a confidence in
      pronouncing the nation, as a whole, uncommitted in any negotiations
      with the hostile Indians, and satisfied to remain in their present
      pacific attitude. Several of their most influential chiefs are quite
      decided in this policy, and would view it as foolish and desperate in
      the extreme, to entertain propositions to give aid to the enemy.</p>

    <p>The only portion of them, of whom there were reasons to apprehend
      hostilities, are the villages of Torch Lake, comprising the Chippewa
      population on the heads of the Wisconsin, Ontonagon, and Chippewa
      rivers. These bands murdered four of our citizens at Lake Pepin, in
      the spring of 1824. Several of the persons implicated were imprisoned
      at Mackinac, whence they escaped. And it has not been practicable to
      carry into effect the measures of punishment, which were determined
      on. Their position, on the head waters of remote streams, is an almost
      inaccessible one, and the offence has ceased to be the subject of any
      further efforts by the Department. They have never, however, been
      relieved from the fears entertained on this account, and these fears
      have confined them very much to their particular villages and hunting
      grounds.</p>

    <p>A war message was transmitted to the Torch Lake (or du Flambeau)
      Indians by the Black Hawk, or his counsellors, in 1830. This message
      was repeated in 1831, and again in 1832. They were re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>minded by it,
      of their affinity by blood, their ancient alliance, and their being
      arrayed as common enemies of the Sioux. It was addressed to the
      whole Chippewa nation, and they were invited to take up arms. It is
      not known that this message has been accepted. The recent death of
      Mozobodo, their first chief, and a man of understanding, has diminished
      my confidence in his band. It has been stated to me, very lately,
      by neighboring chiefs, that the Lac du Flambeau Indians were not in
      alliance with the malcontent tribes. That section of country has not
      been within the track of my recent journey. I have seen and conversed
      with some of the Indians, including one of the minor chiefs. Little, or
      no definite information has, however, been obtained.</p>

    <p>I feel convinced that should the Black Hawk pursue his flight thither,
      he would, from obvious circumstances, be received with, at least,
      negative friendship. He would be allowed to recruit his followers and
      succor himself upon their hunting grounds towards the Mississippi
      borders, where there is a comparative abundance of deer and elk. And it
      is not improbable that some of the young men would follow his fortunes.
      I think, however, the policy of Black Hawk has been to bend his course
      westward after passing the Wisconsin, with the view of crossing the
      Mississippi, at some point where this stream is wide and shallow, (say
      between the Painted Rock and Lake Pepin,) and withdrawing to the plains
      of the Des Moines, where he has resources.</p>

    <p>I have found the Chippewas, generally, not inclined to be communicative
      on the subject of the disturbances. But in cases where information
      has been obtained, it evinces a full knowledge of passing events.
      Kabamappa, a decidedly friendly and respectable chief of the St. Croix,
      informed me that the league consisted originally of nine tribes. I
      requested him to name them. He commenced by mentioning Saucs, Foxes,
      and Iowas, and added cautiously, and with a pause that allowed
      him to double down a finger at each count, Kickapoos, Flatheads,
      Earthlodges,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Pottawattomies, Winnebagoes, and after some inquiry of
      the interpreter, Osages. Another Indian met on Lake Superior, said that
      the hostile Indians claimed to have killed 200 persons, since the war
      commenced.</p>

    <p>Evidence has been furnished to me, that the Saucs who appear to be
      the principals, have taken much pains to form a league against the
      government,—that several tribes have assented to it, who have not
      boldly joined his standard, and that information favorable to their
      success, has been rapidly spread by them, among the northern Indians.
      This infor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>mation they are prone to credit. Even the Sioux, whom I met
      in council at St. Peter’s, on the 25th of July, have been accused of
      being lukewarm in the contest, and rather favoring, than opposed to
      their active enemies. This, the Petite Corbeau, their venerable chief,
      pointedly denied. He said the insinuation was untrue—that the Sioux,
      who went to the theatre of the war, had not returned from friendly
      feelings to the Saucs; and that they stood ready to go again, if
      officially called on.</p>

    <p>The British band of Chippewas near this place were formally invited to
      unite in the war. A painted war club and pipe accompanied the message.
      It was transmitted by the Saucs, and given, by one of their emissaries
      to one of the northern Chippewas at Penetanguishine. It was received
      here (St. Mary’s) by the Little Pine, (alias Lavoire Bart) a chief
      who co-operated with Tecumseh, in the late war, by leading a party
      of warriors from this quarter. He determined not to accept it, and
      communicated the fact to me in January last. He said the message was
      very equivocal. It invited him to aid them in fighting their enemies.
      He said he did not know whether the Sioux or Americans were intended.</p>

    <p>Visits from the Indians within our lines to the British posts in Upper
      Canada, continue to be made. The Ottawas of L’arbre Croche, and the
      British band of the Chippewas of Lapointe, Lake Superior, have made
      their usual journey to Penetanguishine, during the present season. More
      than the ordinary numbers from this vicinity, have joined them.</p>

    <p class="clear"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

    <p>In obedience to such parts of the instructions of the third of May
      last directing me to proceed to the country on the heads of the
      Mississippi, as relates to the Indian population, and to the condition
      of the fur trade, I have the honor herewith to enclose a series of
      statistical tables which exhibit the geographical distribution of the
      lands, the name of each village or permanent encampment, its course
      and distance from the seat of the agency, the number of men, women and
      children, expressed in separate columns, the number of the mixed blood
      population, and the total population of districts. Also, the names and
      position of the trading posts established under the act of Congress of
      May 26th, 1824, the number and names of the clerks, and the number of
      interpreters and boatmen employed in the trade under licences from the
      Indian office, the amount of goods bonded for, agreeably to duplicates
      of the invoices on file, together with an estimate of the capital
      vested in boats and provisions, or paid out in men’s wages, and an
      estimate of the returns in furs and peltries, based on the outfits of 1832.</p>

    <p>An examination of these tables will shew, that the entire Indian, mixed
      and trader population, embraced within the consolidated agency of St.
      Mary’s and Michilimackinac, is 14,279, of which number 12,467 are
      Chippewas and Ottawas, 1553 persons of the mixed blood, and 259 persons
      of every description engaged in the fur trade. That this popu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>lation is
      distributed in 89 principal villages, or fixed encampments, extending
      by the route of Lakes Huron and Superior, through the region of the
      Upper Mississippi, to Pembina on Red River. That 302 of the whole
      number live in temporary encampments, or rather, migrate, along the
      bleak shores of Lake Huron west of the 2nd, or Boundary Line Detour;
      436 occupy the American side of the straits and river St. Mary’s; 1006
      are located on the southern shores of Lake Superior between the Sault
      of St. Mary’s and Fond du Lac; 1855 on the extreme Upper Mississippi,
      between Little Soc River, and the actual source of this stream in
      Itasca Lake; 476 on the American side of the Old Grand Portage, to
      the Lake of the Woods; 1174 on Red River of the North; 895 on the
      River St. Croix of the Mississippi; 1376 on the Chippewa River and
      its tributaries, including the villages of Lac du Flambeau and Ottawa
      Lake; 342 on the heads of the Wisconsin and Monominee rivers; 210 on
      the northern curve of Green Bay; 274 on the north-western shores of Lake
      Michigan between the entrance of Green Bay, and the termination of the
      straits of Michilimackinac, at Point St. Ignace; and 5,674, within the
      peninsula of Michigan, so far as the same is embraced within the limits
      of the Agency. The latter number covers an estimate of the Ottawa and
      Chippewa population indiscriminately.</p>

    <p>For the accommodation of these bands, there have been established
      thirty-five principal trading posts, exclusive of temporary trading
      stations, occupied only in seasons of scarcity. These posts are
      distributed over six degrees of latitude, and sixteen degrees of
      longitude, and embrace a larger area of square miles, than all the
      states of central Europe. Much of it is covered with water, and such
      are the number and continuity of its lakes, large and small, that it
      is probable that this feature, constitutes by far, its most striking
      peculiarity. Its productions are fish, wild rice, and game. But such
      are the precariousness and dispersion of the supply as to keep the
      whole population of men, women, and children, in perpetual vacillation,
      in its search. The time devoted in these migrations, is out of all
      proportion, to the results obtained by agriculture, or by any other
      stated mode of subsistence. And the supply is after all, inadequate.
      Seasons of scarcity and want are the ordinary occurrences of every
      year; and a mere subsistence is the best state of things that is looked for.</p>

    <p>Traders visit them annually with outfits of goods and provisions, to
      purchase the furs and peltries, which are gleaned in their periodical
      mi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>grations. These persons purchase their outfits from capitalists
      resident on the frontiers, and make their payments during the spring or
      summer succeeding the purchase. They employ men who are acquainted with
      the difficulties of the route, and with the character and resources of
      the people amongst whom they are to reside. These men act as boatmen
      and canoe-men on the outward and inward voyage; they erect the wintering
      houses, chop wood, fish, cook for the <i>bourgois</i>, and are employed
      on <i>durwin</i>, or as runners during the hunting season. Much of
      the success of a trading adventure depends on their efficiency and
      faithfulness.</p>

    <p>In the prosecution of this trade, the laws which have been prescribed
      by Congress for its regulation, are substantially observed. I am of
      opinion, however, that more efficiency would be given to the system,
      if a general revision of all the acts pertaining to this subject, were
      made. A legislation of thirty years, some of it necessarily of a hasty
      character, has multiplied the acts, which it is made the duty of Indian
      Agents to enforce, and the number of clauses which are repealed and
      modified, leave the original acts mutilated, and they do not, present
      as a whole, that clearness of intent, which is essential to their due
      and prompt execution. Some of the provisions have become obsolete;
      others are defective. A thorough and careful digest of the entire
      code, including the permanent treaty provisions, would present the
      opportunity for consolidation and amendment, and while leaving the laws
      easier of execution, adapt them more exactly to the present condition
      of the Indians, and to a just supervision of the trade.</p>

    <p>The unconditional repeal by Congress, of every former provision
      relating to the introduction of ardent spirits, is a subject of
      felicitation to the friends of humanity. Of all the acts which it
      was in the power of the government to perform, this promises, in
      my opinion, to produce the most beneficial effects on the moral
      condition of the north-western tribes: And its enforcement is an
      object of the highest moral achievement. My recent visit, as well
      as former opportunities of remark, has afforded full proofs of the
      entire uselessness of ardent spirits as an article of traffic with the
      Indians, and I beg leave to add my voice, to the thousands which are
      audible on this subject, that the government may put into requisition
      every practicable means to carry into effect the act.</p>

  </div>

  <p>(<a id="Note_A"><i>A</i></a>) Michilimackinac is the seat of justice for Mackinac county,
    Michigan Territory, is 300 miles NW. of Detroit, has a U. S. circuit
    court, a population of 1053, by the census of 1830, has a military
    post, an Indian agency, a collector’s office, a flourishing missionary
    school, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_B"><i>B</i></a>) This river enters the head of Muddy Lake, and is partly the
    boundary between Michilimackinac and Chippewa counties.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_C"><i>C</i></a>) This is a tributary of the south branch of the St. Mary’s,
    and is much resorted to by the Indians in their periodical fishing and
    hunting excursions.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_D"><i>D</i></a>) Indian gardens at this place, two miles below St. Mary’s.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_E"><i>E</i></a>) This place is the site of Fort Brady, is ten miles below the
    foot of Lake Superior, and ninety by water NW. of Mackinac. The Indian
    Agency of Vincennes, Indiana, was removed to this place, in 1822, and
    consolidated with the agency of Mackinac, in 1832. It is the seat of
    justice for Chippewa county, M. T. and has a population, by the census
    of 1830, of 918.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_F"></a><i>F</i>) The trading post, at this place, is occupied as a fishing
    station, during the autumn, by persons who proceed with boats and nets,
    from St. Mary’s. Bonds are taken by the Indian Office, and licences
    granted in the usual manner, as a precaution against the introduction
    of ardent spirits.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_G"><i>G</i></a>) It is thirty leagues from Keweena Post to Ontonagon, by the
    most direct water route, but seventy-five leagues around the peninsula.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_H"><i>H</i></a>) The population enumerated at this post, includes the
    villages of Ocogib, Lake Vieux Desert, Iron River and Petite Peche Bay.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_I"><i>I</i></a>) The Chippewas of La Point have their gardens on this river,
    and reside here periodically. This is a good fishing station. A mission
    family has recently been located here.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_K"><i>K</i></a>) This is the most western bay of Lake Superior.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_L"><i>L</i></a>) Replaces the post of the Isle des Corbeau, which is
    abolished.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_M"></a><i>M</i>) The route of Rainy Lake, begins at the post on this lake,
    which is an expansion of the channel of the Mississippi, about ten
    miles across. Clear water and yields fish.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_N"><i>N</i></a>) This lake has been so named in honor of the present
    Secretary of War, who terminated his exploratory journey there, in 1820.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_O"><i>O</i></a>) Itasca Lake is the actual source of the Mississippi, as
    determined by myself, in the expedition, which furnishes occasion for
    this report.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_P"><i>P</i></a>) This is a very large expanse of water, clear and pure in its
    character, and yields fine white fish. It was deemed the head of the
    Mississippi by Pike, who visited it in the winter of 1806, but it is
    not even <i>one</i> of the sources, as it has several large tributaries.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_Q"><i>Q</i></a>) Named Rum River by Carver, but called <i>spirit</i> river by
    the Indians, not using this word in a physical sense.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_R"><i>R</i></a>) This route from Old Grand Portage to the Lake of the Woods,
    is chiefly used by the British traders, and the gentlemen connected
    with the Hudson’s Bay government; but has fallen into comparative
    disuse, as a grand channel of traders since the introduction of goods
    direct from England into the Hudson Bay.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_S"><i>S</i></a>) The estimate of population at Pembina, includes all who
    are believed to be south of latitude 49 deg. and therefore within the
    limits of the United States.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_T"><i>T</i></a>) Embraces all the population of the Fork of St. Croix,
    connected by a portage with the Brulé River of Lake Superior.</p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_U"><i>U</i></a>) The Indians on these streams, rely much on wild rice. Their
    encampments are temporary. They come into contact with the Winnebagoes
    and Monomonees, who are their neighbors on the south.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

  <p>(<a id="Note_V"><i>V</i></a>) The Indian population of the peninsula of Michigan, consists
    of Ottawas, Chippewas and Pottawattomies, who are not widely separated
    by language and habits. The Ottawas are however the most agricultural.
    No Pottawattomies are included in the estimate, and only that portion
    of Ottawas and Chippewas living north of Grand River, and northwest of
    Sagana, as the limits of the Mackinac and St. Mary’s joint agency, do
    not extend south of these places.</p>

  <p><span class="xxlarge lh1 va1">☞</span> <span class="smcap">The</span> data respecting the fur trade, in the schedules,

    operate. They also exclude any amount of trade that may have been
    carried on, by the white inhabitants of Red River settlement, who may
    be located south of the national boundary on the north, as this place
    is too remote to have been heretofore brought under the cognizance of

    <p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

    <p>The condition of the Indians, situated in the area of country traversed
      by the St. Croix and Chippewa Rivers, has not essentially varied
      since the date of the report, which I had the honor to address to the
      Department, on the 22nd of September, 1831.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I beg leave now to
      solicit your attention to the observations made during my recent visit
      to the bands living northwest of that point in our geography.</p>

    <p>From a very early period, war has existed between the Chippewas and
      Sioux, and although the condition of independent bands, separated by
      local position and local interests, has produced internal discord among
      themselves, they have united as nations, in defending their respective
      frontiers, and have not hesitated to make inroads, into the hunting
      grounds of each other, whenever circumstances have favored them.</p>

    <p>The Chippewas assert, that their warfare has been one of self defence,
      and that their inroads have been the inevitable consequence of the
      determination to maintain their territorial rights. The Sioux complain
      that their hunting grounds have been intruded on, and that they cannot
      restrain their warriors. Each party lays claim to forbearance and
      generosity. Neither appears to omit any opportunity of inflicting
      injury on the other. Every blow is a fresh invitation to aggression. A
      state of perpetual insecurity and alarm is the consequence. Time has
      exasperated their feelings. And much of the severity of their present
      condition, is directly owing to the pertinacity with which the contest
      has been kept up.</p>

    <p>In this state, the Chippewas, who are particularly the object of this
      report, were found by our government in 1806, who had, the year before,
      directed the late General Pike, to visit the Upper Mississippi. Owing
      to their remote position, little attention was, however, bestowed
      upon them till the summer of 1820, when the present Secretary of
      War, who then administered the government of Michigan, conducted an
      expedition through the country. By his recommendation a military post
      and agency were established on the avenue of their trade, at the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>foot
      of Lake Superior, and the usual means adopted to regulate the trade
      and intercourse of our citizens with them. They were counselled to
      remain at peace, to intermit their visits to the Canadian posts, and to
      pursue their usual occupations on their own lands. It was immediately
      found, however, that the force of their hostilities fell upon their
      western frontiers, where they border on the Sioux, and where the
      dispute respecting territorial boundaries gave scope to continual and
      afflicting aggressions.</p>

    <p>In 1825 the Chippewas were invited to meet the other tribes in a
      general council at Prairie du Chien, which, after a full discussion,
      resulted in a treaty of territorial limits. This treaty was fully
      assented to, by the northern Chippewas convened at the treaty of
      Fond du Lac in 1826. The following year, deputations of this nation
      attended, and became one of the parties at the treaty of Bude des
      Morts. At this treaty the subject of boundaries was finally carried and
      adjusted between themselves and the Monomonees and the Winnebagoes.
      With the latter tribes there has been no subsequent controversy
      respecting limits. But the delineation on paper of the extensive line
      between them and the Sioux, without an actual survey and marking of
      it, gave rise to further difficulties. What could not be plainly seen,
      might be easily disputed, and the pretext was thus given for renewed
      aggressions. Several instances of this have constituted the subject of
      specific reports to the Department. The hardships of a people destitute
      of resources, were not only thus increased, but those of our citizens
      who had been licensed to trade among them complained of losses and want
      of protection. Many of the Indians, and several of the traders fell,
      either in actual conflict, or the consequences deducible from them.</p>

    <p>During the summer of 1830, I was directed by the Department personally
      to visit the Indians, to endeavour to restore peace. The instructions
      were not, however, received until late in the year, and it was not
      practicable to carry them into effect until the following year. It
      was employed in visiting the bands situated intermediate between Lake
      Superior and the Mississippi, being south of St. Anthony falls. It was
      found impracticable to visit the more northern bands. Instructions were
      however received for this purpose in the spring of 1832. I immediately
      organized an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> expedition, and employed the summer season in visiting
      the remotest bands on the Upper Mississippi, and I will now proceed to
      detail such of its results, not heretofore communicated, as pertain to
      the present condition of the Indians.</p>

    <p>It will be recollected that during the previous visit, general councils
      were held with the Chippewas at Chegoimegon on Lake Superior, and at
      Yellow River, Lac Courtorielle, and Rice Lake, in the region of St.
      Croix and Chippewa Rivers: that the subject of the treaty of peace and
      limits of 1825 was distinctly brought home to the chiefs, and their
      promise obtained to use their influence in keeping their warriors at
      peace: that messages were despatched by them to the principal Sioux
      chiefs, expressive of these sentiments, accompanied by messages from
      myself: that a Chippewa war party was encountered, and its object
      frustrated: and the subject of limits on the Red Cedar fork presenting
      itself as an obstacle to a firm peace on this border, was amicably
      referred by them to the President, with a request, by them, that
      he would use his influence to keep the Sioux at peace. From which
      auspicious results were anticipated.</p>

    <p>I had the satisfaction to find, in the progress of this year’s visits,
      that these measures had been productive of good effects; that the fall
      and winter of 1831 had passed, without any war party’s going out of
      the region of the Chippewa and St. Croix, and that a peace-council had
      been held by the Chippewas of the Folle Avoine, and the Sioux of the
      Petite Corbeau’s band, which was also attended by the Upper Snake River
      Indians, and by deputations of the Mille Lac and Fond du Lac Chippewas,
      and that my counsels and admonitions had been extensively spread.</p>

    <p>Other facts disclosed on my passing through Lake Superior may be
      adverted to. On casually meeting a party of Indians and traders at
      the Portail (June 11th), I heard of the existence of a feud at Lac
      Courtorielle, which had, during the previous winter, resulted in the
      murder of a Canadian named Brunet at Long Lake, and the murder of an
      Indian boy by the son of Mozojeed, the chief of the band. That the
      murderer had been apprehended by the Chippewas and traders, and brought
      out as far as the carrying-place on the head of the Mauvais River,
      where he had escaped.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

    <p>On reaching the trading post at Kewena Bay (14th), I met Pezhicki,
      the chief of La Pointe, with several men going out to visit me at the
      sault. There was also, at this place, the speaker Mizi, being on his
      way, with a considerable retinue, to Penetanguishine, the British post
      on Lake Huron. I here learned the death of Mozobodo, the chief of Lac
      du Flambeau, and that his brother the White Crow, a man of inferior
      merit, had succeeded to the chieftainship, and was forming a war-party
      to descend the Chippewa River against the Sioux.</p>

    <p>I reached the Ontonegon on the 19th, and found at this place
      Mushcoswun, or the Moose’s Tail, an elder brother of the White Crow of
      Lac du Flambeau, and Mozojeed, the chief of Lac Courtorielle, encamped
      with their followers, being all on their way to visit me at the sault.
      No further information was obtained of the state of affairs at Lac du
      Flambeau, except that a trader had clandestinely visited that post from
      the Mississippi with whiskey. Being nearest the theatre of the Sauc
      disturbances, I felt much anxiety to be particularly informed of the
      state of feeling in this numerous, warlike, and hitherto disaffected
      band. This I was, however, left to infer from the studied silence, or
      affected ignorance of Mushcoswun.</p>

    <p>Mozojeed gave me reason to be satisfied that the Chippewas of his
      quarter were quite friendly, and that no disposition was felt to
      sanction, far less to aid, the confederated Saucs and Foxes in their
      schemes. He regretted, he said, the murders which had taken place in
      his vicinity, during the winter, which, he affirmed, arose wholly from
      private jealousies and bickerings. He said, he lamented the folly of
      the young men of his village who had committed the murders. He could
      not prevent it. He could not see through the distant forests, alluding
      to the difficulty of foreseeing and governing the acts of people at
      a distance. He could not absolutely govern those in his own village;
      but these murders were committed at Long Lake, and not at Ottowa Lake,
      where he lived.</p>

    <p>He said that the murderer of Brunet had been apprehended, by the
      joint advice of himself and those who had grown old in wearing medals
      (meaning the elder chiefs). But he had escaped on the Mauvais portage.
      From that point the chief called Misco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> Monedo, or the Red Devil, and
      his people had returned, saying that they would punish the fugitive.</p>

    <p>With respect to the murder committed by his son, he said that he had
      come out to give himself up for it, to be dealt with as might be
      dictated. He stood ready to answer for it. And he awaited my decision
      respecting it, as well as the other murder. He concluded his address by
      presenting a pipe.</p>

    <p>Soon after passing Presque Isle river (20th), we met Mr. Warren,
      a trader, and his brigade of boats, on his annual return from his
      wintering ground. He confirmed the reports heard from the Indians,
      and added, that a trader from the Mississippi had entered the St.
      Croix River, and introduced ardent spirits among the Chippewas of
      Snake River. Mushcoswun followed me, with others, to Chagoimegon,
      or Lapointe, became a sharer in the presents distributed there, and
      expressed himself during the council in a speech of decidedly friendly
      terms.</p>

    <p>At the mouth of the River Broule I encountered Ozawondib, or the Yellow
      Head, and Mainotagooz, or the Handsome Enunciator, two Chippewas from
      the Cassinian source of the Mississippi, being on their way to visit me
      at the seat of the agency. They reported that the Indians of Leech Lake
      had raised a war-party, and gone out against the Sioux of the Plains.
      Both these Indians returned with me to Cass Lake. The former afterward
      guided me from that remote point to the source of this river.</p>

    <p>On reaching Fond du Lac (23d), I found the Indians of that post
      assembled, preparatory to the departure of the traders of the Fond du
      Lac department. Mr. Aitkin represented that the Hudson’s Bay clerks had
      been well supplied with high-wines, during the season of trade, which
      were freely used to induce our Indians to cross the boundary in quest
      of it, and that if the American government did not permit a limited
      quantity of this article to be taken by their traders, that part of
      their hunts would be carried to their opponents. His clerks from Rainy
      Lake presented me a pipe and ornamented stem, accompanying a speech
      of general friendship from Aissibun, or the Racoon, and another, with
      similar testimonials, from the son of the late chief Ainakumigishkung,
      both of the Rainy Lake band.</p>

    <p>Mongazid, or the Loon’s Foot, the second chief and speaker of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> the Fond
      du Lac band, confirmed what I had previously heard, of a peace council
      having been held on the St. Croix, with the Petite Corbeau’s band of
      Sioux. He said that Kabamappa was at the head of the Chippewa party,
      and had been the prime mover in this pacific attempt. That he had
      himself been present, with a deputation of eleven men of the Fond du
      Lac band, including the elder chief Chingoop.</p>

    <p>Dr. Borup, a clerk in the A. F. Company’s service, added, in relation
      to affairs on the Rainy Lake border, that five chiefs have been
      invested with medals and flags, by the <i>British traders</i> of Rainy
      Lake. That eighty kegs of high-wines were exhibited to the Indians
      at that post during the last season—that it was freely sent over
      the American lines, even within <i>a few hours’ march</i> of Leech
      Lake—having been sent <i>west</i> of the portage into Turtle Lake.</p>

    <p>We had now reached the head of Lake Superior. Our route thence to the
      Mississippi was up the river St. Louis, and across the Savanne portage.
      We reached the trading-house at the junction of Sandy Lake River with
      the Mississippi during the afternoon of the 3d of July, and remained
      at that place until 6 o’clock in the evening of the 4th. The Indians
      have confirmed the reports of a war-party’s having gone out from Leech
      Lake. All accounts from that quarter indicated a state of extreme
      restlessness on the part of that band, and also among the Yanktons
      and Sessitons. Inineewi, or the Manly Man, acted as the speaker at
      the council which I held on the west banks of the river. He mingled,
      as is common, his private affairs with his public business. He said
      that he was not possessed of the authority of chieftainship, but that
      his father Kabigwakoosidjiga, had been a chief under the English
      government; that Chingoop, the chief of Fond du Lac, was his uncle,
      and Chamees, our guide, his nephew. He said that the Grosse Guelle,
      and most of the chiefs and hunters of the place, had dispersed from
      their encampment, and were now passing the summer months in the country
      near the mouth of L’aile de Corbeau, or Crow-wing River. That he would
      forthwith convey my message to them, &amp;c.; confirming his words with the
      present of a pipe.</p>

    <p>Having determined to ascend the Mississippi from this point,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> and
      being satisfied from my Indian maps that I could make a portage from
      Cass Lake into Leech Lake, and from the latter into the source of the
      Crow-wing river, so as to descend the latter to its junction with the
      Mississippi, I transmitted a message to the Grosse Guelle to meet
      me, with the Sandy Lake Indians, at Isle de Corbeau, in twenty days,
      counting from the 4th. I then deposited the provisions and goods
      intended for distribution at the council at Isle de Corbeau, with the
      person in charge of Mr. Aitkin’s house, making arrangements to have the
      articles sent down the Mississippi, in exact season to meet me there.</p>

    <p>Relieved of this portion of the burden of transportation, we proceeded
      with more alacrity. We passed the falls of Pukaiguma on the 7th, and
      encamped at the trading-post at Lake Winnipec, above the savannas, on
      the 9th, having pursued the side route through Bogotowa Lake. While
      encamped at Point aux Chenes, in the savannas, a Frenchman arrived from
      Leech Lake, on his way to the post at Sandy Lake. He reported that the
      war-party had returned to Leech Lake, bringing three Sessiton scalps,
      having, in their engagement, lost one man, a brother-in-law of the
      Guelle Plat’s. That the Guelle Plat had led the party, and encountered
      the Sioux coming out against them. He also reported, that the Sioux
      had scalped a Chippewa girl near Pembina. That they were immediately
      pursued by a party of Chippewas, overtaken in the act of constructing a
      raft to cross a stream, and four of the number killed and scalped.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

    <p>Finding the waters favourable for ascending, and that our progress had
      been much accelerated thereby, I sent a verbal message by this man, to
      have the canoes with supplies destined for Isle de Corbeau set forward
      two days earlier than the time originally fixed.</p>

    <p>The clerk in charge of the trading-post of Lake Winnipec, communicated
      a number of facts respecting the location and number of the Indians
      living in the middle grounds between that post and Rainy Lake. I
      proposed to him the following questions, to which I have annexed his
      answers.</p>

    <p>1. Do the Hudson’s Bay clerks cross the American lines from the post of
      Rainy Lake, for the purposes of trade? <i>Ans.</i> No. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>They furnish
      goods to Indians who go trading into the American territory.</p>

    <p>2. Do the partners or clerks of the H. B. Co. present flags and medals
      to Indians? <i>Ans.</i> Yes.</p>

    <p>3. Do they give such flags and medals to Indians living within the
      American lines? <i>Ans.</i> No. I have heard that they took away an
      American flag given to an Indian on the U. S. borders of Rainy Lake,
      tore it, and burnt it, and gave him a British flag instead.</p>

    <p>4. Was the H. B. Co.’s post on Rainy Lake supplied with ardent spirits
      last season? <i>Ans.</i> It was. They had about 60 kegs of high-wines,
      which were shown to some of our Indians, who went there, and Mr.
      Cameron, who was in charge of the post, said to them, that, although
      their streams were high from the melting of the snow, they should, swim
      as high with liquor, if the Indians required it.</p>

    <p>5. What is the strength of the high-wines? <i>Ans.</i> One keg is
      reduced to four.</p>

    <p>6. Have the Indians sent out on <i>derwin</i> by the H. B. Co.
      approached near to your post? <i>Ans.</i> They have come very near,
      having been on the Turtle portage with goods.</p>

    <p>7. Did they bring liquor thus far? <i>Ans.</i> No. The liquor is kept
      at Rainy Lake, to induce the Indians to visit that place with their
      furs.</p>

    <p>8. Did the disposition made of the liquor, which the Secretary of War
      permitted the principal factor of the Fond du Lac department, to take
      in last year, embrace the post of Winnipec? <i>Ans.</i> It did not. It
      was kept chiefly at Rainy Lake, and on the lines, to be used in the
      opposition trade.</p>

    <p>On reaching Cass Lake, or <i>Lac Cedar Rouge</i> (July 10th), I found
      a band of Chippewas resident on its principal island. They confirmed
      the reports of the murder and subsequent affray at Pembina, and of
      the return of the war-party which went out from Leech Lake. Some of
      the warriors engaged in the latter were from the island in Cass Lake,
      including the person killed. His widow and her children attended the
      council, and shared in the distribution of presents which I made there.
      While encamped on this island, two of the Sioux scalps, which had been
      brought in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> as trophies on the late excursion, were danced with the
      ceremonies peculiar to the occasion, on an eminence adjacent to, and
      within sight of, my encampment. This painful exhibition of barbaric
      triumph was enacted without consulting me.</p>

    <p>Finding it practicable, in the existing state of the waters, to visit
      the principal and most remote source of the Mississippi, above this
      lake, I determined to encamp my men, and leave my heavy baggage and
      supplies on the island, and to accomplish the visit in small canoes,
      with the aid of Indian guides. As the details of this expedition afford
      no political information of a character required by my instructions,
      beyond the observation of some evidences of a Sioux inroad in former
      years, and the statistical facts heretofore given, they are omitted.
      It will be sufficient to remark that the object was successfully
      accomplished, under the guidance of Oza Windib. I planted the American
      flag on an island in the lake, which is the true source of the
      Mississippi, 149 years after the discovery of the mouth of this stream
      by La Salle. I was accompanied on this expedition by Mr. Johnston of
      the Department; Dr. D. Houghton; Lieut. Allen, U. S. A.; and the Rev.
      W. T. Boutwell.</p>

    <p>On returning to my encampment on the island in Cass Lake, I explained
      to the Indians, in a formal council, the object of my instructions
      from the Department, so far as these relate to their hostilities with
      the Sioux. I invested Oza Windib with a flag and medal, finding him
      to be looked up to as the principal man in the band, and there being,
      at present, no one who claimed, or appeared to be as well entitled,
      to the authority of chieftainship. Neezh Opinais, or the Twin Birds,
      who received a medal from Gov. Cass, through the intervention of his
      principal guide, in 1820, was formerly resident at this lake, but
      is now incorporated with the band at Red Lake. I sent him a flag,
      accompanied with a formal message, by his son, and acknowledged the
      receipt of a peace pipe and stem, from Waiwain Jigun of Red Lake, sent
      out by him through another hand. These attentions to the ceremonial
      messages of the Indians are of more importance, so far as respects
      their feelings and friendship, than might be inferred.</p>

    <p>Cass Lake is about 15 miles long, in the direction that the Mississippi
      passes through it, and may be estimated to be twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span> miles wide,
      exclusive of a spacious prolongation or bay, in the direction to
      Leech Lake. It is the second large lake below the primary forks of
      the Mississippi, and is decidedly the largest expanse assuming the
      character of <i>a lake</i>, in its entire length, covering a greater
      square superficies than Lake Pepin.</p>

    <p>The Mississippi is but little used by traders going North West, and not
      at all beyond Lac Traverse. It is found to take its rise south of west
      from Cass Lake. In consequence, its source has seldom been visited,
      even by the traders, whose highest point of temporary location is
      Pamitchi Gumaug, or Lac Traverse, estimated to be forty miles W.N.W. of
      Cass Lake. And this point has been found to be the extreme N.W. point
      attained by its waters.</p>

    <p>Representations having been made to the Department, on the subject of
      foreign interference in the trade on this frontier, I have addressed a
      number of queries on the subject to a clerk<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> engaged in the American
      trade, who has been many years a resident of Red Lake, and is well
      acquainted with the geography and resources of the adjacent country.
      I inquired of him, whether the American traders on that border were
      strenuously opposed in their trade by the inhabitants of the Red River
      colony, or by the partners and clerks of the Hudson’s Bay Company. He
      replied, that the inhabitants of Pembina made temporary voyages of
      trade to Voleuse, or Thief River, south of the parallel of 49°, but
      that they had not built, or made a permanent stand there. He said,
      that the open nature of the country about the Red River settlements
      gave great facilities for making short excursions into the Indian
      country, on horseback and in carts. But he did not know any place where
      permanent outfits had been sent, except to Rivière Souris, or Mouse
      River, west of Red River. He believes that this traffic was carried on
      exclusively by the inhabitants of the colony, and not by the Hudson’s
      Bay Company,</p>

    <p>I asked him, whether the Indians of the Lake of the Woods visited the
      post of Red Lake, and whether our traders were annoyed in their trade
      from that quarter, by the servants of the H. B. Company. He replied,
      that the Lac du Bois Indians came <span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>across to Red Lake ordinarily; that
      it is a three days’ journey, but that no annoyance is experienced in
      the trade of that post from the H. B. Co. factors. He is of opinion,
      that they do not send outfits into any part of the territory south of
      the national boundary, beginning at Rat Portage, on the Lake of the
      Woods.</p>

    <p>Assurances being given by the Indians that the portages of the overland
      route from Cass Lake to Leech Lake were not only practicable for my
      canoes and baggage, but that by adopting it a considerable saving
      would be made both in time and distance, I determined on returning
      by it. The first portage was found to be 950 yards. It lies over a
      dry sand plain. A small lake, without outlet, is then crossed; and a
      second portage of 4100 yards terminates at the banks of another small
      lake, which has a navigable outlet (for canoes) into an arm of Leech
      Lake. We accomplished the entire route, from the island in Cass Lake
      to the Guelle Plat’s village in Leech Lake, between ten o’clock A.
      M. and ten P. M. of the 16th July. Although the night was dark, and
      the Indians had retired to their lodges, a salute was fired by them,
      and an eligible spot for encampment pointed out. It was so dark as to
      require torches to find it. The next morning, I found myself in front
      of a village, numbering, when all present, upwards of 700 souls. They
      renewed their salute. The chief, Guelle Plat, sent to invite me to
      breakfast. During the repast, the room became filled with Indians, who
      seated themselves orderly around the room. When we arose, the chief
      assumed the oratorical attitude, and addressed himself to me.</p>

    <p>He expressed his regret that I had not been able to visit them the year
      before, when I was expected. He hoped I had now come, as I had come by
      surprise, to remain some days with them. He said they lived remote, and
      were involved in wars with their neighbours, and wished my advice. They
      were not insensible to advice, nor incapable of following it. They were
      anxious for counsel, and desirous of living at peace, and of keeping
      the advice which had heretofore been given to them. They had been told
      to sit still on their lands. But their enemies would not permit them
      to sit still. They were compelled to get up and fight in defence. The
      Sioux continued to kill their hunters. They had killed his son during
      the last visit he had made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> my office. They had never ceased to
      make inroads. And he believed there were white men among the Sioux who
      stirred them up to go to war against the Chippewas. He named one person
      particularly.</p>

    <p>It was necessary, he continued, to take some decisive steps to put
      a stop to their inroads. This was the reason why he had led out the
      war-party which had recently returned. This was the reason why I saw
      the stains of blood before me.</p>

    <p>He alluded, in this expression, to the flags, war-clubs, &amp;c. which
      decorated one end of the room, all of which had vermilion smeared on
      them, to represent blood. I replied succinctly, stating the reasons
      which would prevent my making a long visit, and notified him, that in
      consequence of the length of my route yet to perform, I would assemble
      them to a general council at my camp as soon as I could be prepared,
      that notice would be given them by the firing of the military, and that
      I should then lay before them the advice I came to deliver from their
      great father the President, and offer them at the same time my own
      counsel on the subjects he had spoken of.</p>

    <p>During the day, constant accessions were made to the number of Indians
      from neighbouring places. Among them were a party of nine Rainy Lake
      Indians, under the leadership of a man named Wai-Wizh-Zhe-Geezhig,
      or the Hole-in-the-Sky. He represented himself and party as resident
      at Springing-bowstring Lake; said that he had heard of my passing
      Lake Winnipec, with an intention to return by Leech Lake, and came to
      express his good will, in the hope that he would not be overlooked,
      &amp;c. I presented him publicly with a flag, and clothing and tobacco for
      himself and party, committing to him a short address to be delivered to
      the Rainy Lake Indians.</p>

    <p>The Muk Kund Wai, or Pillagers, being present, with their chiefs and
      warriors, women and children, I displayed the presents intended for
      this band, on blankets spread out on the grass in front of my tent. I
      called their attention to the subjects named in my instructions, to the
      desire of the government for the restoration of peace to the frontiers,
      and its paternal character, &amp;c.; reminded them of their solemn treaty
      of peace and limits with the Sioux, signed at Prairie du Chien in 1825;
      enforced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span> advantages of it in relation to their hunting, their
      trades, &amp;c. &amp;c. I presented the presents, in bulk, to the chiefs, who
      immediately directed their distribution.</p>

    <p>Aish Kee Buggi Kozh, or the Guelle Plat, was their speaker in reply.
      He called the attention of the warriors to his words. He thanked me
      for the presents, which reminded him, in amount, of the times when the
      British held possession in that quarter. He pointed across an arm of
      the lake in front to the position occupied by the North-West Company’s
      fort. He said many winters had now passed since the Americans first
      sent a chief to that post to visit them—alluding to Lieutenant Pike’s
      visit in the winter of 1805-6. He remembered that visit. I had come to
      remind them that the American flag was flying in the land, and to offer
      them counsels of peace, for which they were thankful. They had hoped
      I was to spend more time with them, to enter more fully into their
      feelings, but as they must speak on the instant, they would not lose
      the opportunity of declaring their sentiments.</p>

    <p>He thought that the advice of the Americans resembled a rushing wind.
      It was strong and went soon. It did not abide long enough to choke up
      the road. He said, that at the treaty of Tipisagi, it had been promised
      that the aggressor should be punished. But that they had even that very
      year, and almost yearly since, been attacked by the Sioux, and some of
      their nation killed. He said that they had even been fired on under the
      walls of the fort at Ishki Buggi Seepi,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and four of their party
      killed. He had himself been present. He handed to me a small bundle of
      sticks, which, he said, exhibited the number of Leech Lake Chippewas
      who had been killed by the Sioux since they had touched the quill<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
      at Tipisagi. The number was forty-three.</p>

    <p>He lifted up four American medals, attached by a string of wampum,
      and smeared with vermilion. He said they were bloody. He wished me to
      wipe off the blood. He said he was himself unable to do it. He found
      himself irretrievably involved in a war with the Sioux. He said he
      believed that it had been intended by the Creator that they should be
      at war with this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>people. He was not satisfied with the result of the
      late war-party. His warriors were not satisfied. He complimented their
      bravery. He disclaimed any merit himself. He said that they had looked
      for help where they did not find it. They were determined to revenge
      themselves. If the United States did not aid them, he had it in mind to
      apply elsewhere for aid. He clearly referred to, but did not name, the
      English government in Canada. His warriors were in a restless state.
      He had sent out his pipe and invitations to the neighbouring bands to
      continue the war. Circumstances controlled him. He could not avoid it.
      His own feelings were enlisted deeply in the contest. When the enemy
      killed his son, he had resolved never to lay down the war-club. He had
      sought for death in battle, but had not met it. All he now could say
      was, that perhaps he should not lead the next war-party. He thought
      some other person would.</p>

    <p>He accused persons on the waters of the Upper Mississippi, of giving
      advice to the Sioux to go to war against the Chippewas. He said it was
      the interest of persons in the trade to induce the Sioux to extend
      the territorial boundary. He evinced a familiarity with persons and
      places. He did not exempt some persons officially connected with the
      general government in that quarter, from participating in the course of
      mal-counsel.</p>

    <p>He complained of the traders. He criticised their conduct with
      severity. He thought their prices exorbitant, and said that they were
      so intent on getting furs, that they did not deem it necessary to use
      much formality in their dealings with the Indians. He complained of
      the exclusion of ardent spirits, but at the same time admitted, that
      formerly it was brought in to buy up their wild rice—a practice that
      left them, at the beginning of cold weather, in a destitute situation.</p>

    <p>Much of the sentiment of this address appeared to be uttered for
      popular effect on the young warriors, who stood an eager, gazing group
      around, and made loud responses of approbation at every pause. Such
      parts of it as were not given as a reply to my remarks, or contained
      allusions entitled to notice, I replied to, aiming to keep their
      attention fixed on the leading principles of the pacific policy which
      dictated my public instructions; and not meaning that they should
      forget them, nor mistake them, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> any bursts of feeling, or appeals
      to the passions or prejudices of the young men, who only looked to
      the war-path as the avenue of personal distinction. I brought these
      principles back to their minds, and enforced them by obvious appeals
      to facts. I told the chief that his political sentiments should be
      faithfully reported to the government, whose object it was, in the
      employment of subordinate officers, to accumulate facts, which might
      form the basis of future action.</p>

    <p>So far as related to the traders withdrawing the article of whiskey
      from the trade, I felt it due to say that no hard feelings should be
      entertained towards them. That it was excluded by the office. That
      the Indians should, in justice blame me, or blame the government, and
      not the traders. I was satisfied that the use of whiskey was very
      hurtful to them in every situation, and felt determined to employ every
      means which the control of the Agency of the North-West gave to me,
      to exclude the article wholly and rigidly from the Chippewas, and to
      set the mark of disapprobation upon every trader who should make the
      attempt to introduce it.</p>

    <p>Having an engagement to meet the Sandy Lake Indians on the 22d (after a
      lapse of five days), and an unknown route to explore, I terminated the
      council by the distribution of provisions to the Rainy Lake Indians,
      guides, and chiefs, requested fresh guides for the route into the Ka
      Ga Gee, or De Corbeau River, and immediately embarked. We encamped on
      the southern shore of Leech Lake. During the following day (18th), we
      accomplished the whole route from this lake to the head waters of the
      De Corbeau. It consists of five portages of various length, separated
      by ten small lakes and ponds. The last of the portages terminates on
      the handsomely elevated banks of a lake called Kagi Nogum Aug. This
      lake is the source of this fork of the Mississippi. The Guelle Plat,
      with the secondary chief of his band, overtook me at the commencement
      of the fourth portage, and accompanied me to my encampment. He said he
      had many things which he still wished to consult me on, and spent the
      evening, until twelve o’clock, in conversation. I found him to possess
      a reflective intelligent mind. He stated to me his opinions on the
      Sioux war, the boundary line, the trade, location of trading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>-posts.
      &amp;c. He evinced the gratified feelings created by the circumstances of
      my visit to his people, and said he should visit me at the agency, next
      year, if his life and health were spared.</p>

    <p>We commenced the descent of the De Corbeau on the 19th. The channel is
      at first small and winding. It expands successively into eleven lakes,
      of various dimensions, and acquires considerable breadth and velocity
      before it forms its upper forks, by the junction with Shell River. We
      encountered in this distance no Indians, but observed, as we had the
      previous day, traces of the recent war-party. In passing out of the
      tenth of the series of lakes, the men observed a camp-fire on shore,
      but no person appeared. It was conjectured to indicate the presence
      of Sioux, who, perceiving the character of the party, had fled and
      concealed themselves.</p>

    <p>The next day afforded no certain evidences of a fixed population. We
      observed continued traces of the recent war-party, and other signs of
      temporary occupancy, in the standing camp-poles and meat racks which
      frequently met the eye in our descent. We passed the entrance of Leaf
      River, a large tributary from the right, having its source near the
      banks of Otter Tail Lake; and the next day, had our attention directed
      to the entrance of Prauie River, on the same shore. The latter is
      also a tributary of the first class. It is the war-road, so to say,
      between the Chippewas and Sioux, having its source in a lake, which is
      designated in the treaty of Prairie du Chien as one of the points in
      the boundary line between these two nations.</p>

    <p>The day following (21st), the monotony of vegetable solitude was broken
      by meeting a Chippewa and his family in a canoe. He informed me that
      we were within a few hours’ journey of the mouth of the river—that the
      Sandy Lake and Mille Lac Indians were assembled there, awaiting my
      arrival, and that they expected me this day. I found this information
      to be correct. We entered the Mississippi about noon, and saw the
      opposite shore lined with lodges, with the American flag conspicuously
      displayed. The long-continued firing and shouts of the Indians left me
      no reason to doubt that my arrival was both anticipated and desired.
      I was gratified on being told, within three hours of my arrival, that
      the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> canoe, with the goods and supplies from Sandy Lake, was in sight.
      And in a few moments found the event verified, in the safe arrival of
      the men, and the landing of the packages.</p>

    <p>I determined to lose no time in assembling the Indians in council,
      addressed them on the objects of the expedition, and caused the
      presents to be prepared and distributed. I was addressed, in reply, by
      the elder chief, Gross Guelle, and also by the brother of the Strong
      Ground, by Waub Ojeeg, and by a young man called Nitum E’gabo Wai.
      Peculiarities in the address of each only require to be adverted to.</p>

    <p>The Gross Guelle deemed it important that the line between them and
      the Sioux should be surveyed and marked. He said that much of it was a
      land line, and it could not be told by either party where it ran. This
      was true of it, in the section of country immediately west of them.
      The Sioux were in the habit of trespassing on it; and when their own
      hunters went out in the pursuit of game, they did not like to stop
      short of the game, and they saw no marked line to stop them. He said
      that it had been promised at the treaty that the line should be run,
      and he wished me to refer the subject to the President. He was in
      favour of peace now, as he had been at Tipisagi, and at Fond du Lac.</p>

    <p>Soangikumig, or the Strong Ground, expressed his sentiments through the
      medium of his brother, who was the more ready speaker. He said he had
      taken a part in defending the lines, and he hoped that they might be
      made plain, so that each party could see them. As it is, a perpetual
      pretence is given for crossing the lines. It must be expected that
      peace would often be broken when it could be so easily done.</p>

    <p>Waub Ojeeg, or the White Fisher, said that he had given his influence
      to peace counsels. He had been present at the treaty of Fond du Lac.
      But the Sandy Lake Indians had been lately reproached, as it were,
      for their pacific character, by hearing of the Leech Lake war-party’s
      passing so near to them. He hoped that the same advice that was given
      to them would be given to the Sioux. If the Sioux would not <i>come</i>
      over the lines, the Chippewas would promise not to <i>go</i> over them.
      He thought the lines might have been differently run, but as they had
      been agreed to by their old chiefs, who were now gone, it would be best
      to let them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> as they do. Their hunters, however, always came out of the
      mouth of Sauc River, which had been given up to the Sioux.</p>

    <p>The young man said that he was the son of Pugu Sain Jigun, who had
      died recently at Sandy Lake. He said that the medal which he wore had
      been given to his father by me, at the treaty of Prairie du Chien in
      1825, in exchange for a British medal, surrendered by him. He did not
      profess to have any experience in political affairs. He had inherited
      his medal, and hoped to be considered by me worthy of it. He expected
      the respect due to it. He expressed his friendship, and confirmed his
      speech with a pipe.</p>

    <p>Ascertaining the trading-house to be near my encampment, after closing
      the council, I descended the Mississippi about eighteen miles, and
      encamped at Prairie Piercée.</p>

    <p>The distance from the mouth of the De Corbeau to St. Anthony’s Falls,
      may be computed to exceed 200 miles. The line between the Chippewas
      and Sioux crossed from the east to the west of the Mississippi, so as
      to strike and follow up the Wadub, or Little Soc River, which is the
      first river on the west banks of the Mississippi, above the mouth of
      Soc River. We passed several Chippewa hunters, with their families,
      along this part of the Mississippi, but encountered no Sioux, even on
      that portion of it lying south of their line. I was informed that they
      had in a measure abandoned this part of the country, and I observed no
      standing Sioux camp-poles, which are, with the people, a conspicuous
      sign of occupancy, and which were, in 1820, noticed to extend as high
      up the river as Little Rock. (<i>Les Petite Roches</i>).</p>

    <p>I passed the portage of the Falls of St. Anthony, and reached Fort
      Snelling on the 24th July. There being no agent, nor sub-agent
      present, Captain Jouett, the commanding officer, on whom the charge of
      the agency had temporarily devolved, afforded me every facility for
      communicating to the Sioux the object of my visit to the Chippewas, and
      requesting their concurrence in its accomplishment. For this purpose
      the Wahpeton Sioux were called together, at the agency-house, on the
      25th. I stated to them the object of the visit, and the means which had
      been used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span> to persuade the Chippewas to give up war, and to confine
      themselves within their lines. I reminded them of the anxiety of their
      great father the President, to bring about a firm peace between them
      and the Chippewas, and of the numerous proofs he had given them of
      this anxiety, by calling them together at several councils, which had
      this object particularly in view. They had men of wisdom among them,
      and they would quickly see how utterly useless it would, however, be
      for the Chippewas to remain quiet, during any single season, if the
      Sioux did not also, at the same time, sit still. I appealed to them to
      resolve on peace; to take the resolution now; to take it sincerely, and
      to adhere to it firmly and for ever.</p>

    <p>I stated to them the request made by Grosse Guelle, and other Chippewa
      chiefs, respecting the marking out of the lines, and invited them to
      express their opinion on this subject.</p>

    <p>I announced to them the exclusion of whiskey.</p>

    <p>The aged chief Petite Corbeau uttered their reply. I recognised in
      this chief one of the signers of the grant of land made at this place
      26 years ago, when the site of the fort was first visited and selected
      by the late General Pike. He adverted to the agency, which he had
      exercised for many years, in managing the affairs of his people. They
      lived upon the river. They were constantly in sight. They were in
      the habit of being consulted. His ears had always been open to the
      Americans. He had listened to their counsels. He would still listen
      to them, although they were, at present, in a depressed situation.
      He adverted particularly to the existing war with the Saucs, and the
      accusations which had been thrown out against the Sioux party, who had
      gone down to join the American standard, but had returned. He denied
      that they felt any friendship for the Saucs and Foxes. He said they
      were willing to go against them again, if requested by the commanding
      officer.</p>

    <p>He spoke on the subject of the Chippewa wars at some length, adverting
      to a time when this people did not approach so near to the river—when
      they dared not to approach so near to it. He thought the lines were
      drawn too close upon them, on the St. Croix—that the young men
      could not go out hunting, but quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> they found themselves beyond
      their lines. He thought they might even now be driven back, were it
      undertaken in earnest.</p>

    <p>He said the chief of Leech Lake was wrong to appeal to me to wipe the
      blood off his medal. He ought to be able to wipe it off himself. It
      was pitiful to make this appeal, for men who were able to do a thing
      themselves. He referred to the late Chippewa war-party, and said that a
      relative of his had been killed. Blood would call for blood. He did not
      rule the Lessitons. He thought they would repay the blow.</p>

    <p>His own advice had been pacific. He had received my wampum last year,
      and smoked the pipe with the St. Croix Chippewas. They were their
      neighbours. They were now at peace. They wished to remain so. They
      would act by my advice. He thanked me for the advice.</p>

    <p>He warmly approbated the proposition to run out the lines. He said
      it had been mentioned at the treaty. And although the lines were not
      adjusted to the full satisfaction of all, perhaps they could never be
      settled better. He therefore united in requesting that the President
      might be asked to direct white men to establish them. It would be
      necessary, however, to have both parties by.</p>

    <p>He again adverted to the difficulties between them and the Chippewas.
      He thought that these difficulties were kept alive by the visits of the
      Chippewas to their post. He said it put bad feelings into the hearts
      of the Sioux, to see the Chippewas share the bounties of government,
      which the Sioux believed the government intended exclusively for them.
      Besides, it was difficult to restrain their feelings of hostility
      when they came together. Both parties were mistrustful. It was only
      necessary to look back a few years, to perceive what the consequences
      had been. He believes that these tribes ought to be kept apart. And one
      of the best means of keeping them apart was to draw their lines plain,
      and to order presents to be given out on their own lands, and not on
      each other’s lands.</p>

    <p>He spoke against the location of any trading-post on the St. Croix,
      which should be fixed so near to the lines as to bring the Sioux and
      Chippewas into contact. He also stated reasons why a post at the mouth
      of the St. Croix, which is exclusively in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> Sioux country, was
      not necessary.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He wished to keep his band together, and not to
      give them excuses for going hither and yon. He requested me to stop
      at his village, and to use my influence in persuading his people to
      live in one village, and not to continue, as they now were, in two
      distinct villages, which were not, in consequence, so fully under his
      control.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

    <p>Wamidetunkar, or the Black Dog, followed him in a speech containing
      sentiments not at variance with those expressed by the Little Crow. Its
      distinguishing feature was, however, a reference to the indulgences
      formerly granted to the Sioux at this post. He thought it hard that
      these indulgences should be withdrawn, or curtailed. And he could not
      comprehend how such a course could be consistent with professions of
      friendship on the part of officers of the U. States. He referred,
      particularly, to indiscriminate visiting at the fort, and the purchase
      of ardent spirits from the settlers.</p>

    <p>Cohmokar said that he had been present with the Petite Corbeau at
      the signing of the treaty of cession at St. Peters, and it was owing
      to this act that the American flag was now displayed there. He had
      sustained this chief in his public acts, and he concurred with him
      in what he had uttered about the Chippewa war, and also the existing
      troubles with the Black Hawk. He repelled the idea that the Sioux were
      friendly to the Saucs and Foxes in the present controversy. They were
      a people who were never at ease. They had often struck the Sioux.
      The Sioux war-club had also been often lifted against them, and it
      was ready to be lifted again. They were ready to hear the commanding
      officer, who was sitting present, say strike.</p>

    <p>The details of my route through the St. Croix and Burntwood Rivers, do
      not essentially vary the aspect of North Western Indian affairs given
      above. Facts communicated expressive of the then existing state of
      feeling respecting the said disturbances, were promptly reported to
      his excellency George B. Porter, governor <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>of Michigan, in a letter,
      of which I have the honour herewith to furnish a copy. The proposition
      of running out and marking their territorial lines, as a means of
      preserving peace, was approved; the recent meetings on the St. Croix,
      for the purpose of renewing pledges of peace, declared to be sincere
      on the part of the Chippewas; and sentiments of friendship to the
      government, and welcome to myself, expressed at each of the councils
      which I held with them.</p>

    <p>In submitting to the Department this summary of facts, resulting from
      my visit to the source of the Mississippi, I take the occasion to
      remark, that whatever may be the present state of feeling of the tribes
      on that stream, above Prairie du Chien, respecting the government of
      the United States, causes are in silent, but active operation, which
      will hereafter bring them into contact with our frontier settlements,
      and renew, at two or three separate periods in their history, the
      necessity of resorting to arms to quell or pacify them. The grounds
      of this opinion I need not now specify, further than to indicate that
      they exist in the condition and character of opposite lines of an
      extensive frontier population, which will inevitably impel the one to
      press, and the other to recede or resist. This process of repulsion and
      resistance will continue, if I have not much mistaken the character
      of that stream, until the frontier shall have become stationary about
      five hundred miles above the point I have indicated. I advert to this
      topic, not in the spirit of exciting immediate alarm, for there are
      no reasons for it, but for the purpose of calling the attention of
      the Secretary of War, through you, sir, to the importance of keeping
      up, and not withdrawing or reducing, the north western posts and
      agencies. And to express the opinion, that the advice and influence of
      the government upon these tribes would fall nearly powerless, without
      ready and visible means upon the frontiers of causing its counsels to
      be respected. Christianity, schools, and agriculture will do much to
      meliorate their condition and subdue their animosities, but it is a
      species of influence which has not yet been felt in any general effects
      in this quarter. Among the means of securing their friendship, and
      preserving peace, I have the honour to suggest, that beneficial effects
      would result from following out the system of exploratory visits, by
      extending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> it to the region of Lac des Flambeau, and to that portion of
      the peninsula of Michigan lying north of Grand River. A deputation of
      the Chippewas from the sources of the Mississippi and Lake Superior to
      the seat of government, would also be advantageous.</p>

    <p>So far as respects the state of hostilities among the Sioux and
      Chippewas, it must be expected that continued efforts will be necessary
      effectually to check it. Nothing could, perhaps, now be done, which
      would tend so directly to promote this end, as the surveying of the
      lines agreed on between themselves at the treaty of Prairie du Chien of
      1825.</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

    <p>In conformity with your instructions, I take the earliest opportunity
      to lay before you such facts as I have collected, touching the
      vaccination of the Chippewa Indians, during the progress of the late
      expedition into their country; and also “of the prevalence, from time
      to time, of the small-pox” among them.</p>

    <p>The accompanying table will serve to illustrate the “ages, sex, tribe,
      and local situation” of those Indians who have been vaccinated by me.
      With the view of illustrating more fully their local situation, I
      have arranged those bands residing upon the shores of Lake Superior;
      those residing in the Folle Avoine country (or that section of country
      lying between the highlands south-west from Lake Superior, and the
      Mississippi River); and those residing near the sources of the
      Mississippi River, separately.</p>

    <p>Nearly all the Indians noticed in this table were vaccinated at their
      respective villages; yet I did not fail to vaccinate those whom we
      chanced to meet in their hunting or other excursions.</p>

    <p>I have embraced, with the Indians of the frontier bands, those
      half-breeds, who, in consequence of having adopted more or less the
      habits of the Indian, may be identified with him.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>But little difficulty has occurred in convincing the Indians of the
      efficacy of vaccination; and the universal dread in which they hold the
      appearance of the small pox among them, rendered it an easy task to
      overcome their prejudices, whatever they chanced to be. The efficacy of
      the vaccine disease is well appreciated, even by the most interior of
      the Chippewa Indians, and so universal is this information, that only
      one instance occurred where the Indian had never heard of the disease.</p>

    <p>In nearly every instance the opportunity which was presented for
      vaccination was embraced with cheerfulness and apparent gratitude;
      at the same time manifesting great anxiety that, for the safety of
      the whole, each one of the band should undergo the operation. When
      objections were made to vaccination, they were not usually made because
      the Indian doubted the protective power of the disease, but because he
      supposed (never having seen its progress) that the remedy must nearly
      equal the disease which it was intended to counteract.</p>

    <p>Our situation, while travelling, did not allow me sufficient time to
      test the result of the vaccination in most instances; but an occasional
      return to bands where the operation had been performed, enabled me, in
      those bands, either to note the progress of the disease, or to judge
      from the cicatrices marking the original situation of the pustules, the
      cases in which the disease had proved successful.</p>

    <p>About one-fourth of the whole number were vaccinated directly from the
      pustules of patients labouring under the disease; while the remaining
      three-fourths were vaccinated from crusts, or from virus which had
      been several days on hand. I did not pass by a single opportunity for
      securing the crusts and virus from the arms of healthy patients; and
      to avoid as far as possible the chance of giving rise to a disease of
      a spurious kind, I invariably made use of those crusts and that virus,
      for the purposes of vaccination, which had been most recently obtained.
      To secure, as far as possible, against the chances of escaping the
      vaccine disease, I invariably vaccinated in each arm.</p>

    <p>Of the whole number of Indians vaccinated, I have either watched the
      progress of the disease, or examined the cicatrices of about seven
      hundred. An average of one in three of those vac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>cinated from crusts
      has failed, while of those vaccinated directly from the arm of a person
      labouring under the disease, not more than one in twenty has failed
      to take effect—when the disease did not make its appearance after
      vaccination, I have invariably, as the cases came under my examination,
      revaccinated until a favourable result has been obtained.</p>

    <p>Of the different bands of Indians vaccinated, a large proportion of
      the following have, as an actual examination has shown, undergone
      thoroughly the effects of the disease: viz. Sault Ste. Marie, Keweena
      Bay, La Pointe, and Cass Lake, being seven hundred and fifty-one in
      number; while of the remaining thirteen hundred and seventy-eight,
      of other bands, I think it may safely be calculated that more than
      three-fourths have passed effectually under the influence of the
      vaccine disease: and as directions to revaccinate all those in whom
      the disease failed, together with instructions as to time and manner
      of vaccination, were given to the chiefs of the different bands, it is
      more than probable that, where the bands remained together a sufficient
      length of time, the operation of revaccination has been performed by
      themselves.</p>

    <p>Upon our return to Lake Superior I had reason to suspect, on
      examining several cicatrices, that two of the crusts furnished by
      the surgeon-general in consequence of a partial decomposition, gave
      rise to a spurious disease, and these suspicions were confirmed when
      revaccinating with genuine vaccine matter, when the true disease was
      communicated. Nearly all those Indians vaccinated with those two
      crusts, have been vaccinated, and passed regularly through the vaccine
      disease.</p>

    <p>The answers to my repeated inquiries respecting the introduction,
      progress, and fatality of the small-pox, would lead me to infer that
      the disease has made its appearance, at least five times, among
      the bands of Chippewa Indians noticed in the accompanying table of
      vaccination.</p>

    <p>The small-pox appears to have been wholly unknown to the Chippewas of
      Lake Superior until about 1750; when a war-party, of more than one
      hundred young men, from the bands resident near the head of the lake,
      having visited Montreal for the purpose of assisting the French in
      their then existing troubles with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> English, became infected with
      the disease, and but few of the party survived to reach their homes—It
      does not appear, although they made a precipitate retreat to their own
      country, that the disease was at this time communicated to any others
      of the tribe.</p>

    <p>About the year 1770, the disease appeared a second time among the
      Chippewas, but unlike that which preceded it, it was communicated to
      the more northern bands.</p>

    <p>The circumstances connected with its introduction are related nearly as
      follows.</p>

    <p>Some time in the fall of 1767 or 8, a trader, who had ascended the
      Mississippi and established himself near Leech Lake, was robbed of his
      goods by the Indians residing at that lake; and, in consequence of his
      exertions in defending his property, he died soon after.</p>

    <p>These facts became known to the directors of the Fur Company, at
      Mackinac, and each successive year after, requests were sent to
      the Leech Lake Indians, that they should visit Mackinac, and make
      reparation for the goods they had taken, by a payment of furs, at
      the same time threatening punishment in case of a refusal. In the
      spring of 1770 the Indians saw fit to comply with this request; and a
      deputation from the band visited Mackinac, with a quantity of furs,
      which they considered an equivalent for the goods which had been taken.
      The deputation was received with politeness by the directors of the
      company, and the difficulties readily adjusted. When this was effected,
      a cask of liquor and a flag closely rolled were presented to the
      Indians as a token of friendship. They were at the same time strictly
      enjoined neither to break the seal of the cask nor to unroll the flag,
      until they had reached the heart of their own country. This they
      promised to observe; but while returning, and after having travelled
      many days, the chief of the deputation made a feast for the Indians of
      the band at Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, upon which occasion he unsealed
      the cask and unrolled the flag for the gratification of his guests. The
      Indians drank of the liquor, and remained in a state of inebriation
      during several days. The rioting was over, and they were fast
      recovering from its effects, when several of the party were seized with
      violent pain. This was attributed to the liquor they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> had drunk; but
      the pain increasing, they were induced to drink deeper of the poisonous
      drug, and in this inebriated state several of the party died, before
      the real cause was suspected. Other like cases occurred; and it was not
      long before one of the war-party which had visited Montreal in 1750,
      and who had narrowly escaped with his life, recognised the disease as
      the same which had attacked their party at that time. It proved to be
      so; and of those Indians then at Fond du Lac, about three hundred in
      number, nearly the whole were swept off by it. Nor did it stop here,
      for numbers of those at Fond du Lac, at the time the disease made its
      appearance, took refuge among the neighbouring bands, and although it
      did not extend easterly on Lake Superior, it is believed that not a
      single band of Chippewas north or west from Fond du Lac escaped its
      ravages. Of a large band then resident at Cass Lake, near the source of
      the Mississippi River, only one person, a child, escaped. The others
      having been attacked by the disease, died before any opportunity for
      dispersing was offered. The Indians at this day are firmly of the
      opinion that the small-pox was, at this time, communicated through the
      articles presented to their brethren, by the agent of the Fur Company
      at Mackinac; and that it was done for the purpose of punishing them
      more severely for their offences.</p>

    <p>The most western bands of Chippewas relate a singular allegory of
      the introduction of the small-pox into their country by a war-party,
      returning from the plains of the Missouri, as nearly as information
      will enable me to judge, in the year 1784. It does not appear that, at
      this time, the disease extended to the bands east of Fond du Lac; but
      it is represented to have been extremely fatal to those bands north and
      west from there.</p>

    <p>In 1802 or 3, the small-pox made its appearance among the Indians
      residing at the Sault Ste. Marie, but did not extend to the bands west
      from that place. The disease was introduced by a voyager, in the employ
      of the North West Fur Company, who had just returned from Montreal;
      and although all communication with him was prohibited, an Indian
      imprudently having made him a visit, was infected with and transmitted
      the disease to others of the band. When once communicated, it raged
      with great violence, and of a large band scarcely one of those then at
      the village sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>vived, and the unburied bones still remain marking the
      situation they occupied. From this band the infection was communicated
      to a band residing upon St. Joseph’s Island, and many died of it; but
      the surgeon of the military post then there succeeded, by judicious and
      early measures, in checking it, before the infection became general.</p>

    <p>In 1824 the small-pox again made its appearance among the Indians at
      the Sault Ste. Marie. It was communicated by a voyager to Indians upon
      Drummond’s Island, Lake Huron; and through them several families at
      Sault Ste. Marie became infected. Of those belonging to the latter
      place, more than twenty in number, only two escaped. The disease is
      represented to have been extremely fatal to the Indians at Drummond’s
      Island.</p>

    <p>Since 1824, the small-pox is not known to have appeared among the
      Indians at the Sault Ste. Marie, nor among the Chippewas north or
      west from that place. But the Indians of these bands still tremble at
      the bare name of a disease which (next to the compounds of alcohol)
      has been one of the greatest scourges that has ever overtaken them
      since their first communication with the whites. The disease, when
      once communicated to a band of Indians, rages with a violence wholly
      unknown to the civilized man. The Indian, guided by present feeling,
      adopts a course of treatment (if indeed it deserves that appellation),
      which not unfrequently arms the disease with new power. An attack is
      but a warning to the poor and helpless patient to prepare for death,
      which will almost assuredly soon follow. His situation under these
      circumstances is truly deplorable; for while in a state that even,
      with proper advice, he would of himself recover, he adds fresh fuel
      to the flame which is already consuming him, under the delusive hope
      of gaining relief. The intoxicating draught (when it is within his
      reach) is not among the last remedies to which he resorts, to produce
      a lethargy from which he is never to recover. Were the friends of the
      sick man, even under these circumstances, enabled to attend him, his
      sufferings might be, at least, somewhat mitigated; but they too are,
      perhaps, in a similar situation, and themselves without even a single
      person to minister to their wants. Death comes to the poor invalid, and
      perhaps even as a welcome guest, to rid him of his suffering.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

    <p>By a comparison of the number of Indians vaccinated upon the borders
      of Lake Superior, with the actual population, it will be seen that the
      proportion who have passed through the vaccine disease is so great as
      to secure them against any general prevalence of the small-pox; and
      perhaps it is sufficient to prevent the introduction of the disease to
      the bands beyond, through this channel. But in the Folle Avoine country
      it is not so. Of the large bands of Indians residing in that section
      of country, only a small fraction have been vaccinated; while of other
      bands not a single person has passed through the disease.</p>

    <p>Their local situation undoubtedly renders it of the first importance
      that the benefits of vaccination should be extended to them. Their
      situation may be said to render them a connecting link between the
      southern and north-western bands of Chippewas; and while on the south
      they are liable to receive the virus of the small-pox from the whites
      and Indians, the passage of the disease through them to their more
      northern brethren would only be prevented by their remaining, at that
      time, completely separated. Every motive of humanity towards the
      suffering Indian, would lead to extend to him this protection against
      a disease he holds in constant dread, and of which he knows, by sad
      experience, the fatal effects. The protection he will prize highly, and
      will give in return the only boon a destitute man is capable of giving;
      the deep-felt gratitude of an overflowing heart.</p>

    <p>Events growing out of the political condition of the Indian tribes
      on the head waters of the Mississippi, call for the continued
      interposition of the friendly influence of the government on that
      remote part of our north-western frontier. It has been long known
      that desperate and deep-rooted feuds continue to harass the tribes
      whose local position brings them into frequent contact. These contests
      operate to divert their attention from hunting, and to abstract their
      minds from objects essential to their well-being. They embarrass every
      effort to better their condition. They repel the advance of teachers.
      They deaden the effect of counsel. And by keeping the Indian mind in a
      state of perpetual alarm, destroy its capacities of healthful action.
      Every year is giving new proofs of the inveteracy of their hatred for
      each other, and the deteriorating effects of cultivating, as they do,
      the passion for warlike achievement. It is destructive to the industry
      of the young, and paralyzing to the counsels of the old.</p>

    <p>The effect of the expedition ordered by the government last year, into
      the country of the Chippewas, is believed to have been efficacious in
      checking this spirit of predatory warfare, and impressing upon their
      minds the true character of our government, its benevolent intentions
      towards them, and its watchfulness, power, and resources. It was not
      practicable, however, to go over the whole area proposed to be visited,
      the effect of the expedition having been directed exclusively to the
      bands located south of the latitude of St. Anthony’s Falls. It is
      believed that a similar mission to the tribes of the Upper Mississippi,
      living north of that point in our geography, would result in effects
      equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> useful to them and to the government. And I therefore submit
      to the Department the propriety of authorizing it.</p>

    <p>Additional weight is given to the reasons applicable to this subject,
      by the increased hazards at which the trade of our citizens is
      conducted in that quarter, and the influence they have to contend with,
      from the proximity of a foreign and a rival frontier. The agents of
      the Hudson’s Bay Company are wakeful and active opponents, and there
      is reason to believe that the measure of control which they exercise
      over the Indian population, is irrespective of an imaginary territorial
      line. At any rate, our traders complain loudly of infractions and
      losses from this source. Merely to visit the Indians and the traders at
      their posts, will be to encourage and to sustain them.</p>

    <p>It is proposed to perform the journey in a single canoe, manned by
      <i>engages</i>, accompanied with an escort of soldiers, and with such
      auxiliary aid from the native population as may be necessary. It would
      give additional utility to the effort, if the Engineer Department
      should judge proper to subjoin an officer to take observations
      for latitude, and to collect the materials for a correct map. The
      moral condition of the native population is such as to render it an
      interesting field for evangelical observation, and I propose to offer
      to a clergyman in the service of the A. B. F. Missions, now on the
      frontier, the opportunity of exploring it.</p>

    <p>The route from the head of Lake Superior will extend, through the River
      St. Louis and its connecting waters, to the Mississippi at Sandy Lake,
      and by the way of Leech Lake to the sources of the Mississippi. From
      the point where navigation is checked a portage is proposed to be made
      into Red Lake (a remote tributary of Hudson’s Bay). And the route by
      Ottertail Lake, and the river De Corbeau, will be pursued so as to
      re-enter the Mississippi at the confluence of the latter. Thence by
      the Falls of St. Anthony to St. Peters, and through the St. Croix, the
      Chippewa, or the Wisconsin, to the lakes. Circumstances may require
      changes in this programme.</p>

    <p>The extent of the country to be traversed requires an early departure
      from this place, and the toil of interior transportation makes it
      desirable that as little baggage, and as few men, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> be taken,
      as may suffice for the certain accomplishment of the object. Under
      this view of the subject, I have prepared a detailed estimate of
      expenditures, on an economical scale, which is herewith submitted.</p>

    <p>Your letter of February 13th has been received, and its general
      views are approved. The Secretary of War deems it important that you
      should proceed to the country upon the heads of the Mississippi, and
      visit as many of the Indians in that, and the intermediate region, as
      circumstances will permit. Reports have reached the Department from
      various quarters, that the Indians upon our frontiers are in an unquiet
      state, and that there is a prospect of extensive hostilities among
      themselves. It is no less the dictate of humanity than of policy, to
      repress this feeling, and to establish permanent peace among these
      tribes. It is also important to inspect the condition of the trade
      in that remote country, and the conduct of the traders. To ascertain
      whether the laws and regulations are complied with, and to suggest
      such alterations as may be required. And generally to inquire into the
      numbers, situations, dispositions, and prospects of the Indians, and
      to report all the statistical facts you can procure, and which will be
      useful to the government in its operations, or to the community in the
      investigation of these subjects.</p>

    <p>In addition to these objects, you will direct your attention to
      the vaccination of the Indians. An act for that purpose has passed
      Congress, and you are authorized to take a surgeon with you. The
      compensation fixed by law is six dollars per day, but this includes all
      the expenses. As the surgeon with you must necessarily be transported
      and subsisted at the public expense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span> the whole sum of six dollars
      per day will be allowed for this service, but of that sum only three
      dollars per day will be paid to the surgeon, and the residue will be
      applied to the expenses of the expedition.</p>

    <p>Vaccine matter, prepared and put up by the surgeon-general, is herewith
      transmitted to you; and you will, upon your whole route, explain to
      the Indians the advantages of vaccination, and endeavour to persuade
      them to submit to the process. You will keep and report an account of
      the number, ages, sex, tribe, and local situation of the Indians who
      may be vaccinated, and also of the prevalence, from time to time, of
      the small-pox among them, and of its effects as far as these can be
      ascertained.</p>

    <p>The following sums will be allowed for the expenses of the expedition,

    <p>I arrived at this place yesterday from the sources of the Mississippi,
      having visited the Chippewa bands and trading-posts in that quarter.
      Much complaint is made respecting the conduct of the persons licensed
      by you last year, who located themselves at the Granite Rocks, and
      on the St. Croix. No doubt can exist that each of them took in, and
      used in their trade, a considerable quantity of whiskey. And I am now
      enabled to say, that they each located themselves at points within the
      limits of my agency,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> where there are no trading-posts established.
      My lowest trading-post on the Mississippi, is the Pierced Prairie,
      eighteen miles below the mouth of the De Corbeau. It embraces one mile
      square, upon which traders are required to be located. On the St.
      Croix, the posts established and confirmed by the Department are Snake
      River and Yellow River, and embrace each, as the permanent place of
      location, one mile square. I report these facts for your information,
      and not to enable you to grant licenses for these posts, as the
      instructions of the Department give to each agent the exclusive control
      of the subject of granting licenses for the respective agencies.</p>

    <p>Much solicitude is felt by me to exclude ardent spirits wholly from
      the Chippewas and Ottowas, the latter of whom have, by a recent order,
      been placed under my charge. I am fully satisfied that ardent spirits
      are not necessary to the successful prosecution of the trade, that
      they are deeply pernicious to the Indians, and that both their use and
      abuse is derogatory to the character of a wise and sober government.
      Their exclusion in every shape, and every quantity, is an object of
      primary moment; and it is an object which I feel it a duty to persevere
      in the attainment of, however traders may bluster. I feel a reasonable
      confidence in stating, that no whiskey has been used in my agency
      during the last two years, except the limited quantity taken by special
      permission of the Secretary of War, for the trade of the Hudson’s Bay
      lines; and saving also the quantity clandestinely introduced from
      Prairie du Chien and St. Peters.</p>

    <p>I know, sir, that an appeal to you on this subject cannot be lost, and
      that your feelings and judgment fully approve of temperance measures.
      But it requires active, persevering, unyielding efforts. And in all
      such efforts, judiciously urged, I am satisfied that the government
      will sustain the agents in a dignified discharge of their duties. Let
      us proceed in the accomplishment of this object with firmness, and
      with a determination never to relinquish it, until ardent spirits are
      entirely excluded from the Indian country.</p>

    <div><span class="ml30">I am sir,</span><br />

    <p>P.S. Capt. Jouett, commanding at this post, has recently seized
      sixteen kegs of high-wines. His prompt, decisive, and correct conduct
      in this, and other transactions relating to Indian affairs, merit the
      approbation of government.</p>

    <p>I have now the honor, through your intervention, to forward to the
      Department my report of the late tour through the Huron Territory.
      It has not been possible to prepare the map referred to in season to
      accompany the report, but it will be forwarded as soon as it can be
      completed. In the mean time, I send a sketch of portions of the country
      intermediate between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, from which you
      will be enabled to trace my particular route, and the location of the
      principal streams, lakes, and villages. The imperfect state of public
      information respecting the geography of this region, and the numerous
      errors which still continue to characterize our maps, render something
      of this kind essential.</p>

    <p>With the limited means assigned for the accomplishment of the object,
      it became necessary that every moment of time should be used in
      pushing forward. This will account for the great space travelled in a
      comparatively short time. I am of the opinion, however, that little
      or nothing has been lost from the efficacy of the movement by its
      celerity. Lakes, rivers, and villages succeeded each other, with short
      intervals. But, in ascending each river, in crossing each lake and
      portage, the object of the expedition was definitely impressed upon the
      natives who witnessed our progress; and it was acquiesced in by the
      chiefs and warriors, at the several councils which I held with them.
      For a general detail of these councils, the report may be consulted.</p>

    <p>It will be perceived that new topics for discussion arose from a
      recent misunderstanding between the Chippewas and Menomonies; and from
      the uncertainty as to the spot where the boundary line between the
      Chippewas and Sioux strikes the falls on the Red Cedar fork, agreeably
      to a just construction of the treaty of Prairie du Chien of 1825. With
      respect to the first, I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> of opinion that time will only serve to
      increase the difficulty of restoring a perfect understanding.</p>

    <p>The line on the Red Cedar is important, as opposing an obstacle to a
      firm peace between the Sioux and Chippewas; and I doubt whether any
      steps could be taken by the government to induce them to live peaceably
      near each other, with so little cost of time and money as the taking
      post, with a small military force, on the frontier in dispute, at some
      suitable point between Prairie du Chien and St. Peters. With this
      impression, I have brought the subject to the consideration of the
      Secretary of War; and I shall be gratified, if, on a review of it, you
      shall concur in opinion with,</p>

    <p>In compliance with instructions to endeavour to terminate the
      hostilities between the Chippewas and Sioux, I proceeded into the
      Chippewa country with thirteen men in two canoes, having the necessary
      provisions and presents for the Indians, an interpreter, a physician
      to attend the sick, and a person in charge of the provisions and other
      public property. The commanding officer of Fort Brady furnished me
      with an escort of ten soldiers, under the command of a lieutenant;
      and I took with me a few Chippewas, in a canoe provided with oars, to
      convey a part of the provisions. A flag was procured for each canoe. I
      joined the expedition at the head of the portage, at this place, on the
      25th of June; and, after visiting the Chippewa villages in the belt of
      country between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, in latitudes 44° to
      70°, returned on the 4th of September, having been absent seventy-two
      days, and travelled a line of country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> estimated to be two thousand
      three hundred and eight miles. I have now the honor to report to you
      the route pursued, the means employed to accomplish the object, and
      such further measures as appear to me to be necessary to give effect
      to what has been done, and to ensure a lasting peace between the two
      tribes.</p>

    <p>Reasons existed for not extending the visit to the Chippewa bands
      on the extreme Upper Mississippi, on Red Lake, and Red River, and
      the river De Corbeau. After entering Lake Superior, and traversing
      its southern shores to Point Chegoimegon and the adjacent cluster of
      islands, I ascended the Mauvaise River to a portage of 8¾ miles
      into the Kaginogumac or Long Water Lake. This lake is about eight
      miles long, and of very irregular width. Thence, by a portage of 280
      yards, into Turtle Lake; thence, by a portage of 1,075 yards, into
      Clary’s Lake, so called; thence, by a portage of 425 yards, into Lake
      Polyganum; and thence, by a portage of 1,050 yards, into the Namakagon
      River, a branch of the river St. Croix of the Upper Mississippi. The
      distance from Lake Superior to this spot is, by estimation, 124 miles.</p>

    <p>We descended the Namakagon to the Pukwaewa, a rice lake, and a Chippewa
      village of eight permanent lodges, containing a population of 53
      persons, under a local chief called Odabossa. We found here gardens
      of corn, potatoes, and pumpkins, in a very neat state of cultivation.
      The low state of the water, and the consequent difficulty of the
      navigation, induced me to leave the provisions and stores at this
      place, in charge of Mr. Woolsey, with directions to proceed (with part
      of the men, and the aid of the Indians) to <i>Lac Courtorielle</i> or
      Ottowa Lake, and there await my arrival. I then descended the Namakagon
      in a light canoe, to its discharge into the St. Croix, and down the
      latter to Yellow River, the site of a trading-post and an Indian
      village, where I had, by runners, appointed a council. In this trip
      I was accompanied by Mr. Johnson, sub-agent, acting as interpreter,
      and by Dr. Houghton, adjunct professor of the Rensselaer school. We
      reached Yellow River on the 1st of August, and found the Indians
      assembled. After terminating the business of the council (of which I
      shall presently mention the results), I re-ascended the St. Croix and
      the Namakagon to the portage which inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>venes between the latter and
      Lac Courtorielle. The first of the series of carrying-places is about
      three miles in length, and terminates at the Lake of the Isles (<i>Lac
      des Isles</i>); after crossing which, a portage of 750 yards leads to
      <i>Lac du Gres</i>. This lake has a navigable outlet into Ottowa Lake,
      where I rejoined the advanced party (including Lieutenant Clary’s
      detachment) on the 5th of August.</p>

    <p>Ottowa Lake is a considerable expanse of water, being about twelve
      miles long, with irregular but elevated shores. A populous Chippewa
      village and a trading-post are located at its outlet, and a numerous
      Indian population subsists in the vicinity. It is situated in a
      district of country which abounds in rice lakes, has a proportion of
      prairie or burnt land, caused by the ravages of fire, and, in addition
      to the small fur-bearing animals, has several of the deer species. It
      occupies, geographically, a central situation, being intermediate,
      and commanding the communications between the St. Croix and Chippewa
      Rivers, and between Lake Superior and the Upper Mississippi. It is
      on the great slope of land descending towards the latter, enjoys a
      climate of comparative mildness, and yields, with fewer and shorter
      intervals of extreme want, the means of subsistence to a population
      which is still essentially erratic. These remarks apply, with some
      modifications, to the entire range of country (within the latitudes
      mentioned) situated west and south of the high lands circumscribing the
      waters of Lake Superior. The outlet of this Lake (Ottowa) is a fork of
      Chippewa River, called Ottowa River.</p>

    <p>I had intended to proceed from this lake, either by following down
      the Ottowa branch to its junction with the main Chippewa, and then
      ascending the latter into <i>Lac du Flambeau</i>, or by descending the
      Ottowa branch only to its junction with the North-West fork, called
      the Ochasowa River; and, ascending the latter to a portage of sixty
      <i>pauses</i>, into the Chippewa River. By the latter route time and
      distance would have been saved, and I should, in either way, have
      been enabled to proceed from <i>Lac du Flambeau</i> to Green Bay by
      an easy communication into the Upper Ouisconsin, and from the latter
      into the Menomonie River, or by Plover Portage into Wolf River. This
      was the route I had designed to go on quitting Lake Superior; but, on
      consulting my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> Indian maps, and obtaining at Ottowa Lake the best and
      most recent information of the distance and the actual state of the
      water, I found neither of the foregoing routes practicable, without
      extending my time so far as to exhaust my supplies. I was finally
      determined to relinquish the <i>Lac du Flambeau</i> route, by learning
      that the Indians of that place had dispersed, and by knowing that a
      considerable delay would be caused by reassembling them.</p>

    <p>The homeward route by the Mississippi was now the most eligible,
      particularly as it would carry me through a portion of country occupied
      by the Chippewas, in a state of hostility with the Sioux, and cross the
      disputed line at the mill. Two routes, to arrive at the Mississippi,
      were before me—either to follow down the outlet of Ottowa Lake to its
      junction with the Chippewa, and ascend the latter to its mouth, or
      to quit the Ottowa Lake branch at an intermediate point, and, after
      ascending a small and very serpentine tributary, to cross a portage of
      6,000 yards into Lake Chetac. I pursued the latter route.</p>

    <p>Lake Chetac is a sheet of water about six miles in length, and it has
      several islands, on one of which is a small Chippewa village and a
      trading-post. This lake is the main source of Red Cedar River (called
      sometimes the <i>Folle Avoine</i>), a branch of the Chippewa River.
      It receives a brook at its head from the direction of the portage,
      which admits empty canoes to be conveyed down it two <i>pauses</i>,
      but is then obstructed with logs. It is connected by a shallow outlet
      with Weegwos Lake, a small expanse which we crossed with paddles in
      twenty-five minutes. The passage from the latter is so shallow, that
      a portage of 1,295 yards is made into Balsam of Fir or <i>Sapin</i>
      Lake. The baggage is carried this distance, but the canoes are brought
      through the stream. Sapin Lake is also small; we were thirty minutes
      in crossing it. Below this point, the river again expands into a
      beautiful sheet of water, called Red Cedar Lake, which we were an hour
      in passing; and afterward into <i>Bois Francois</i>, or Rice Lake. At
      the latter place, at the distance of perhaps sixty miles from its head,
      I found the last fixed village of Chippewas on this stream, although
      the hunting camps, and other signs of temporary occupation, were more
      numerous below than on any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span> part of the stream. This may be
      attributed to the abundance of the Virginia deer in that vicinity, many
      of which we saw, and of the elk and moose, whose tracks were fresh
      and numerous in the sands of the shore. Wild rice is found in all the
      lakes. Game, of every species common to the latitude, is plentiful. The
      prairie country extends itself into the vicinity of Rice Lake; and for
      more than a day’s march before reaching the mouth of the river, the
      whole face of the country puts on a sylvan character, as beautiful to
      the eye as it is fertile in soil, and spontaneously productive of the
      means of subsistence. A country more valuable to a population having
      the habits of our North-Western Indians, could hardly be conceived of;
      and it is therefore cause of less surprise that its possession should
      have been so long an object of contention between the Chippewas and
      Sioux.</p>

    <p>About sixty miles below Rice Lake commences a series of rapids, which
      extend, with short intervals, 24 miles. The remainder of the distance,
      to the junction of this stream with the Chippewa, consists of deep
      and strong water. The junction itself is characterized by commanding
      and elevated grounds, and a noble expanse of waters. And the Chippewa
      River, from this spot to its entrance into the Mississippi, has a depth
      and volume, and a prominence of scenery, which mark it to be inferior
      to none, and superior to most of the larger tributaries of the Upper
      Mississippi. Before its junction, it is separated into several mouths,
      from the principal of which the observer can look into Lake Pepin.
      Steamboats could probably ascend to the falls.</p>

    <p>The whole distance travelled, from the shores of Lake Superior to
      the mouth of the Chippewa, is, by estimation, 643 miles, of which
      138 should be deducted for the trip to Yellow River, leaving the
      direct practicable route 505 miles. The length of the Mauvaise to the
      portage is 104; of the Namakagon, from the portage, 161; of the Red
      Cedar, 170; of the Chippewa, from the entrance of the latter, 40. Our
      means of estimating distances was by time, corrected by reference to
      the rapidity of water and strength of wind, compared with our known
      velocity of travelling in calm weather on the lakes. These estimates
      were made and put down every evening, and considerable confidence is
      felt in them. The courses were accurately kept by a canoe compass.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
      I illustrate my report of this part of the route by a map protracted
      by Dr. Houghton. On this map our places of encampment, the sites and
      population of the principal Indian villages, the trading-posts, and the
      boundary lines between the Sioux and Chippewa, are indicated. And I
      refer you to it for several details which are omitted in this report.</p>

    <p>The present state of the controversy between the Sioux and the
      Chippewas will be best inferred from the facts that follow. In
      stating them, I have deemed it essential to preserve the order of my
      conferences with the Indians, and to confine myself, almost wholly, to
      results.</p>

    <p>Along the borders of Lake Superior, comparatively little alarm was
      felt from the hostile relation with the Sioux. But I found them well
      informed of the state of the difficulties, and the result of the
      several war-parties that had been sent out the last year. A system of
      information and advice is constantly kept up by runners; and there is
      no movement meditated on the Sioux borders, which is not known and
      canvassed by the lake bands.</p>

    <p>They sent warriors to the scene of conflict last year, in consequence
      of the murder committed by the Sioux on the St. Croix. Their sufferings
      from hunger during the winter, and the existence of disease at Torch
      Lake (<i>Lac du Flambeau</i>), and some other places, together with
      the entire failure of the rice crop, had produced effects, which
      were depicted by them and by the traders in striking colours. They
      made these sufferings the basis of frequent and urgent requests for
      provisions. This theme was strenuously dwelt upon. Whatever other gifts
      they asked for, they never omitted the gift of food. They made it their
      first, their second, and their third request.</p>

    <p>At Chegoimegon, on Lake Superior (or La Pointe, emphatically so
      called), I held my first and stated council with the Indians. This is
      the ancient seat of the Chippewa power in this quarter. It is a central
      and commanding point, with respect to the country lying north, and
      west, and south of it. It appears to be the focus from which, as radii
      from a centre, the ancient population emigrated; and the interior bands
      consequently look back to it with something of the feelings of parental
      relation. News from the frontiers flies back to it with a celerity
      which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> peculiar to the Indian mode of express. I found here, as I
      had expected, the fullest and most recent information from the lines.
      Mozojeed, the principal man at Ottawa Lake, had recently visited them
      for the purpose of consultation; but returned on the alarm of an attack
      upon his village.</p>

    <p>The Indians listened with attention to the message transmitted to them
      from the President, and to the statements with which it was enforced.
      Pezhickee, the venerable and respected chief of the place, was their
      speaker in reply. He lamented the war, and admitted the folly of
      keeping it up; but it was carried on by the Chippewas in self-defence,
      and by volunteer parties of young men, acting without the sanction
      of the old chiefs. He thought the same remark due to the elder Sioux
      chiefs, who probably did not sanction the crossing of the lines, but
      could not restrain their young men. He lived, he said, in an isolated
      situation, did not mingle in the interior broils, and did not deem
      himself responsible for acts done out of his own village, and certainly
      not for the acts of the villages of Torch Lake, Ottawa Lake, and the
      St. Croix. He had uniformly advised his people to sit still and remain
      at peace, and he believed that none of his young men had joined the
      war-parties of last year. The government, he said, should have his
      hearty co-operation in restoring peace. He referred to the sub-agency
      established here in 1826, spoke of its benefits, and wished to know why
      the agent had been withdrawn, and whether he would be instructed to
      return? In the course of his reply, he said, that formerly, when the
      Indians lived under the British government, they were usually told what
      to do, and in very distinct terms. But they were now at a loss. From
      what had been said and done at the treaty of Fond du Lac, he expected
      the care and protection of the American government, and that they
      would advance towards, instead of (as in the case of the sub-agency)
      withdrawing from them. He was rather at a loss for our views respecting
      the Chippewas, and he wished much for my advice in their affairs.</p>

    <p>I thought it requisite to make a distinct reply to this point. I
      told him that when they lived under the British Government, they
      were justified in shaping their course according to the advice they
      received; but that, on the transfer of the country, their allegiance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
      was transferred with it. And when our government hoisted its flag
      at Mackinac (1796), it expected from the Indians living within our
      boundaries the respect due to it; and it acknowledged, at the same
      time, the reciprocal obligations of care and protection. That it always
      aimed to fulfil these obligations, of which facts within his own
      knowledge and memory would afford ample proofs. I referred him to the
      several efforts the government had made to establish a lasting peace
      between the Chippewas and Sioux; for which purpose the President had
      sent one of his principal men (alluding to Gov. Cass), in 1820, who
      had visited their most extreme north-western villages, and induced
      themselves and the Sioux to smoke the pipe of peace together at St.
      Peters. In accordance with these views, and acting on the information
      then acquired, the President had established an agency for their
      tribe at Sault Ste. Marie, in 1822. That, in 1825, he had assembled
      at Prairie du Chien all the tribes who were at variance on the Upper
      Mississippi, and persuaded them to make peace, and, as one of the best
      means of ensuring its permanency, had fixed the boundaries of their
      lands. Seeing that the Chippewas and Sioux still continued a harassing
      and useless contest, he had sent me to remind them of this peace and
      these boundaries, which, I added. you, Perikee, yourself agreed to,
      and signed, in my presence. I come to bring you back to the terms of
      this treaty. Are not these proofs of his care and attention? Are not
      these clear indications of his views respecting the Chippewas? The
      chief was evidently affected by this recital. The truth appeared to
      strike him forcibly; and he said, in a short reply. that he was now
      <i>advised</i>; that he would hereafter feel himself to be advised, &amp;c.
      He made some remarks on the establishment of a mission school. &amp;c.,
      which, being irrelevant, are omitted. He presented a pipe, with an
      ornamented stem. as a token of his friendship, and his desire of peace.</p>

    <p>I requested him to furnish messengers to take belts of wampum and
      tobacco, with three separate messages, viz. to Yellow River, to Ottawa
      Lake, and to Lac du Flambeau, or Torch Lake; and also, as the water
      was low, to aid me in the ascent of the Mauvaise River. and to supply
      guides for each of the military canoes, as the soldiers would here
      leave their barge, and were unacquainted with the difficulties of the
      ascent. He accordingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> sent his oldest son (Che-che-gwy-ung) and
      another person, with the messages, by a direct trail. leading into the
      St. Croix country. He also furnished several young Chippewas to aid
      us on the Mauvaise, and to carry baggage on the long portage into the
      first intermediate lake west of that stream.</p>

    <p>After the distribution of presents, I left Chegoimegon on the 18th
      July. The first party of Indians met at the Namakagon, belonging to a
      Chippewa village called Pukwaewa, having, as its geographical centre
      and trading-post, Ottowa Lake. As I had directed part of the expedition
      to precede me there, during my journey to Yellow River, I requested
      these Indians to meet me at Ottowa Lake, and assist in conveying the
      stores and provisions to that place—a service which they cheerfully
      performed. On ascending the lower part of the Namakagon, I learned that
      my messenger from Lake Superior had passed, and on reaching Yellow
      River, I found the Indians assembled and waiting. They were encamped
      on an elevated ridge, called Pekogunagun, or the Hip Bone, and fired
      a salute from its summit. Several of the neighbouring Indians came in
      after my arrival. Others, with their chiefs, were hourly expected. I
      did not deem it necessary for all to come in, but proceeded to lay
      before them the objects of my visit, and to solicit their co-operation
      in an attempt to make a permanent peace with the Sioux, whose borders
      we then were near. Kabamappa, the principal chief, not being a speaker,
      responded to my statements and recommendations through another person
      (Sha-ne-wa-gwun-ai-be). He said that the Sioux were of bad faith;
      that they never refused to smoke the pipe of peace with them, and
      they never failed to violate the promise of peace thus solemnly made.
      He referred to an attack they made last year on a band of Chippewas
      and half-breeds, and the murder of four persons. Perpetual vigilance
      was required to meet these inroads. Yet he could assert, fearlessly,
      that no Chippewa war-party from the St. Croix had crossed the Sioux
      line for years; that the murder he had mentioned was committed within
      the Chippewa lines; and although it was said at the treaty of Prairie
      du Chien that the first aggressor of territorial rights should be
      punished, neither punishment was inflicted by the government, nor had
      any atonement or apology thus far been made for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> act by the Sioux.
      He said his influence had been exerted in favour of peace; that he had
      uniformly advised both chiefs and warriors to this effect; and he stood
      ready now to do whatever it was reasonable he should do on the subject.</p>

    <p>I told him it was not a question of recrimination that was before us.
      It was not even necessary to go into the inquiry of who had spilt the
      first blood since the treaty of Prairie du Chien. The treaty had been
      violated. The lines had been crossed. Murders had been committed by the
      Chippewas and by the Sioux. These murders had reached the ears of the
      President, and he was resolved to put a stop to them. I did not doubt
      but that the advice of the old chiefs, on each side, had been pacific.
      I did not doubt but that his course had been <i>particularly</i> so.
      But rash young men, of each party, had raised the war-club; and when
      they could not go openly, they went secretly. A stop must be put to
      this course, and it was necessary the first movement should be made
      <i>somewhere</i>. It was proper it should be made here, and be made
      at this time. Nothing could be lost by it; much might be gained; and
      if a negotiation was opened with the Sioux chiefs while I remained, I
      would second it by sending an explanatory message to the chiefs and to
      their agent. I recommended that Kabamappa and Shakoba, the war-chief
      of Snake River, should send jointly wampum and tobacco to the Petite
      Corbeau and to Wabisha, the leading Sioux chiefs on the Mississippi,
      inviting them to renew the league of friendship, and protesting their
      own sincerity in the offer. I concluded, by presenting him with a flag,
      tobacco, wampum, and ribands, to be used in the negotiation. After a
      consultation, he said he would not only send the messages, but, as he
      now had the protection of a flag, he would himself go with the chief
      Shakoba to the Petite Corbeau’s village. I accompanied these renewed
      offers of peace with explanatory messages, in my own name, to Petite
      Corbeau and to Wabisha, and a letter to Mr. Taliaferro, the Indian
      agent at St. Peter’s, informing him of these steps, and soliciting his
      co-operation. A copy of this letter is hereunto annexed. I closed the
      council by the distribution of presents; after which the Indians called
      my attention to the conduct of their trader, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Information was given me immediately after my arrival at Yel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>low River,
      that Neenaba, a popular war-leader from the Red Cedar fork of Chippewa
      River, had very recently danced the war-dance with thirty men at Rice
      Lake of Yellow River, and that his object was to enlist the young men
      of that place in a war-party against the Sioux. I also learned that my
      message for Ottowa Lake had been promptly transmitted through Neenaba,
      whom I was now anxious to see. I lost not an hour in re-ascending the
      St. Croix and the Namakagon. I purchased two additional canoes of
      the Indians, and distributed my men in them, to lighten the draught
      of water, and facilitate the ascent; and, by pushing early and late,
      we reached Ottowa Lake on the fifth day in the morning. Neenaba had,
      however, delivered his message, and departed. I was received in a very
      friendly and welcome manner, by Mozojeed, of the band of Ottowa Lake;
      Wabezhais, of the Red Devil’s band of the South Pukwaewa; and Odabossa,
      of the Upper Namakagon. After passing the usual formalities, I prepared
      to meet them in council the same day, and communicate to them the
      objects of my mission.</p>

    <p>In the course of the conference at this place, I obtained the
      particulars of a dispute which had arisen between the Chippewas of this
      quarter, which now added to their alarm, as they feared the latter
      would act in coincidence with their ancient enemies, the Sioux. The
      reports of this disturbance had reached me at the Sault, and they
      continued, with some variations, until my arrival here. The following
      are the material facts in relation to this new cause of disquietude: In
      the summer of 1827, Okunzhewug, an old woman, the wife of Kishkemun,
      the principal chief of Torch Lake, a man superannuated and blind;
      attended the treaty of Butte des Morts, bearing her husband’s medal.
      She was treated with the respect due to the character she represented,
      and ample presents were directed to be given to her; among other
      things a handsome hat. The latter article had been requested of her
      by a young Menomonie, and refused. It is thought a general feeling
      of jealousy was excited by her good reception. A number of the
      Menomonies went on her return route as far as the Clover Portage,
      where she was last seen. Having never returned to her village, the
      Chippewas attributed her death to the Menomonies. Her husband died
      soon after; but she had numerous and influential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> relatives to avenge
      her real or supposed murder. This is the account delivered by the
      Chippewas, and it is corroborated by reports from the traders of that
      section of the country. Her singular disappearance and secret death
      at the Clover Portage, is undisputed; and whether caused or not by
      any agency of the Menomonies, the belief of such agency, and that of
      the most direct kind, is fixed in the minds of the Chippewas, and
      has furnished the basis of their subsequent acts in relation to the
      Menomonie hunting-parties who have visited the lower part of Chippewa
      River. Two women belonging to one of these parties were killed by a
      Chippewa war-party traversing that part of the country the ensuing
      year. The act was disclaimed by them as not being intentional, and
      it was declared they supposed the women to be Sioux.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> On a close
      inquiry, however, I found the persons who committed this act were
      relatives of Okunzewug, which renders it probable that the murder was
      intentionally perpetrated. This act further widened the breach between
      the two hitherto fraternal tribes; and the Chippewas of this quarter
      began to regard the Menomonie hunting-parties, who entered the mouth
      of the Chippewa River, as intruders on their lands. Among a people
      whose means of verbal information is speedy, and whose natural sense of
      right and wrong is acute, the more than usual friendship and apparent
      alliance which have taken place between the Menomonies and Sioux, in
      the contest between the Sacs and Foxes, and the murder by them jointly
      of the Fox chief White Skin and his companions at a smoking council,
      in 1830, have operated to increase the feeling of distrust; so much
      so, that it was openly reported at Chegoimegon, at Yellow River, and
      Ottowa Lake, that the Menomonies had formed a league with the Sioux
      against the Chippewas also, and they were fearful of an attack from
      them. A circumstance that had given point to this fear, and made it
      a subject of absorbing interest, when I arrived at Ottowa Lake, was
      the recent murder of a Menomonie chief by a Chippewa of that quarter,
      and the demand of satisfaction which had been made (it was sometimes
      said) by the Indian agent at Prairie du Chien, and sometimes by the
      commanding officer, with a threat to march <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>troops into the country.
      This demand, I afterward learned from the Indians at Rice Lake, and
      from a conversation with General Street, the agent at Prairie du Chien,
      had not been made, either by himself or by the commanding officer;
      and the report had probably arisen from a conversation held by a
      subaltern officer in command of a wood or timber-party near the mouth
      of the Chippewa River, with some Chippewas who were casually met. Its
      effects, however, were to alarm them, and to lead them to desire a
      reconciliation with the Menomonies. I requested them to lose no time
      in sending tobacco to the Menomonies, and adjusting this difference.
      Mozojeed observed that the murder of the Menomonie had been committed
      by a person <i>non compos</i>, and he deplored the folly of it, and
      disclaimed all agency in it for himself and his band. The murderer, I
      believe, belonged to his band; he desired a reconciliation. He also
      said the measures adopted at Yellow River, to bring about a firm peace
      with the Sioux, had his fullest approbation, and that nothing on his
      part should be wanting to promote a result in every view so wise and so
      advantageous to the Indians. In this sentiment, Wabezhais and Odabossa,
      who made distinct speeches, also concurred. They confirmed their words
      by pipes, and all the assembly made an audible assent. I invested
      Mozojeed with a flag and a medal, that he might exert the influence
      he has acquired among the Indians beneficially for them and for us,
      and that his hands might thus be officially strengthened to accomplish
      the work of pacification. I then distributed presents to the chiefs,
      warriors, women, and children, in the order of their being seated, and
      immediately embarked, leaving them under a lively and enlivened sense
      of the good-will and friendship of the American government, on this
      first official visit to them, and with a sincere disposition, so far as
      could be judged, to act in obedience to its expressed and known wishes.</p>

    <p>The Indians at Torch Lake being dispersed, and my message to them
      not having been delivered, from this uncertainty of their location,
      I should have found reasons for not proceeding in that direction,
      independent of the actual and known difficulties of the route at that
      time. I was still apprehensive that my appearance had not wholly
      disconcerted the war-party of Neenaba, and lost no time in proceeding
      to his village on the Red Cedar fork. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> found the village at Lake
      Chetac, which in 1824 was 217 strong, almost totally deserted, and the
      trading-house burnt. Scattering Indians were found along the river. The
      mutual fear of interruption was such that Mr. B. Cadotte, sen., the
      trader at Ottowa Lake, thought it advisable to follow in our train for
      the purpose of collecting his credits at Rice Lake.</p>

    <p>While at breakfast on the banks of Sapin Lake, a returning war-party
      entered the opposite side of it: they were evidently surprised, and
      they stopped. After reconnoitring us, they were encouraged to advance,
      at first warily, and afterward with confidence. There were eight
      canoes, with two men in each; each man had a gun, war-club, knife,
      and ammunition bag: there was nothing else except the apparatus for
      managing the canoe. They were all young men, and belonged to the
      vicinity of Ottowa Lake. Their unexpected appearance at this place gave
      me the first information that the war-party at Neenaba had been broken
      up. They reported that some of their number had been near the mill,
      and that they had discovered signs of the Sioux being out in the moose
      having been driven up, &amp;c. In a short conference, I recited to them
      the purpose of the council at Ottowa Lake, and referred them to their
      chiefs for particulars, enjoining their acquiescence in the proposed
      measures.</p>

    <p>I found at Rice Lake a band of Chippewas, most of them young men,
      having a prompt and martial air, encamped in a very compact form, and
      prepared, at a moment’s notice, for action. They saluted our advance
      with a smartness and precision of firing that would have done honour
      to drilled troops. Neenaba was absent on a hunting-party; but one of
      the elder men pointed out a suitable place for my encampment, as I
      intended here to put new bottoms to my bark canoes. He arrived in the
      evening, and visited my camp with forty-two men. This visit was one of
      ceremony merely; as it was late, I deferred any thing further until the
      following day. I remained at this place part of the 7th, the 8th, and
      until 3 o’clock on the 9th of August. And the following facts present
      the result of several conferences with this distinguished young man,
      whose influence is entirely of his own creation, and whose endowments,
      personal and mental, had not been misrepresented by the Indians on my
      route, who uniformly spoke of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> in favourable terms. He is located
      at the most advanced point towards the Sioux borders, and, although
      not in the line of ancient chiefs, upon him rests essentially the
      conduct of affairs in this quarter. I therefore deemed it important
      to acquire his confidence and secure his influence, and held frequent
      conversations with him. His manner was frank and bold, equally free
      from servility and repulsiveness. I drew his attention to several
      subjects. I asked him whether the sawmill on the lower part of the Red
      Cedar was located on Chippewa lands? He said, Yes. Whether it was built
      with the consent of the Chippewas? He said, No; it had been built, as
      it were, by stealth. I asked him if any thing had been subsequently
      given them in acknowledgment of their right to the soil? He said,
      No; that the only acknowledgment was their getting tobacco to smoke
      when they visited the mill: that the Sioux claimed it to be on their
      side of the line, but the Chippewas contended that their line ran to
      a certain bluff and brook below the mill. I asked him to draw a map
      of the lower part of Chippewa River, with all its branches, showing
      the exact lines as fixed by the treaty at Prairie du Chien, and as
      understood by them. I requested him to state the facts respecting the
      murder of the Menomonie, and the causes that led to it; and whether he
      or any of his band received any message from the agent or commanding
      officer at Prairie du Chien, demanding the surrender of the murderer?
      To the latter inquiry he answered promptly, No. He gave in his
      actual population at 142; but it is evident that a very considerable
      additional population, particularly in men, resort there for the
      purpose of hunting a part of the year.</p>

    <p>The day after my arrival, I prepared for and summoned the Indians to
      a council, with the usual formalities. I opened it by announcing the
      objects of my visit. Neenaba and his followers listened to the terms
      of the message, the means I had adopted to enforce it, and, finally,
      to the request of co-operation on the part of himself and band, with
      strict attention. He confined his reply to an expression of thanks;
      allusions to the peculiarity of his situation on an exposed frontier;
      and general sentiments of friendship. He appeared to be mentally
      embarrassed by my request to drop the war-club, on the successful use
      of which he had relied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> for his popularity, and whatever of real power
      he possessed. He often referred to his young men, over whom he claimed
      no superiority, and who appeared to be ardently attached to him. I
      urged the principal topic upon his attention, presenting it in several
      lights. I finally conferred on him, personally, a medal and flag, and
      directed the presents intended for his band to be laid, in gross,
      before him.</p>

    <p>After a pause, Neenaba got up, and spoke to the question, connecting it
      with obvious considerations, of which mutual rights, personal safety,
      and the obligation to protect the women and children, formed the basis.
      The latter duty was not a slight one. Last year the Sioux had killed
      a chief on the opposite shore of the lake, and, at the same time,
      decoyed two children, who were in a canoe, among the rice, and killed
      and beheaded them. He said, in allusion to the medal and flag, that
      these marks of honour were not necessary to secure his attention to any
      requests made by the American government. And after resuming his seat
      awhile (during which he overheard some remarks not pleasing to him,
      from an Indian on the opposite side of the ring), he finally got up and
      declined receiving them until they were eventually pressed upon him by
      the young warriors. Every thing appeared to proceed with great harmony,
      and the presents were quickly distributed by one of his men. It was
      not, however, until the next day, when my canoes were already put in
      the water, that he came with his entire party, to make his final reply,
      and to present the peace-pipe. He had thrown the flag over one arm,
      and held the war-club perpendicular in the other hand. He said, that
      although he accepted the one, he did not drop the other; he held fast
      to both. When he looked at the one, he should revert to the counsels
      with which it had been given, and he should aim to act upon those
      counsels; but he also deemed it necessary to hold fast the war-club;
      it was, however, with a determination to use it in defence, and not in
      attack. He had reflected upon the advice sent to the Chippewas by the
      President, and particularly that part of it which counselled them to
      sit still upon their lands; but while they sat still, they also wished
      to be certain that their enemies would sit still. And the pipe he was
      now about to offer, he offered with a request that it might be sent to
      the President, asking him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> to use his power to prevent the Sioux from
      crossing the lines. The pipe was then lit, handed round, the ashes
      knocked out, and a formal presentation of it made. This ceremony being
      ended, I shook hands with them, and immediately embarked.</p>

    <p>On the second day afterward, I reached the sawmill, the subject of
      such frequent allusion, and landed there at 7 o’clock in the morning.
      I found a Mr. Wallace in charge, who was employed, with ten men, in
      building a new dam on a brook of the Red Cedar, the freshet of last
      spring having carried away the former one. I inquired of him where the
      line between the Sioux and Chippewas crossed. He replied that the line
      crossed above the mill, he did not precisely know the place; adding,
      however, in the course of conversation, that he believed the land in
      this vicinity originally belonged to the Chippewas. He said it was
      seven years since any Sioux had visited the mill; and that the latter
      was owned by persons at Prairie du Chien.</p>

    <p>The rapids of the Red Cedar River extend (according to the estimates
      contained in my notes) about twenty-four miles. They commence a few
      miles below the junction of Meadow River, and terminate about two
      miles below the mills. This extension of falling water, referred to
      in the treaty as a fixed point, has led to the existing uncertainty.
      The country itself is of a highly valuable character for its soil,
      its game, its wild rice, and its wood. We found the butter-nut among
      those species which are locally included under the name of <i>Bois
      franc</i> by the traders. The land can, hereafter, be easily brought
      into cultivation, as it is interspersed with prairie; and its fine
      mill privileges will add to its value. Indeed, one mile square is
      intrinsically worth one hundred miles square of Chippewa country, in
      some other places.</p>

    <p>The present sawmills (there are two), are situated 65 miles from
      the banks of the Mississippi. They are owned exclusively by private
      citizens, and employed for their sole benefit. The boards are formed
      into rafts: and these rafts are afterward attached together, and
      floated down the Mississippi to St. Louis, where they command a good
      price. The business is understood to be a profitable one. For the
      privilege, no equivalent has been paid either to the Indians or to the
      United States. The first mill was built several years ago, and before
      the conclusion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span> treaty of Prairie du Chien, fixing boundaries to
      the lands. A permit was given for building, either verbal or written,
      as I have been informed, by a former commanding officer at Prairie
      du Chien. I make these statements in reference to a letter I have
      received from the Department since my return, but which is dated June
      27th, containing a complaint of one of the owners of the mill, that
      the Chippewas had threatened to burn it, and requesting me to take the
      necessary precautionary measures. I heard nothing of such a threat, but
      believe that the respect which the Chippewas have professed, through
      me, for the American government, and the influence of my visit among
      them, will prevent a resort to any measures of violence; and that they
      will wait the peaceable adjustment of the line on the rapids. I will
      add, that <i>wherever</i> that line may be determined, in a reasonable
      probability, to fall, the mill itself cannot be supplied with logs for
      any length of time, if <i>it is now so supplied</i>, without cutting
      them on Chippewa lands, and rafting them down the Red Cedar. Many
      of the logs heretofore sawed at this mill, have been rafted, <i>up
      stream</i>, to the mill. And I understood from the person in charge
      of it, that he was now anxious to ascertain new sites for chopping;
      that his expectations were directed up the stream, but that his
      actual knowledge of the country, in that direction, did not embrace a
      circumference of more than five miles.</p>

    <p>The line between the Chippewa and Sioux, as drawn on the MS. map of
      Neenaba, strikes the rapids on Red Cedar River at a brook and bluff a
      short distance below the mill. It proceeds thence, across the point
      of land between that branch of the main Chippewa, to an island in the
      latter; and thence, up stream, to the mouth of Clearwater River, as
      called for by the treaty, and from this point to the bluffs of the
      Mississippi valley (where it corners on Winnebago land), on Black
      River, and not to the “<i>mouth</i>” of Black River, as erroneously
      inserted in the 5th article of the treaty; the Chippewas never having
      advanced any claims to the lands at the mouth of Black River. This map,
      being drawn by a Chippewa of sense, influence, and respectability, an
      exact copy of it is herewith forwarded for the use of the Department,
      as embracing the opinions of the Chippewas on this point. The lines and
      geographical marks were drawn on paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span> by Neenaba himself, and the
      names translated and written down by Mr. Johnston.</p>

    <p>It is obvious that the adjustment of this line must precede a
      permanent peace on this part of the frontiers. The number of Chippewas
      particularly interested in it is, from my notes, 2,102; to which,
      911 may be added for certain bands on Lake Superior. It embraces 27
      villages, and the most influential civil and war chiefs of the region.
      The population is enterprising and warlike. They have the means of
      subsistence in <i>comparative</i> abundance. They are increasing in
      numbers. They command a ready access to the Mississippi by water, and
      a ready return from it by land. Habits of association have taught them
      to look upon this stream as the theatre of war. Their young men are
      carried into it as the natural and almost only means of distinction.
      And it is in coincidence with all observation, to say that they are
      now, as they were in the days of Captain Carver, the terror of the
      east bank of this river, between the St. Croix and Chippewa Rivers. No
      other tribe has now, or has had, within the memory of man, a village
      or permanent possession on this part of the shore. It is landed on
      in fear. It is often passed by other nations by stealth, and at
      night. Such is not an exaggerated picture. And with a knowledge of
      their geographical advantages, and numbers, and distribution, on the
      tributary streams, slight causes, it may be imagined, will often excite
      the young and thoughtless portion of them to raise the war-club, to
      chant the war-song, and follow the war-path.</p>

    <p>To remove these causes, to teach them the folly of such a contest, to
      remind them of the treaty stipulations and promises solemnly made to
      the government and to the Sioux, and to induce them to renew those
      promises, and to act on fixed principles of political faith, were
      the primary objects committed to me; and they were certainly objects
      of exalted attainment, according as well with the character of the
      government as with the spirit and moral and intellectual tone of the
      age. To these objects I have faithfully, as I believe, devoted the
      means at my command. And the Chippewas cannot, hereafter, err on the
      subject of their hostilities with the Sioux, without knowing that
      the error is dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>approved by the American government, and that a
      continuance in it will be visited upon them in measures of severity.</p>

    <p>Without indulging the expectation that my influence on the tour will
      have the effect to put an end to the spirit of predatory warfare, it
      may be asserted that this spirit has been checked and allayed; and
      that a state of feeling and reflection has been produced by it, which
      cannot fail to be beneficial to our relations with them, and to their
      relations with each other. The messages sent to the Sioux chiefs, may
      be anticipated to have resulted in restoring a perfect peace during the
      present fall and ensuing winter, and will thus leave to each party the
      undisturbed chase of their lands. The meditated blow of Steenaba was
      turned aside, and his war-party arrested and dispersed at the moment it
      was ready to proceed. Every argument was used to show them the folly
      and the insecurity of a continuance of the war. And the whole tenor and
      effect of my visit has been to inform and reform these remote bands.
      It has destroyed the charm of their seclusion. It has taught them that
      their conduct is under the supervision of the American government;
      that they depend on its care and protection; that no other government
      has power to regulate trade and send traders among them; finally, that
      an adherence to foreign counsels, and to antipacific maxims, can be
      visited upon them in measures of coercion. That their country, hitherto
      deemed nearly inaccessible, can be penetrated and traversed by men and
      troops, with baggage and provisions, even in midsummer, when the waters
      are lowest; and that, in proportion as they comply with political
      maxims, as benevolent as they are just, will they live at peace with
      their enemies, and have the means of subsistence for an increased
      population among themselves. The conduct of the traders in this
      quarter, and the influence they have exerted, both moral and political,
      cannot here be entered upon, and must be left to some other occasion,
      together with statistical details and other branches of information not
      arising from particular instructions.</p>

    <p>It may be said that the Indians upon the St. Croix and Chippewa Rivers,
      and their numerous branches, have been drawn into a close intercourse
      with government. But it will be obvious that a perseverance in the
      system of official advice and restraints, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span> essential to give
      permanence to the effects already produced, and to secure a firm and
      lasting peace between them and the Sioux. To this end the settlement
      of the line upon the Red Cedar fork is an object which claims the
      attention of the Department; and would justify, in my opinion, the
      calling together the parties interested, at some convenient spot near
      the junction of the Red Cedar River with the Chippewa. Indeed, the
      handsome elevation, and the commanding geographical advantages of this
      spot, render it one which, I think, might be advantageously occupied as
      a military post. Such an occupancy would have the effect to keep the
      parties at peace, and the point of land, on which the work is proposed
      to be erected, might be purchased from the Sioux, together with such
      part of the disputed lands near the mills as might be deemed necessary
      to quiet the title of the Chippewas. By acquiring this portion of
      country for the purposes of military occupancy, the United States
      would be justified in punishing any murders committed upon it; and
      I am fully convinced, that no measure which could, at this time, be
      adopted, would so certainly conduce to a permanent peace between the
      tribes. I therefore beg leave, through you, to submit these subjects
      to the consideration of the honorable the Secretary of War, with
      every distrust in my own powers of observation, and with a very full
      confidence in his.</p>

    <p class="ml3"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

    <p>It is in accordance with the instructions under which I am acting, to
      solicit your co-operation in keeping the Sioux and Chippewas at peace,
      and to induce them to adhere, in good faith, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> the articles of the
      treaty of Prairie du Chien. Blind to their true interests, these tribes
      continue a warfare as hopeless in its termination as it is inglorious
      in its results. Notwithstanding every pains which has been taken by the
      government to convince them of the erroneous policy of such a contest,
      and to inspire in them fidelity to their public treaties with each
      other, restless and ambitious young men, on either side, continue to
      lead war-parties into the territories of the other, and to waylay the
      unsuspecting. I am satisfied that the authority of the chiefs is not
      always sufficient to restrain the incursions of these young warriors,
      who are led on by the thirst of fame, and stimulated by hereditary
      animosity. Such a course is not surprising among savages. But it is
      the dictate of humanity to restrain this false ardor, and to make use
      of every practicable means to put a stop to scenes at which the heart
      sickens. It is but recently that a Mr. Cadotte, a young half-breed
      of the Sault Ste. Marie, another young man of mixed blood, called
      the Little Frenchman, living as an Indian, and two Chippewas, one a
      female, travelling down the St. Croix in a canoe, were fired upon from
      an ambush by the Sioux, and killed. And this injury still remains
      unredressed.</p>

    <p>The Chippewas complain of this mode of warfare, which it would be an
      idle affectation to designate by any other term than murder. They
      say the Sioux are indeed ready to smoke the pipe of peace with them,
      and never fail to do so when it is presented to them; but that a
      confidence, on their part, in these smoking councils, is paid with the
      loss of lives.</p>

    <p>I have despatched a message to the Sioux chief, Petite Corbeau, and
      another to Wabisha, reminding them of their treaty engagements with
      the Chippewas, and of the recent violation of them above referred to,
      and requesting them to use their influence efficaciously to terminate
      further inroads. These messages are accompanied by others from Shakoba
      and from Kabamappa, Chippewa chiefs on the St. Croix and Snake Rivers.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="ml40"><i>Fredonia, N. Y., November 14, 1831.</i></div>

    <div>Hon. <span class="smcap">Lewis Cass</span>, <i>Secretary of War</i>.</div>

    <p class="ml3"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

    <p>In fulfilment of the duties assigned to me in the late expedition
      into the Indian country, under the direction of H. R. Schoolcraft,
      Esq., Indian agent, I would beg leave to transmit to you the following
      observations relative to the existence of copper in the country
      bordering on the southern shore of Lake Superior.</p>

    <p>It is without doubt true that this subject has long been viewed with
      an interest far beyond its actual merit. Each mass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> native copper
      which this country has produced, however insulated, or however it
      may have been separated from its original position, appears to have
      been considered a sure indication of the existence of that metal in
      beds; and hence we occasionally see, upon maps of that section of our
      country, particular portions marked as containing “copper mines,” where
      no copper now exists. But while it is certain that a combination of
      circumstances has served to mislead the public mind with regard to the
      geological situation and existing quantity of that metal, it is no less
      certain that a greater quantity of insulated native copper has been
      discovered upon the borders of Lake Superior, than in any other equal
      portion of North America.</p>

    <p>Among the masses of native copper which have engaged the attention of
      travellers in this section of country, one, which from its great size
      was early noticed, is situated on the Ontonagon River, a stream which
      empties its waters into the southern part of Lake Superior, 331 miles
      above the falls of the Ste. Marie. The Ontonagon River is, with some
      difficulty, navigable by bateaux 36 miles, at which place by the union
      of two smaller streams, one from an easterly, and the other from a
      westerly direction, the main stream is formed. The mass of copper is
      situated on the western fork, at a distance of six or eight miles from
      the junction.</p>

    <p>The face of the country through the upper half of the distance from
      Lake Superior is uneven, and the irregularity is given it by hills of
      marly clay, which occasionally rise quite abruptly to the height of one
      or two hundred feet. No rock was observed <i>in situ</i>, except in one
      place, where, for a distance, the red sandstone was observed, forming
      the bed of the river.</p>

    <p>The mass of copper lies partly covered by water, directly at the foot
      of a clay hill, from which, together with numerous boulders of the
      primitive rocks, it has undoubtedly been washed by the action of the
      water of the river. Although it is completely insulated, there is much
      to interest in its examination. Its largest surface measures three and
      a half by four feet, and this, which is of malleable copper, is kept
      bright by the action of the water, and has the usual appearance of that
      metal when worn. To one surface is attached a small quantity of rock,
      singularly bound together by threads of copper, which pass through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
      it in all directions. This rock, although many of its distinctive
      characters are lost, is evidently a dark colored serpentine, with small
      interspersed masses of milky quartz.</p>

    <p>The mass of copper is so situated as to afford but little that would
      enable us to judge of its original geological position. In examining
      the eastern fork of the river, I discovered small water-worn masses of
      trap-rock, in which were specks of imbedded carbonate of copper and
      copper black; and with them were occasionally associated minute specks
      of serpentine, in some respects resembling that which is attached to
      the large mass of copper; and facts would lead us to infer that the
      trap formation which appears on Lake Superior east of the Ontonagon
      River, crosses this section of country at or near the source of that
      river and at length forms one of the spurs of the Porcupine Mountains.</p>

    <p>Several smaller masses of insulated native copper have been discovered
      on the borders of Lake Superior, but that upon Ontonagon River is the
      only one which is now known to remain.</p>

    <p>At as early a period as before the American revolution, an English
      mining company directed their operations to the country bordering
      on Lake Superior, and Ontonagon River was one point to which their
      attention was immediately directed. Traces of a shaft, sunk in the clay
      hill, near a mass of copper, are still visible, a memento of ignorance
      and folly.</p>

    <p>Operations were also commenced on the southern shore of Lake Superior,
      near the mouth of a small stream, which, from that circumstance, is
      called Miners’ River. Parts of the names of the miners, carved upon
      the sandstone rock at the mouth of the river are still visible. What
      circumstance led to the selection of this spot does not now appear.
      No mineral traces are at this day perceptible, except occasional
      discolorations of the sandstone rock by what is apparently a mixture of
      the carbonate of iron and copper; and this is only to be observed where
      water, holding in solution an extremely minute portion of these salts,
      has trickled slowly over those rocks.</p>

    <p>It does not, in fact, appear that the red sandstone, which constitutes
      the principal rock formation of the southern shore, of Lake Superior,
      is in any instance metalliferous in any considerable degree. If this
      be true, it would require but little reflection to convince one of the
      inexpediency of conducting mining operations at either of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> the points
      selected for that purpose; and it is beyond a doubt true, that the
      company did not receive the least inducement to continue their labors.</p>

    <p>In addition to these masses of native copper, an ore of that metal has
      long been known to the lake traders as the green rock, in which the
      characteristic substances are the green and blue carbonate of copper,
      accompanied by copper black. It is situated upon Keweena Point, 280
      miles above the falls of the Ste. Marie. The ore is embraced by what
      is apparently a recently formed crag; and although it is of a kind,
      and so situated as to make an imposing appearance, there is little
      certainty of its existence in large quantities in this formation. The
      ore forms a thin covering to the pebbles of which the body of the rock
      is composed, and is rarely observed in masses separate from it. The
      crag is composed of angular fragments of trap-rock; and the formation
      is occasionally traversed by broad and continuous belts of calc. spar,
      here and there tinged with copper. Although the ore was not observed in
      any considerable quantity, except at one point, it apparently exists
      in minute specks through a greater part of the crag formation, which
      extends several miles, forming the shore of the lake.</p>

    <p>This examination of the crag threw new interest upon the trap
      formation, which had been first observed to take the place of the
      sandstone at the bottom of a deep bay, called Montreal Bay, on the
      easterly side of Keweena Point. The trap-rock continues for a few
      miles, when the crag before noticed appears to lie directly upon it,
      and to form the extremity of the point; the crag, in turn, disappears,
      and the trap-rock is continued for a distance of six or eight miles
      upon the westerly side of the point, when the sandstone again reappears.</p>

    <p>The trap-rock is of a compact granular texture, occasionally running
      into the amygdaloid and toadstone varieties, and is rich in imbedded
      minerals, such as amethystine quartz, smoky quartz, cornelian,
      chalcedony, agate, &amp;c., together with several of the ores of copper.
      Traces of copper ore in the trap-rock were first noticed on the
      easterly side of Keweena Point, and near the commencement of the trap
      formation. This ore, which is an impure copper black, was observed in a
      vein of variable thickness, but not in any part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span> exceeding 2½ inches;
      it is sufficiently compact and hard to receive a firm polish, but it
      is rather disposed to break into small irregular masses. A specimen
      furnished, upon analysis, 47.5 per cent. of pure copper.</p>

    <p>On the western side of Keweena Point, the same ore appears under
      different circumstances, being disseminated through the body of
      the trap-rock, in grains varying in size from a pin’s head to a
      pea. Although many of these grains are wholly copper black, they
      are occasionally only depositions of the mineral upon specks of
      cornelian, chalcedony, or agate, or are more frequently composed,
      in part, of what is apparently an imperfect steatite. The ore is so
      connected with, and so much resembles in colour the rock, of which
      it may be said to be a constituent part, that they might easily,
      during a hasty examination, be confounded. A random specimen of the
      rock furnished, upon analysis, 3.2 per cent. of pure copper. The rock
      continues combined with that mineral for nearly the space of three
      miles. Extremely thin veins of copper black were observed to traverse
      this same rock; and in enlargements of these were discovered several
      masses of amorphous native copper. The latter mineral appeared in two
      forms—the one consisting of compact and malleable masses, carrying from
      4 to 10 ounces each; and the other, of specks and fasciculi of pure
      copper, binding together confused masses of copper green, and partially
      disintegrated trap-rock: the latter was of several pounds’ weight.
      Each variety was closely embraced by the rock, although the action of
      the water upon the rock had occasionally exposed to view points of the
      metal. In addition to the accompanying copper green, which was in a
      disintegrated state, small specks of the oxyd of copper were associated
      in most of the native specimens.</p>

    <p>Circumstances would not permit an examination of any portion of the
      trap formation, except that bordering directly upon the lake. But facts
      would lead us to infer that that formation extends from one side of
      Keweena Point to the other, and that a range of thickly wooded hills,
      which traverses the point, is based upon, if not formed of, that rock.
      An Indian information which, particularly upon such a subject, must be
      adopted with caution, would sanction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> the opinion that the prominent
      constituents are the same wherever the rock is observed.</p>

    <p>After having duly considered the facts which are presented, I would not
      hesitate to offer, as an opinion, that the trap-rock formation was the
      original source of the masses of copper which have been observed in
      the country bordering on Lake Superior; and that at the present day,
      examinations for the ores of copper could not be made in that country
      with hopes of success, except in the trap-rock itself; which rock is
      not certainly known to exist upon any place upon Lake Superior, other
      than Keweena Point.</p>

    <p>If this opinion be a correct one, the cause of failure of the mining
      company in this region is rendered plain. Having considered each
      insulated mass of pure metal as a true indication of the existence
      of a bed in the vicinity, operations were directed to wrong points;
      when, having failed to realize their anticipations, the project was
      abandoned without further actual investigation. We would be induced to
      infer, that no attempts were made to learn the original source of the
      metal which was discovered, and thus, while the attention was drawn to
      insulated masses, the ores, ordinary in appearance, but more important
      <i>in situ</i>, were neglected; and perhaps from the close analogy in
      appearance to the rock with which they were associated, no distinction
      was observed.</p>

    <p>What quantity of ore the trap-rock of Keweena Point may be capable of
      producing, can only be determined by minute and laborious examination.
      The indications which were presented by a hasty investigation are here
      imbodied, and, with deference, submitted to your consideration.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="smcap ml3">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

    <p>Time admonishes me of my promise to furnish you some account of my
      journey from Galena to Fort Winnebago. But I confess, that time has
      taken away none of those features which make me regard it as a task.
      Other objects have occupied so much of my thoughts, that the subject
      has lost some of its vividness, and I shall be obliged to confine
      myself more exclusively to my notes than I had intended. This will
      be particularly true in speaking of geological facts. Geographical
      features impress themselves strongly on the mind. The shape of a
      mountain is not easily forgotten, and its relation to contiguous
      waters and woods is recollected after the lapse of many years. The
      succession of plains, streams, and settlements is likewise retained in
      the memory, while the peculiar plains, the soils overlaying them, and
      all the variety of their mineral and organic contents, require to be
      perpetuated by specimens and by notes, which impose neither a slight
      nor a momentary labor.</p>

    <p>Limited sketches of this kind are furthermore liable to be
      misconceived. Prominent external objects can only be brought to mind,
      and these often reveal but an imperfect notion of the pervading
      character of strata, and still less knowledge of their mineral
      contents. Haste takes away many opportunities of observation; and
      scanty or inconvenient means of transporting hand specimens, often
      deprive us of the requisite data. Indeed, I should be loath to describe
      the few facts I am about to communicate, had you not personally
      visited and examined the great carboniferous and sandstone formation
      on the Mississippi and Wisconsin, and thus got the knowledge of their
      features. The parallelism which is apparent in these rocks, by the
      pinnacles which have been left standing on high—the wasting effects of
      time in scooping out valleys and filling up declivities—and the dark
      and castle-looking character of the cherty limestone bluffs, as viewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
      from the water, while the shadows of evening are deepening around, are
      suited to make vivid impressions. And these broken and denuded cliffs
      offer the most favorable points for making geological observations.
      There are no places inland where the streams have cut so deep. On
      gaining the height of land, the strata are found to be covered with so
      heavy a deposite of soil, that it is difficult to glean much that can
      be relied on respecting the interior structure.</p>

    <p>The angle formed by the junction of the Wisconsin with the Mississippi
      is a sombre line of weather-beaten rocks. Gliding along the current,
      at the base of these rocks, the idea of a “hill country,” of no very
      productive character, is naturally impressed upon the observer. And
      this impression came down, probably, from the days of Marquette, who
      was the first European, that we read of, who descended the Wisconsin,
      and thus became the true discoverer of the Mississippi. The fact that
      it yielded lead ore, bits of which were occasionally brought in by the
      natives, was in accordance with this opinion; and aided, it may be
      supposed, in keeping out of view the real character of the country. I
      know not how else to account for the light which has suddenly burst
      upon us from this bank of the Mississippi, and which has at once proved
      it to be as valuable for the purposes of agriculture as for those of
      mining, and as sylvan in its appearance as if it were not fringed, as
      it were, with rocks, and lying at a great elevation above the water.
      This elevation is so considerable as to permit a lively descent in the
      streams, forming numerous mill-seats. The surface of the country is
      not, however, broken, but may be compared to the heavy and lazy-rolling
      waves of the sea after a tempest. These wave-like plains are often
      destitute of trees, except a few scattering ones, but present to
      the eye an almost boundless field of native herbage. Groves of oak
      sometimes diversify those native meadows, or cover the ridges which
      bound them. Very rarely does any rock appear above the surface. The
      highest elevations, the Platte mounds, and the Blue mound, are covered
      with soil and with trees. Numerous brooks of limpid water traverse the
      plains, and find their way into either the Wisconsin, Rock River, or
      the Mississippi. The common deer is still in possession of its favorite
      haunts; and the traveller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> is very often startled by flocks of the
      prairie-hen rising up in his path. The surface soil is a rich, black
      alluvion; it yields abundant crops of corn, and, so far as they have
      been tried, all the cereal gramina. I have never, either in the west or
      out of the west, seen a richer soil, or more stately fields of corn and
      oats, than upon one of the plateaux of the Blue mound.</p>

    <p>Such is the country which appears to be richer in ores of lead than
      any other mineral district in the world—which yielded forty millions
      of pounds in seven years—produced a single lump of ore of two thousand
      cubic feet—and appears adequate to supply almost any amount of this
      article that the demands of commerce require.</p>

    <p>The river of Galena rises in the mineral plains of Iowa county, in
      that part of the North-Western Territory which is attached, for the
      purposes of temporary government, to Michigan. It is made up of clear
      and permanent springs, and has a descent which affords a very valuable
      water-power. This has been particularly remarked at the curve called
      Millseat-bend. No change in its general course, which is south-west, is
      I believe apparent after it enters the north-west angle of the state
      of Illinois. The town of Galena, the capital of the mining country,
      occupies a somewhat precipitous semicircular bend, on the right (or
      north) bank of the river, six or seven miles from its entrance into the
      Mississippi. Backwater, from the latter, gives the stream itself the
      appearance, as it bears the name, of a “river,” and admits steamboat
      navigation thus far. It is a rapid brook immediately above the town,
      and of no further value for the purpose of navigation. Lead is brought
      in from the smelting furnaces, on heavy ox-teams, capable of carrying
      several tons at a load. I do not know that water <i>has been</i>, or
      that it <i>cannot</i> be made subservient in the transportation of
      this article from the mines. The streams themselves are numerous and
      permanent, although they are small, and it would require the aid of
      so many of these, on any projected route, that it is to be feared the
      supply of water would be inadequate. To remedy this deficiency, the
      Wisconsin itself might be relied on. Could the waters of this river be
      conducted in a canal along its valley from the portage to the bend at
      Arena, they might, from this point, be deflected in a direct line to
      Galena<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>? This route would cut the mine district centrally, and afford
      the upper tributaries of the Pekatolika and Fever River as feeders.
      Such a communication would open the way to a northern market, and
      merchandise might be supplied by the way of Green Bay, when the low
      state of water in the Mississippi prevents the ascent of boats. It
      would, at all times, obviate the tedious voyage, which goods ordered
      from the Atlantic cities have to perform through the straits of Florida
      and Gulf of Mexico. A railroad could be laid upon this route with
      equal, perhaps superior advantages. These things may seem too much like
      making arrangements for the next generation. But we cannot fix bounds
      to the efforts of our spreading population, and spirit of enterprise.
      Nor, after what we have seen in the way of internal improvement, in
      our own day and generation, should we deem any thing too hard to be
      accomplished.</p>

    <p>I set out from Galena in a light wagon, drawn by two horses, about ten
      o’clock in the morning (August 17th), accompanied by Mr. B. It had
      rained the night and morning of the day previous, which rendered the
      streets and roads quite muddy. A marly soil, easily penetrated by rain,
      was, however, as susceptible to the influence of the sun, and in a much
      shorter period than would be imagined, the surface became dry. Although
      a heavy and continued shower had thoroughly drenched the ground, and
      covered it with superfluous water, but very little effects of it were
      to be seen at this time. We ascended into the open plain country, which
      appears in every direction around the town, and directed our course
      to Gratiot’s Grove. In this distance, which on our programme of the
      route, was put down at fifteen miles, a lively idea of the formation
      and character of the country is given. The eye is feasted with the
      boundlessness of its range. Grass and flowers spread before and beside
      the traveller, and on looking back, they fill up the vista behind him.
      He soon finds himself in the midst of a sylvan scene. Groves fringe the
      tops of the most distant elevations, and clusters of trees—more rarely,
      open forests—are occasionally presented. The trees appear to be almost
      exclusively of the species of white oak and roughbark hickory. Among
      the flowers, the plant called rosin-weed attracts attention by its
      gigantic stature, and it is accompanied, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span> certainly as substance by
      shadow, by the wild indigo, two plants which were afterward detected
      of less luxuriant growth on Fox River. The roads are in their natural
      condition, they are excellent, except for a few yards where streams are
      crossed. At such places there is a plunge into soft, black muck, and it
      requires all the powers of a horse harnessed to a wagon to emerge from
      the stream.</p>

    <p>On reaching Gratiot’s Grove, I handed letters of introduction to Mr.
      H. and B. Gratiot. These gentlemen appear to be extensively engaged in
      smelting. They conducted me to see the ore prepared for smelting in
      the log furnace; and also the preparation of such parts of it for the
      ash furnace as do not undergo complete fusion in the first process.
      The ash furnace is a very simple kind of air furnace, with a grate so
      arranged as to throw a reverberating flame upon the hearth where the
      prepared ore is laid. It is built against a declivity, and charged by
      throwing the materials to be operated upon, down the flue. A silicious
      flux is used; and the scoria is tapped and suffered to flow out, from
      the side of the furnace, before drawing off the melted lead. The latter
      is received in an excavation made in the earth, from which it is ladled
      out into iron moulds. The whole process is conducted in the open air,
      with sometimes a slight shed. The lead ore is piled in cribs of logs,
      which are roofed. Hammers, ladles, a kind of tongs, and some other
      iron tools are required. The simplicity of the process, the absence of
      external show in buildings, and the direct and ready application of the
      means to the end, are remarkable, as pleasing characteristics about the
      smelting establishment.</p>

    <p>The ore used is the common sulphuret, with a foliated, glittering and
      cubical fracture. It occurs with scarcely any adhering gangue. Cubical
      masses of it are found, at some of the diggings, which are studded over
      with minute crystals of calcareous spar. These crystals, when examined,
      have the form of the dog-tooth spar. This broad, square-shaped, and
      square-broken mineral, is taken from <i>east and west leads</i>, is
      most easy to smelt, and yields the greatest per centum of lead. It is
      estimated to produce fifty per cent. from the log furnace, and about
      sixteen more when treated with a flux in the ash furnace.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

    <p>Miners classify their ore from its position in the mine. Ore from
      <i>east and west leads</i>, is raised from clay diggings, although
      these diggings may be pursued under the first stratum of rock. Ore
      from <i>north and south leads</i>, is termed “sheet minerals,”
      and is usually taken from rock diggings. The vein or sheet stands
      perpendicularly in the fissure, and is usually struck in sinking from
      six to ten feet. The sheet varies in thickness from six or eight
      inches, in the broadest part, to not more than one. The great mass
      found at “Irish diggings,” was of this kind.</p>

    <p>I observed among the piles of ore at Gratiot’s, the combination of
      zinc with lead ore, which is denominated <i>dry bone</i>. It is cast
      by as unproductive. Mr. B. Gratiot also showed me pieces of the common
      ore which had undergone desulphuration in the log furnace. Its natural
      splendor is increased by this process, so as to have the appearance of
      highly burnished steel. He also presented me some uniform masses of
      lead, recrystallized from a metallic state, under the hearth of the
      ash furnace. The tendency to rectangular structure in these delicate
      and fragile masses is very remarkable. Crystallization appears to
      have taken place under circumstances which opposed the production
      of a complete and perfect cube or parallelogram, although there are
      innumerable rectangles of each geometric form.</p>

    <p>In the drive from Gratiot’s to Willow Springs, we saw a succession
      of the same objects that had formed the prominent features of the
      landscape from Galena. The platte mounds, which had appeared on our
      left all the morning, continued visible until we entered the grove that
      embraces the site of the springs. Little mounds of red earth frequently
      appeared above the grass, to testify to the labors of miners along this
      part of the route. In taking a hasty survey of some of the numerous
      excavations of Irish diggings, I observed among the rubbish small
      flat masses of a yellowish white amorphous mineral substance of great
      weight. I have not had time to submit it to any tests. It appears too
      heavy and compact for the earthy yellow oxide of lead. I should not be
      disappointed to find it an oxide of zinc. No rock stratum protrudes
      from the ground in this part of the country. The consolidated masses
      thrown up from the diggings, appear to be sili<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>cated limestone, often
      friable, and not crystalline. Galena is found in open fissures in this
      rock.</p>

    <p>We reached the springs in the dusk of the evening, and found good
      accommodations at Ray’s. Distance from Galena thirty miles.</p>

    <p>The rain fell copiously during the night, and on the morning
      (eighteenth) gave no signs of a speedy cessation. Those who travel
      ought often, however, to call to mind the remark of Xenophon, that
      “pleasure is the result of toil,” and not permit slight impediments
      to arrest them, particularly when they have definite points to make.
      We set forward in a moderate rain, but in less than an hour had the
      pleasure to perceive signs of it mitigating, and before nine o’clock
      it was quite clear. We stopped a short time at Bracken’s furnace. Mr.
      Bracken gave me specimens of organic remains, in the condition of
      earthy calcareous carbonates, procured on a neighbouring ridge. He
      described the locality as being plentiful in casts and impressions
      such as he exhibited, which appeared to have been removed from the
      surface of a shelly limestone. At Rock-branch diggings, I found masses
      of calcareous spar thrown from the pits. The surface appears to have
      been much explored for lead in this vicinity. I stopped to examine
      Vanmater’s lead. It had been a productive one, and affords a fair
      example of what are called east and west leads. I observed a compass
      standing on the line of the lead, and asked Mr. V. whether much
      reliance was to be placed upon the certainty of striking the lead by
      the aid of this instrument. He said that it was much relied on. That
      the course of the leads was definite. The present one varied from a due
      east and west line but nine minutes, and the lead had been followed
      without much difficulty. The position of the ore was about forty feet
      below the surface. Of this depth about thirty-six feet consisted of the
      surface rock and its earthy covering. A vein of marly clay, enveloping
      the ore, was then penetrated. A series of pits had been sunk on the
      course of it, and the earth and ore in the interstices removed, and
      drawn to the surface by a windlass and bucket. Besides the ore, masses
      of iron pyrites had been thrown out, connected with galena. In stooping
      to detach some pieces from one of these masses, I placed my feet on the
      verge of an abandoned pit, around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span> which weeds and bushes had grown.
      My face was, however, averted from the danger, but on beholding it, I
      was made sensible that the least deviation from a proper balance would
      have pitched me into it. It was forty feet deep. The danger I had just
      escaped fell to the lot of Mr. B.’s dog, who, probably, deceived by the
      growth of bushes, fell in. Whether killed or not, it was impossible to
      tell, and we were obliged to leave the poor animal under a promise of
      Mr. V., that he would cause a windlass to be removed to the pit, to
      ascertain his fate.</p>

    <p>At eleven o’clock we reached Mineral Point, the seat of justice of Iowa
      county. I delivered an introductory letter to Mr. Ansley, who had made
      a discovery of copper ore in the vicinity, and through his politeness,
      visited the locality. The discovery was made in sinking pits in search
      of lead ore. Small pieces of green carbonate of copper were found on
      striking the rock, which is apparently silico-calcareous, and of a very
      friable structure. From one of the excavations, detached masses of
      the sulphuret, blue and green mingled, were raised. These masses are
      enveloped with ochery clay.</p>

    <p>In riding out on horseback to see this locality, I passed over the
      ridge of land which first received the appellation of “Mineral Point.”
      No digging was observed in process, but the heaps of red marly clay,
      the vigorous growth of shrubbery around them, and the number of open
      or partially filled pits, remain to attest the labour which was
      formerly devoted in the search for lead. And this search is said to
      have been amply rewarded. The track of discovery is conspicuously
      marked by these excavations, which often extend, in a direct line,
      on the cardinal points, as far as the eye can reach. Everywhere the
      marly clay formation appears to have been relied on for the ore, and
      much of it certainly appears to be <i>in situ</i> in it. It bears no
      traces of attrition; and its occurrence in regular leads, forbids the
      supposition of its being an oceanic arrangement of mineral detritus.
      At Vanmater’s, the metalliferous clay marl is overlaid by a grayish
      sedimentary limestone. Different is the geological situation of what is
      denominated <i>gravel ore</i>, of which I noticed piles, on the route
      from Gratiot’s. This bears evident marks of attrition, and appears to
      have been uniformly taken from diluvial earth.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

    <p>On returning to the village from this excursion, I found Mr. B. ready
      to proceed, and we lost no time in making the next point in our
      proposed route. A drive of five miles brought us to the residence of
      Colonel Dodge, whose zeal and enterprise in opening this portion of our
      western country for settlement, give him claims to be looked up to as a
      public benefactor. I here met the superintendent of the mines (Captain
      Legate), and after spending some time in conversation on the resources
      and prospects of the country, and partaking of the hospitalities
      politely offered by Colonel D. and his intelligent family, we pursued
      our way. The village of Dodgeville lies at the distance of four miles.
      Soon after passing through it some part of our tackle gave way, in
      crossing a gully, and I improved the opportunity of the delay to visit
      the adjacent diggings, which are extensive. The ore is found as at
      other mines, in regular leads, and not scattered about promiscuously
      in the red marl. Masses of brown oxide of iron were more common here
      than I had noticed them elsewhere. Among the rubbish of the diggings,
      fragments of hornstone occur. They appear to be, most commonly,
      portions of nodules, which exhibit, on being fractured, various
      discolorings.</p>

    <p>Night overtook us before we entered Porter’s Grove, which is also
      the seat of mining and smelting operations. We are indebted to the
      hospitality of Mr. M., of whom my companion was an acquaintance, for
      opening his door to us, at an advanced hour of the evening. Distance
      from Willow Springs, twenty-five miles.</p>

    <p>There is no repose for a traveller. We retired to rest at a late
      hour, and rose at an early one. The morning (19th) was hazy, and we
      set forward while the dew was heavy on the grass. Our route still
      lay through a prairie country. The growth of native grass, bent down
      with dew, nearly covered the road, so that our horses’ legs were
      continually bathed. The rising sun was a very cheerful sight, but
      as our road lay up a long ascent, we soon felt its wilting effects.
      Nine miles of such driving, with not a single grove to shelter us,
      brought us to Mr. Brigham’s, at the foot of the Blue Mound, being
      the last house in the direction to Fort Winnebago. The distance from
      Galena is sixty-four miles, and this area embraces the present field
      of mining operations. In rapidly passing over it, mines, furnaces,
      dwelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>houses, mining villages, enclosed fields, upland prairies (an
      almost continued prairie), groves, springs, and brooks, have formed
      the prominent features of the landscape. The impulse to the settlement
      of the country was first given by its mineral wealth; and it brought
      here, as it were by magic, an enterprising and active population. It
      is evident that a far greater amount of labor was a few years ago
      engaged in mining operations; but the intrinsic value of the lands has
      operated to detain the present population, which may be considered
      as permanent. The lands are beautifully disposed, well watered, well
      drained by natural streams, and easily brought into cultivation. Crops
      have everywhere repaid the labors of the farmer; and, thus far, the
      agricultural produce of the country has borne a fair price. The country
      appears to afford every facility for raising cattle, horses, and hogs.
      Mining, the cardinal interest heretofore, has not ceased in the degree
      that might be inferred from the depression of the lead market; and it
      will be pursued, with increased activity, whenever the purposes of
      commerce call for it. In the present situation of the country, there
      appear to be two objects essential to the lasting welfare of the
      settlements:—first, a title to their lands from Congress; second, a
      northern market for the products of their mines and farms. To these,
      a <i>third</i> requisite may be considered auxiliary, namely, the
      establishment of the seat of territorial government at some point west
      of Lake Michigan, where its powers may be more readily exercised, and
      the reciprocal obligations of governor and people more vividly felt.</p>

    <p>Mr. Brigham, in whom I was happy to recognise an esteemed friend,
      conducted us over his valuable plantation. He gave me a mass of a
      white, heavy metallic substance, taken as an accompanying mineral, from
      a lead of Galena, which he has recently discovered in a cave. Without
      instituting any examination of it but such as its external characters
      disclose, it may be deemed a native carbonate of lead. The mass from
      which it was broken weighed ninety or one hundred pounds. And its
      occurrence, at the lead, was not alone.</p>

    <p>From the Blue Mound to Fort Winnebago is an estimated distance of
      fifty-six miles. The country is, however, entirely in a state of
      nature. The trace is rather obscure; but, with a know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>ledge of the
      general geography and face of the country, there is no difficulty in
      proceeding with a light wagon, or even a loaded team, as the Indian
      practice of firing the prairies every fall has relieved the surface
      from underbrush and fallen timber. After driving a few miles, we
      encountered two Winnebagoes on horseback, the forward rider having
      a white man in tie behind him. The latter informed us that his name
      was H., that he had come out to Twelve-mile Creek, for the purpose of
      locating himself there, and was in pursuit of a hired man, who had gone
      off, with some articles of his property, the night previous. With this
      relation, and a <i>boshu</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> for the natives, with whom we had no
      means of conversing, we continued our way, without further incident,
      to Duck Creek, a distance of ten miles. We here struck the path,
      which is one of the boundary lines, in the recent purchase from the
      Winnebagoes. It is a deeply marked horse path, cutting quite through
      the prairie sod, and so much used by the natives as to prevent grass
      from growing on it; in this respect, it is as well-defined a landmark
      as “blazed tree,” or “saddle.” The surveyor appointed to run out the
      lines, had placed mile-posts on the route, but the Winnebagoes, with a
      prejudice against the practice which is natural, pulled up many, and
      defaced others. When we had gone ten miles further, we began to see
      the glittering of water through the trees, and we soon found ourselves
      on the margin of a clear lake. I heard no name for this handsome sheet
      of water. It is one of the four lakes, which are connected with each
      other by a stream, and have their outlet into Rock River, through a
      tributary called the Guskihaw. We drove through the margin of it,
      where the shores were sandy, and innumerable small unio shells were
      driven up. Most of these small species appeared to be helices. Standing
      tent-poles, and other remains of Indian encampments, appeared at this
      place. A rock stratum, dark and weather-beaten, apparently sandstone,
      jutted out into the lake. A little farther, we passed to the left
      of an abandoned village. By casting our eyes across the lake, we
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>observed the new position which had been selected and occupied by the
      Winnebagoes. We often assign wrong motives, when we undertake to reason
      for the Indian race; but, in the present instance, we may presume, that
      their removal was influenced by too near a position to the boundary path.</p>

    <p>We drove to the second brook, beyond the lake, and encamped.</p>

    <p>Comfort in an encampment depends very much upon getting a good fire.
      In this we totally failed last night, owing to our having but a small
      piece of spunk, which ignited and burned out without inflaming our
      kindling materials. The atmosphere was damp, but not sufficiently
      cooled to quiet the ever-busy musquito. Mr. B. deemed it a hardship
      that he could not boil the kettle, so as to have the addition of tea to
      our cold repast. I reminded him that there was a bright moon, and that
      it did not rain; and that, for myself, I had fared so decidedly worse,
      on former occasions, that I was quite contented with the light of the
      moon and a dry blanket. By raising up and putting a fork under the
      wagon tongue, and spreading our tent-cloth over it, I found the means
      of insulating ourselves from the insect hordes, but it was not until I
      had pitched my musquito net within it that we found repose.</p>

    <p>On awaking in the morning (20th), we found H., who had passed us the
      day before in company with the Winnebagoes, lying under the wagon. He
      had returned from pursuing the fugitive, and had overtaken us, after
      twelve o’clock at night. He complained of being cold. We admitted him
      into the wagon, and drove on to reach his camp at Twelve-mile Creek.
      In crossing what he denominated Seven-mile Prairie, I observed on our
      right a prominent wall of rock, surmounted with image-stones. The rock
      itself consisted of sandstone. Elongated water-worn masses of stone
      had been set up, so as to resemble, at a distance, the figures of men.
      The allusion had been strengthened by some rude paints. This had been
      the serious or the sportive work of Indians. It is not to be inferred
      hence, that the Winnebagoes are idolaters. But there is a strong
      tendency to idolatry in the minds of the North American Indians. They
      do not bow before a carved image, shaped like Dagon or Juggernaut; but
      they rely upon their guardian spirits, or personal manitos, for aid in
      exigencies, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span> impute to the skins of animals, which are preserved
      with religious care, the power of gods. Their medicine institution is
      also a gross and bold system of semi-deification connected with magic,
      witchcraft, and necromancy. Their jossakeeds are impostors and jugglers
      of the grossest stamp. Their wabenos address Satan directly for power;
      and their metais, who appear to be least idolatrous, rely more upon the
      invisible agency of spirits and magic influence, than upon the physical
      properties of the medicines they exhibit.</p>

    <p>On reaching Twelve-mile Creek, we found a yoke of steers of H., in
      a pen, which had been tied there two days and nights without water.
      He evinced, however, an obliging disposition, and, after refreshing
      ourselves and our horses, we left him to complete the labours of a
      “local habitation.” The intermediate route to Fort Winnebago afforded
      few objects of either physical or mental interest. The upland soil,
      which had become decidedly thinner and more arenaceous, after
      reaching the lake, appears to increase in sterility on approaching
      the Wisconsin. And the occurrence of <i>lost rocks</i> (primitive
      boulders), as Mr. B. happily termed them, which are first observed
      after passing the Blue Mound, becomes more frequent in this portion of
      the country, denoting our approach to the borders of the north-western
      primitive formation. This formation, we have now reason to conclude,
      extends in an angle, so far south as to embrace a part of Fox River,
      above Apukwa Lake.</p>

    <p>Anticipated difficulties always appear magnified. This we verified in
      crossing Duck Creek, near its entrance into the Wisconsin. We found
      the adjoining bog nearly dry, and drove through the stream without the
      water entering into the body of the wagon. It here commenced raining.
      Having but four miles to make, and that a level prairie, we pushed on.
      But the rain increased, and poured down steadily and incessantly till
      near sunset. In the midst of this rain-storm we reached the fort, about
      one o’clock, and crossed over to the elevated ground occupied by the
      Indian Department, where my sojourn, while awaiting the expedition, was
      rendered as comfortable as the cordial greeting and kind attention of
      Mr. Kinzie, the agent, and his intelligent family could make it.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
