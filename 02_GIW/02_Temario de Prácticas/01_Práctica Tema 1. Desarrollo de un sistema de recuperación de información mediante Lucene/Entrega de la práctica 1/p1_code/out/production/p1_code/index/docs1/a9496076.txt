Abstract    :
              The Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division will                    
              support Professor Richard D. Gandour's study of "Models to Test                
              Proximity and Position in Catalysis" in the Chemistry                          
              Department at Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge.  This                   
              project will use biarylethynyl model compounds to test ideas                   
              concerning how the placement and orientation of a catalytic                    
              functional group affect the rate at which it serves to                         
              accelerate a reaction.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project in intramolecular recognition will investigate the                
              general base catalyzed hydrolysis of a series of esters in                     
              order to determine how critical to rate enhancement is the                     
              positioning (distance and orientation) of the catalytic group                  
              and the substrate in an enzymatic active site.  The models                     
              being studied have been selected so that comparisons are made                  
              between systems differing only in the number of degrees of                     
              rotational freedom and/or the time-average distance between                    
              reacting groups.  The rate enhancements engendered by proximity                
              are being determined by comparing the hydrolysis rates of                      
              compounds with free rotation (no tether) with those containing                 
              tethers of varying lengths.
