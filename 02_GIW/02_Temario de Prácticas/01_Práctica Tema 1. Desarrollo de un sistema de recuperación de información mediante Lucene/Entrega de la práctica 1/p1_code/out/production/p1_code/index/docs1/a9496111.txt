Abstract    :
              This project builds on a developed prototype learning environment,             
              a computer-based design tool that enables girls to create machines             
              by starting from their own imaginative vantage points. "Imagine" is            
              a graphics program that supports students in designing objects,                
              animating them, and adding sound and visual effects.  The principal            
              investigator proposes to refine and complete the development of the            
              existing prototype and create a set of curriculum activities that              
              can be used in conjunction with the ongoing math and science                   
              curricula.  This proposal expect to attract girls, particularly                
              urban minority girls, to engineering and related professions.
