Abstract    :
                   The overall goal of this research is to understand the                    
              function of calcium channels.  Previous results have indicated                 
              that the selectivity of the channel for calcium is dependent upon              
              both channel diameter and a high affinity, calcium binding site                
              within the channel.  These results formed the basis for a                      
              theoretical model which quantitatively describes the essential                 
              features of calcium channel selectivity of the vertebrate                      
              skeletal muscle calcium channel.  Current studies are directed                 
              toward understanding the phenomenon of calcium-induced                         
              inactivation of the calcium channel and toward comparing the                   
              voltage gating of calcium channels in skeletal and cardiac                     
              muscle.  Experiments are also planned to study the turnover of                 
              calcium channels in neuronal membranes using as a probe the                    
              channel binding protein, omega conotoxin.                                      
                   Controlled entry of calcium into cells by way of calcium                  
              channels is a critical factor in control of skeletal muscle                    
              contraction and heart beat, in communication between nerve cells,              
              and in release of many hormones.  The results of this research                 
              will enhance our understanding of this important process.
