Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The American Institute of Physics will carry out a                        
              project to improve instruction in college and university                       
              physical science courses for preservice elementary school                      
              teachers.  Instructional modules for a college course in                       
              physical science will be produced based on materials                           
              developed by the Operation Physics project.  The course                        
              will emphasize the teachers' acquiring a better                                
              understanding of the physical science concepts they would                      
              be required to teach, an awareness of both their own and                       
              children's naive ideas about physical science phenomena,                       
              and a repertoire of techniques and strategies which they                       
              can use in their classroom to help children better learn                       
              and understand physical science concepts.  A group of                          
              outstanding physics and chemistry educators will contribute                    
              to the writing and field testing of the materials.  An                         
              extensive program of college faculty enhancement will be                       
              undertaken to educate faculty in the best practices of                         
              teaching physical science and how the materials should be                      
              used with prospective teachers.  Field test instructors                        
              will be solicited both through AAPT and ACS publications.                      
              The cost-sharing will be 24% of NSF's contribution.
