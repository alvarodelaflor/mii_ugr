Abstract    :
              9313071  Shen  This research project deals with the analysis and the development
               of an innovative damping treatment, called Intelligent  Constrained Layer
              (ICL), that integrates passive and active  damping characteristics to enhance
              system reliability and  provides adjustable damping. A variety of design
              configurations  using the ICL is developed and compared in order to suppress 
              bending and torsional vibrations and optimize damping  performance. The
              dynamics and stability of ICL are investigated  in the context of helicopter
              rotor blades, and a precision boring  process as an illustrative example of a
              manufacturing task. The  results of this research yield practical, innovative
              and fail-  safe damping treatments which enhance system reliability and 
              damping adjustability. In addition, they establish fundamental  theories such
              as controllability and stability of damped  distributed systems under active
              vibration control, and advance  damping design methodology in structural
              dynamics and  manufacturing.  ***
