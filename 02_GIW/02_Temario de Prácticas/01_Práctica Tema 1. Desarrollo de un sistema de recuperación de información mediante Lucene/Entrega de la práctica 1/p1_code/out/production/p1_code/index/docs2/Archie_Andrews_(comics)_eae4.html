<p>Archibald "Archie" Andrews debuted in <i>Pep Comics</i> 22 (December, 1941), and six and a half decades later, he is still a <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">redheaded</a> 17-year-old. Archie lives in <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/v/Riverdale_%28Archie_Comics%29_22a7.html" title="Riverdale (Archie Comics)">Riverdale</a>, attends <a href="../../../../articles/h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">Riverdale High</a> and is the only son of Mary Andrews and mid-level business executive Fred Andrews.</p>
<p>The stories of Little Archie are also published. As Little Archie, he had a dog named Spotty.</p>
<p>Archie is a typical small-town teenager. He studies at Riverdale High School, and he is also a lead singer of The Archies band. Generous, well-mannered, but clumsy, he is genuinely liked by many of his friends. As a normal teenager, Archie goes ga-ga over pretty girls, but both <a href="../../../../articles/v/e/r/Veronica_Lodge_c1ee.html" title="Veronica Lodge">Veronica Lodge</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/t/Betty_Cooper_6f41.html" title="Betty Cooper">Betty Cooper</a> try to keep him in check. He is the center of the love triangle between Veronica and Betty. His best friend is <a href="../../../../articles/j/u/g/Jughead_Jones_0a59.html" title="Jughead Jones">Jughead Jones</a>, who has been his friend since they were kids. He is an average athlete who always is second to his friend and 'enemy' <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/g/Reggie_Mantle_0bd8.html" title="Reggie Mantle">Reggie Mantle</a>, from whom he never hears the end of. Reggie is rich and conceited and contends with Archie for Veronica, with whom he shares an 'upper class' complex.</p>
<p>Archie often takes odd jobs to pay for his various projects and his dates. Archie is a good fellow, but he often acts clumsily, coming in conflict with Veronica's father <a href="../../../../articles/h/i/r/Hiram_Lodge_c7ca.html" title="Hiram Lodge">Hiram Lodge</a> and Riverdale High's principal, <a href="../../../../articles/m/r/2E/Mr._Weatherbee_46e5.html" title="Mr. Weatherbee">Waldo Weatherbee</a>. As the lead singer of <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Archies_6146.html" title="The Archies">The Archies</a></i>, Archie performs with Betty, Veronica, <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/g/Reggie_Mantle_0bd8.html" title="Reggie Mantle">Reggie Mantle</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/j/u/g/Jughead_Jones_0a59.html" title="Jughead Jones">Forsythe Pendleton "Jughead" Jones</a>.</p>
<p>A number of stories have revealed the Andrews family's origins in <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, with "Andy Andrews" immigrating to the United States and befriending <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/o/Moose_Mason_c9fd.html" title="Moose Mason">Moose Mason's</a> Russian ancestor, who was immigrating at the same time. Archie has been depicted wearing the traditional <a href="../../../../articles/k/i/l/Kilt.html" title="Kilt">kilt</a> of his ancestors and playing <a href="../../../../articles/b/a/g/Bagpipes.html" title="Bagpipes">bagpipes</a> (but not very well).</p>
<p>In addition to having many <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/b/Hobby.html" title="Hobby">hobbies</a>, Archie is passionate about his car. For decades, he was shown driving a 1916 <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/r/Ford_Model_T_913a.html" title="Ford Model T">Ford Model T</a> jalopy called "Betsy." In a story where Archie tried to have his jalopy insured, he described it as being a "<a href="../../../../articles/f/o/r/Ford.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Ford">Ford</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/e/Chevy.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Chevy">Chevy</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/l/y/Plymouth_%28automobile%29.html" title="Plymouth (automobile)">Plymouth</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/i/e/Pierce-Arrow_f619.html" title="Pierce-Arrow">Pierce-Arrow</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/c/Packard.html" title="Packard">Packard</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/s/DeSoto_%28automobile%29_96f6.html" title="DeSoto (automobile)">DeSoto</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/h/u/d/Hudson_Motor_Car_Company_4d0f.html" title="Hudson Motor Car Company">Hudson</a>..." The insurance agent originally thought Archie wanted to insure several cars, but then Archie explained that his jalopy was "a collection of replacement parts from several junkyards", with some parts of the car dating back to 1926.</p>
<p>Archie Digest 239, published in October 2007, contained a new story where Mr. Lodge owned a classic antique car that had a very strong resemblance to Archie's jalopy. In addition, the story had a character referred to as "Grandpa Andrews" who looked and dressed like Archie from the 1940s. <a href="http://archiecomicblogs.typepad.com/archie_news/2007/10/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archiecomicblogs.typepad.com/archie_news/2007/10/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Archie often greets his friends at <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/p/Pop_Tate_f9de.html" title="Pop Tate">Pop Tate's</a> Chocklit Shoppe. This <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/d/Soda_shop.html" title="Soda shop">soda shop</a>, a frequent hangout of <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/c/Archie%27s_Gang_6f13.html" title="Archie's Gang">Archie's Gang</a>, was based on real-life locations frequented by teenagers in <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/v/Haverhill%2C_Massachusetts_ddc0.html" title="Haverhill, Massachusetts">Haverhill, Massachusetts</a>, during the 1930s — Crown Confectionery and the Chocolate Shop on Merrimack Street and the Tuscarora on Winter Street.</p>
<p>Bob Montana went to high school in Haverhill from 1936 to 1939, and his sketchbook, an illustrated diary of life in Haverhill, was the true origin of Archie and his friends. Montana's daughters once made pages from this sketchbook available online. Several real-life residents of Haverhill were drawn into Montana's creation, as was revealed when film critic <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/r/Gerald_Peary_e99c.html" title="Gerald Peary">Gerald Peary</a> interviewed Haverhill's cartoon character prototypes for the <i><a href="../../../../articles/b/o/s/Boston_Globe_1f5c.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a></i> in 1980.</p>
<p>Arnold Daggett was the model for Moose, and Skinny Linehan (Jughead). At a 1989 reunion of Montana's classmates, Daggett said that he recognized himself in one strip "where I was getting kicked out of class." Miss Grundy was inspired by school librarian Elizabeth Tuck, while Haverhill High School principal Earl McLeod was the basis for Mr. Weatherbee. Montana knew the Massachusetts' Brahmin political family, the Lodges, because he had once painted a mural for them; he combined that name with actress <a href="../../../../articles/v/e/r/Veronica_Lake_1e54.html" title="Veronica Lake">Veronica Lake</a> to create the character of Veronica Lodge. Betty was based on Montana's girlfriend in New York.</p>

<p>Montana's characters were heard on radio in the early 1940s. <i>Archie Andrews</i> began on the Blue Network on <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, switched to Mutual in 1944, and then continued on <a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> from 1945 until <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/p/September_5.html" title="September 5">September 5</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>.

<p>Archie has forever been involved in the love triangle between Betty, Veronica, and himself. The love triangle is famous, and has become the hallmark of the Archie stories ever since the character was created more than 60 years ago.Initially, when Archie was known as "Chick", he was trying to woo the <a href="../../../../articles/g/i/r/Girl_next_door.html" title="Girl next door">girl next door</a> Betty Cooper for his object of affection. Initially, Betty only considered him as an annoying red head neighbour. When Veronica came to Riverdale, "Chick" switched his attention to her, leading Betty to jealousy. She then tried to win "Chick"'s affection back.</p>
<p>It is hard to decide which one Archie truly loves: Betty or Veronica. Because of his famous indecision between the girls, the terminology of "Betty and Veronica syndrome" is now being coined. Archie says in many occasions and stories that he considers Betty to be his best friend, someone that he can confide in, and is more comfortable with her. But on other occasions, he likes going on a date with Betty. Even when Jughead asked him if he likes kissing Betty, Archie blushly answered yes. With Betty sporadically dating <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/s/Jason_Blossom_ed39.html" title="Jason Blossom">Jason Blossom</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Archie_Comics_fb76.html#Adam_Chisholm" title="Minor characters in Archie Comics">Adam Chisholm</a> currently, he shows a tinge of jealousy. Archie also admitted on several occasions that whenever he wants to have his ego lifted up, he comes to Betty who will shower him with affection.</p>
<p>Archie also considers Veronica to be his girlfriend. Beautiful, stylish, and not to mention one of the richest girls in Riverdale, Veronica can easily manipulate him, and although he sometimes realizes it, he cannot do anything about it. Archie is always fighting for her affection, especially with other boys and his main rival, <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/g/Reggie_Mantle_0bd8.html" title="Reggie Mantle">Reggie Mantle</a>. Archie admits for some unexplained reason that Veronica can always take control over him. Sometimes he can be his own man, sometimes he can't (variants of this revelation exist as a result of differing writers).</p>
<p>Besides Betty and Veronica, another object of affection comes from another recently introduced character — a rich red-haired girl named <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/e/Cheryl_Blossom_ae66.html" title="Cheryl Blossom">Cheryl Blossom</a>. At first, she was deemed too sexual and a bit <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Promiscuous.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Promiscuous">promiscuous</a> and she was taken out of the series. But when her character was realized to be popular, she was brought her back again, shown in <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/v/Love_Showdown_%28Archie_Comics%29_c94c.html" title="Love Showdown (Archie Comics)">Love Showdown issues</a>.</p>
<p>Archie also dated <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Archie_Comics_fb76.html#Ginger_Lopez" title="Minor characters in Archie Comics">Ginger Lopez</a> un-officially every now and again.</p>

<p>Because fans sometimes include adult and erotic content, <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/c/Archie_Comics_6f6c.html" title="Archie Comics">Archie Comics</a> prohibits <a href="../../../../articles/f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">fan fiction</a> stories (even family-friendly ones) based on Archie Comics characters. The reason for this is that Archie Comics does not want to tarnish the clean and good-natured image of the characters or allow them to stray too far from what has been depicted in the comic. <a href="../../../../articles/f/a/n/Fanfiction.Net_4e17.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fanfiction.Net">Fanfiction.Net</a> received a <a href="../../../../articles/c/e/a/Cease_and_desist.html" title="Cease and desist">cease and desist</a> order from Archie Comics to remove any fanfics based on Archies characters from its site.</p>
<p>On April 4th 2003, Dad's Garage Theatre of Atlanta, was scheduled to debut a new play, <i>Archie's Weird Fantasy</i>, which depicted Riverdale's most famous resident coming out of the closet and moving to New York. The day before the play was scheduled to open, Archie Comics issued a cease and desist order threatening litigation if the play proceeded as written: "The play was to depict Archie and his pals from Riverdale growing up, coming out and facing censorship. 'Archie Comics' thought if Archie was portrayed as being gay, that would dilute and tarnish his image."
