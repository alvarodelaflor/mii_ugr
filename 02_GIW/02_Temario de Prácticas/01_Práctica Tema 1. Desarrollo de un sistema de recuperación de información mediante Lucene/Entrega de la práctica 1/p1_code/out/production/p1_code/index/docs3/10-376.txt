It mattered not from whence it\r\n      came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.\r\n\r\n      We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to\r\n      spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the\r\n      invention of men, as I have lived to see practised since. But\r\n      such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants\r\n      and others who corresponded abroad, and from them was handed\r\n      about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread\r\n      instantly over the whole nation, as they do now. But it seems\r\n      that the Government had a true account of it, and several\r\n      councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all\r\n      was kept very private. Hence it was that this rumour died off\r\n      again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very\r\n      little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true; till the\r\n      latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two\r\n      men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long Acre, or\r\n      rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they were in\r\n      endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as it had\r\n      gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the\r\n      Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning\r\n      themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the\r\n      truth, two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the\r\n      house and make inspection. This they did; and finding evident\r\n      tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they\r\n      gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague.\r\n      Whereupon it was given in to the parish clerk, and he also\r\n      returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill\r\n      of mortality in the usual manner, thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     Plague, 2. Parishes infected, 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The people showed a great concern at this, and began to be\r\n      alarmed all over the town, and the more, because in the last week\r\n      in December 1664 another man died in the same house, and of the\r\n      same distemper. And then we were easy again for about six weeks,\r\n      when none having died with any marks of infection, it was said\r\n      the distemper was gone; but after that, I think it was about the\r\n      12th of February, another died in another house, but in the same\r\n      parish and in the same manner.\r\n\r\n      This turned the people\xe2\x80\x99s eyes pretty much towards that end of the\r\n      town, and the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St\r\n      Giles\xe2\x80\x99s parish more than usual, it began to be suspected that the\r\n      plague was among the people at that end of the town, and that\r\n      many had died of it, though they had taken care to keep it as\r\n      much from the knowledge of the public as possible. This possessed\r\n      the heads of the people very much, and few cared to go through\r\n      Drury Lane, or the other streets suspected, unless they had\r\n      extraordinary business that obliged them to it\r\n\r\n      This increase of the bills stood thus: the usual number of\r\n      burials in a week, in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields and\r\n      St Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s, Holborn, were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen\r\n      each, few more or less; but from the time that the plague first\r\n      began in St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s parish, it was observed that the ordinary\r\n      burials increased in number considerably.

The last was\r\n      esteemed a pretty high bill; but after this we found the bills\r\n      successively increasing as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n Buried.  Increased.\r\n     December the 20th to the 27th               291       ...\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d     \xe2\x80\x9d      27th  \xe2\x80\x9d     3rd January        349        58\r\n     January  the  3rd  \xe2\x80\x9d    10th   \xe2\x80\x9d            394        45\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d     \xe2\x80\x9d      10th  \xe2\x80\x9d    17th   \xe2\x80\x9d            415        21\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d     \xe2\x80\x9d      17th  \xe2\x80\x9d    24th   \xe2\x80\x9d            474        59\r\n\r\n      This last bill was really frightful, being a higher number than\r\n      had been known to have been buried in one week since the\r\n      preceding visitation of 1656.\r\n\r\n      However, all this went off again, and the weather proving cold,\r\n      and the frost, which began in December, still continuing very\r\n      severe even till near the end of February, attended with sharp\r\n      though moderate winds, the bills decreased again, and the city\r\n      grew healthy, and everybody began to look upon the danger as good\r\n      as over; only that still the burials in St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s continued\r\n      high. From the beginning of April especially they stood at\r\n      twenty-five each week, till the week from the 18th to the 25th,\r\n      when there was buried in St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s parish thirty, whereof two of\r\n      the plague and eight of the spotted-fever, which was looked upon\r\n      as the same thing; likewise the number that died of the\r\n      spotted-fever in the whole increased, being eight the week\r\n      before, and twelve the week above-named.\r\n\r\n      This alarmed us all again, and terrible apprehensions were among\r\n      the people, especially the weather being now changed and growing\r\n      warm, and the summer being at hand. However, the next week there\r\n      seemed to be some hopes again; the bills were low, the number of\r\n      the dead in all was but 388, there was none of the plague, and\r\n      but four of the spotted-fever.\r\n\r\n      But the following week it returned again, and the distemper was\r\n      spread into two or three other parishes, viz., St Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\n      Holborn; St Clement Danes; and, to the great affliction of the\r\n      city, one died within the walls, in the parish of St Mary\r\n      Woolchurch, that is to say, in Bearbinder Lane, near Stocks\r\n      Market; in all there were nine of the plague and six of the\r\n      spotted-fever. It was, however, upon inquiry found that this\r\n      Frenchman who died in Bearbinder Lane was one who, having lived\r\n      in Long Acre, near the infected houses, had removed for fear of\r\n      the distemper, not knowing that he was already infected.\r\n\r\n      This was the beginning of May, yet the weather was temperate,\r\n      variable, and cool enough, and people had still some hopes. That\r\n      which encouraged them was that the city was healthy: the whole\r\n      ninety-seven parishes buried but fifty-four, and we began to hope\r\n      that, as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town,\r\n      it might go no farther; and the rather, because the next week,\r\n      which was from the 9th of May to the 16th, there died but three,\r\n      of which not one within the whole city or liberties; and St\r\n      Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s buried but fifteen, which was very low. \xe2\x80\x99Tis true St\r\n      Giles\xe2\x80\x99s buried two-and-thirty, but still, as there was but one of\r\n      the plague, people began to be easy. The whole bill also was very\r\n      low, for the week before the bill was but 347, and the week above\r\n      mentioned but 343. We continued in these hopes for a few days,\r\n      but it was but for a few, for the people were no more to be\r\n      deceived thus; they searched the houses and found that the plague\r\n      was really spread every way, and that many died of it every day.\r\n      So that now all our extenuations abated, and it was no more to be\r\n      concealed; nay, it quickly appeared that the infection had spread\r\n      itself beyond all hopes of abatement. That in the parish of St\r\n      Giles it was gotten into several streets, and several families\r\n      lay all sick together; and, accordingly, in the weekly bill for\r\n      the next week the thing began to show itself. There was indeed\r\n      but fourteen set down of the plague, but this was all knavery and\r\n      collusion, for in St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s parish they buried forty in all,\r\n      whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague, though\r\n      they were set down of other distempers; and though the number of\r\n      all the burials were not increased above thirty-two, and the\r\n      whole bill being but 385, yet there was fourteen of the\r\n      spotted-fever, as well as fourteen of the plague; and we took it\r\n      for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week\r\n      of the plague.\r\n\r\n      The next bill was from the 23rd of May to the 30th, when the\r\n      number of the plague was seventeen. But the burials in St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      were fifty-three\xe2\x80\x94a frightful number!\xe2\x80\x94of whom they set down but\r\n      nine of the plague; but on an examination more strictly by the\r\n      justices of peace, and at the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s request, it was found\r\n      there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that\r\n      parish, but had been set down of the spotted-fever or other\r\n      distempers, besides others concealed.\r\n\r\n      But those were trifling things to what followed immediately\r\n      after; for now the weather set in hot, and from the first week in\r\n      June the infection spread in a dreadful manner, and the bills\r\n      rose high; the articles of the fever, spotted-fever, and teeth\r\n      began to swell; for all that could conceal their distempers did\r\n      it, to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse\r\n      with them, and also to prevent authority shutting up their\r\n      houses; which, though it was not yet practised, yet was\r\n      threatened, and people were extremely terrified at the thoughts\r\n      of it.\r\n\r\n      The second week in June, the parish of St Giles, where still the\r\n      weight of the infection lay, buried 120, whereof though the bills\r\n      said but sixty-eight of the plague, everybody said there had been\r\n      100 at least, calculating it from the usual number of funerals in\r\n      that parish, as above.\r\n\r\n      Till this week the city continued free, there having never any\r\n      died, except that one Frenchman whom I mentioned before, within\r\n      the whole ninety-seven parishes. Now there died four within the\r\n      city, one in Wood Street, one in Fenchurch Street, and two in\r\n      Crooked Lane. Southwark was entirely free, having not one yet\r\n      died on that side of the water.\r\n\r\n      I lived without Aldgate, about midway between Aldgate Church and\r\n      Whitechappel Bars, on the left hand or north side of the street;\r\n      and as the distemper had not reached to that side of the city,\r\n      our neighbourhood continued very easy. But at the other end of\r\n      the town their consternation was very great: and the richer sort\r\n      of people, especially the nobility and gentry from the west part\r\n      of the city, thronged out of town with their families and\r\n      servants in an unusual manner; and this was more particularly\r\n      seen in Whitechappel; that is to say, the Broad Street where I\r\n      lived; indeed, nothing was to be seen but waggons and carts, with\r\n      goods, women, servants, children, &c.; coaches filled with people\r\n      of the better sort and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying\r\n      away; then empty waggons and carts appeared, and spare horses\r\n      with servants, who, it was apparent, were returning or sent from\r\n      the countries to fetch more people; besides innumerable numbers\r\n      of men on horseback, some alone, others with servants, and,\r\n      generally speaking, all loaded with baggage and fitted out for\r\n      travelling, as anyone might perceive by their appearance.\r\n\r\n      This was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see, and as it\r\n      was a sight which I could not but look on from morning to night\r\n      (for indeed there was nothing else of moment to be seen), it\r\n      filled me with very serious thoughts of the misery that was\r\n      coming upon the city, and the unhappy condition of those that\r\n      would be left in it.\r\n\r\n      This hurry of the people was such for some weeks that there was\r\n      no getting at the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s door without exceeding difficulty;\r\n      there were such pressing and crowding there to get passes and\r\n      certificates of health for such as travelled abroad, for without\r\n      these there was no being admitted to pass through the towns upon\r\n      the road, or to lodge in any inn. Now, as there had none died in\r\n      the city for all this time, my Lord Mayor gave certificates of\r\n      health without any difficulty to all those who lived in the\r\n      ninety-seven parishes, and to those within the liberties too for\r\n      a while.\r\n\r\n      This hurry, I say, continued some weeks, that is to say, all the\r\n      month of May and June, and the more because it was rumoured that\r\n      an order of the Government was to be issued out to place\r\n      turnpikes and barriers on the road to prevent people travelling,\r\n      and that the towns on the road would not suffer people from\r\n      London to pass for fear of bringing the infection along with\r\n      them, though neither of these rumours had any foundation but in\r\n      the imagination, especially at-first.\r\n\r\n      I now began to consider seriously with myself concerning my own\r\n      case, and how I should dispose of myself; that is to say, whether\r\n      I should resolve to stay in London or shut up my house and flee,\r\n      as many of my neighbours did. I have set this particular down so\r\n      fully, because I know not but it may be of moment to those who\r\n      come after me, if they come to be brought to the same distress,\r\n      and to the same manner of making their choice; and therefore I\r\n      desire this account may pass with them rather for a direction to\r\n      themselves to act by than a history of my actings, seeing it may\r\n      not be of one farthing value to them to note what became of me.\r\n\r\n      I had two important things before me: the one was the carrying on\r\n      my business and shop, which was considerable, and in which was\r\n      embarked all my effects in the world; and the other was the\r\n      preservation of my life in so dismal a calamity as I saw\r\n      apparently was coming upon the whole city, and which, however\r\n      great it was, my fears perhaps, as well as other people\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\n      represented to be much greater than it could be.\r\n\r\n      The first consideration was of great moment to me; my trade was a\r\n      saddler, and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance\r\n      trade, but among the merchants trading to the English colonies in\r\n      America, so my effects lay very much in the hands of such. I was\r\n      a single man, \xe2\x80\x99tis true, but I had a family of servants whom I\r\n      kept at my business; had a house, shop, and warehouses filled\r\n      with goods; and, in short, to leave them all as things in such a\r\n      case must be left (that is to say, without any overseer or person\r\n      fit to be trusted with them), had been to hazard the loss not\r\n      only of my trade, but of my goods, and indeed of all I had in the\r\n      world.\r\n\r\n      I had an elder brother at the same time in London, and not many\r\n      years before come over from Portugal: and advising with him, his\r\n      answer was in three words, the same that was given in another\r\n      case quite different, viz., \xe2\x80\x98Master, save thyself.\xe2\x80\x99 In a word, he\r\n      was for my retiring into the country, as he resolved to do\r\n      himself with his family; telling me what he had, it seems, heard\r\n      abroad, that the best preparation for the plague was to run away\r\n      from it. As to my argument of losing my trade, my goods, or\r\n      debts, he quite confuted me. He told me the same thing which I\r\n      argued for my staying, viz., that I would trust God with my\r\n      safety and health, was the strongest repulse to my pretensions of\r\n      losing my trade and my goods; \xe2\x80\x98for\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98is it not as\r\n      reasonable that you should trust God with the chance or risk of\r\n      losing your trade, as that you should stay in so eminent a point\r\n      of danger, and trust Him with your life?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      I could not argue that I was in any strait as to a place where to\r\n      go, having several friends and relations in Northamptonshire,\r\n      whence our family first came from; and particularly, I had an\r\n      only sister in Lincolnshire, very willing to receive and\r\n      entertain me.\r\n\r\n      My brother, who had already sent his wife and two children into\r\n      Bedfordshire, and resolved to follow them, pressed my going very\r\n      earnestly; and I had once resolved to comply with his desires,\r\n      but at that time could get no horse; for though it is true all\r\n      the people did not go out of the city of London, yet I may\r\n      venture to say that in a manner all the horses did; for there was\r\n      hardly a horse to be bought or hired in the whole city for some\r\n      weeks. Once I resolved to travel on foot with one servant, and,\r\n      as many did, lie at no inn, but carry a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s tent with us,\r\n      and so lie in the fields, the weather being very warm, and no\r\n      danger from taking cold. I say, as many did, because several did\r\n      so at last, especially those who had been in the armies in the\r\n      war which had not been many years past; and I must needs say\r\n      that, speaking of second causes, had most of the people that\r\n      travelled done so, the plague had not been carried into so many\r\n      country towns and houses as it was, to the great damage, and\r\n      indeed to the ruin, of abundance of people.\r\n\r\n      But then my servant, whom I had intended to take down with me,\r\n      deceived me; and being frighted at the increase of the distemper,\r\n      and not knowing when I should go, he took other measures, and\r\n      left me, so I was put off for that time; and, one way or other, I\r\n      always found that to appoint to go away was always crossed by\r\n      some accident or other, so as to disappoint and put it off again;\r\n      and this brings in a story which otherwise might be thought a\r\n      needless digression, viz., about these disappointments being from\r\n      Heaven.\r\n\r\n      I mention this story also as the best method I can advise any\r\n      person to take in such a case, especially if he be one that makes\r\n      conscience of his duty, and would be directed what to do in it,\r\n      namely, that he should keep his eye upon the particular\r\n      providences which occur at that time, and look upon them\r\n      complexly, as they regard one another, and as all together regard\r\n      the question before him: and then, I think, he may safely take\r\n      them for intimations from Heaven of what is his unquestioned duty\r\n      to do in such a case; I mean as to going away from or staying in\r\n      the place where we dwell, when visited with an infectious\r\n      distemper.\r\n\r\n      It came very warmly into my mind one morning, as I was musing on\r\n      this particular thing, that as nothing attended us without the\r\n      direction or permission of Divine Power, so these disappointments\r\n      must have something in them extraordinary; and I ought to\r\n      consider whether it did not evidently point out, or intimate to\r\n      me, that it was the will of Heaven I should not go. It\r\n      immediately followed in my thoughts, that if it really was from\r\n      God that I should stay, He was able effectually to preserve me in\r\n      the midst of all the death and danger that would surround me; and\r\n      that if I attempted to secure myself by fleeing from my\r\n      habitation, and acted contrary to these intimations, which I\r\n      believe to be Divine, it was a kind of flying from God, and that\r\n      He could cause His justice to overtake me when and where He\r\n      thought fit.\r\n\r\n      These thoughts quite turned my resolutions again, and when I came\r\n      to discourse with my brother again I told him that I inclined to\r\n      stay and take my lot in that station in which God had placed me,\r\n      and that it seemed to be made more especially my duty, on the\r\n      account of what I have said.\r\n\r\n      My brother, though a very religious man himself, laughed at all I\r\n      had suggested about its being an intimation from Heaven, and told\r\n      me several stories of such foolhardy people, as he called them,\r\n      as I was; that I ought indeed to submit to it as a work of Heaven\r\n      if I had been any way disabled by distempers or diseases, and\r\n      that then not being able to go, I ought to acquiesce in the\r\n      direction of Him, who, having been my Maker, had an undisputed\r\n      right of sovereignty in disposing of me, and that then there had\r\n      been no difficulty to determine which was the call of His\r\n      providence and which was not; but that I should take it as an\r\n      intimation from Heaven that I should not go out of town, only\r\n      because I could not hire a horse to go, or my fellow was run away\r\n      that was to attend me, was ridiculous, since at the time I had my\r\n      health and limbs, and other servants, and might with ease travel\r\n      a day or two on foot, and having a good certificate of being in\r\n      perfect health, might either hire a horse or take post on the\r\n      road, as I thought fit.\r\n\r\n      Then he proceeded to tell me of the mischievous consequences\r\n      which attended the presumption of the Turks and Mahometans in\r\n      Asia and in other places where he had been (for my brother, being\r\n      a merchant, was a few years before, as I have already observed,\r\n      returned from abroad, coming last from Lisbon), and how,\r\n      presuming upon their professed predestinating notions, and of\r\n      every man\xe2\x80\x99s end being predetermined and unalterably beforehand\r\n      decreed, they would go unconcerned into infected places and\r\n      converse with infected persons, by which means they died at the\r\n      rate of ten or fifteen thousand a week, whereas the Europeans or\r\n      Christian merchants, who kept themselves retired and reserved,\r\n      generally escaped the contagion.\r\n\r\n      Upon these arguments my brother changed my resolutions again, and\r\n      I began to resolve to go, and accordingly made all things ready;\r\n      for, in short, the infection increased round me, and the bills\r\n      were risen to almost seven hundred a week, and my brother told me\r\n      he would venture to stay no longer. I desired him to let me\r\n      consider of it but till the next day, and I would resolve: and as\r\n      I had already prepared everything as well as I could as to MY\r\n      business, and whom to entrust my affairs with, I had little to do\r\n      but to resolve.\r\n\r\n      I went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind,\r\n      irresolute, and not knowing what to do. I had set the evening\r\n      wholly\xe2\x80\x94apart to consider seriously about it, and was all alone;\r\n      for already people had, as it were by a general consent, taken up\r\n      the custom of not going out of doors after sunset; the reasons I\r\n      shall have occasion to say more of by-and-by.\r\n\r\n      In the retirement of this evening I endeavoured to resolve,\r\n      first, what was my duty to do, and I stated the arguments with\r\n      which my brother had pressed me to go into the country, and I\r\n      set, against them the strong impressions which I had on my mind\r\n      for staying; the visible call I seemed to have from the\r\n      particular circumstance of my calling, and the care due from me\r\n      for the preservation of my effects, which were, as I might say,\r\n      my estate; also the intimations which I thought I had from\r\n      Heaven, that to me signified a kind of direction to venture; and\r\n      it occurred to me that if I had what I might call a direction to\r\n      stay, I ought to suppose it contained a promise of being\r\n      preserved if I obeyed.\r\n\r\n      This lay close to me, and my mind seemed more and more encouraged\r\n      to stay than ever, and supported with a secret satisfaction that\r\n      I should be kept. Add to this, that, turning over the Bible which\r\n      lay before me, and while my thoughts were more than ordinarily\r\n      serious upon the question, I cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Well, I know not what to\r\n      do; Lord, direct me !\xe2\x80\x99 and the like; and at that juncture I\r\n      happened to stop turning over the book at the ninety-first Psalm,\r\n      and casting my eye on the second verse, I read on to the seventh\r\n      verse exclusive, and after that included the tenth, as follows:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God,\r\n      in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare\r\n      of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover\r\n      thee with His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His\r\n      truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid\r\n      for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;\r\n      nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the\r\n      destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy\r\n      side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come\r\n      nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the\r\n      reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is\r\n      my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no\r\n      evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy\r\n      dwelling,\xe2\x80\x99 &C.\r\n\r\n      I scarce need tell the reader that from that moment I resolved\r\n      that I would stay in the town, and casting myself entirely upon\r\n      the goodness and protection of the Almighty, would not seek any\r\n      other shelter whatever; and that, as my times were in His hands,\r\n      He was as able to keep me in a time of the infection as in a time\r\n      of health; and if He did not think fit to deliver me, still I was\r\n      in His hands, and it was meet He should do with me as should seem\r\n      good to Him.\r\n\r\n      With this resolution I went to bed; and I was further confirmed\r\n      in it the next day by the woman being taken ill with whom I had\r\n      intended to entrust my house and all my affairs. But I had a\r\n      further obligation laid on me on the same side, for the next day\r\n      I found myself very much out of order also, so that if I would\r\n      have gone away, I could not, and I continued ill three or four\r\n      days, and this entirely determined my stay; so I took my leave of\r\n      my brother, who went away to Dorking, in Surrey, and afterwards\r\n      fetched a round farther into Buckinghamshire or Bedfordshire, to\r\n      a retreat he had found out there for his family.\r\n\r\n      It was a very ill time to be sick in, for if any one complained,\r\n      it was immediately said he had the plague; and though I had\r\n      indeed no symptom of that distemper, yet being very ill, both in\r\n      my head and in my stomach, I was not without apprehension that I\r\n      really was infected; but in about three days I grew better; the\r\n      third night I rested well, sweated a little, and was much\r\n      refreshed. The apprehensions of its being the infection went also\r\n      quite away with my illness, and I went about my business as\r\n      usual.\r\n\r\n      These things, however, put off all my thoughts of going into the\r\n      country; and my brother also being gone, I had no more debate\r\n      either with him or with myself on that subject.\r\n\r\n      It was now mid-July, and the plague, which had chiefly raged at\r\n      the other end of the town, and, as I said before, in the parishes\r\n      of St Giles, St Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s, Holborn, and towards Westminster, began\r\n      to now come eastward towards the part where I lived. It was to be\r\n      observed, indeed, that it did not come straight on towards us;\r\n      for the city, that is to say, within the walls, was indifferently\r\n      healthy still; nor was it got then very much over the water into\r\n      Southwark; for though there died that week 1268 of all\r\n      distempers, whereof it might be supposed above 600 died of the\r\n      plague, yet there was but twenty-eight in the whole city, within\r\n      the walls, and but nineteen in Southwark, Lambeth parish\r\n      included; whereas in the parishes of St Giles and St\r\n      Martin-in-the-Fields alone there died 421.\r\n\r\n      But we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out-parishes,\r\n      which being very populous, and fuller also of poor, the distemper\r\n      found more to prey upon than in the city, as I shall observe\r\n      afterwards. We perceived, I say, the distemper to draw our way,\r\n      viz., by the parishes of Clarkenwell, Cripplegate, Shoreditch,\r\n      and Bishopsgate; which last two parishes joining to Aldgate,\r\n      Whitechappel, and Stepney, the infection came at length to spread\r\n      its utmost rage and violence in those parts, even when it abated\r\n      at the western parishes where it began.\r\n\r\n      It was very strange to observe that in this particular week, from\r\n      the 4th to the 11th of July, when, as I have observed, there died\r\n      near 400 of the plague in the two parishes of St Martin and St\r\n      Giles-in-the-Fields only, there died in the parish of Aldgate but\r\n      four, in the parish of Whitechappel three, in the parish of\r\n      Stepney but one.\r\n\r\n      Likewise in the next week, from the 11th of July to the 18th,\r\n      when the week\xe2\x80\x99s bill was 1761, yet there died no more of the\r\n      plague, on the whole Southwark side of the water, than sixteen.\r\n      But this face of things soon changed, and it began to thicken in\r\n      Cripplegate parish especially, and in Clarkenwell; so that by the\r\n      second week in August, Cripplegate parish alone buried 886, and\r\n      Clarkenwell 155. Of the first, 850 might well be reckoned to die\r\n      of the plague; and of the last, the bill itself said 145 were of\r\n      the plague.\r\n\r\n      During the month of July, and while, as I have observed, our part\r\n      of the town seemed to be spared in comparison of the west part, I\r\n      went ordinarily about the streets, as my business required, and\r\n      particularly went generally once in a day, or in two days, into\r\n      the city, to my brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, which he had given me charge of,\r\n      and to see if it was safe; and having the key in my pocket, I\r\n      used to go into the house, and over most of the rooms, to see\r\n      that all was well; for though it be something wonderful to tell,\r\n      that any should have hearts so hardened in the midst of such a\r\n      calamity as to rob and steal, yet certain it is that all sorts of\r\n      villainies, and even levities and debaucheries, were then\r\n      practised in the town as openly as ever\xe2\x80\x94I will not say quite as\r\n      frequently, because the numbers of people were many ways\r\n      lessened.\r\n\r\n      But the city itself began now to be visited too, I mean within\r\n      the walls; but the number of people there were indeed extremely\r\n      lessened by so great a multitude having been gone into the\r\n      country; and even all this month of July they continued to flee,\r\n      though not in such multitudes as formerly. In August, indeed,\r\n      they fled in such a manner that I began to think there would be\r\n      really none but magistrates and servants left in the city.\r\n\r\n      As they fled now out of the city, so I should observe that the\r\n      Court removed early, viz., in the month of June, and went to\r\n      Oxford, where it pleased God to preserve them; and the distemper\r\n      did not, as I heard of, so much as touch them, for which I cannot\r\n      say that I ever saw they showed any great token of thankfulness,\r\n      and hardly anything of reformation, though they did not want\r\n      being told that their crying vices might without breach of\r\n      charity be said to have gone far in bringing that terrible\r\n      judgement upon the whole nation.\r\n\r\n      The face of London was\xe2\x80\x94now indeed strangely altered: I mean the\r\n      whole mass of buildings, city, liberties, suburbs, Westminster,\r\n      Southwark, and altogether; for as to the particular part called\r\n      the city, or within the walls, that was not yet much infected.\r\n      But in the whole the face of things, I say, was much altered;\r\n      sorrow and sadness sat upon every face; and though some parts\r\n      were not yet overwhelmed, yet all looked deeply concerned; and,\r\n      as we saw it apparently coming on, so every one looked on himself\r\n      and his family as in the utmost danger. Were it possible to\r\n      represent those times exactly to those that did not see them, and\r\n      give the reader due ideas of the horror \xe2\x80\x98that everywhere\r\n      presented itself, it must make just impressions upon their minds\r\n      and fill them with surprise. London might well be said to be all\r\n      in tears; the mourners did not go about the streets indeed, for\r\n      nobody put on black or made a formal dress of mourning for their\r\n      nearest friends; but the voice of mourners was truly heard in the\r\n      streets. The shrieks of women and children at the windows and\r\n      doors of their houses, where their dearest relations were perhaps\r\n      dying, or just dead, were so frequent to be heard as we passed\r\n      the streets, that it was enough to pierce the stoutest heart in\r\n      the world to hear them. Tears and lamentations were seen almost\r\n      in every house, especially in the first part of the visitation;\r\n      for towards the latter end men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts were hardened, and death\r\n      was so always before their eyes, that they did not so much\r\n      concern themselves for the loss of their friends, expecting that\r\n      themselves should be summoned the next hour.\r\n\r\n      Business led me out sometimes to the other end of the town, even\r\n      when the sickness was chiefly there; and as the thing was new to\r\n      me, as well as to everybody else, it was a most surprising thing\r\n      to see those streets which were usually so thronged now grown\r\n      desolate, and so few people to be seen in them, that if I had\r\n      been a stranger and at a loss for my way, I might sometimes have\r\n      gone the length of a whole street (I mean of the by-streets), and\r\n      seen nobody to direct me except watchmen set at the doors of such\r\n      houses as were shut up, of which I shall speak presently.\r\n\r\n      One day, being at that part of the town on some special business,\r\n      curiosity led me to observe things more than usually, and indeed\r\n      I walked a great way where I had no business. I went up Holborn,\r\n      and there the street was full of people, but they walked in the\r\n      middle of the great street, neither on one side or other,\r\n      because, as I suppose, they would not mingle with anybody that\r\n      came out of houses, or meet with smells and scent from houses\r\n      that might be infected.\r\n\r\n      The Inns of Court were all shut up; nor were very many of the\r\n      lawyers in the Temple, or Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, or Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, to be\r\n      seen there. Everybody was at peace; there was no occasion for\r\n      lawyers; besides, it being in the time of the vacation too, they\r\n      were generally gone into the country. Whole rows of houses in\r\n      some places were shut close up, the inhabitants all fled, and\r\n      only a watchman or two left.\r\n\r\n      When I speak of rows of houses being shut up, I do not mean shut\r\n      up by the magistrates, but that great numbers of persons followed\r\n      the Court, by the necessity of their employments and other\r\n      dependences; and as others retired, really frighted with the\r\n      distemper, it was a mere desolating of some of the streets. But\r\n      the fright was not yet near so great in the city, abstractly so\r\n      called, and particularly because, though they were at first in a\r\n      most inexpressible consternation, yet as I have observed that the\r\n      distemper intermitted often at first, so they were, as it were,\r\n      alarmed and unalarmed again, and this several times, till it\r\n      began to be familiar to them; and that even when it appeared\r\n      violent, yet seeing it did not presently spread into the city, or\r\n      the east and south parts, the people began to take courage, and\r\n      to be, as I may say, a little hardened. It is true a vast many\r\n      people fled, as I have observed, yet they were chiefly from the\r\n      west end of the town, and from that we call the heart of the\r\n      city: that is to say, among the wealthiest of the people, and\r\n      such people as were unencumbered with trades and business. But of\r\n      the rest, the generality stayed, and seemed to abide the worst;\r\n      so that in the place we call the Liberties, and in the suburbs,\r\n      in Southwark, and in the east part, such as Wapping, Ratcliff,\r\n      Stepney, Rotherhithe, and the like, the people generally stayed,\r\n      except here and there a few wealthy families, who, as above, did\r\n      not depend upon their business.\r\n\r\n      It must not be forgot here that the city and suburbs were\r\n      prodigiously full of people at the time of this visitation, I\r\n      mean at the time that it began; for though I have lived to see a\r\n      further increase, and mighty throngs of people settling in London\r\n      more than ever, yet we had always a notion that the numbers of\r\n      people which, the wars being over, the armies disbanded, and the\r\n      royal family and the monarchy being restored, had flocked to\r\n      London to settle in business, or to depend upon and attend the\r\n      Court for rewards of services, preferments, and the like, was\r\n      such that the town was computed to have in it above a hundred\r\n      thousand people more than ever it held before; nay, some took\r\n      upon them to say it had twice as many, because all the ruined\r\n      families of the royal party flocked hither. All the old soldiers\r\n      set up trades here, and abundance of families settled here.\r\n      Again, the Court brought with them a great flux of pride, and new\r\n      fashions. All people were grown gay and luxurious, and the joy of\r\n      the Restoration had brought a vast many families to London.\r\n\r\n      I often thought that as Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans when\r\n      the Jews were assembled together to celebrate the Passover\xe2\x80\x94by\r\n      which means an incredible number of people were surprised there\r\n      who would otherwise have been in other countries\xe2\x80\x94so the plague\r\n      entered London when an incredible increase of people had happened\r\n      occasionally, by the particular circumstances above-named. As\r\n      this conflux of the people to a youthful and gay Court made a\r\n      great trade in the city, especially in everything that belonged\r\n      to fashion and finery, so it drew by consequence a great number\r\n      of workmen, manufacturers, and the like, being mostly poor people\r\n      who depended upon their labour. And I remember in particular that\r\n      in a representation to my Lord Mayor of the condition of the\r\n      poor, it was estimated that there were no less than an hundred\r\n      thousand riband-weavers in and about the city, the chiefest\r\n      number of whom lived then in the parishes of Shoreditch, Stepney,\r\n      Whitechappel, and Bishopsgate, that, namely, about Spitalfields;\r\n      that is to say, as Spitalfields was then, for it was not so large\r\n      as now by one fifth part.\r\n\r\n      By this, however, the number of people in the whole may be judged\r\n      of; and, indeed, I often wondered that, after the prodigious\r\n      numbers of people that went away at first, there was yet so great\r\n      a multitude left as it appeared there was.\r\n\r\n      But I must go back again to the beginning of this surprising\r\n      time. While the fears of the people were young, they were\r\n      increased strangely by several odd accidents which, put\r\n      altogether, it was really a wonder the whole body of the people\r\n      did not rise as one man and abandon their dwellings, leaving the\r\n      place as a space of ground designed by Heaven for an Akeldama,\r\n      doomed to be destroyed from the face of the earth, and that all\r\n      that would be found in it would perish with it. I shall name but\r\n      a few of these things; but sure they were so many, and so many\r\n      wizards and cunning people propagating them, that I have often\r\n      wondered there was any (women especially) left behind.\r\n\r\n      In the first place, a blazing star or comet appeared for several\r\n      months before the plague, as there did the year after another, a\r\n      little before the fire. The old women and the phlegmatic\r\n      hypochondriac part of the other sex, whom I could almost call old\r\n      women too, remarked (especially afterward, though not till both\r\n      those judgements were over) that those two comets passed directly\r\n      over the city, and that so very near the houses that it was plain\r\n      they imported something peculiar to the city alone; that the\r\n      comet before the pestilence was of a faint, dull, languid colour,\r\n      and its motion very heavy, Solemn, and slow; but that the comet\r\n      before the fire was bright and sparkling, or, as others said,\r\n      flaming, and its motion swift and furious; and that, accordingly,\r\n      one foretold a heavy judgement, slow but severe, terrible and\r\n      frightful, as was the plague; but the other foretold a stroke,\r\n      sudden, swift, and fiery as the conflagration. Nay, so particular\r\n      some people were, that as they looked upon that comet preceding\r\n      the fire, they fancied that they not only saw it pass swiftly and\r\n      fiercely, and could perceive the motion with their eye, but even\r\n      they heard it; that it made a rushing, mighty noise, fierce and\r\n      terrible, though at a distance, and but just perceivable.\r\n\r\n      I saw both these stars, and, I must confess, had so much of the\r\n      common notion of such things in my head, that I was apt to look\r\n      upon them as the forerunners and warnings of God\xe2\x80\x99s judgements;\r\n      and especially when, after the plague had followed the first, I\r\n      yet saw another of the like kind, I could not but say God had not\r\n      yet sufficiently scourged the city.\r\n\r\n      But I could not at the same time carry these things to the height\r\n      that others did, knowing, too, that natural causes are assigned\r\n      by the astronomers for such things, and that their motions and\r\n      even their revolutions are calculated, or pretended to be\r\n      calculated, so that they cannot be so perfectly called the\r\n      forerunners or foretellers, much less the procurers, of such\r\n      events as pestilence, war, fire, and the like.\r\n\r\n      But let my thoughts and the thoughts of the philosophers be, or\r\n      have been, what they will, these things had a more than ordinary\r\n      influence upon the minds of the common people, and they had\r\n      almost universal melancholy apprehensions of some dreadful\r\n      calamity and judgement coming upon the city; and this principally\r\n      from the sight of this comet, and the little alarm that was given\r\n      in December by two people dying at St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s, as above.\r\n\r\n      The apprehensions of the people were likewise strangely increased\r\n      by the error of the times; in which, I think, the people, from\r\n      what principle I cannot imagine, were more addicted to prophecies\r\n      and astrological conjurations, dreams, and old wives\xe2\x80\x99 tales than\r\n      ever they were before or since. Whether this unhappy temper was\r\n      originally raised by the follies of some people who got money by\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, by printing predictions and prognostications\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      know not; but certain it is, books frighted them terribly, such\r\n      as Lilly\xe2\x80\x99s Almanack, Gadbury\xe2\x80\x99s Astrological Predictions, Poor\r\n      Robin\xe2\x80\x99s Almanack, and the like; also several pretended religious\r\n      books, one entitled, Come out of her, my People, lest you be\r\n      Partaker of her Plagues; another called, Fair Warning; another,\r\n      Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Remembrancer; and many such, all, or most part of\r\n      which, foretold, directly or covertly, the ruin of the city. Nay,\r\n      some were so enthusiastically bold as to run about the streets\r\n      with their oral predictions, pretending they were sent to preach\r\n      to the city; and one in particular, who, like Jonah to Nineveh,\r\n      cried in the streets, \xe2\x80\x98Yet forty days, and London shall be\r\n      destroyed.\xe2\x80\x99 I will not be positive whether he said yet forty days\r\n      or yet a few days. Another ran about naked, except a pair of\r\n      drawers about his waist, crying day and night, like a man that\r\n      Josephus mentions, who cried, \xe2\x80\x98Woe to Jerusalem!\xe2\x80\x99 a little before\r\n      the destruction of that city. So this poor naked creature cried,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Oh, the great and the dreadful God!\xe2\x80\x99 and said no more, but\r\n      repeated those words continually, with a voice and countenance\r\n      full of horror, a swift pace; and nobody could ever find him to\r\n      stop or rest, or take any sustenance, at least that ever I could\r\n      hear of. I met this poor creature several times in the streets,\r\n      and would have spoken to him, but he would not enter into speech\r\n      with me or any one else, but held on his dismal cries\r\n      continually.\r\n\r\n      These things terrified the people to the last degree, and\r\n      especially when two or three times, as I have mentioned already,\r\n      they found one or two in the bills dead of the plague at St\r\n      Giles\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n      Next to these public things were the dreams of old women, or, I\r\n      should say, the interpretation of old women upon other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      dreams; and these put abundance of people even out of their wits.\r\n      Some heard voices warning them to be gone, for that there would\r\n      be such a plague in London, so that the living would not be able\r\n      to bury the dead. Others saw apparitions in the air; and I must\r\n      be allowed to say of both, I hope without breach of charity, that\r\n      they heard voices that never spake, and saw sights that never\r\n      appeared; but the imagination of the people was really turned\r\n      wayward and possessed. And no wonder, if they who were poring\r\n      continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures, representations\r\n      and appearances, which had nothing in them but air, and vapour.\r\n      Here they told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand coming\r\n      out of a cloud, with a point hanging directly over the city;\r\n      there they saw hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be\r\n      buried; and there again, heaps of dead bodies lying unburied, and\r\n      the like, just as the imagination of the poor terrified people\r\n      furnished them with matter to work upon.\r\n\r\n      So hypochondriac fancies represent\r\n      Ships, armies, battles in the firmament;\r\n      Till steady eyes the exhalations solve,\r\n      And all to its first matter, cloud, resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n      I could fill this account with the strange relations such people\r\n      gave every day of what they had seen; and every one was so\r\n      positive of their having seen what they pretended to see, that\r\n      there was no contradicting them without breach of friendship, or\r\n      being accounted rude and unmannerly on the one hand, and profane\r\n      and impenetrable on the other. One time before the plague was\r\n      begun (otherwise than as I have said in St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s), I think it\r\n      was in March, seeing a crowd of people in the street, I joined\r\n      with them to satisfy my curiosity, and found them all staring up\r\n      into the air to see what a woman told them appeared plain to her,\r\n      which was an angel clothed in white, with a fiery sword in his\r\n      hand, waving it or brandishing it over his head. She described\r\n      every part of the figure to the life, showed them the motion and\r\n      the form, and the poor people came into it so eagerly, and with\r\n      so much readiness; \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I see it all plainly,\xe2\x80\x99 says one;\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s the sword as plain as can be.\xe2\x80\x99 Another saw the angel.\r\n      One saw his very face, and cried out what a glorious creature he\r\n      was! One saw one thing, and one another. I looked as earnestly as\r\n      the rest, but perhaps not with so much willingness to be imposed\r\n      upon; and I said, indeed, that I could see nothing but a white\r\n      cloud, bright on one side by the shining of the sun upon the\r\n      other part. The woman endeavoured to show it me, but could not\r\n      make me confess that I saw it, which, indeed, if I had I must\r\n      have lied. But the woman, turning upon me, looked in my face, and\r\n      fancied I laughed, in which her imagination deceived her too, for\r\n      I really did not laugh, but was very seriously reflecting how the\r\n      poor people were terrified by the force of their own imagination.\r\n      However, she turned from me, called me profane fellow, and a\r\n      scoffer; told me that it was a time of God\xe2\x80\x99s anger, and dreadful\r\n      judgements were approaching, and that despisers such as I should\r\n      wander and perish.\r\n\r\n      The people about her seemed disgusted as well as she; and I found\r\n      there was no persuading them that I did not laugh at them, and\r\n      that I should be rather mobbed by them than be able to undeceive\r\n      them. So I left them; and this appearance passed for as real as\r\n      the blazing star itself.\r\n\r\n      Another encounter I had in the open day also; and this was in\r\n      going through a narrow passage from Petty France into Bishopsgate\r\n      Churchyard, by a row of alms-houses. There are two churchyards to\r\n      Bishopsgate church or parish; one we go over to pass from the\r\n      place called Petty France into Bishopsgate Street, coming out\r\n      just by the church door; the other is on the side of the narrow\r\n      passage where the alms-houses are on the left; and a dwarf-wall\r\n      with a palisado on it on the right hand, and the city wall on the\r\n      other side more to the right.\r\n\r\n      In this narrow passage stands a man looking through between the\r\n      palisadoes into the burying-place, and as many people as the\r\n      narrowness of the passage would admit to stop, without hindering\r\n      the passage of others, and he was talking mightily eagerly to\r\n      them, and pointing now to one place, then to another, and\r\n      affirming that he saw a ghost walking upon such a gravestone\r\n      there. He described the shape, the posture, and the movement of\r\n      it so exactly that it was the greatest matter of amazement to him\r\n      in the world that everybody did not see it as well as he. On a\r\n      sudden he would cry, \xe2\x80\x98There it is; now it comes this way.\xe2\x80\x99 Then,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x99Tis turned back\xe2\x80\x99; till at length he persuaded the people into so\r\n      firm a belief of it, that one fancied he saw it, and another\r\n      fancied he saw it; and thus he came every day making a strange\r\n      hubbub, considering it was in so narrow a passage, till\r\n      Bishopsgate clock struck eleven, and then the ghost would seem to\r\n      start, and, as if he were called away, disappeared on a sudden.\r\n\r\n      I looked earnestly every way, and at the very moment that this\r\n      man directed, but could not see the least appearance of anything;\r\n      but so positive was this poor man, that he gave the people the\r\n      vapours in abundance, and sent them away trembling and frighted,\r\n      till at length few people that knew of it cared to go through\r\n      that passage, and hardly anybody by night on any account\r\n      whatever.\r\n\r\n      This ghost, as the poor man affirmed, made signs to the houses,\r\n      and to the ground, and to the people, plainly intimating, or else\r\n      they so understanding it, that abundance of the people should\r\n      come to be buried in that churchyard, as indeed happened; but\r\n      that he saw such aspects I must acknowledge I never believed, nor\r\n      could I see anything of it myself, though I looked most earnestly\r\n      to see it, if possible.\r\n\r\n      These things serve to show how far the people were really\r\n      overcome with delusions; and as they had a notion of the approach\r\n      of a visitation, all their predictions ran upon a most dreadful\r\n      plague, which should lay the whole city, and even the kingdom,\r\n      waste, and should destroy almost all the nation, both man and\r\n      beast.\r\n\r\n      To this, as I said before, the astrologers added stories of the\r\n      conjunctions of planets in a malignant manner and with a\r\n      mischievous influence, one of which conjunctions was to happen,\r\n      and did happen, in October, and the other in November; and they\r\n      filled the people\xe2\x80\x99s heads with predictions on these signs of the\r\n      heavens, intimating that those conjunctions foretold drought,\r\n      famine, and pestilence. In the two first of them, however, they\r\n      were entirely mistaken, for we had no droughty season, but in the\r\n      beginning of the year a hard frost, which lasted from December\r\n      almost to March, and after that moderate weather, rather warm\r\n      than hot, with refreshing winds, and, in short, very seasonable\r\n      weather, and also several very great rains.\r\n\r\n      Some endeavours were used to suppress the printing of such books\r\n      as terrified the people, and to frighten the dispersers of them,\r\n      some of whom were taken up; but nothing was done in it, as I am\r\n      informed, the Government being unwilling to exasperate the\r\n      people, who were, as I may say, all out of their wits already.\r\n\r\n      Neither can I acquit those ministers that in their sermons rather\r\n      sank than lifted up the hearts of their hearers. Many of them no\r\n      doubt did it for the strengthening the resolution of the people,\r\n      and especially for quickening them to repentance, but it\r\n      certainly answered not their end, at least not in proportion to\r\n      the injury it did another way; and indeed, as God Himself through\r\n      the whole Scriptures rather draws to Him by invitations and calls\r\n      to turn to Him and live, than drives us by terror and amazement,\r\n      so I must confess I thought the ministers should have done also,\r\n      imitating our blessed Lord and Master in this, that His whole\r\n      Gospel is full of declarations from heaven of God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy, and\r\n      His readiness to receive penitents and forgive them, complaining,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Ye will not come unto Me that ye may have life\xe2\x80\x99, and that\r\n      therefore His Gospel is called the Gospel of Peace and the Gospel\r\n      of Grace.\r\n\r\n      But we had some good men, and that of all persuasions and\r\n      opinions, whose discourses were full of terror, who spoke nothing\r\n      but dismal things; and as they brought the people together with a\r\n      kind of horror, sent them away in tears, prophesying nothing but\r\n      evil tidings, terrifying the people with the apprehensions of\r\n      being utterly destroyed, not guiding them, at least not enough,\r\n      to cry to heaven for mercy.\r\n\r\n      It was, indeed, a time of very unhappy breaches among us in\r\n      matters of religion. Innumerable sects and divisions and separate\r\n      opinions prevailed among the people. The Church of England was\r\n      restored, indeed, with the restoration of the monarchy, about\r\n      four years before; but the ministers and preachers of the\r\n      Presbyterians and Independents, and of all the other sorts of\r\n      professions, had begun to gather separate societies and erect\r\n      altar against altar, and all those had their meetings for worship\r\n      apart, as they have now, but not so many then, the Dissenters\r\n      being not thoroughly formed into a body as they are since; and\r\n      those congregations which were thus gathered together were yet\r\n      but few. And even those that were, the Government did not allow,\r\n      but endeavoured to suppress them and shut up their meetings.\r\n\r\n      But the visitation reconciled them again, at least for a time,\r\n      and many of the best and most valuable ministers and preachers of\r\n      the Dissenters were suffered to go into the churches where the\r\n      incumbents were fled away, as many were, not being able to stand\r\n      it; and the people flocked without distinction to hear them\r\n      preach, not much inquiring who or what opinion they were of. But\r\n      after the sickness was over, that spirit of charity abated; and\r\n      every church being again supplied with their own ministers, or\r\n      others presented where the minister was dead, things returned to\r\n      their old channel again.\r\n\r\n      One mischief always introduces another. These terrors and\r\n      apprehensions of the people led them into a thousand weak,\r\n      foolish, and wicked things, which they wanted not a sort of\r\n      people really wicked to encourage them to: and this was running\r\n      about to fortune-tellers, cunning-men, and astrologers to know\r\n      their fortune, or, as it is vulgarly expressed, to have their\r\n      fortunes told them, their nativities calculated, and the like;\r\n      and this folly presently made the town swarm with a wicked\r\n      generation of pretenders to magic, to the black art, as they\r\n      called it, and I know not what; nay, to a thousand worse dealings\r\n      with the devil than they were really guilty of. And this trade\r\n      grew so open and so generally practised that it became common to\r\n      have signs and inscriptions set up at doors: \xe2\x80\x98Here lives a\r\n      fortune-teller\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Here lives an astrologer\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Here you may have\r\n      your nativity calculated\xe2\x80\x99, and the like; and Friar Bacon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      brazen-head, which was the usual sign of these people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      dwellings, was to be seen almost in every street, or else the\r\n      sign of Mother Shipton, or of Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s head, and the like.\r\n\r\n      With what blind, absurd, and ridiculous stuff these oracles of\r\n      the devil pleased and satisfied the people I really know not, but\r\n      certain it is that innumerable attendants crowded about their\r\n      doors every day. And if but a grave fellow in a velvet jacket, a\r\n      band, and a black coat, which was the habit those quack-conjurers\r\n      generally went in, was but seen in the streets the people would\r\n      follow them in crowds, and ask them questions as they went along.\r\n\r\n      I need not mention what a horrid delusion this was, or what it\r\n      tended to; but there was no remedy for it till the plague itself\r\n      put an end to it all\xe2\x80\x94and, I suppose, cleared the town of most of\r\n      those calculators themselves. One mischief was, that if the poor\r\n      people asked these mock astrologers whether there would be a\r\n      plague or no, they all agreed in general to answer \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99, for\r\n      that kept up their trade. And had the people not been kept in a\r\n      fright about that, the wizards would presently have been rendered\r\n      useless, and their craft had been at an end. But they always\r\n      talked to them of such-and-such influences of the stars, of the\r\n      conjunctions of such-and-such planets, which must necessarily\r\n      bring sickness and distempers, and consequently the plague. And\r\n      some had the assurance to tell them the plague was begun already,\r\n      which was too true, though they that said so knew nothing of the\r\n      matter.\r\n\r\n      The ministers, to do them justice, and preachers of most sorts\r\n      that were serious and understanding persons, thundered against\r\n      these and other wicked practices, and exposed the folly as well\r\n      as the wickedness of them together, and the most sober and\r\n      judicious people despised and abhorred them. But it was\r\n      impossible to make any impression upon the middling people and\r\n      the working labouring poor. Their fears were predominant over all\r\n      their passions, and they threw away their money in a most\r\n      distracted manner upon those whimsies. Maid-servants especially,\r\n      and men-servants, were the chief of their customers, and their\r\n      question generally was, after the first demand of \xe2\x80\x98Will there be\r\n      a plague?\xe2\x80\x99 I say, the next question was, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir I for the\r\n      Lord\xe2\x80\x99s sake, what will become of me? Will my mistress keep me, or\r\n      will she turn me off? Will she stay here, or will she go into the\r\n      country? And if she goes into the country, will she take me with\r\n      her, or leave me here to be starved and undone?\xe2\x80\x99 And the like of\r\n      menservants.\r\n\r\n      The truth is, the case of poor servants was very dismal, as I\r\n      shall have occasion to mention again by-and-by, for it was\r\n      apparent a prodigious number of them would be turned away, and it\r\n      was so. And of them abundance perished, and particularly of those\r\n      that these false prophets had flattered with hopes that they\r\n      should be continued in their services, and carried with their\r\n      masters and mistresses into the country; and had not public\r\n      charity provided for these poor creatures, whose number was\r\n      exceeding great and in all cases of this nature must be so, they\r\n      would have been in the worst condition of any people in the city.\r\n\r\n      These things agitated the minds of the common people for many\r\n      months, while the first apprehensions were upon them, and while\r\n      the plague was not, as I may say, yet broken out. But I must also\r\n      not forget that the more serious part of the inhabitants behaved\r\n      after another manner. The Government encouraged their devotion,\r\n      and appointed public prayers and days of fasting and humiliation,\r\n      to make public confession of sin and implore the mercy of God to\r\n      avert the dreadful judgement which hung over their heads; and it\r\n      is not to be expressed with what alacrity the people of all\r\n      persuasions embraced the occasion; how they flocked to the\r\n      churches and meetings, and they were all so thronged that there\r\n      was often no coming near, no, not to the very doors of the\r\n      largest churches. Also there were daily prayers appointed morning\r\n      and evening at several churches, and days of private praying at\r\n      other places; at all which the people attended, I say, with an\r\n      uncommon devotion. Several private families also, as well of one\r\n      opinion as of another, kept family fasts, to which they admitted\r\n      their near relations only. So that, in a word, those people who\r\n      were really serious and religious applied themselves in a truly\r\n      Christian manner to the proper work of repentance and\r\n      humiliation, as a Christian people ought to do.\r\n\r\n      Again, the public showed that they would bear their share in\r\n      these things; the very Court, which was then gay and luxurious,\r\n      put on a face of just concern for the public danger. All the\r\n      plays and interludes which, after the manner of the French Court,\r\n      had been set up, and began to increase among us, were forbid to\r\n      act; the gaming-tables, public dancing-rooms, and music-houses,\r\n      which multiplied and began to debauch the manners of the people,\r\n      were shut up and suppressed; and the jack-puddings,\r\n      merry-andrews, puppet-shows, rope-dancers, and such-like doings,\r\n      which had bewitched the poor common people, shut up their shops,\r\n      finding indeed no trade; for the minds of the people were\r\n      agitated with other things, and a kind of sadness and horror at\r\n      these things sat upon the countenances even of the common people.\r\n      Death was before their eyes, and everybody began to think of\r\n      their graves, not of mirth and diversions.\r\n\r\n      But even those wholesome reflections\xe2\x80\x94which, rightly managed,\r\n      would have most happily led the people to fall upon their knees,\r\n      make confession of their sins, and look up to their merciful\r\n      Saviour for pardon, imploring His compassion on them in such a\r\n      time of their distress, by which we might have been as a second\r\n      Nineveh\xe2\x80\x94had a quite contrary extreme in the common people, who,\r\n      ignorant and stupid in their reflections as they were brutishly\r\n      wicked and thoughtless before, were now led by their fright to\r\n      extremes of folly; and, as I have said before, that they ran to\r\n      conjurers and witches, and all sorts of deceivers, to know what\r\n      should become of them (who fed their fears, and kept them always\r\n      alarmed and awake on purpose to delude them and pick their\r\n      pockets), so they were as mad upon their running after quacks and\r\n      mountebanks, and every practising old woman, for medicines and\r\n      remedies; storing themselves with such multitudes of pills,\r\n      potions, and preservatives, as they were called, that they not\r\n      only spent their money but even poisoned themselves beforehand\r\n      for fear of the poison of the infection; and prepared their\r\n      bodies for the plague, instead of preserving them against it. On\r\n      the other hand it is incredible and scarce to be imagined, how\r\n      the posts of houses and corners of streets were plastered over\r\n      with doctors\xe2\x80\x99 bills and papers of ignorant fellows, quacking and\r\n      tampering in physic, and inviting the people to come to them for\r\n      remedies, which was generally set off with such flourishes as\r\n      these, viz.: \xe2\x80\x98Infallible preventive pills against the plague.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Neverfailing preservatives against the infection.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Sovereign\r\n      cordials against the corruption of the air.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Exact regulations\r\n      for the conduct of the body in case of an infection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Anti-pestilential pills.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Incomparable drink against the\r\n      plague, never found out before.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98An universal remedy for the\r\n      plague.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The only true plague water.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The royal antidote\r\n      against all kinds of infection\xe2\x80\x99;\xe2\x80\x94and such a number more that I\r\n      cannot reckon up; and if I could, would fill a book of themselves\r\n      to set them down.\r\n\r\n      Others set up bills to summon people to their lodgings for\r\n      directions and advice in the case of infection. These had\r\n      specious titles also, such as these:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98An eminent High Dutch physician, newly come over from Holland,\r\n      where he resided during all the time of the great plague last\r\n      year in Amsterdam, and cured multitudes of people that actually\r\n      had the plague upon them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98An Italian gentlewoman just arrived from Naples, having a choice\r\n      secret to prevent infection, which she found out by her great\r\n      experience, and did wonderful cures with it in the late plague\r\n      there, wherein there died 20,000 in one day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98An ancient gentlewoman, having practised with great success in\r\n      the late plague in this city, anno 1636, gives her advice only to\r\n      the female sex. To be spoken with,\xe2\x80\x99 &c.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98An experienced physician, who has long studied the doctrine of\r\n      antidotes against all sorts of poison and infection, has, after\r\n      forty years\xe2\x80\x99 practice, arrived to such skill as may, with God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      blessing, direct persons how to prevent their being touched by\r\n      any contagious distemper whatsoever. He directs the poor gratis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      I take notice of these by way of specimen. I could give you two\r\n      or three dozen of the like and yet have abundance left behind.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x99Tis sufficient from these to apprise any one of the humour of\r\n      those times, and how a set of thieves and pickpockets not only\r\n      robbed and cheated the poor people of their money, but poisoned\r\n      their bodies with odious and fatal preparations; some with\r\n      mercury, and some with other things as bad, perfectly remote from\r\n      the thing pretended to, and rather hurtful than serviceable to\r\n      the body in case an infection followed.\r\n\r\n      I cannot omit a subtility of one of those quack operators, with\r\n      which he gulled the poor people to crowd about him, but did\r\n      nothing for them without money. He had, it seems, added to his\r\n      bills, which he gave about the streets, this advertisement in\r\n      capital letters, viz., \xe2\x80\x98He gives advice to the poor for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      Abundance of poor people came to him accordingly, to whom he made\r\n      a great many fine speeches, examined them of the state of their\r\n      health and of the constitution of their bodies, and told them\r\n      many good things for them to do, which were of no great moment.\r\n      But the issue and conclusion of all was, that he had a\r\n      preparation which if they took such a quantity of every morning,\r\n      he would pawn his life they should never have the plague; no,\r\n      though they lived in the house with people that were infected.\r\n      This made the people all resolve to have it; but then the price\r\n      of that was so much, I think \xe2\x80\x99twas half-a-crown. \xe2\x80\x98But, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\n      one poor woman, \xe2\x80\x98I am a poor almswoman and am kept by the parish,\r\n      and your bills say you give the poor your help for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ay,\r\n      good woman,\xe2\x80\x99 says the doctor, \xe2\x80\x98so I do, as I published there. I\r\n      give my advice to the poor for nothing, but not my physic.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Alas, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98that is a snare laid for the poor, then;\r\n      for you give them advice for nothing; that is to say, you advise\r\n      them gratis, to buy your physic for their money; so does every\r\n      shop-keeper with his wares.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the woman began to give him ill\r\n      words, and stood at his door all that day, telling her tale to\r\n      all the people that came, till the doctor finding she turned away\r\n      his customers, was obliged to call her upstairs again, and give\r\n      her his box of physic for nothing, which perhaps, too, was good\r\n      for nothing when she had it.\r\n\r\n      But to return to the people, whose confusions fitted them to be\r\n      imposed upon by all sorts of pretenders and by every mountebank.\r\n      There is no doubt but these quacking sort of fellows raised great\r\n      gains out of the miserable people, for we daily found the crowds\r\n      that ran after them were infinitely greater, and their doors were\r\n      more thronged than those of Dr Brooks, Dr Upton, Dr Hodges, Dr\r\n      Berwick, or any, though the most famous men of the time. And I\r\n      was told that some of them got five pounds a day by their physic.\r\n\r\n      But there was still another madness beyond all this, which may\r\n      serve to give an idea of the distracted humour of the poor people\r\n      at that time: and this was their following a worse sort of\r\n      deceivers than any of these; for these petty thieves only deluded\r\n      them to pick their pockets and get their money, in which their\r\n      wickedness, whatever it was, lay chiefly on the side of the\r\n      deceivers, not upon the deceived. But in this part I am going to\r\n      mention, it lay chiefly in the people deceived, or equally in\r\n      both; and this was in wearing charms, philtres, exorcisms,\r\n      amulets, and I know not what preparations, to fortify the body\r\n      with them against the plague; as if the plague was not the hand\r\n      of God, but a kind of possession of an evil spirit, and that it\r\n      was to be kept off with crossings, signs of the zodiac, papers\r\n      tied up with so many knots, and certain words or figures written\r\n      on them, as particularly the word Abracadabra, formed in triangle\r\n      or pyramid, thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     ABRACADABRA\r\n     ABRACADABR     Others had the Jesuits\xe2\x80\x99\r\n     ABRACADAB         mark in a cross:\r\n     ABRACADA             I H\r\n     ABRACAD               S.\r\n     ABRACA\r\n     ABRAC          Others nothing but this\r\n     ABRA               mark, thus:\r\n     ABR\r\n     AB                   * *\r\n     A                    {*}\r\n\r\n      I might spend a great deal of time in my exclamations against the\r\n      follies, and indeed the wickedness, of those things, in a time of\r\n      such danger, in a matter of such consequences as this, of a\r\n      national infection. But my memorandums of these things relate\r\n      rather to take notice only of the fact, and mention only that it\r\n      was so. How the poor people found the insufficiency of those\r\n      things, and how many of them were afterwards carried away in the\r\n      dead-carts and thrown into the common graves of every parish with\r\n      these hellish charms and trumpery hanging about their necks,\r\n      remains to be spoken of as we go along.\r\n\r\n      All this was the effect of the hurry the people were in, after\r\n      the first notion of the plague being at hand was among them, and\r\n      which may be said to be from about Michaelmas 1664, but more\r\n      particularly after the two men died in St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\n      beginning of December; and again, after another alarm in\r\n      February. For when the plague evidently spread itself, they soon\r\n      began to see the folly of trusting to those unperforming\r\n      creatures who had gulled them of their money; and then their\r\n      fears worked another way, namely, to amazement and stupidity, not\r\n      knowing what course to take or what to do either to help or\r\n      relieve themselves. But they ran about from one neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\n      to another, and even in the streets from one door to another,\r\n      with repeated cries of, \xe2\x80\x98Lord, have mercy upon us! What shall we\r\n      do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      Indeed, the poor people were to be pitied in one particular thing\r\n      in which they had little or no relief, and which I desire to\r\n      mention with a serious awe and reflection, which perhaps every\r\n      one that reads this may not relish; namely, that whereas death\r\n      now began not, as we may say, to hover over every one\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\n      only, but to look into their houses and chambers and stare in\r\n      their faces. Though there might be some stupidity and dulness of\r\n      the mind (and there was so, a great deal), yet there was a great\r\n      deal of just alarm sounded into the very inmost soul, if I may so\r\n      say, of others. Many consciences were awakened; many hard hearts\r\n      melted into tears; many a penitent confession was made of crimes\r\n      long concealed. It would wound the soul of any Christian to have\r\n      heard the dying groans of many a despairing creature, and none\r\n      durst come near to comfort them. Many a robbery, many a murder,\r\n      was then confessed aloud, and nobody surviving to record the\r\n      accounts of it. People might be heard, even into the streets as\r\n      we passed along, calling upon God for mercy through Jesus Christ,\r\n      and saying, \xe2\x80\x98I have been a thief, \xe2\x80\x98I have been an adulterer\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\n      have been a murderer\xe2\x80\x99, and the like, and none durst stop to make\r\n      the least inquiry into such things or to administer comfort to\r\n      the poor creatures that in the anguish both of soul and body thus\r\n      cried out. Some of the ministers did visit the sick at first and\r\n      for a little while, but it was not to be done. It would have been\r\n      present death to have gone into some houses. The very buriers of\r\n      the dead, who were the hardenedest creatures in town, were\r\n      sometimes beaten back and so terrified that they durst not go\r\n      into houses where the whole families were swept away together,\r\n      and where the circumstances were more particularly horrible, as\r\n      some were; but this was, indeed, at the first heat of the\r\n      distemper.\r\n\r\n      Time inured them to it all, and they ventured everywhere\r\n      afterwards without hesitation, as I shall have occasion to\r\n      mention at large hereafter.\r\n\r\n      I am supposing now the plague to be begun, as I have said, and\r\n      that the magistrates began to take the condition of the people\r\n      into their serious consideration. What they did as to the\r\n      regulation of the inhabitants and of infected families, I shall\r\n      speak to by itself; but as to the affair of health, it is proper\r\n      to mention it here that, having seen the foolish humour of the\r\n      people in running after quacks and mountebanks, wizards and\r\n      fortune-tellers, which they did as above, even to madness, the\r\n      Lord Mayor, a very sober and religious gentleman, appointed\r\n      physicians and surgeons for relief of the poor\xe2\x80\x94I mean the\r\n      diseased poor and in particular ordered the College of Physicians\r\n      to publish directions for cheap remedies for the poor, in all the\r\n      circumstances of the distemper. This, indeed, was one of the most\r\n      charitable and judicious things that could be done at that time,\r\n      for this drove the people from haunting the doors of every\r\n      disperser of bills, and from taking down blindly and without\r\n      consideration poison for physic and death instead of life.\r\n\r\n      This direction of the physicians was done by a consultation of\r\n      the whole College; and, as it was particularly calculated for the\r\n      use of the poor and for cheap medicines, it was made public, so\r\n      that everybody might see it, and copies were given gratis to all\r\n      that desired it. But as it is public, and to be seen on all\r\n      occasions, I need not give the reader of this the trouble of it.\r\n\r\n      I shall not be supposed to lessen the authority or capacity of\r\n      the physicians when I say that the violence of the distemper,\r\n      when it came to its extremity, was like the fire the next year.\r\n      The fire, which consumed what the plague could not touch, defied\r\n      all the application of remedies; the fire-engines were broken,\r\n      the buckets thrown away, and the power of man was baffled and\r\n      brought to an end. So the Plague defied all medicines; the very\r\n      physicians were seized with it, with their preservatives in their\r\n      mouths; and men went about prescribing to others and telling them\r\n      what to do till the tokens were upon them, and they dropped down\r\n      dead, destroyed by that very enemy they directed others to\r\n      oppose. This was the case of several physicians, even some of\r\n      them the most eminent, and of several of the most skilful\r\n      surgeons. Abundance of quacks too died, who had the folly to\r\n      trust to their own medicines, which they must needs be conscious\r\n      to themselves were good for nothing, and who rather ought, like\r\n      other sorts of thieves, to have run away, sensible of their\r\n      guilt, from the justice that they could not but expect should\r\n      punish them as they knew they had deserved.\r\n\r\n      Not that it is any derogation from the labour or application of\r\n      the physicians to say they fell in the common calamity; nor is it\r\n      so intended by me; it rather is to their praise that they\r\n      ventured their lives so far as even to lose them in the service\r\n      of mankind. They endeavoured to do good, and to save the lives of\r\n      others. But we were not to expect that the physicians could stop\r\n      God\xe2\x80\x99s judgements, or prevent a distemper eminently armed from\r\n      heaven from executing the errand it was sent about.\r\n\r\n      Doubtless, the physicians assisted many by their skill, and by\r\n      their prudence and applications, to the saving of their lives and\r\n      restoring their health. But it is not lessening their character\r\n      or their skill, to say they could not cure those that had the\r\n      tokens upon them, or those who were mortally infected before the\r\n      physicians were sent for, as was frequently the case.\r\n\r\n      It remains to mention now what public measures were taken by the\r\n      magistrates for the general safety, and to prevent the spreading\r\n      of the distemper, when it first broke out. I shall have frequent\r\n      occasion to speak of the prudence of the magistrates, their\r\n      charity, their vigilance for the poor, and for preserving good\r\n      order, furnishing provisions, and the like, when the plague was\r\n      increased, as it afterwards was. But I am now upon the order and\r\n      regulations they published for the government of infected\r\n      families.\r\n\r\n      I mentioned above shutting of houses up; and it is needful to say\r\n      something particularly to that, for this part of the history of\r\n      the plague is very melancholy, but the most grievous story must\r\n      be told.\r\n\r\n      About June the Lord Mayor of London and the Court of Aldermen, as\r\n      I have said, began more particularly to concern themselves for\r\n      the regulation of the city.\r\n\r\n      The justices of Peace for Middlesex, by direction of the\r\n      Secretary of State, had begun to shut up houses in the parishes\r\n      of St Giles-in-the-Fields, St Martin, St Clement Danes, &c., and\r\n      it was with good success; for in several streets where the plague\r\n      broke out, upon strict guarding the houses that were infected,\r\n      and taking care to bury those that died immediately after they\r\n      were known to be dead, the plague ceased in those streets. It was\r\n      also observed that the plague decreased sooner in those parishes\r\n      after they had been visited to the full than it did in the\r\n      parishes of Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Aldgate, Whitechappel,\r\n      Stepney, and others; the early care taken in that manner being a\r\n      great means to the putting a check to it.\r\n\r\n      This shutting up of houses was a method first taken, as I\r\n      understand, in the plague which happened in 1603, at the coming\r\n      of King James the First to the crown; and the power of shutting\r\n      people up in their own houses was granted by Act of Parliament,\r\n      entitled, \xe2\x80\x98An Act for the charitable Relief and Ordering of\r\n      Persons infected with the Plague\xe2\x80\x99; on which Act of Parliament the\r\n      Lord Mayor and aldermen of the city of London founded the order\r\n      they made at this time, and which took place the 1st of July\r\n      1665, when the numbers infected within the city were but few, the\r\n      last bill for the ninety-two parishes being but four; and some\r\n      houses having been shut up in the city, and some people being\r\n      removed to the pest-house beyond Bunhill Fields, in the way to\r\n      Islington,\xe2\x80\x94I say, by these means, when there died near one\r\n      thousand a week in the whole, the number in the city was but\r\n      twenty-eight, and the city was preserved more healthy in\r\n      proportion than any other place all the time of the infection.\r\n\r\n      These orders of my Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s were published, as I have said,\r\n      the latter end of June, and took place from the 1st of July, and\r\n      were as follows, viz.:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      ORDERS CONCEIVED AND PUBLISHED BY THE LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF\r\n      THE CITY OF LONDON CONCERNING THE INFECTION OF THE PLAGUE, 1665.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98WHEREAS in the reign of our late Sovereign King James, of happy\r\n      memory, an Act was made for the charitable relief and ordering of\r\n      persons infected with the plague, whereby authority was given to\r\n      justices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and other head-officers\r\n      to appoint within their several limits examiners, searchers,\r\n      watchmen, keepers, and buriers for the persons and places\r\n      infected, and to minister unto them oaths for the performance of\r\n      their offices. And the same statute did also authorise the giving\r\n      of other directions, as unto them for the present necessity\r\n      should seem good in their directions. It is now, upon special\r\n      consideration, thought very expedient for preventing and avoiding\r\n      of infection of sickness (if it shall so please Almighty God)\r\n      that these officers following be appointed, and these orders\r\n      hereafter duly observed.\r\n\r\n      Examiners to be appointed in every Parish.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98First, it is thought requisite, and so ordered, that in every\r\n      parish there be one, two, or more persons of good sort and credit\r\n      chosen and appointed by the alderman, his deputy, and common\r\n      council of every ward, by the name of examiners, to continue in\r\n      that office the space of two months at least. And if any fit\r\n      person so appointed shall refuse to undertake the same, the said\r\n      parties so refusing to be committed to prison until they shall\r\n      conform themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\n      The Examiner\xe2\x80\x99s Office.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to inquire and\r\n      learn from time to time what houses in every parish be visited,\r\n      and what persons be sick, and of what diseases, as near as they\r\n      can inform themselves; and upon doubt in that case, to command\r\n      restraint of access until it appear what the disease shall prove.\r\n      And if they find any person sick of the infection, to give order\r\n      to the constable that the house be shut up; and if the constable\r\n      shall be found remiss or negligent, to give present notice\r\n      thereof to the alderman of the ward.\r\n\r\n      Watchmen.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That to every infected house there be appointed two watchmen,\r\n      one for every day, and the other for the night; and that these\r\n      watchmen have a special care that no person go in or out of such\r\n      infected houses whereof they have the charge, upon pain of severe\r\n      punishment. And the said watchmen to do such further offices as\r\n      the sick house shall need and require: and if the watchman be\r\n      sent upon any business, to lock up the house and take the key\r\n      with him; and the watchman by day to attend until ten of the\r\n      clock at night, and the watchman by night until six in the\r\n      morning.\r\n\r\n      Searchers.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That there be a special care to appoint women searchers in every\r\n      parish, such as are of honest reputation, and of the best sort as\r\n      can be got in this kind; and these to be sworn to make due search\r\n      and true report to the utmost of their knowledge whether the\r\n      persons whose bodies they are appointed to search do die of the\r\n      infection, or of what other diseases, as near as they can. And\r\n      that the physicians who shall be appointed for cure and\r\n      prevention of the infection do call before them the said\r\n      searchers who are, or shall be, appointed for the several\r\n      parishes under their respective cares, to the end they may\r\n      consider whether they are fitly qualified for that employment,\r\n      and charge them from time to time as they shall see cause, if\r\n      they appear defective in their duties.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That no searcher during this time of visitation be permitted to\r\n      use any public work or employment, or keep any shop or stall, or\r\n      be employed as a laundress, or in any other common employment\r\n      whatsoever.\r\n\r\n      Chirurgeons.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98For better assistance of the searchers, forasmuch as there hath\r\n      been heretofore great abuse in misreporting the disease, to the\r\n      further spreading of the infection, it is therefore ordered that\r\n      there be chosen and appointed able and discreet chirurgeons,\r\n      besides those that do already belong to the pest-house, amongst\r\n      whom the city and Liberties to be quartered as the places lie\r\n      most apt and convenient; and every of these to have one quarter\r\n      for his limit; and the said chirurgeons in every of their limits\r\n      to join with the searchers for the view of the body, to the end\r\n      there may be a true report made of the disease.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98And further, that the said chirurgeons shall visit and search\r\n      such-like persons as shall either send for them or be named and\r\n      directed unto them by the examiners of every parish, and inform\r\n      themselves of the disease of the said parties.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98And forasmuch as the said chirurgeons are to be sequestered from\r\n      all other cures, and kept only to this disease of the infection,\r\n      it is ordered that every of the said chirurgeons shall have\r\n      twelve-pence a body searched by them, to be paid out of the goods\r\n      of the party searched, if he be able, or otherwise by the parish.\r\n\r\n      Nurse-keepers.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98If any nurse-keeper shall remove herself out of any infected\r\n      house before twenty-eight days after the decease of any person\r\n      dying of the infection, the house to which the said nurse-keeper\r\n      doth so remove herself shall be shut up until the said\r\n      twenty-eight days be expired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      ORDERS CONCERNING INFECTED HOUSES AND PERSONS SICK OF THE PLAGUE.\r\n\r\n      Notice to be given of the Sickness.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98The master of every house, as soon as any one in his house\r\n      complaineth, either of blotch or purple, or swelling in any part\r\n      of his body, or falleth otherwise dangerously sick, without\r\n      apparent cause of some other disease, shall give knowledge\r\n      thereof to the examiner of health within two hours after the said\r\n      sign shall appear.\r\n\r\n      Sequestration of the Sick.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98As soon as any man shall be found by this examiner, chirurgeon,\r\n      or searcher to be sick of the plague, he shall the same night be\r\n      sequestered in the same house; and in case he be so sequestered,\r\n      then though he afterwards die not, the house wherein he sickened\r\n      should be shut up for a month, after the use of the due\r\n      preservatives taken by the rest.\r\n\r\n      Airing the Stuff.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98For sequestration of the goods and stuff of the infection, their\r\n      bedding and apparel and hangings of chambers must be well aired\r\n      with fire and such perfumes as are requisite within the infected\r\n      house before they be taken again to use. This to be done by the\r\n      appointment of an examiner.\r\n\r\n      Shutting up of the House.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98If any person shall have visited any man known to be infected of\r\n      the plague, or entered willingly into any known infected house,\r\n      being not allowed, the house wherein he inhabiteth shall be shut\r\n      up for certain days by the examiner\xe2\x80\x99s direction.\r\n\r\n      None to be removed out of infected Houses, but, &C.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Item, that none be removed out of the house where he falleth\r\n      sick of the infection into any other house in the city (except it\r\n      be to the pest-house or a tent, or unto some such house which the\r\n      owner of the said visited house holdeth in his own hands and\r\n      occupieth by his own servants); and so as security be given to\r\n      the parish whither such remove is made, that the attendance and\r\n      charge about the said visited persons shall be observed and\r\n      charged in all the particularities before expressed, without any\r\n      cost of that parish to which any such remove shall happen to be\r\n      made, and this remove to be done by night. And it shall be lawful\r\n      to any person that hath two houses to remove either his sound or\r\n      his infected people to his spare house at his choice, so as, if\r\n      he send away first his sound, he not after send thither his sick,\r\n      nor again unto the sick the sound; and that the same which he\r\n      sendeth be for one week at the least shut up and secluded from\r\n      company, for fear of some infection at the first not appearing.\r\n\r\n      Burial of the Dead.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That the burial of the dead by this visitation be at most\r\n      convenient hours, always either before sun-rising or after\r\n      sun-setting, with the privity of the churchwardens or constable,\r\n      and not otherwise; and that no neighbours nor friends be suffered\r\n      to accompany the corpse to church, or to enter the house visited,\r\n      upon pain of having his house shut up or be imprisoned.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98And that no corpse dying of infection shall be buried, or remain\r\n      in any church in time of common prayer, sermon, or lecture. And\r\n      that no children be suffered at time of burial of any corpse in\r\n      any church, churchyard, or burying-place to come near the corpse,\r\n      coffin, or grave. And that all the graves shall be at least six\r\n      feet deep.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98And further, all public assemblies at other burials are to be\r\n      foreborne during the continuance of this visitation.\r\n\r\n      No infected Stuff to be uttered.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That no clothes, stuff, bedding, or garments be suffered to be\r\n      carried or conveyed out of any infected houses, and that the\r\n      criers and carriers abroad of bedding or old apparel to be sold\r\n      or pawned be utterly prohibited and restrained, and no brokers of\r\n      bedding or old apparel be permitted to make any outward show, or\r\n      hang forth on their stalls, shop-boards, or windows, towards any\r\n      street, lane, common way, or passage, any old bedding or apparel\r\n      to be sold, upon pain of imprisonment. And if any broker or other\r\n      person shall buy any bedding, apparel, or other stuff out of any\r\n      infected house within two months after the infection hath been\r\n      there, his house shall be shut up as infected, and so shall\r\n      continue shut up twenty days at the least.\r\n\r\n      No Person to be conveyed out of any infected House.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98If any person visited do fortune, by negligent looking unto, or\r\n      by any other means, to come or be conveyed from a place infected\r\n      to any other place, the parish from whence such party hath come\r\n      or been conveyed, upon notice thereof given, shall at their\r\n      charge cause the said party so visited and escaped to be carried\r\n      and brought back again by night, and the parties in this case\r\n      offending to be punished at the direction of the alderman of the\r\n      ward, and the house of the receiver of such visited person to be\r\n      shut up for twenty days.\r\n\r\n      Every visited House to be marked.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That every house visited be marked with a red cross of a foot\r\n      long in the middle of the door, evident to be seen, and with\r\n      these usual printed words, that is to say, \xe2\x80\x9cLord, have mercy upon\r\n      us,\xe2\x80\x9d to be set close over the same cross, there to continue until\r\n      lawful opening of the same house.\r\n\r\n      Every visited House to be watched.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That the constables see every house shut up, and to be attended\r\n      with watchmen, which may keep them in, and minister necessaries\r\n      unto them at their own charges, if they be able, or at the common\r\n      charge, if they are unable;

but to forbear and abstain from company, especially\r\n      when they have been lately used in any such business or\r\n      attendance.\r\n\r\n      Inmates.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That where several inmates are in one and the same house, and\r\n      any person in that house happens to be infected, no other person\r\n      or family of such house shall be suffered to remove him or\r\n      themselves without a certificate from the examiners of health of\r\n      that parish; or in default thereof, the house whither he or they\r\n      so remove shall be shut up as in case of visitation.\r\n\r\n      Hackney-Coaches.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That care be taken of hackney-coachmen, that they may not (as\r\n      some of them have been observed to do after carrying of infected\r\n      persons to the pest-house and other places) be admitted to common\r\n      use till their coaches be well aired, and have stood unemployed\r\n      by the space of five or six days after such service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      ORDERS FOR CLEANSING AND KEEPING OF THE STREETS SWEPT.\r\n\r\n      The Streets to be kept Clean.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98First, it is thought necessary, and so ordered, that every\r\n      householder do cause the street to be daily prepared before his\r\n      door, and so to keep it clean swept all the week long.\r\n\r\n      That Rakers take it from out the Houses.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That the sweeping and filth of houses be daily carried away by\r\n      the rakers, and that the raker shall give notice of his coming by\r\n      the blowing of a horn, as hitherto hath been done.\r\n\r\n      Laystalls to be made far off from the City.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That the laystalls be removed as far as may be out of the city\r\n      and common passages, and that no nightman or other be suffered to\r\n      empty a vault into any garden near about the city.\r\n\r\n      Care to be had of unwholesome Fish or Flesh, and of musty Corn.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That special care be taken that no stinking fish, or unwholesome\r\n      flesh, or musty corn, or other corrupt fruits of what sort\r\n      soever, be suffered to be sold about the city, or any part of the\r\n      same.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That the brewers and tippling-houses be looked into for musty\r\n      and unwholesome casks.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That no hogs, dogs, or cats, or tame pigeons, or ponies, be\r\n      suffered to be kept within any part of the city, or any swine to\r\n      be or stray in the streets or lanes, but that such swine be\r\n      impounded by the beadle or any other officer, and the owner\r\n      punished according to Act of Common Council, and that the dogs be\r\n      killed by the dog-killers appointed for that purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      ORDERS CONCERNING LOOSE PERSONS AND IDLE ASSEMBLIES.\r\n\r\n      Beggars.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Forasmuch as nothing is more complained of than the multitude of\r\n      rogues and wandering beggars that swarm in every place about the\r\n      city, being a great cause of the spreading of the infection, and\r\n      will not be avoided, notwithstanding any orders that have been\r\n      given to the contrary: It is therefore now ordered, that such\r\n      constables, and others whom this matter may any way concern, take\r\n      special care that no wandering beggars be suffered in the streets\r\n      of this city in any fashion or manner whatsoever, upon the\r\n      penalty provided by the law, to be duly and severely executed\r\n      upon them.\r\n\r\n      Plays.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That all plays, bear-baitings, games, singing of ballads,\r\n      buckler-play, or such-like causes of assemblies of people be\r\n      utterly prohibited, and the parties offending severely punished\r\n      by every alderman in his ward.\r\n\r\n      Feasting prohibited.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That all public feasting, and particularly by the companies of\r\n      this city, and dinners at taverns, ale-houses, and other places\r\n      of common entertainment, be forborne till further order and\r\n      allowance; and that the money thereby spared be preserved and\r\n      employed for the benefit and relief of the poor visited with the\r\n      infection.\r\n\r\n      Tippling-houses.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That disorderly tippling in taverns, ale-houses, coffee-houses,\r\n      and cellars be severely looked unto, as the common sin of this\r\n      time and greatest occasion of dispersing the plague. And that no\r\n      company or person be suffered to remain or come into any tavern,\r\n      ale-house, or coffee-house to drink after nine of the clock in\r\n      the evening, according to the ancient law and custom of this\r\n      city, upon the penalties ordained in that behalf.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98And for the better execution of these orders, and such other\r\n      rules and directions as, upon further consideration, shall be\r\n      found needful: It is ordered and enjoined that the aldermen,\r\n      deputies, and common councilmen shall meet together weekly, once,\r\n      twice, thrice or oftener (as cause shall require), at some one\r\n      general place accustomed in their respective wards (being clear\r\n      from infection of the plague), to consult how the said orders may\r\n      be duly put in execution; not intending that any dwelling in or\r\n      near places infected shall come to the said meeting while their\r\n      coming may be doubtful. And the said aldermen, and deputies, and\r\n      common councilmen in their several wards may put in execution any\r\n      other good orders that by them at their said meetings shall be\r\n      conceived and devised for preservation of his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s subjects\r\n      from the infection.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98SIR JOHN LAWRENCE, Lord Mayor.\r\n      SIR GEORGE WATERMAN\r\n      SIR CHARLES\r\n      DOE, Sheriffs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      I need not say that these orders extended only to such places as\r\n      were within the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, so it is requisite to\r\n      observe that the justices of Peace within those parishes and\r\n      places as were called the Hamlets and out-parts took the same\r\n      method. As I remember, the orders for shutting up of houses did\r\n      not take Place so soon on our side, because, as I said before,\r\n      the plague did not reach to these eastern parts of the town at\r\n      least, nor begin to be very violent, till the beginning of\r\n      August. For example, the whole bill from the 11th to the 18th of\r\n      July was 1761, yet there died but 71 of the plague in all those\r\n      parishes we call the Tower Hamlets, and they were as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n-                           The next week   And to the 1st\r\n     -                             was thus:     of Aug. thus:\r\n     Aldgate               14          34               65\r\n     Stepney               33          58               76\r\n     Whitechappel          21          48               79\r\n     St Katherine, Tower    2           4                4\r\n     Trinity, Minories      1           1                4\r\n     -                    \xe2\x80\x94-         \xe2\x80\x94-              \xe2\x80\x94-\r\n     -                     71         145              228\r\n\r\n      It was indeed coming on amain, for the burials that same week\r\n      were in the next adjoining parishes thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n-                                The next week\r\n     -                                prodigiously    To the 1st of\r\n     -                                increased, as:   Aug. thus:\r\n     St Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s, Shoreditch      64       84          110\r\n     St Botolph\xe2\x80\x99s, Bishopsgate     65      105          116\r\n     St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s, Cripplegate      213      421          554\r\n     -                            \xe2\x80\x94-      \xe2\x80\x94-          \xe2\x80\x94-\r\n     -                            342      610          780\r\n\r\n      This shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and\r\n      unchristian method, and the poor people so confined made bitter\r\n      lamentations. Complaints of the severity of it were also daily\r\n      brought to my Lord Mayor, of houses causelessly (and some\r\n      maliciously) shut up. I cannot say; but upon inquiry many that\r\n      complained so loudly were found in a condition to be continued;\r\n      and others again, inspection being made upon the sick person, and\r\n      the sickness not appearing infectious, or if uncertain, yet on\r\n      his being content to be carried to the pest-house, were released.\r\n\r\n      It is true that the locking up the doors of people\xe2\x80\x99s houses, and\r\n      setting a watchman there night and day to prevent their stirring\r\n      out or any coming to them, when perhaps the sound people in the\r\n      family might have escaped if they had been removed from the sick,\r\n      looked very hard and cruel; and many people perished in these\r\n      miserable confinements which, \xe2\x80\x99tis reasonable to believe, would\r\n      not have been distempered if they had had liberty, though the\r\n      plague was in the house; at which the people were very clamorous\r\n      and uneasy at first, and several violences were committed and\r\n      injuries offered to the men who were set to watch the houses so\r\n      shut up; also several people broke out by force in many places,\r\n      as I shall observe by-and-by. But it was a public good that\r\n      justified the private mischief, and there was no obtaining the\r\n      least mitigation by any application to magistrates or government\r\n      at that time, at least not that I heard of. This put the people\r\n      upon all manner of stratagem in order, if possible, to get out;\r\n      and it would fill a little volume to set down the arts used by\r\n      the people of such houses to shut the eyes of the watchmen who\r\n      were employed, to deceive them, and to escape or break out from\r\n      them, in which frequent scuffles and some mischief happened; of\r\n      which by itself.\r\n\r\n      As I went along Houndsditch one morning about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock there\r\n      was a great noise. It is true, indeed, there was not much crowd,\r\n      because people were not very free to gather together, or to stay\r\n      long together when they were there; nor did I stay long there.\r\n      But the outcry was loud enough to prompt my curiosity, and I\r\n      called to one that looked out of a window, and asked what was the\r\n      matter.\r\n\r\n      A watchman, it seems, had been employed to keep his post at the\r\n      door of a house which was infected, or said to be infected, and\r\n      was shut up. He had been there all night for two nights together,\r\n      as he told his story, and the day-watchman had been there one\r\n      day, and was now come to relieve him. All this while no noise had\r\n      been heard in the house, no light had been seen; they called for\r\n      nothing, sent him of no errands, which used to be the chief\r\n      business of the watchmen; neither had they given him any\r\n      disturbance, as he said, from the Monday afternoon, when he heard\r\n      great crying and screaming in the house, which, as he supposed,\r\n      was occasioned by some of the family dying just at that time. It\r\n      seems, the night before, the dead-cart, as it was called, had\r\n      been stopped there, and a servant-maid had been brought down to\r\n      the door dead, and the buriers or bearers, as they were called,\r\n      put her into the cart, wrapt only in a green rug, and carried her\r\n      away.\r\n\r\n      The watchman had knocked at the door, it seems, when he heard\r\n      that noise and crying, as above, and nobody answered a great\r\n      while; but at last one looked out and said with an angry, quick\r\n      tone, and yet a kind of crying voice, or a voice of one that was\r\n      crying, \xe2\x80\x98What d\xe2\x80\x99ye want, that ye make such a knocking?\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\n      answered, \xe2\x80\x98I am the watchman! How do you do? What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      The person answered, \xe2\x80\x98What is that to you? Stop the dead-cart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      This, it seems, was about one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Soon after, as the fellow\r\n      said, he stopped the dead-cart, and then knocked again, but\r\n      nobody answered. He continued knocking, and the bellman called\r\n      out several times, \xe2\x80\x98Bring out your dead\xe2\x80\x99; but nobody answered,\r\n      till the man that drove the cart, being called to other houses,\r\n      would stay no longer, and drove away.\r\n\r\n      The watchman knew not what to make of all this, so he let them\r\n      alone till the morning-man or day-watchman, as they called him,\r\n      came to relieve him. Giving him an account of the particulars,\r\n      they knocked at the door a great while, but nobody answered; and\r\n      they observed that the window or casement at which the person had\r\n      looked out who had answered before continued open, being up two\r\n      pair of stairs.\r\n\r\n      Upon this the two men, to satisfy their curiosity, got a long\r\n      ladder, and one of them went up to the window and looked into the\r\n      room, where he saw a woman lying dead upon the floor in a dismal\r\n      manner, having no clothes on her but her shift. But though he\r\n      called aloud, and putting in his long staff, knocked hard on the\r\n      floor, yet nobody stirred or answered; neither could he hear any\r\n      noise in the house.\r\n\r\n      He came down again upon this, and acquainted his fellow, who went\r\n      up also; and finding it just so, they resolved to acquaint either\r\n      the Lord Mayor or some other magistrate of it, but did not offer\r\n      to go in at the window. The magistrate, it seems, upon the\r\n      information of the two men, ordered the house to be broke open, a\r\n      constable and other persons being appointed to be present, that\r\n      nothing might be plundered; and accordingly it was so done, when\r\n      nobody was found in the house but that young woman, who having\r\n      been infected and past recovery, the rest had left her to die by\r\n      herself, and were every one gone, having found some way to delude\r\n      the watchman, and to get open the door, or get out at some\r\n      back-door, or over the tops of the houses, so that he knew\r\n      nothing of it; and as to those cries and shrieks which he heard,\r\n      it was supposed they were the passionate cries of the family at\r\n      the bitter parting, which, to be sure, it was to them all, this\r\n      being the sister to the mistress of the family. The man of the\r\n      house, his wife, several children, and servants, being all gone\r\n      and fled, whether sick or sound, that I could never learn; nor,\r\n      indeed, did I make much inquiry after it.\r\n\r\n      Many such escapes were made out of infected houses, as\r\n      particularly when the watchman was sent of some errand; for it\r\n      was his business to go of any errand that the family sent him of;\r\n      that is to say, for necessaries, such as food and physic; to\r\n      fetch physicians, if they would come, or surgeons, or nurses, or\r\n      to order the dead-cart, and the like; but with this condition,\r\n      too, that when he went he was to lock up the outer door of the\r\n      house and take the key away with him, To evade this, and cheat\r\n      the watchmen, people got two or three keys made to their locks,\r\n      or they found ways to unscrew the locks such as were screwed on,\r\n      and so take off the lock, being in the inside of the house, and\r\n      while they sent away the watchman to the market, to the\r\n      bakehouse, or for one trifle or another, open the door and go out\r\n      as often as they pleased. But this being found out, the officers\r\n      afterwards had orders to padlock up the doors on the outside, and\r\n      place bolts on them as they thought fit.\r\n\r\n      At another house, as I was informed, in the street next within\r\n      Aldgate, a whole family was shut up and locked in because the\r\n      maid-servant was taken sick. The master of the house had\r\n      complained by his friends to the next alderman and to the Lord\r\n      Mayor, and had consented to have the maid carried to the\r\n      pest-house, but was refused; so the door was marked with a red\r\n      cross, a padlock on the outside, as above, and a watchman set to\r\n      keep the door, according to public order.\r\n\r\n      After the master of the house found there was no remedy, but that\r\n      he, his wife, and his children were to be locked up with this\r\n      poor distempered servant, he called to the watchman, and told him\r\n      he must go then and fetch a nurse for them to attend this poor\r\n      girl, for that it would be certain death to them all to oblige\r\n      them to nurse her; and told him plainly that if he would not do\r\n      this, the maid must perish either of the distemper or be starved\r\n      for want of food, for he was resolved none of his family should\r\n      go near her; and she lay in the garret four storey high, where\r\n      she could not cry out, or call to anybody for help.\r\n\r\n      The watchman consented to that, and went and fetched a nurse, as\r\n      he was appointed, and brought her to them the same evening.\r\n      During this interval the master of the house took his opportunity\r\n      to break a large hole through his shop into a bulk or stall,\r\n      where formerly a cobbler had sat, before or under his\r\n      shop-window; but the tenant, as may be supposed at such a dismal\r\n      time as that, was dead or removed, and so he had the key in his\r\n      own keeping. Having made his way into this stall, which he could\r\n      not have done if the man had been at the door, the noise he was\r\n      obliged to make being such as would have alarmed the watchman; I\r\n      say, having made his way into this stall, he sat still till the\r\n      watchman returned with the nurse, and all the next day also. But\r\n      the night following, having contrived to send the watchman of\r\n      another trifling errand, which, as I take it, was to an\r\n      apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s for a plaister for the maid, which he was to stay\r\n      for the making up, or some other such errand that might secure\r\n      his staying some time; in that time he conveyed himself and all\r\n      his family out of the house, and left the nurse and the watchman\r\n      to bury the poor wench\xe2\x80\x94that is, throw her into the cart\xe2\x80\x94and take\r\n      care of the house.\r\n\r\n      I could give a great many such stories as these, diverting\r\n      enough, which in the long course of that dismal year I met\r\n      with\xe2\x80\x94that is, heard of\xe2\x80\x94and which are very certain to be true, or\r\n      very near the truth; that is to say, true in the general: for no\r\n      man could at such a time learn all the particulars. There was\r\n      likewise violence used with the watchmen, as was reported, in\r\n      abundance of places; and I believe that from the beginning of the\r\n      visitation to the end, there was not less than eighteen or twenty\r\n      of them killed, or so wounded as to be taken up for dead, which\r\n      was supposed to be done by the people in the infected houses\r\n      which were shut up, and where they attempted to come out and were\r\n      opposed.\r\n\r\n      Nor, indeed, could less be expected, for here were so many\r\n      prisons in the town as there were houses shut up; and as the\r\n      people shut up or imprisoned so were guilty of no crime, only\r\n      shut up because miserable, it was really the more intolerable to\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n      It had also this difference, that every prison, as we may call\r\n      it, had but one jailer, and as he had the whole house to guard,\r\n      and that many houses were so situated as that they had several\r\n      ways out, some more, some less, and some into several streets, it\r\n      was impossible for one man so to guard all the passages as to\r\n      prevent the escape of people made desperate by the fright of\r\n      their circumstances, by the resentment of their usage, or by the\r\n      raging of the distemper itself; so that they would talk to the\r\n      watchman on one side of the house, while the family made their\r\n      escape at another.\r\n\r\n      For example, in Coleman Street there are abundance of alleys, as\r\n      appears still. A house was shut up in that they call White\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      Alley; and this house had a back-window, not a door, into a court\r\n      which had a passage into Bell Alley. A watchman was set by the\r\n      constable at the door of this house, and there he stood, or his\r\n      comrade, night and day, while the family went all away in the\r\n      evening out at that window into the court, and left the poor\r\n      fellows warding and watching for near a fortnight.\r\n\r\n      Not far from the same place they blew up a watchman with\r\n      gunpowder, and burned the poor fellow dreadfully; and while he\r\n      made hideous cries, and nobody would venture to come near to help\r\n      him, the whole family that were able to stir got out at the\r\n      windows one storey high, two that were left sick calling out for\r\n      help. Care was taken to give them nurses to look after them, but\r\n      the persons fled were never found, till after the plague was\r\n      abated they returned; but as nothing could be proved, so nothing\r\n      could be done to them.\r\n\r\n      It is to be considered, too, that as these were prisons without\r\n      bars and bolts, which our common prisons are furnished with, so\r\n      the people let themselves down out of their windows, even in the\r\n      face of the watchman, bringing swords or pistols in their hands,\r\n      and threatening the poor wretch to shoot him if he stirred or\r\n      called for help.\r\n\r\n      In other cases, some had gardens, and walls or pales, between\r\n      them and their neighbours, or yards and back-houses; and these,\r\n      by friendship and entreaties, would get leave to get over those\r\n      walls or pales, and so go out at their neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 doors; or, by\r\n      giving money to their servants, get them to let them through in\r\n      the night; so that in short, the shutting up of houses was in no\r\n      wise to be depended upon. Neither did it answer the end at all,\r\n      serving more to make the people desperate, and drive them to such\r\n      extremities as that they would break out at all adventures.\r\n\r\n      And that which was still worse, those that did thus break out\r\n      spread the infection farther by their wandering about with the\r\n      distemper upon them, in their desperate circumstances, than they\r\n      would otherwise have done; for whoever considers all the\r\n      particulars in such cases must acknowledge, and we cannot doubt\r\n      but the severity of those confinements made many people\r\n      desperate, and made them run out of their houses at all hazards,\r\n      and with the plague visibly upon them, not knowing either whither\r\n      to go or what to do, or, indeed, what they did; and many that did\r\n      so were driven to dreadful exigencies and extremities, and\r\n      perished in the streets or fields for mere want, or dropped down\r\n      by the raging violence of the fever upon them. Others wandered\r\n      into the country, and went forward any way, as their desperation\r\n      guided them, not knowing whither they went or would go: till,\r\n      faint and tired, and not getting any relief, the houses and\r\n      villages on the road refusing to admit them to lodge whether\r\n      infected or no, they have perished by the roadside or gotten into\r\n      barns and died there, none daring to come to them or relieve\r\n      them, though perhaps not infected, for nobody would believe them.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, when the plague at first seized a family that\r\n      is to say, when any body of the family had gone out and unwarily\r\n      or otherwise catched the distemper and brought it home\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\n      certainly known by the family before it was known to the\r\n      officers, who, as you will see by the order, were appointed to\r\n      examine into the circumstances of all sick persons when they\r\n      heard of their being sick.\r\n\r\n      In this interval, between their being taken sick and the\r\n      examiners coming, the master of the house had leisure and liberty\r\n      to remove himself or all his family, if he knew whither to go,\r\n      and many did so. But the great disaster was that many did thus\r\n      after they were really infected themselves, and so carried the\r\n      disease into the houses of those who were so hospitable as to\r\n      receive them; which, it must be confessed, was very cruel and\r\n      ungrateful.\r\n\r\n      And this was in part the reason of the general notion, or scandal\r\n      rather, which went about of the temper of people infected:\r\n      namely, that they did not take the least care or make any scruple\r\n      of infecting others, though I cannot say but there might be some\r\n      truth in it too, but not so general as was reported. What natural\r\n      reason could be given for so wicked a thing at a time when they\r\n      might conclude themselves just going to appear at the bar of\r\n      Divine justice I know not. I am very well satisfied that it\r\n      cannot be reconciled to religion and principle any more than it\r\n      can be to generosity and Humanity, but I may speak of that again.\r\n\r\n      I am speaking now of people made desperate by the apprehensions\r\n      of their being shut up, and their breaking out by stratagem or\r\n      force, either before or after they were shut up, whose misery was\r\n      not lessened when they were out, but sadly increased. On the\r\n      other hand, many that thus got away had retreats to go to and\r\n      other houses, where they locked themselves up and kept hid till\r\n      the plague was over; and many families, foreseeing the approach\r\n      of the distemper, laid up stores of provisions sufficient for\r\n      their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so\r\n      entirely that they were neither seen or heard of till the\r\n      infection was quite ceased, and then came abroad sound and well.\r\n      I might recollect several such as these, and give you the\r\n      particulars of their management; for doubtless it was the most\r\n      effectual secure step that could be taken for such whose\r\n      circumstances would not admit them to remove, or who had not\r\n      retreats abroad proper for the case; for in being thus shut up\r\n      they were as if they had been a hundred miles off. Nor do I\r\n      remember that any one of those families miscarried. Among these,\r\n      several Dutch merchants were particularly remarkable, who kept\r\n      their houses like little garrisons besieged suffering none to go\r\n      in or out or come near them, particularly one in a court in\r\n      Throgmorton Street whose house looked into Draper\xe2\x80\x99s Garden.\r\n\r\n      But I come back to the case of families infected and shut up by\r\n      the magistrates. The misery of those families is not to be\r\n      expressed; and it was generally in such houses that we heard the\r\n      most dismal shrieks and outcries of the poor people, terrified\r\n      and even frighted to death by the sight of the condition of their\r\n      dearest relations, and by the terror of being imprisoned as they\r\n      were.\r\n\r\n      I remember, and while I am writing this story I think I hear the\r\n      very sound of it, a certain lady had an only daughter, a young\r\n      maiden about nineteen years old, and who was possessed of a very\r\n      considerable fortune. They were only lodgers in the house where\r\n      they were. The young woman, her mother, and the maid had been\r\n      abroad on some occasion, I do not remember what, for the house\r\n      was not shut up; but about two hours after they came home the\r\n      young lady complained she was not well; in a quarter of an hour\r\n      more she vomited and had a violent pain in her head. \xe2\x80\x98Pray God\xe2\x80\x99,\r\n      says her mother, in a terrible fright, \xe2\x80\x98my child has not the\r\n      distemper!\xe2\x80\x99 The pain in her head increasing, her mother ordered\r\n      the bed to be warmed, and resolved to put her to bed, and\r\n      prepared to give her things to sweat, which was the ordinary\r\n      remedy to be taken when the first apprehensions of the distemper\r\n      began.\r\n\r\n      While the bed was airing the mother undressed the young woman,\r\n      and just as she was laid down in the bed, she, looking upon her\r\n      body with a candle, immediately discovered the fatal tokens on\r\n      the inside of her thighs. Her mother, not being able to contain\r\n      herself, threw down her candle and shrieked out in such a\r\n      frightful manner that it was enough to place horror upon the\r\n      stoutest heart in the world; nor was it one scream or one cry,\r\n      but the fright having seized her spirits, she\xe2\x80\x94fainted first, then\r\n      recovered, then ran all over the house, up the stairs and down\r\n      the stairs, like one distracted, and indeed really was\r\n      distracted, and continued screeching and crying out for several\r\n      hours void of all sense, or at least government of her senses,\r\n      and, as I was told, never came thoroughly to herself again. As to\r\n      the young maiden, she was a dead corpse from that moment, for the\r\n      gangrene which occasions the spots had spread [over] her whole\r\n      body, and she died in less than two hours. But still the mother\r\n      continued crying out, not knowing anything more of her child,\r\n      several hours after she was dead. It is so long ago that I am not\r\n      certain, but I think the mother never recovered, but died in two\r\n      or three weeks after.\r\n\r\n      This was an extraordinary case, and I am therefore the more\r\n      particular in it, because I came so much to the knowledge of it;\r\n      but there were innumerable such-like cases, and it was seldom\r\n      that the weekly bill came in but there were two or three put in,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98frighted\xe2\x80\x99; that is, that may well be called frighted to death.\r\n      But besides those who were so frighted as to die upon the spot,\r\n      there were great numbers frighted to other extremes, some\r\n      frighted out of their senses, some out of their memory, and some\r\n      out of their understanding. But I return to the shutting up of\r\n      houses.\r\n\r\n      As several people, I say, got out of their houses by stratagem\r\n      after they were shut up, so others got out by bribing the\r\n      watchmen, and giving them money to let them go privately out in\r\n      the night. I must confess I thought it at that time the most\r\n      innocent corruption or bribery that any man could be guilty of,\r\n      and therefore could not but pity the poor men, and think it was\r\n      hard when three of those watchmen were publicly whipped through\r\n      the streets for suffering people to go out of houses shut up.\r\n\r\n      But notwithstanding that severity, money prevailed with the poor\r\n      men, and many families found means to make sallies out, and\r\n      escape that way after they had been shut up; but these were\r\n      generally such as had some places to retire to; and though there\r\n      was no easy passing the roads any whither after the 1st of\r\n      August, yet there were many ways of retreat, and particularly, as\r\n      I hinted, some got tents and set them up in the fields, carrying\r\n      beds or straw to lie on, and provisions to eat, and so lived in\r\n      them as hermits in a cell, for nobody would venture to come near\r\n      them; and several stories were told of such, some comical, some\r\n      tragical, some who lived like wandering pilgrims in the deserts,\r\n      and escaped by making themselves exiles in such a manner as is\r\n      scarce to be credited, and who yet enjoyed more liberty than was\r\n      to be expected in such cases.\r\n\r\n      I have by me a story of two brothers and their kinsman, who being\r\n      single men, but that had stayed in the city too long to get away,\r\n      and indeed not knowing where to go to have any retreat, nor\r\n      having wherewith to travel far, took a course for their own\r\n      preservation, which though in itself at first desperate, yet was\r\n      so natural that it may be wondered that no more did so at that\r\n      time. They were but of mean condition, and yet not so very poor\r\n      as that they could not furnish themselves with some little\r\n      conveniences such as might serve to keep life and soul together;\r\n      and finding the distemper increasing in a terrible manner, they\r\n      resolved to shift as well as they could, and to be gone.\r\n\r\n      One of them had been a soldier in the late wars, and before that\r\n      in the Low Countries, and having been bred to no particular\r\n      employment but his arms, and besides being wounded, and not able\r\n      to work very hard, had for some time been employed at a baker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      of sea-biscuit in Wapping.\r\n\r\n      The brother of this man was a seaman too, but somehow or other\r\n      had been hurt of one leg, that he could not go to sea, but had\r\n      worked for his living at a sailmaker\xe2\x80\x99s in Wapping, or\r\n      thereabouts; and being a good husband, had laid up some money,\r\n      and was the richest of the three.\r\n\r\n      The third man was a joiner or carpenter by trade, a handy fellow,\r\n      and he had no wealth but his box or basket of tools, with the\r\n      help of which he could at any time get his living, such a time as\r\n      this excepted, wherever he went\xe2\x80\x94and he lived near Shadwell.\r\n\r\n      They all lived in Stepney parish, which, as I have said, being\r\n      the last that was infected, or at least violently, they stayed\r\n      there till they evidently saw the plague was abating at the west\r\n      part of the town, and coming towards the east, where they lived.\r\n\r\n      The story of those three men, if the reader will be content to\r\n      have me give it in their own persons, without taking upon me to\r\n      either vouch the particulars or answer for any mistakes, I shall\r\n      give as distinctly as I can, believing the history will be a very\r\n      good pattern for any poor man to follow, in case the like public\r\n      desolation should happen here; and if there may be no such\r\n      occasion, which God of His infinite mercy grant us, still the\r\n      story may have its uses so many ways as that it will, I hope,\r\n      never be said that the relating has been unprofitable.\r\n\r\n      I say all this previous to the history, having yet, for the\r\n      present, much more to say before I quit my own part.\r\n\r\n      I went all the first part of the time freely about the streets,\r\n      though not so freely as to run myself into apparent danger,\r\n      except when they dug the great pit in the churchyard of our\r\n      parish of Aldgate. A terrible pit it was, and I could not resist\r\n      my curiosity to go and see it. As near as I may judge, it was\r\n      about forty feet in length, and about fifteen or sixteen feet\r\n      broad, and at the time I first looked at it, about nine feet\r\n      deep; but it was said they dug it near twenty feet deep\r\n      afterwards in one part of it, till they could go no deeper for\r\n      the water; for they had, it seems, dug several large pits before\r\n      this. For though the plague was long a-coming to our parish, yet,\r\n      when it did come, there was no parish in or about London where it\r\n      raged with such violence as in the two parishes of Aldgate and\r\n      Whitechappel.\r\n\r\n      I say they had dug several pits in another ground, when the\r\n      distemper began to spread in our parish, and especially when the\r\n      dead-carts began to go about, which was not, in our parish, till\r\n      the beginning of August. Into these pits they had put perhaps\r\n      fifty or sixty bodies each; then they made larger holes wherein\r\n      they buried all that the cart brought in a week, which, by the\r\n      middle to the end of August, came to from 200 to 400 a week; and\r\n      they could not well dig them larger, because of the order of the\r\n      magistrates confining them to leave no bodies within six feet of\r\n      the surface; and the water coming on at about seventeen or\r\n      eighteen feet, they could not well, I say, put more in one pit.\r\n      But now, at the beginning of September, the plague raging in a\r\n      dreadful manner, and the number of burials in our parish\r\n      increasing to more than was ever buried in any parish about\r\n      London of no larger extent, they ordered this dreadful gulf to be\r\n      dug\xe2\x80\x94for such it was, rather than a pit.\r\n\r\n      They had supposed this pit would have supplied them for a month\r\n      or more when they dug it, and some blamed the churchwardens for\r\n      suffering such a frightful thing, telling them they were making\r\n      preparations to bury the whole parish, and the like; but time\r\n      made it appear the churchwardens knew the condition of the parish\r\n      better than they did: for, the pit being finished the 4th of\r\n      September, I think, they began to bury in it the 6th, and by the\r\n      20th, which was just two weeks, they had thrown into it 1114\r\n      bodies when they were obliged to fill it up, the bodies being\r\n      then come to lie within six feet of the surface. I doubt not but\r\n      there may be some ancient persons alive in the parish who can\r\n      justify the fact of this, and are able to show even in what place\r\n      of the churchyard the pit lay better than I can. The mark of it\r\n      also was many years to be seen in the churchyard on the surface,\r\n      lying in length parallel with the passage which goes by the west\r\n      wall of the churchyard out of Houndsditch, and turns east again\r\n      into Whitechappel, coming out near the Three Nuns\xe2\x80\x99 Inn.\r\n\r\n      It was about the 10th of September that my curiosity led, or\r\n      rather drove, me to go and see this pit again, when there had\r\n      been near 400 people buried in it; and I was not content to see\r\n      it in the day-time, as I had done before, for then there would\r\n      have been nothing to have been seen but the loose earth; for all\r\n      the bodies that were thrown in were immediately covered with\r\n      earth by those they called the buriers, which at other times were\r\n      called bearers; but I resolved to go in the night and see some of\r\n      them thrown in.\r\n\r\n      There was a strict order to prevent people coming to those pits,\r\n      and that was only to prevent infection. But after some time that\r\n      order was more necessary, for people that were infected and near\r\n      their end, and delirious also, would run to those pits, wrapt in\r\n      blankets or rugs, and throw themselves in, and, as they said,\r\n      bury themselves. I cannot say that the officers suffered any\r\n      willingly to lie there; but I have heard that in a great pit in\r\n      Finsbury, in the parish of Cripplegate, it lying open then to the\r\n      fields, for it was not then walled about, [many] came and threw\r\n      themselves in, and expired there, before they threw any earth\r\n      upon them; and that when they came to bury others and found them\r\n      there, they were quite dead, though not cold.\r\n\r\n      This may serve a little to describe the dreadful condition of\r\n      that day, though it is impossible to say anything that is able to\r\n      give a true idea of it to those who did not see it, other than\r\n      this, that it was indeed very, very, very dreadful, and such as\r\n      no tongue can express.\r\n\r\n      I got admittance into the churchyard by being acquainted with the\r\n      sexton who attended; who, though he did not refuse me at all, yet\r\n      earnestly persuaded me not to go, telling me very seriously (for\r\n      he was a good, religious, and sensible man) that it was indeed\r\n      their business and duty to venture, and to run all hazards, and\r\n      that in it they might hope to be preserved; but that I had no\r\n      apparent call to it but my own curiosity, which, he said, he\r\n      believed I would not pretend was sufficient to justify my running\r\n      that hazard. I told him I had been pressed in my mind to go, and\r\n      that perhaps it might be an instructing sight, that might not be\r\n      without its uses. \xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 says the good man, \xe2\x80\x98if you will venture\r\n      upon that score, name of God go in; for, depend upon it, \xe2\x80\x99twill\r\n      be a sermon to you, it may be, the best that ever you heard in\r\n      your life. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a speaking sight,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and has a voice with\r\n      it, and a loud one, to call us all to repentance\xe2\x80\x99; and with that\r\n      he opened the door and said, \xe2\x80\x98Go, if you will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      His discourse had shocked my resolution a little, and I stood\r\n      wavering for a good while, but just at that interval I saw two\r\n      links come over from the end of the Minories, and heard the\r\n      bellman, and then appeared a dead-cart, as they called it, coming\r\n      over the streets; so I could no longer resist my desire of seeing\r\n      it, and went in. There was nobody, as I could perceive at first,\r\n      in the churchyard, or going into it, but the buriers and the\r\n      fellow that drove the cart, or rather led the horse and cart; but\r\n      when they came up to the pit they saw a man go to and again,\r\n      muffled up in a brown Cloak, and making motions with his hands\r\n      under his cloak, as if he was in great agony, and the buriers\r\n      immediately gathered about him, supposing he was one of those\r\n      poor delirious or desperate creatures that used to pretend, as I\r\n      have said, to bury themselves. He said nothing as he walked\r\n      about, but two or three times groaned very deeply and loud, and\r\n      sighed as he would break his heart.\r\n\r\n      When the buriers came up to him they soon found he was neither a\r\n      person infected and desperate, as I have observed above, or a\r\n      person distempered\xe2\x80\x94in mind, but one oppressed with a dreadful\r\n      weight of grief indeed, having his wife and several of his\r\n      children all in the cart that was just come in with him, and he\r\n      followed in an agony and excess of sorrow. He mourned heartily,\r\n      as it was easy to see, but with a kind of masculine grief that\r\n      could not give itself vent by tears; and calmly defying the\r\n      buriers to let him alone, said he would only see the bodies\r\n      thrown in and go away, so they left importuning him. But no\r\n      sooner was the cart turned round and the bodies shot into the pit\r\n      promiscuously, which was a surprise to him, for he at least\r\n      expected they would have been decently laid in, though indeed he\r\n      was afterwards convinced that was impracticable; I say, no sooner\r\n      did he see the sight but he cried out aloud, unable to contain\r\n      himself. I could not hear what he said, but he went backward two\r\n      or three steps and fell down in a swoon. The buriers ran to him\r\n      and took him up, and in a little while he came to himself, and\r\n      they led him away to the Pie Tavern over against the end of\r\n      Houndsditch, where, it seems, the man was known, and where they\r\n      took care of him. He looked into the pit again as he went away,\r\n      but the buriers had covered the bodies so immediately with\r\n      throwing in earth, that though there was light enough, for there\r\n      were lanterns, and candles in them, placed all night round the\r\n      sides of the pit, upon heaps of earth, seven or eight, or perhaps\r\n      more, yet nothing could be seen.\r\n\r\n      This was a mournful scene indeed, and affected me almost as much\r\n      as the rest; but the other was awful and full of terror. The cart\r\n      had in it sixteen or seventeen bodies; some were wrapt up in\r\n      linen sheets, some in rags, some little other than naked, or so\r\n      loose that what covering they had fell from them in the shooting\r\n      out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among the rest; but\r\n      the matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one\r\n      else, seeing they were all dead, and were to be huddled together\r\n      into the common grave of mankind, as we may call it, for here was\r\n      no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there was no\r\n      other way of burials, neither was it possible there should, for\r\n      coffins were not to be had for the prodigious numbers that fell\r\n      in such a calamity as this.\r\n\r\n      It was reported by way of scandal upon the buriers, that if any\r\n      corpse was delivered to them decently wound up, as we called it\r\n      then, in a winding-sheet tied over the head and feet, which some\r\n      did, and which was generally of good linen; I say, it was\r\n      reported that the buriers were so wicked as to strip them in the\r\n      cart and carry them quite naked to the ground. But as I cannot\r\n      easily credit anything so vile among Christians, and at a time so\r\n      filled with terrors as that was, I can only relate it and leave\r\n      it undetermined.\r\n\r\n      Innumerable stories also went about of the cruel behaviours and\r\n      practices of nurses who tended the sick, and of their hastening\r\n      on the fate of those they tended in their sickness. But I shall\r\n      say more of this in its place.\r\n\r\n      I was indeed shocked with this sight; it almost overwhelmed me,\r\n      and I went away with my heart most afflicted, and full of the\r\n      afflicting thoughts, such as I cannot describe just at my going\r\n      out of the church, and turning up the street towards my own\r\n      house, I saw another cart with links, and a bellman going before,\r\n      coming out of Harrow Alley in the Butcher Row, on the other side\r\n      of the way, and being, as I perceived, very full of dead bodies,\r\n      it went directly over the street also toward the church. I stood\r\n      a while, but I had no stomach to go back again to see the same\r\n      dismal scene over again, so I went directly home, where I could\r\n      not but consider with thankfulness the risk I had run, believing\r\n      I had gotten no injury, as indeed I had not.\r\n\r\n      Here the poor unhappy gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s grief came into my head again,\r\n      and indeed I could not but shed tears in the reflection upon it,\r\n      perhaps more than he did himself; but his case lay so heavy upon\r\n      my mind that I could not prevail with myself, but that I must go\r\n      out again into the street, and go to the Pie Tavern, resolving to\r\n      inquire what became of him.\r\n\r\n      It was by this time one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and yet the poor\r\n      gentleman was there. The truth was, the people of the house,\r\n      knowing him, had entertained him, and kept him there all the\r\n      night, notwithstanding the danger of being infected by him,\r\n      though it appeared the man was perfectly sound himself.\r\n\r\n      It is with regret that I take notice of this tavern. The people\r\n      were civil, mannerly, and an obliging sort of folks enough, and\r\n      had till this time kept their house open and their trade going\r\n      on, though not so very publicly as formerly: but there was a\r\n      dreadful set of fellows that used their house, and who, in the\r\n      middle of all this horror, met there every night, behaved with\r\n      all the revelling and roaring extravagances as is usual for such\r\n      people to do at other times, and, indeed, to such an offensive\r\n      degree that the very master and mistress of the house grew first\r\n      ashamed and then terrified at them.\r\n\r\n      They sat generally in a room next the street, and as they always\r\n      kept late hours, so when the dead-cart came across the street-end\r\n      to go into Houndsditch, which was in view of the tavern windows,\r\n      they would frequently open the windows as soon as they heard the\r\n      bell and look out at them; and as they might often hear sad\r\n      lamentations of people in the streets or at their windows as the\r\n      carts went along, they would make their impudent mocks and jeers\r\n      at them, especially if they heard the poor people call upon God\r\n      to have mercy upon them, as many would do at those times in their\r\n      ordinary passing along the streets.\r\n\r\n      These gentlemen, being something disturbed with the clutter of\r\n      bringing the poor gentleman into the house, as above, were first\r\n      angry and very high with the master of the house for suffering\r\n      such a fellow, as they called him, to be brought out of the grave\r\n      into their house; but being answered that the man was a\r\n      neighbour, and that he was sound, but overwhelmed with the\r\n      calamity of his family, and the like, they turned their anger\r\n      into ridiculing the man and his sorrow for his wife and children,\r\n      taunted him with want of courage to leap into the great pit and\r\n      go to heaven, as they jeeringly expressed it, along with them,\r\n      adding some very profane and even blasphemous expressions.\r\n\r\n      They were at this vile work when I came back to the house, and,\r\n      as far as I could see, though the man sat still, mute and\r\n      disconsolate, and their affronts could not divert his sorrow, yet\r\n      he was both grieved and offended at their discourse. Upon this I\r\n      gently reproved them, being well enough acquainted with their\r\n      characters, and not unknown in person to two of them.\r\n\r\n      They immediately fell upon me with ill language and oaths, asked\r\n      me what I did out of my grave at such a time when so many\r\n      honester men were carried into the churchyard, and why I was not\r\n      at home saying my prayers against the dead-cart came for me, and\r\n      the like.\r\n\r\n      I was indeed astonished at the impudence of the men, though not\r\n      at all discomposed at their treatment of me. However, I kept my\r\n      temper. I told them that though I defied them or any man in the\r\n      world to tax me with any dishonesty, yet I acknowledged that in\r\n      this terrible judgement of God many better than I were swept away\r\n      and carried to their grave. But to answer their question\r\n      directly, the case was, that I was mercifully preserved by that\r\n      great God whose name they had blasphemed and taken in vain by\r\n      cursing and swearing in a dreadful manner, and that I believed I\r\n      was preserved in particular, among other ends of His goodness,\r\n      that I might reprove them for their audacious boldness in\r\n      behaving in such a manner and in such an awful time as this was,\r\n      especially for their jeering and mocking at an honest gentleman\r\n      and a neighbour (for some of them knew him), who, they saw, was\r\n      overwhelmed with sorrow for the breaches which it had pleased God\r\n      to make upon his family.\r\n\r\n      I cannot call exactly to mind the hellish, abominable raillery\r\n      which was the return they made to that talk of mine: being\r\n      provoked, it seems, that I was not at all afraid to be free with\r\n      them; nor, if I could remember, would I fill my account with any\r\n      of the words, the horrid oaths, curses, and vile expressions,\r\n      such as, at that time of the day, even the worst and ordinariest\r\n      people in the street would not use; for, except such hardened\r\n      creatures as these, the most wicked wretches that could be found\r\n      had at that time some terror upon their minds of the hand of that\r\n      Power which could thus in a moment destroy them.\r\n\r\n      But that which was the worst in all their devilish language was,\r\n      that they were not afraid to blaspheme God and talk\r\n      atheistically, making a jest of my calling the plague the hand of\r\n      God; mocking, and even laughing, at the word judgement, as if the\r\n      providence of God had no concern in the inflicting such a\r\n      desolating stroke; and that the people calling upon God as they\r\n      saw the carts carrying away the dead bodies was all enthusiastic,\r\n      absurd, and impertinent.\r\n\r\n      I made them some reply, such as I thought proper, but which I\r\n      found was so far from putting a check to their horrid way of\r\n      speaking that it made them rail the more, so that I confess it\r\n      filled me with horror and a kind of rage, and I came away, as I\r\n      told them, lest the hand of that judgement which had visited the\r\n      whole city should glorify His vengeance upon them, and all that\r\n      were near them.\r\n\r\n      They received all reproof with the utmost contempt, and made the\r\n      greatest mockery that was possible for them to do at me, giving\r\n      me all the opprobrious, insolent scoffs that they could think of\r\n      for preaching to them, as they called it, which indeed grieved\r\n      me, rather than angered me; and I went away, blessing God,\r\n      however, in my mind that I had not spared them, though they had\r\n      insulted me so much.\r\n\r\n      They continued this wretched course three or four days after\r\n      this, continually mocking and jeering at all that showed\r\n      themselves religious or serious, or that were any way touched\r\n      with the sense of the terrible judgement of God upon us; and I\r\n      was informed they flouted in the same manner at the good people\r\n      who, notwithstanding the contagion, met at the church, fasted,\r\n      and prayed to God to remove His hand from them.\r\n\r\n      I say, they continued this dreadful course three or four days\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      think it was no more\xe2\x80\x94when one of them, particularly he who asked\r\n      the poor gentleman what he did out of his grave, was struck from\r\n      Heaven with the plague, and died in a most deplorable manner;\r\n      and, in a word, they were every one of them carried into the\r\n      great pit which I have mentioned above, before it was quite\r\n      filled up, which was not above a fortnight or thereabout.\r\n\r\n      These men were guilty of many extravagances, such as one would\r\n      think human nature should have trembled at the thoughts of at\r\n      such a time of general terror as was then upon us, and\r\n      particularly scoffing and mocking at everything which they\r\n      happened to see that was religious among the people, especially\r\n      at their thronging zealously to the place of public worship to\r\n      implore mercy from Heaven in such a time of distress; and this\r\n      tavern where they held their dub being within view of the\r\n      church-door, they had the more particular occasion for their\r\n      atheistical profane mirth.\r\n\r\n      But this began to abate a little with them before the accident\r\n      which I have related happened, for the infection increased so\r\n      violently at this part of the town now, that people began to be\r\n      afraid to come to the church; at least such numbers did not\r\n      resort thither as was usual. Many of the clergymen likewise were\r\n      dead, and others gone into the country; for it really required a\r\n      steady courage and a strong faith for a man not only to venture\r\n      being in town at such a time as this, but likewise to venture to\r\n      come to church and perform the office of a minister to a\r\n      congregation, of whom he had reason to believe many of them were\r\n      actually infected with the plague, and to do this every day, or\r\n      twice a day, as in some places was done.\r\n\r\n      It is true the people showed an extraordinary zeal in these\r\n      religious exercises, and as the church-doors were always open,\r\n      people would go in single at all times, whether the minister was\r\n      officiating or no, and locking themselves into separate pews,\r\n      would be praying to God with great fervency and devotion.\r\n\r\n      Others assembled at meeting-houses, every one as their different\r\n      opinions in such things guided, but all were promiscuously the\r\n      subject of these men\xe2\x80\x99s drollery, especially at the beginning of\r\n      the visitation.\r\n\r\n      It seems they had been checked for their open insulting religion\r\n      in this manner by several good people of every persuasion, and\r\n      that, and the violent raging of the infection, I suppose, was the\r\n      occasion that they had abated much of their rudeness for some\r\n      time before, and were only roused by the spirit of ribaldry and\r\n      atheism at the clamour which was made when the gentleman was\r\n      first brought in there, and perhaps were agitated by the same\r\n      devil, when I took upon me to reprove them; though I did it at\r\n      first with all the calmness, temper, and good manners that I\r\n      could, which for a while they insulted me the more for thinking\r\n      it had been in fear of their resentment, though afterwards they\r\n      found the contrary.\r\n\r\n      I went home, indeed, grieved and afflicted in my mind at the\r\n      abominable wickedness of those men, not doubting, however, that\r\n      they would be made dreadful examples of God\xe2\x80\x99s justice; for I\r\n      looked upon this dismal time to be a particular season of Divine\r\n      vengeance, and that God would on this occasion single out the\r\n      proper objects of His displeasure in a more especial and\r\n      remarkable manner than at another time; and that though I did\r\n      believe that many good people would, and did, fall in the common\r\n      calamity, and that it was no certain rule to judge of the eternal\r\n      state of any one by their being distinguished in such a time of\r\n      general destruction neither one way or other; yet, I say, it\r\n      could not but seem reasonable to believe that God would not think\r\n      fit to spare by His mercy such open declared enemies, that should\r\n      insult His name and Being, defy His vengeance, and mock at His\r\n      worship and worshippers at such a time; no, not though His mercy\r\n      had thought fit to bear with and spare them at other times; that\r\n      this was a day of visitation, a day of God\xe2\x80\x99s anger, and those\r\n      words came into my thought, Jer. v. 9: \xe2\x80\x98Shall I not visit for\r\n      these things? saith the Lord: and shall not My soul be avenged of\r\n      such a nation as this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      These things, I say, lay upon my mind, and I went home very much\r\n      grieved and oppressed with the horror of these men\xe2\x80\x99s wickedness,\r\n      and to think that anything could be so vile, so hardened, and\r\n      notoriously wicked as to insult God, and His servants, and His\r\n      worship in such a manner, and at such a time as this was, when He\r\n      had, as it were, His sword drawn in His hand on purpose to take\r\n      vengeance not on them only, but on the whole nation.\r\n\r\n      I had, indeed, been in some passion at first with them\xe2\x80\x94though it\r\n      was really raised, not by any affront they had offered me\r\n      personally, but by the horror their blaspheming tongues filled me\r\n      with. However, I was doubtful in my thoughts whether the\r\n      resentment I retained was not all upon my own private account,\r\n      for they had given me a great deal of ill language too\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\n      personally; but after some pause, and having a weight of grief\r\n      upon my mind, I retired myself as soon as I came home, for I\r\n      slept not that night; and giving God most humble thanks for my\r\n      preservation in the eminent danger I had been in, I set my mind\r\n      seriously and with the utmost earnestness to pray for those\r\n      desperate wretches, that God would pardon them, open their eyes,\r\n      and effectually humble them.\r\n\r\n      By this I not only did my duty, namely, to pray for those who\r\n      despitefully used me, but I fully tried my own heart, to my full\r\n      satisfaction, that it was not filled with any spirit of\r\n      resentment as they had offended me in particular; and I humbly\r\n      recommend the method to all those that would know, or be certain,\r\n      how to distinguish between their zeal for the honour of God and\r\n      the effects of their private passions and resentment.\r\n\r\n      But I must go back here to the particular incidents which occur\r\n      to my thoughts of the time of the visitation, and particularly to\r\n      the time of their shutting up houses in the first part of their\r\n      sickness; for before the sickness was come to its height people\r\n      had more room to make their observations than they had afterward;\r\n      but when it was in the extremity there was no such thing as\r\n      communication with one another, as before.\r\n\r\n      During the shutting up of houses, as I have said, some violence\r\n      was offered to the watchmen. As to soldiers, there were none to\r\n      be found. The few guards which the king then had, which were\r\n      nothing like the number entertained since, were dispersed, either\r\n      at Oxford with the Court, or in quarters in the remoter parts of\r\n      the country, small detachments excepted, who did duty at the\r\n      Tower and at Whitehall, and these but very few. Neither am I\r\n      positive that there was any other guard at the Tower than the\r\n      warders, as they called them, who stand at the gate with gowns\r\n      and caps, the same as the yeomen of the guard, except the\r\n      ordinary gunners, who were twenty-four, and the officers\r\n      appointed to look after the magazine, who were called armourers.\r\n      As to trained bands, there was no possibility of raising any;\r\n      neither, if the Lieutenancy, either of London or Middlesex, had\r\n      ordered the drums to beat for the militia, would any of the\r\n      companies, I believe, have drawn together, whatever risk they had\r\n      run.\r\n\r\n      This made the watchmen be the less regarded, and perhaps\r\n      occasioned the greater violence to be used against them. I\r\n      mention it on this score to observe that the setting watchmen\r\n      thus to keep the people in was, first of all, not effectual, but\r\n      that the people broke out, whether by force or by stratagem, even\r\n      almost as often as they pleased; and, second, that those that did\r\n      thus break out were generally people infected who, in their\r\n      desperation, running about from one place to another, valued not\r\n      whom they injured: and which perhaps, as I have said, might give\r\n      birth to report that it was natural to the infected people to\r\n      desire to infect others, which report was really false.\r\n\r\n      And I know it so well, and in so many several cases, that I could\r\n      give several relations of good, pious, and religious people who,\r\n      when they have had the distemper, have been so far from being\r\n      forward to infect others that they have forbid their own family\r\n      to come near them, in hopes of their being preserved, and have\r\n      even died without seeing their nearest relations lest they should\r\n      be instrumental to give them the distemper, and infect or\r\n      endanger them. If, then, there were cases wherein the infected\r\n      people were careless of the injury they did to others, this was\r\n      certainly one of them, if not the chief, namely, when people who\r\n      had the distemper had broken out from houses which were so shut\r\n      up, and having been driven to extremities for provision or for\r\n      entertainment, had endeavoured to conceal their condition, and\r\n      have been thereby instrumental involuntarily to infect others who\r\n      have been ignorant and unwary.\r\n\r\n      This is one of the reasons why I believed then, and do believe\r\n      still, that the shutting up houses thus by force, and\r\n      restraining, or rather imprisoning, people in their own houses,\r\n      as I said above, was of little or no service in the whole. Nay, I\r\n      am of opinion it was rather hurtful, having forced those\r\n      desperate people to wander abroad with the plague upon them, who\r\n      would otherwise have died quietly in their beds.\r\n\r\n      I remember one citizen who, having thus broken out of his house\r\n      in Aldersgate Street or thereabout, went along the road to\r\n      Islington; he attempted to have gone in at the Angel Inn, and\r\n      after that the White Horse, two inns known still by the same\r\n      signs, but was refused; after which he came to the Pied Bull, an\r\n      inn also still continuing the same sign. He asked them for\r\n      lodging for one night only, pretending to be going into\r\n      Lincolnshire, and assuring them of his being very sound and free\r\n      from the infection, which also at that time had not reached much\r\n      that way.\r\n\r\n      They told him they had no lodging that they could spare but one\r\n      bed up in the garret, and that they could spare that bed for one\r\n      night, some drovers being expected the next day with cattle; so,\r\n      if he would accept of that lodging, he might have it, which he\r\n      did. So a servant was sent up with a candle with him to show him\r\n      the room. He was very well dressed, and looked like a person not\r\n      used to lie in a garret; and when he came to the room he fetched\r\n      a deep sigh, and said to the servant, \xe2\x80\x98I have seldom lain in such\r\n      a lodging as this. \xe2\x80\x98However, the servant assuring him again that\r\n      they had no better, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98I must make shift; this is\r\n      a dreadful time; but it is but for one night.\xe2\x80\x99 So he sat down\r\n      upon the bedside, and bade the maid, I think it was, fetch him up\r\n      a pint of warm ale. Accordingly the servant went for the ale, but\r\n      some hurry in the house, which perhaps employed her other ways,\r\n      put it out of her head, and she went up no more to him.\r\n\r\n      The next morning, seeing no appearance of the gentleman, somebody\r\n      in the house asked the servant that had showed him upstairs what\r\n      was become of him. She started. \xe2\x80\x98Alas I,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98I never\r\n      thought more of him. He bade me carry him some warm ale, but I\r\n      forgot.\xe2\x80\x99 Upon which, not the maid, but some other person was sent\r\n      up to see after him, who, coming into the room, found him stark\r\n      dead and almost cold, stretched out across the bed. His clothes\r\n      were pulled off, his jaw fallen, his eyes open in a most\r\n      frightful posture, the rug of the bed being grasped hard in one\r\n      of his hands, so that it was plain he died soon after the maid\r\n      left him; and \xe2\x80\x99tis probable, had she gone up with the ale, she\r\n      had found him dead in a few minutes after he sat down upon the\r\n      bed. The alarm was great in the house, as anyone may suppose,\r\n      they having been free from the distemper till that disaster,\r\n      which, bringing the infection to the house, spread it immediately\r\n      to other houses round about it. I do not remember how many died\r\n      in the house itself, but I think the maid-servant who went up\r\n      first with him fell presently ill by the fright, and several\r\n      others; for, whereas there died but two in Islington of the\r\n      plague the week before, there died seventeen the week after,\r\n      whereof fourteen were of the plague. This was in the week from\r\n      the 11th of July to the 18th.\r\n\r\n      There was one shift that some families had, and that not a few,\r\n      when their houses happened to be infected, and that was this: the\r\n      families who, in the first breaking-out of the distemper, fled\r\n      away into the country and had retreats among their friends,\r\n      generally found some or other of their neighbours or relations to\r\n      commit the charge of those houses to for the safety of the goods\r\n      and the like. Some houses were, indeed, entirely locked up, the\r\n      doors padlocked, the windows and doors having deal boards nailed\r\n      over them, and only the inspection of them committed to the\r\n      ordinary watchmen and parish officers; but these were but few.\r\n\r\n      It was thought that there were not less than 10,000 houses\r\n      forsaken of the inhabitants in the city and suburbs, including\r\n      what was in the out-parishes and in Surrey, or the side of the\r\n      water they called Southwark. This was besides the numbers of\r\n      lodgers, and of particular persons who were fled out of other\r\n      families; so that in all it was computed that about 200,000\r\n      people were fled and gone. But of this I shall speak again. But I\r\n      mention it here on this account, namely, that it was a rule with\r\n      those who had thus two houses in their keeping or care, that if\r\n      anybody was taken sick in a family, before the master of the\r\n      family let the examiners or any other officer know of it, he\r\n      immediately would send all the rest of his family, whether\r\n      children or servants, as it fell out to be, to such other house\r\n      which he had so in charge, and then giving notice of the sick\r\n      person to the examiner, have a nurse or nurses appointed, and\r\n      have another person to be shut up in the house with them (which\r\n      many for money would do), so to take charge of the house in case\r\n      the person should die.\r\n\r\n      This was, in many cases, the saving a whole family, who, if they\r\n      had been shut up with the sick person, would inevitably have\r\n      perished. But, on the other hand, this was another of the\r\n      inconveniences of shutting up houses; for the apprehensions and\r\n      terror of being shut up made many run away with the rest of the\r\n      family, who, though it was not publicly known, and they were not\r\n      quite sick, had yet the distemper upon them; and who, by having\r\n      an uninterrupted liberty to go about, but being obliged still to\r\n      conceal their circumstances, or perhaps not knowing it\r\n      themselves, gave the distemper to others, and spread the\r\n      infection in a dreadful manner, as I shall explain further\r\n      hereafter.\r\n\r\n      And here I may be able to make an observation or two of my own,\r\n      which may be of use hereafter to those into whose hands these may\r\n      come, if they should ever see the like dreadful visitation. (1)\r\n      The infection generally came into the houses of the citizens by\r\n      the means of their servants, whom they were obliged to send up\r\n      and down the streets for necessaries; that is to say, for food or\r\n      physic, to bakehouses, brew-houses, shops, &c.; and who going\r\n      necessarily through the streets into shops, markets, and the\r\n      like, it was impossible but that they should, one way or other,\r\n      meet with distempered people, who conveyed the fatal breath into\r\n      them, and they brought it home to the families to which they\r\n      belonged. (2) It was a great mistake that such a great city as\r\n      this had but one pest-house; for had there been, instead of one\r\n      pest-house\xe2\x80\x94viz., beyond Bunhill Fields, where, at most, they\r\n      could receive, perhaps, two hundred or three hundred people\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      say, had there, instead of that one, been several pest-houses,\r\n      every one able to contain a thousand people, without lying two in\r\n      a bed, or two beds in a room; and had every master of a family,\r\n      as soon as any servant especially had been taken sick in his\r\n      house, been obliged to send them to the next pest-house, if they\r\n      were willing, as many were, and had the examiners done the like\r\n      among the poor people when any had been stricken with the\r\n      infection; I say, had this been done where the people were\r\n      willing (not otherwise), and the houses not been shut, I am\r\n      persuaded, and was all the while of that opinion, that not so\r\n      many, by several thousands, had died; for it was observed, and I\r\n      could give several instances within the compass of my own\r\n      knowledge, where a servant had been taken sick, and the family\r\n      had either time to send him out or retire from the house and\r\n      leave the sick person, as I have said above, they had all been\r\n      preserved; whereas when, upon one or more sickening in a family,\r\n      the house has been shut up, the whole family have perished, and\r\n      the bearers been obliged to go in to fetch out the dead bodies,\r\n      not being able to bring them to the door, and at last none left\r\n      to do it.\r\n\r\n      (3) This put it out of question to me, that the calamity was\r\n      spread by infection; that is to say, by some certain steams or\r\n      fumes, which the physicians call effluvia, by the breath, or by\r\n      the sweat, or by the stench of the sores of the sick persons, or\r\n      some other way, perhaps, beyond even the reach of the physicians\r\n      themselves, which effluvia affected the sound who came within\r\n      certain distances of the sick, immediately penetrating the vital\r\n      parts of the said sound persons, putting their blood into an\r\n      immediate ferment, and agitating their spirits to that degree\r\n      which it was found they were agitated; and so those newly\r\n      infected persons communicated it in the same manner to others.\r\n      And this I shall give some instances of, that cannot but convince\r\n      those who seriously consider it; and I cannot but with some\r\n      wonder find some people, now the contagion is over, talk of its\r\n      being an immediate stroke from Heaven, without the agency of\r\n      means, having commission to strike this and that particular\r\n      person, and none other\xe2\x80\x94which I look upon with contempt as the\r\n      effect of manifest ignorance and enthusiasm; likewise the opinion\r\n      of others, who talk of infection being carried on by the air\r\n      only, by carrying with it vast numbers of insects and invisible\r\n      creatures, who enter into the body with the breath, or even at\r\n      the pores with the air, and there generate or emit most acute\r\n      poisons, or poisonous ovae or eggs, which mingle themselves with\r\n      the blood, and so infect the body: a discourse full of learned\r\n      simplicity, and manifested to be so by universal experience; but\r\n      I shall say more to this case in its order.\r\n\r\n      I must here take further notice that nothing was more fatal to\r\n      the inhabitants of this city than the supine negligence of the\r\n      people themselves, who, during the long notice or warning they\r\n      had of the visitation, made no provision for it by laying in\r\n      store of provisions, or of other necessaries, by which they might\r\n      have lived retired and within their own houses, as I have\r\n      observed others did, and who were in a great measure preserved by\r\n      that caution; nor were they, after they were a little hardened to\r\n      it, so shy of conversing with one another, when actually\r\n      infected, as they were at first: no, though they knew it.\r\n\r\n      I acknowledge I was one of those thoughtless ones that had made\r\n      so little provision that my servants were obliged to go out of\r\n      doors to buy every trifle by penny and halfpenny, just as before\r\n      it began, even till my experience showing me the folly, I began\r\n      to be wiser so late that I had scarce time to store myself\r\n      sufficient for our common subsistence for a month.\r\n\r\n      I had in family only an ancient woman that managed the house, a\r\n      maid-servant, two apprentices, and myself; and the plague\r\n      beginning to increase about us, I had many sad thoughts about\r\n      what course I should take, and how I should act. The many dismal\r\n      objects which happened everywhere as I went about the streets,\r\n      had filled my mind with a great deal of horror for fear of the\r\n      distemper, which was indeed very horrible in itself, and in some\r\n      more than in others. The swellings, which were generally in the\r\n      neck or groin, when they grew hard and would not break, grew so\r\n      painful that it was equal to the most exquisite torture; and\r\n      some, not able to bear the torment, threw themselves out at\r\n      windows or shot themselves, or otherwise made themselves away,\r\n      and I saw several dismal objects of that kind. Others, unable to\r\n      contain themselves, vented their pain by incessant roarings, and\r\n      such loud and lamentable cries were to be heard as we walked\r\n      along the streets that would pierce the very heart to think of,\r\n      especially when it was to be considered that the same dreadful\r\n      scourge might be expected every moment to seize upon ourselves.\r\n\r\n      I cannot say but that now I began to faint in my resolutions; my\r\n      heart failed me very much, and sorely I repented of my rashness.\r\n      When I had been out, and met with such terrible things as these I\r\n      have talked of, I say I repented my rashness in venturing to\r\n      abide in town. I wished often that I had not taken upon me to\r\n      stay, but had gone away with my brother and his family.\r\n\r\n      Terrified by those frightful objects, I would retire home\r\n      sometimes and resolve to go out no more; and perhaps I would keep\r\n      those resolutions for three or four days, which time I spent in\r\n      the most serious thankfulness for my preservation and the\r\n      preservation of my family, and the constant confession of my\r\n      sins, giving myself up to God every day, and applying to Him with\r\n      fasting, humiliation, and meditation. Such intervals as I had I\r\n      employed in reading books and in writing down my memorandums of\r\n      what occurred to me every day, and out of which afterwards I took\r\n      most of this work, as it relates to my observations without\r\n      doors. What I wrote of my private meditations I reserve for\r\n      private use, and desire it may not be made public on any account\r\n      whatever.\r\n\r\n      I also wrote other meditations upon divine subjects, such as\r\n      occurred to me at that time and were profitable to myself, but\r\n      not fit for any other view, and therefore I say no more of that.\r\n\r\n      I had a very good friend, a physician, whose name was Heath, whom\r\n      I frequently visited during this dismal time, and to whose advice\r\n      I was very much obliged for many things which he directed me to\r\n      take, by way of preventing the infection when I went out, as he\r\n      found I frequently did, and to hold in my mouth when I was in the\r\n      streets. He also came very often to see me, and as he was a good\r\n      Christian as well as a good physician, his agreeable conversation\r\n      was a very great support to me in the worst of this terrible\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n      It was now the beginning of August, and the plague grew very\r\n      violent and terrible in the place where I lived, and Dr Heath\r\n      coming to visit me, and finding that I ventured so often out in\r\n      the streets, earnestly persuaded me to lock myself up and my\r\n      family, and not to suffer any of us to go out of doors; to keep\r\n      all our windows fast, shutters and curtains close, and never to\r\n      open them; but first, to make a very strong smoke in the room\r\n      where the window or door was to be opened, with rozen and pitch,\r\n      brimstone or gunpowder and the like; and we did this for some\r\n      time; but as I had not laid in a store of provision for such a\r\n      retreat, it was impossible that we could keep within doors\r\n      entirely. However, I attempted, though it was so very late, to do\r\n      something towards it; and first, as I had convenience both for\r\n      brewing and baking, I went and bought two sacks of meal, and for\r\n      several weeks, having an oven, we baked all our own bread; also I\r\n      bought malt, and brewed as much beer as all the casks I had would\r\n      hold, and which seemed enough to serve my house for five or six\r\n      weeks; also I laid in a quantity of salt butter and Cheshire\r\n      cheese; but I had no flesh-meat, and the plague raged so\r\n      violently among the butchers and slaughter-houses on the other\r\n      side of our street, where they are known to dwell in great\r\n      numbers, that it was not advisable so much as to go over the\r\n      street among them.\r\n\r\n      And here I must observe again, that this necessity of going out\r\n      of our houses to buy provisions was in a great measure the ruin\r\n      of the whole city, for the people catched the distemper on these\r\n      occasions one of another, and even the provisions themselves were\r\n      often tainted; at least I have great reason to believe so; and\r\n      therefore I cannot say with satisfaction what I know is repeated\r\n      with great assurance, that the market-people and such as brought\r\n      provisions to town were never infected. I am certain the butchers\r\n      of Whitechappel, where the greatest part of the flesh-meat was\r\n      killed, were dreadfully visited, and that at least to such a\r\n      degree that few of their shops were kept open, and those that\r\n      remained of them killed their meat at Mile End and that way, and\r\n      brought it to market upon horses.\r\n\r\n      However, the poor people could not lay up provisions, and there\r\n      was a necessity that they must go to market to buy, and others to\r\n      send servants or their children; and as this was a necessity\r\n      which renewed itself daily, it brought abundance of unsound\r\n      people to the markets, and a great many that went thither sound\r\n      brought death home with them.\r\n\r\n      It is true people used all possible precaution. When any one\r\n      bought a joint of meat in the market they would not take it off\r\n      the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s hand, but took it off the hooks themselves. On the\r\n      other hand, the butcher would not touch the money, but have it\r\n      put into a pot full of vinegar, which he kept for that purpose.\r\n      The buyer carried always small money to make up any odd sum, that\r\n      they might take no change. They carried bottles of scents and\r\n      perfumes in their hands, and all the means that could be used\r\n      were used, but then the poor could not do even these things, and\r\n      they went at all hazards.\r\n\r\n      Innumerable dismal stories we heard every day on this very\r\n      account. Sometimes a man or woman dropped down dead in the very\r\n      markets, for many people that had the plague upon them knew\r\n      nothing of it till the inward gangrene had affected their vitals,\r\n      and they died in a few moments. This caused that many died\r\n      frequently in that manner in the streets suddenly, without any\r\n      warning; others perhaps had time to go to the next bulk or stall,\r\n      or to any door-porch, and just sit down and die, as I have said\r\n      before.\r\n\r\n      These objects were so frequent in the streets that when the\r\n      plague came to be very raging on one side, there was scarce any\r\n      passing by the streets but that several dead bodies would be\r\n      lying here and there upon the ground. On the other hand, it is\r\n      observable that though at first the people would stop as they\r\n      went along and call to the neighbours to come out on such an\r\n      occasion, yet afterward no notice was taken of them; but that if\r\n      at any time we found a corpse lying, go across the way and not\r\n      come near it; or, if in a narrow lane or passage, go back again\r\n      and seek some other way to go on the business we were upon; and\r\n      in those cases the corpse was always left till the officers had\r\n      notice to come and take them away, or till night, when the\r\n      bearers attending the dead-cart would take them up and carry them\r\n      away. Nor did those undaunted creatures who performed these\r\n      offices fail to search their pockets, and sometimes strip off\r\n      their clothes if they were well dressed, as sometimes they were,\r\n      and carry off what they could get.\r\n\r\n      But to return to the markets. The butchers took that care that if\r\n      any person died in the market they had the officers always at\r\n      hand to take them up upon hand-barrows and carry them to the next\r\n      churchyard; and this was so frequent that such were not entered\r\n      in the weekly bill, \xe2\x80\x98Found dead in the streets or fields\xe2\x80\x99, as is\r\n      the case now, but they went into the general articles of the\r\n      great distemper.\r\n\r\n      But now the fury of the distemper increased to such a degree that\r\n      even the markets were but very thinly furnished with provisions\r\n      or frequented with buyers compared to what they were before; and\r\n      the Lord Mayor caused the country people who brought provisions\r\n      to be stopped in the streets leading into the town, and to sit\r\n      down there with their goods, where they sold what they brought,\r\n      and went immediately away; and this encouraged the country people\r\n      greatly-to do so, for they sold their provisions at the very\r\n      entrances into the town, and even in the fields, as particularly\r\n      in the fields beyond Whitechappel, in Spittlefields; also in St\r\n      George\xe2\x80\x99s Fields in Southwark, in Bunhill Fields, and in a great\r\n      field called Wood\xe2\x80\x99s Close, near Islington. Thither the Lord\r\n      Mayor, aldermen, and magistrates sent their officers and servants\r\n      to buy for their families, themselves keeping within doors as\r\n      much as possible, and the like did many other people; and after\r\n      this method was taken the country people came with great\r\n      cheerfulness, and brought provisions of all sorts, and very\r\n      seldom got any harm, which, I suppose, added also to that report\r\n      of their being miraculously preserved.\r\n\r\n      As for my little family, having thus, as I have said, laid in a\r\n      store of bread, butter, cheese, and beer, I took my friend and\r\n      physician\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and locked myself up, and my family, and\r\n      resolved to suffer the hardship of living a few months without\r\n      flesh-meat, rather than to purchase it at the hazard of our\r\n      lives.\r\n\r\n      But though I confined my family, I could not prevail upon my\r\n      unsatisfied curiosity to stay within entirely myself; and though\r\n      I generally came frighted and terrified home, yet I could not\r\n      restrain; only that indeed I did not do it so frequently as at\r\n      first.\r\n\r\n      I had some little obligations, indeed, upon me to go to my\r\n      brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, which was in Coleman Street parish and which he\r\n      had left to my care, and I went at first every day, but\r\n      afterwards only once or twice a week.\r\n\r\n      In these walks I had many dismal scenes before my eyes, as\r\n      particularly of persons falling dead in the streets, terrible\r\n      shrieks and screechings of women, who, in their agonies, would\r\n      throw open their chamber windows and cry out in a dismal,\r\n      surprising manner. It is impossible to describe the variety of\r\n      postures in which the passions of the poor people would express\r\n      themselves.\r\n\r\n      Passing through Tokenhouse Yard, in Lothbury, of a sudden a\r\n      casement violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave\r\n      three frightful screeches, and then cried, \xe2\x80\x98Oh! death, death,\r\n      death!\xe2\x80\x99 in a most inimitable tone, and which struck me with\r\n      horror and a chillness in my very blood. There was nobody to be\r\n      seen in the whole street, neither did any other window open, for\r\n      people had no curiosity now in any case, nor could anybody help\r\n      one another, so I went on to pass into Bell Alley.\r\n\r\n      Just in Bell Alley, on the right hand of the passage, there was a\r\n      more terrible cry than that, though it was not so directed out at\r\n      the window; but the whole family was in a terrible fright, and I\r\n      could hear women and children run screaming about the rooms like\r\n      distracted, when a garret-window opened and somebody from a\r\n      window on the other side the alley called and asked, \xe2\x80\x98What is the\r\n      matter?\xe2\x80\x99 upon which, from the first window, it was answered, \xe2\x80\x98Oh\r\n      Lord, my old master has hanged himself!\xe2\x80\x99 The other asked again,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Is he quite dead?\xe2\x80\x99 and the first answered, \xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay, quite dead;\r\n      quite dead and cold!\xe2\x80\x99 This person was a merchant and a deputy\r\n      alderman, and very rich. I care not to mention the name, though I\r\n      knew his name too, but that would be an hardship to the family,\r\n      which is now flourishing again.\r\n\r\n      But this is but one; it is scarce credible what dreadful cases\r\n      happened in particular families every day. People in the rage of\r\n      the distemper, or in the torment of their swellings, which was\r\n      indeed intolerable, running out of their own government, raving\r\n      and distracted, and oftentimes laying violent hands upon\r\n      themselves, throwing themselves out at their windows, shooting\r\n      themselves &c.; mothers murdering their own children in their\r\n      lunacy, some dying of mere grief as a passion, some of mere\r\n      fright and surprise without any infection at all, others frighted\r\n      into idiotism and foolish distractions, some into despair and\r\n      lunacy, others into melancholy madness.\r\n\r\n      The pain of the swelling was in particular very violent, and to\r\n      some intolerable; the physicians and surgeons may be said to have\r\n      tortured many poor creatures even to death. The swellings in some\r\n      grew hard, and they applied violent drawing-plaisters or\r\n      poultices to break them, and if these did not do they cut and\r\n      scarified them in a terrible manner. In some those swellings were\r\n      made hard partly by the force of the distemper and partly by\r\n      their being too violently drawn, and were so hard that no\r\n      instrument could cut them, and then they burnt them with\r\n      caustics, so that many died raving mad with the torment, and some\r\n      in the very operation. In these distresses, some, for want of\r\n      help to hold them down in their beds, or to look to them, laid\r\n      hands upon themselves as above. Some broke out into the streets,\r\n      perhaps naked, and would run directly down to the river if they\r\n      were not stopped by the watchman or other officers, and plunge\r\n      themselves into the water wherever they found it.\r\n\r\n      It often pierced my very soul to hear the groans and cries of\r\n      those who were thus tormented, but of the two this was counted\r\n      the most promising particular in the whole infection, for if\r\n      these swellings could be brought to a head, and to break and run,\r\n      or, as the surgeons call it, to digest, the patient generally\r\n      recovered; whereas those who, like the gentlewoman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\r\n      were struck with death at the beginning, and had the tokens come\r\n      out upon them, often went about indifferent easy till a little\r\n      before they died, and some till the moment they dropped down, as\r\n      in apoplexies and epilepsies is often the case. Such would be\r\n      taken suddenly very sick, and would run to a bench or bulk, or\r\n      any convenient place that offered itself, or to their own houses\r\n      if possible, as I mentioned before, and there sit down, grow\r\n      faint, and die. This kind of dying was much the same as it was\r\n      with those who die of common mortifications, who die swooning,\r\n      and, as it were, go away in a dream. Such as died thus had very\r\n      little notice of their being infected at all till the gangrene\r\n      was spread through their whole body; nor could physicians\r\n      themselves know certainly how it was with them till they opened\r\n      their breasts or other parts of their body and saw the tokens.\r\n\r\n      We had at this time a great many frightful stories told us of\r\n      nurses and watchmen who looked after the dying people; that is to\r\n      say, hired nurses who attended infected people, using them\r\n      barbarously, starving them, smothering them, or by other wicked\r\n      means hastening their end, that is to say, murdering of them; and\r\n      watchmen, being set to guard houses that were shut up when there\r\n      has been but one person left, and perhaps that one lying sick,\r\n      that they have broke in and murdered that body, and immediately\r\n      thrown them out into the dead-cart! And so they have gone scarce\r\n      cold to the grave.\r\n\r\n      I cannot say but that some such murders were committed, and I\r\n      think two were sent to prison for it, but died before they could\r\n      be tried; and I have heard that three others, at several times,\r\n      were excused for murders of that kind; but I must say I believe\r\n      nothing of its being so common a crime as some have since been\r\n      pleased to say, nor did it seem to be so rational where the\r\n      people were brought so low as not to be able to help themselves,\r\n      for such seldom recovered, and there was no temptation to commit\r\n      a murder, at least none equal to the fact, where they were sure\r\n      persons would die in so short a time, and could not live.\r\n\r\n      That there were a great many robberies and wicked practices\r\n      committed even in this dreadful time I do not deny. The power of\r\n      avarice was so strong in some that they would run any hazard to\r\n      steal and to plunder; and particularly in houses where all the\r\n      families or inhabitants have been dead and carried out, they\r\n      would break in at all hazards, and without regard to the danger\r\n      of infection, take even the clothes off the dead bodies and the\r\n      bed-clothes from others where they lay dead.\r\n\r\n      This, I suppose, must be the case of a family in Houndsditch,\r\n      where a man and his daughter, the rest of the family being, as I\r\n      suppose, carried away before by the dead-cart, were found stark\r\n      naked, one in one chamber and one in another, lying dead on the\r\n      floor, and the clothes of the beds, from whence \xe2\x80\x99tis supposed\r\n      they were rolled off by thieves, stolen and carried quite away.\r\n\r\n      It is indeed to be observed that the women were in all this\r\n      calamity the most rash, fearless, and desperate creatures, and as\r\n      there were vast numbers that went about as nurses to tend those\r\n      that were sick, they committed a great many petty thieveries in\r\n      the houses where they were employed; and some of them were\r\n      publicly whipped for it, when perhaps they ought rather to have\r\n      been hanged for examples, for numbers of houses were robbed on\r\n      these occasions, till at length the parish officers were sent to\r\n      recommend nurses to the sick, and always took an account whom it\r\n      was they sent, so as that they might call them to account if the\r\n      house had been abused where they were placed.\r\n\r\n      But these robberies extended chiefly to wearing-clothes, linen,\r\n      and what rings or money they could come at when the person died\r\n      who was under their care, but not to a general plunder of the\r\n      houses; and I could give you an account of one of these nurses,\r\n      who, several years after, being on her deathbed, confessed with\r\n      the utmost horror the robberies she had committed at the time of\r\n      her being a nurse, and by which she had enriched herself to a\r\n      great degree. But as for murders, I do not find that there was\r\n      ever any proof of the facts in the manner as it has been\r\n      reported, except as above.\r\n\r\n      They did tell me, indeed, of a nurse in one place that laid a wet\r\n      cloth upon the face of a dying patient whom she tended, and so\r\n      put an end to his life, who was just expiring before; and another\r\n      that smothered a young woman she was looking to when she was in a\r\n      fainting fit, and would have come to herself; some that killed\r\n      them by giving them one thing, some another, and some starved\r\n      them by giving them nothing at all. But these stories had two\r\n      marks of suspicion that always attended them, which caused me\r\n      always to slight them and to look on them as mere stories that\r\n      people continually frighted one another with. First, that\r\n      wherever it was that we heard it, they always placed the scene at\r\n      the farther end of the town, opposite or most remote from where\r\n      you were to hear it. If you heard it in Whitechappel, it had\r\n      happened at St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s, or at Westminster, or Holborn, or that\r\n      end of the town. If you heard of it at that end of the town, then\r\n      it was done in Whitechappel, or the Minories, or about\r\n      Cripplegate parish. If you heard of it in the city, why, then it\r\n      happened in Southwark; and if you heard of it in Southwark, then\r\n      it was done in the city, and the like.\r\n\r\n      In the next place, of what part soever you heard the story, the\r\n      particulars were always the same, especially that of laying a wet\r\n      double cloth on a dying man\xe2\x80\x99s face, and that of smothering a\r\n      young gentlewoman; so that it was apparent, at least to my\r\n      judgement, that there was more of tale than of truth in those\r\n      things.\r\n\r\n      However, I cannot say but it had some effect upon the people, and\r\n      particularly that, as I said before, they grew more cautious whom\r\n      they took into their houses, and whom they trusted their lives\r\n      with, and had them always recommended if they could; and where\r\n      they could not find such, for they were not very plenty, they\r\n      applied to the parish officers.\r\n\r\n      But here again the misery of that time lay upon the poor who,\r\n      being infected, had neither food or physic, neither physician or\r\n      apothecary to assist them, or nurse to attend them. Many of those\r\n      died calling for help, and even for sustenance, out at their\r\n      windows in a most miserable and deplorable manner; but it must be\r\n      added that whenever the cases of such persons or families were\r\n      represented to my Lord Mayor they always were relieved.\r\n\r\n      It is true, in some houses where the people were not very poor,\r\n      yet where they had sent perhaps their wives and children away,\r\n      and if they had any servants they had been dismissed;\xe2\x80\x94I say it is\r\n      true that to save the expenses, many such as these shut\r\n      themselves in, and not having help, died alone.\r\n\r\n      A neighbour and acquaintance of mine, having some money owing to\r\n      him from a shopkeeper in Whitecross Street or thereabouts, sent\r\n      his apprentice, a youth about eighteen years of age, to endeavour\r\n      to get the money. He came to the door, and finding it shut,\r\n      knocked pretty hard; and, as he thought, heard somebody answer\r\n      within, but was not sure, so he waited, and after some stay\r\n      knocked again, and then a third time, when he heard somebody\r\n      coming downstairs.\r\n\r\n      At length the man of the house came to the door; he had on his\r\n      breeches or drawers, and a yellow flannel waistcoat, no\r\n      stockings, a pair of slipped-shoes, a white cap on his head, and,\r\n      as the young man said, \xe2\x80\x98death in his face\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n      When he opened the door, says he, \xe2\x80\x98What do you disturb me thus\r\n      for?\xe2\x80\x99 The boy, though a little surprised, replied, \xe2\x80\x98I come from\r\n      such a one, and my master sent me for the money which he says you\r\n      know of.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very well, child,\xe2\x80\x99 returns the living ghost; \xe2\x80\x98call as\r\n      you go by at Cripplegate Church, and bid them ring the bell\xe2\x80\x99; and\r\n      with these words shut the door again, and went up again, and died\r\n      the same day; nay, perhaps the same hour. This the young man told\r\n      me himself, and I have reason to believe it. This was while the\r\n      plague was not come to a height. I think it was in June, towards\r\n      the latter end of the month; it must be before the dead-carts\r\n      came about, and while they used the ceremony of ringing the bell\r\n      for the dead, which was over for certain, in that parish at\r\n      least, before the month of July, for by the 25th of July there\r\n      died 550 and upwards in a week, and then they could no more bury\r\n      in form, rich or poor.\r\n\r\n      I have mentioned above that notwithstanding this dreadful\r\n      calamity, yet the numbers of thieves were abroad upon all\r\n      occasions, where they had found any prey, and that these were\r\n      generally women. It was one morning about eleven O\xe2\x80\x99clock, I had\r\n      walked out to my brother\xe2\x80\x99s house in Coleman Street parish, as I\r\n      often did, to see that all was safe.\r\n\r\n      My brother\xe2\x80\x99s house had a little court before it, and a brick wall\r\n      and a gate in it, and within that several warehouses where his\r\n      goods of several sorts lay. It happened that in one of these\r\n      warehouses were several packs of women\xe2\x80\x99s high-crowned hats, which\r\n      came out of the country and were, as I suppose, for exportation:\r\n      whither, I know not.\r\n\r\n      I was surprised that when I came near my brother\xe2\x80\x99s door, which\r\n      was in a place they called Swan Alley, I met three or four women\r\n      with high-crowned hats on their heads; and, as I remembered\r\n      afterwards, one, if not more, had some hats likewise in their\r\n      hands; but as I did not see them come out at my brother\xe2\x80\x99s door,\r\n      and not knowing that my brother had any such goods in his\r\n      warehouse, I did not offer to say anything to them, but went\r\n      across the way to shun meeting them, as was usual to do at that\r\n      time, for fear of the plague. But when I came nearer to the gate\r\n      I met another woman with more hats come out of the gate. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\n      business, mistress,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98have you had there?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98There are\r\n      more people there,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98I have had no more business there\r\n      than they.\xe2\x80\x99 I was hasty to get to the gate then, and said no more\r\n      to her, by which means she got away. But just as I came to the\r\n      gate, I saw two more coming across the yard to come out with hats\r\n      also on their heads and under their arms, at which I threw the\r\n      gate to behind me, which having a spring lock fastened itself;\r\n      and turning to the women, \xe2\x80\x98Forsooth,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98what are you doing\r\n      here?\xe2\x80\x99 and seized upon the hats, and took them from them. One of\r\n      them, who, I confess, did not look like a thief\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\n      she, \xe2\x80\x98we are wrong, but we were told they were goods that had no\r\n      owner. Be pleased to take them again; and look yonder, there are\r\n      more such customers as we.\xe2\x80\x99 She cried and looked pitifully, so I\r\n      took the hats from her and opened the gate, and bade them be\r\n      gone, for I pitied the women indeed; but when I looked towards\r\n      the warehouse, as she directed, there were six or seven more, all\r\n      women, fitting themselves with hats as unconcerned and quiet as\r\n      if they had been at a hatter\xe2\x80\x99s shop buying for their money.\r\n\r\n      I was surprised, not at the sight of so many thieves only, but at\r\n      the circumstances I was in; being now to thrust myself in among\r\n      so many people, who for some weeks had been so shy of myself that\r\n      if I met anybody in the street I would cross the way from them.\r\n\r\n      They were equally surprised, though on another account. They all\r\n      told me they were neighbours, that they had heard anyone might\r\n      take them, that they were nobody\xe2\x80\x99s goods, and the like. I talked\r\n      big to them at first, went back to the gate and took out the key,\r\n      so that they were all my prisoners, threatened to lock them all\r\n      into the warehouse, and go and fetch my Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s officers for\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n      They begged heartily, protested they found the gate open, and the\r\n      warehouse door open; and that it had no doubt been broken open by\r\n      some who expected to find goods of greater value: which indeed\r\n      was reasonable to believe, because the lock was broke, and a\r\n      padlock that hung to the door on the outside also loose, and an\r\n      abundance of the hats carried away.\r\n\r\n      At length I considered that this was not a time to be cruel and\r\n      rigorous; and besides that, it would necessarily oblige me to go\r\n      much about, to have several people come to me, and I go to\r\n      several whose circumstances of health I knew nothing of; and that\r\n      even at this time the plague was so high as that there died 4000\r\n      a week; so that in showing my resentment, or even in seeking\r\n      justice for my brother\xe2\x80\x99s goods, I might lose my own life; so I\r\n      contented myself with taking the names and places where some of\r\n      them lived, who were really inhabitants in the neighbourhood, and\r\n      threatening that my brother should call them to an account for it\r\n      when he returned to his habitation.\r\n\r\n      Then I talked a little upon another foot with them, and asked\r\n      them how they could do such things as these in a time of such\r\n      general calamity, and, as it were, in the face of God\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\n      dreadful judgements, when the plague was at their very doors,\r\n      and, it may be, in their very houses, and they did not know but\r\n      that the dead-cart might stop at their doors in a few hours to\r\n      carry them to their graves.\r\n\r\n      I could not perceive that my discourse made much impression upon\r\n      them all that while, till it happened that there came two men of\r\n      the neighbourhood, hearing of the disturbance, and knowing my\r\n      brother, for they had been both dependents upon his family, and\r\n      they came to my assistance. These being, as I said, neighbours,\r\n      presently knew three of the women and told me who they were and\r\n      where they lived; and it seems they had given me a true account\r\n      of themselves before.\r\n\r\n      This brings these two men to a further remembrance. The name of\r\n      one was John Hayward, who was at that time undersexton of the\r\n      parish of St Stephen, Coleman Street. By undersexton was\r\n      understood at that time gravedigger and bearer of the dead. This\r\n      man carried, or assisted to carry, all the dead to their graves\r\n      which were buried in that large parish, and who were carried in\r\n      form; and after that form of burying was stopped, went with the\r\n      dead-cart and the bell to fetch the dead bodies from the houses\r\n      where they lay, and fetched many of them out of the chambers and\r\n      houses; for the parish was, and is still, remarkable\r\n      particularly, above all the parishes in London, for a great\r\n      number of alleys and thoroughfares, very long, into which no\r\n      carts could come, and where they were obliged to go and fetch the\r\n      bodies a very long way; which alleys now remain to witness it,\r\n      such as White\xe2\x80\x99s Alley, Cross Key Court, Swan Alley, Bell Alley,\r\n      White Horse Alley, and many more. Here they went with a kind of\r\n      hand-barrow and laid the dead bodies on it, and carried them out\r\n      to the carts; which work he performed and never had the distemper\r\n      at all, but lived about twenty years after it, and was sexton of\r\n      the parish to the time of his death. His wife at the same time\r\n      was a nurse to infected people, and tended many that died in the\r\n      parish, being for her honesty recommended by the parish officers;\r\n      yet she never was infected neither.\r\n\r\n      He never used any preservative against the infection, other than\r\n      holding garlic and rue in his mouth, and smoking tobacco. This I\r\n      also had from his own mouth. And his wife\xe2\x80\x99s remedy was washing\r\n      her head in vinegar and sprinkling her head-clothes so with\r\n      vinegar as to keep them always moist, and if the smell of any of\r\n      those she waited on was more than ordinary offensive, she snuffed\r\n      vinegar up her nose and sprinkled vinegar upon her head-clothes,\r\n      and held a handkerchief wetted with vinegar to her mouth.\r\n\r\n      It must be confessed that though the plague was chiefly among the\r\n      poor, yet were the poor the most venturous and fearless of it,\r\n      and went about their employment with a sort of brutal courage; I\r\n      must call it so, for it was founded neither on religion nor\r\n      prudence; scarce did they use any caution, but ran into any\r\n      business which they could get employment in, though it was the\r\n      most hazardous. Such was that of tending the sick, watching\r\n      houses shut up, carrying infected persons to the pest-house, and,\r\n      which was still worse, carrying the dead away to their graves.\r\n\r\n      It was under this John Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s care, and within his bounds,\r\n      that the story of the piper, with which people have made\r\n      themselves so merry, happened, and he assured me that it was\r\n      true. It is said that it was a blind piper; but, as John told me,\r\n      the fellow was not blind, but an ignorant, weak, poor man, and\r\n      usually walked his rounds about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night and went\r\n      piping along from door to door, and the people usually took him\r\n      in at public-houses where they knew him, and would give him drink\r\n      and victuals, and sometimes farthings; and he in return would\r\n      pipe and sing and talk simply, which diverted the people; and\r\n      thus he lived. It was but a very bad time for this diversion\r\n      while things were as I have told, yet the poor fellow went about\r\n      as usual, but was almost starved; and when anybody asked how he\r\n      did he would answer, the dead cart had not taken him yet, but\r\n      that they had promised to call for him next week.\r\n\r\n      It happened one night that this poor fellow, whether somebody had\r\n      given him too much drink or no\xe2\x80\x94John Hayward said he had not drink\r\n      in his house, but that they had given him a little more victuals\r\n      than ordinary at a public-house in Coleman Street\xe2\x80\x94and the poor\r\n      fellow, having not usually had a bellyful for perhaps not a good\r\n      while, was laid all along upon the top of a bulk or stall, and\r\n      fast asleep, at a door in the street near London Wall, towards\r\n      Cripplegate-, and that upon the same bulk or stall the people of\r\n      some house, in the alley of which the house was a corner, hearing\r\n      a bell which they always rang before the cart came, had laid a\r\n      body really dead of the plague just by him, thinking, too, that\r\n      this poor fellow had been a dead body, as the other was, and laid\r\n      there by some of the neighbours.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, when John Hayward with his bell and the cart came\r\n      along, finding two dead bodies lie upon the stall, they took them\r\n      up with the instrument they used and threw them into the cart,\r\n      and, all this while the piper slept soundly.\r\n\r\n      From hence they passed along and took in other dead bodies, till,\r\n      as honest John Hayward told me, they almost buried him alive in\r\n      the cart; yet all this while he slept soundly. At length the cart\r\n      came to the place where the bodies were to be thrown into the\r\n      ground, which, as I do remember, was at Mount Mill; and as the\r\n      cart usually stopped some time before they were ready to shoot\r\n      out the melancholy load they had in it, as soon as the cart\r\n      stopped the fellow awaked and struggled a little to get his head\r\n      out from among the dead bodies, when, raising himself up in the\r\n      cart, he called out, \xe2\x80\x98Hey! where am I?\xe2\x80\x99 This frighted the fellow\r\n      that attended about the work; but after some pause John Hayward,\r\n      recovering himself, said, \xe2\x80\x98Lord, bless us! There\xe2\x80\x99s somebody in\r\n      the cart not quite dead!\xe2\x80\x99 So another called to him and said, \xe2\x80\x98Who\r\n      are you?\xe2\x80\x99 The fellow answered, \xe2\x80\x98I am the poor piper. Where am I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Where are you?\xe2\x80\x99 says Hayward. \xe2\x80\x98Why, you are in the dead-cart,\r\n      and we are going to bury you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But I an\xe2\x80\x99t dead though, am I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      says the piper, which made them laugh a little though, as John\r\n      said, they were heartily frighted at first; so they helped the\r\n      poor fellow down, and he went about his business.\r\n\r\n      I know the story goes he set up his pipes in the cart and\r\n      frighted the bearers and others so that they ran away; but John\r\n      Hayward did not tell the story so, nor say anything of his piping\r\n      at all; but that he was a poor piper, and that he was carried\r\n      away as above I am fully satisfied of the truth of.\r\n\r\n      It is to be noted here that the dead-carts in the city were not\r\n      confined to particular parishes, but one cart went through\r\n      several parishes, according as the number of dead presented; nor\r\n      were they tied to carry the dead to their respective parishes,\r\n      but many of the dead taken up in the city were carried to the\r\n      burying-ground in the out-parts for want of room.\r\n\r\n      I have already mentioned the surprise that this judgement was at\r\n      first among the people. I must be allowed to give some of my\r\n      observations on the more serious and religious part. Surely never\r\n      city, at least of this bulk and magnitude, was taken in a\r\n      condition so perfectly unprepared for such a dreadful visitation,\r\n      whether I am to speak of the civil preparations or religious.\r\n      They were, indeed, as if they had had no warning, no expectation,\r\n      no apprehensions, and consequently the least provision imaginable\r\n      was made for it in a public way. For example, the Lord Mayor and\r\n      sheriffs had made no provision as magistrates for the regulations\r\n      which were to be observed. They had gone into no measures for\r\n      relief of the poor. The citizens had no public magazines or\r\n      storehouses for corn or meal for the subsistence of the poor,\r\n      which if they had provided themselves, as in such cases is done\r\n      abroad, many miserable families who were now reduced to the\r\n      utmost distress would have been relieved, and that in a better\r\n      manner than now could be done.\r\n\r\n      The stock of the city\xe2\x80\x99s money I can say but little to. The\r\n      Chamber of London was said to be exceedingly rich, and it may be\r\n      concluded that they were so, by the vast of money issued from\r\n      thence in the rebuilding the public edifices after the fire of\r\n      London, and in building new works, such as, for the first part,\r\n      the Guildhall, Blackwell Hall, part of Leadenhall, half the\r\n      Exchange, the Session House, the Compter, the prisons of Ludgate,\r\n      Newgate, &c., several of the wharfs and stairs and landing-places\r\n      on the river; all which were either burned down or damaged by the\r\n      great fire of London, the next year after the plague; and of the\r\n      second sort, the Monument, Fleet Ditch with its bridges, and the\r\n      Hospital of Bethlem or Bedlam, &c. But possibly the managers of\r\n      the city\xe2\x80\x99s credit at that time made more conscience of breaking\r\n      in upon the orphan\xe2\x80\x99s money to show charity to the distressed\r\n      citizens than the managers in the following years did to beautify\r\n      the city and re-edify the buildings; though, in the first case,\r\n      the losers would have thought their fortunes better bestowed, and\r\n      the public faith of the city have been less subjected to scandal\r\n      and reproach.\r\n\r\n      It must be acknowledged that the absent citizens, who, though\r\n      they were fled for safety into the country, were yet greatly\r\n      interested in the welfare of those whom they left behind, forgot\r\n      not to contribute liberally to the relief of the poor, and large\r\n      sums were also collected among trading towns in the remotest\r\n      parts of England; and, as I have heard also, the nobility and the\r\n      gentry in all parts of England took the deplorable condition of\r\n      the city into their consideration, and sent up large sums of\r\n      money in charity to the Lord Mayor and magistrates for the relief\r\n      of the poor. The king also, as I was told, ordered a thousand\r\n      pounds a week to be distributed in four parts: one quarter to the\r\n      city and liberty of Westminster; one quarter or part among the\r\n      inhabitants of the Southwark side of the water; one quarter to\r\n      the liberty and parts within of the city, exclusive of the city\r\n      within the walls; and one-fourth part to the suburbs in the\r\n      county of Middlesex, and the east and north parts of the city.\r\n      But this latter I only speak of as a report.\r\n\r\n      Certain it is, the greatest part of the poor or families who\r\n      formerly lived by their labour, or by retail trade, lived now on\r\n      charity; and had there not been prodigious sums of money given by\r\n      charitable, well-minded Christians for the support of such, the\r\n      city could never have subsisted. There were, no question,\r\n      accounts kept of their charity, and of the just distribution of\r\n      it by the magistrates. But as such multitudes of those very\r\n      officers died through whose hands it was distributed, and also\r\n      that, as I have been told, most of the accounts of those things\r\n      were lost in the great fire which happened in the very next year,\r\n      and which burnt even the chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s office and many of their\r\n      papers, so I could never come at the particular account, which I\r\n      used great endeavours to have seen.\r\n\r\n      It may, however, be a direction in case of the approach of a like\r\n      visitation, which God keep the city from;\xe2\x80\x94I say, it may be of use\r\n      to observe that by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen at\r\n      that time in distributing weekly great sums of money for relief\r\n      of the poor, a multitude of people who would otherwise have\r\n      perished, were relieved, and their lives preserved. And here let\r\n      me enter into a brief state of the case of the poor at that time,\r\n      and what way apprehended from them, from whence may be judged\r\n      hereafter what may be expected if the like distress should come\r\n      upon the city.\r\n\r\n      At the beginning of the plague, when there was now no more hope\r\n      but that the whole city would be visited; when, as I have said,\r\n      all that had friends or estates in the country retired with their\r\n      families; and when, indeed, one would have thought the very city\r\n      itself was running out of the gates, and that there would be\r\n      nobody left behind; you may be sure from that hour all trade,\r\n      except such as related to immediate subsistence, was, as it were,\r\n      at a full stop.\r\n\r\n      This is so lively a case, and contains in it so much of the real\r\n      condition of the people, that I think I cannot be too particular\r\n      in it, and therefore I descend to the several arrangements or\r\n      classes of people who fell into immediate distress upon this\r\n      occasion. For example:\r\n\r\n      1. All master-workmen in manufactures, especially such as\r\n      belonged to ornament and the less necessary parts of the people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      dress, clothes, and furniture for houses, such as riband-weavers\r\n      and other weavers, gold and silver lace makers, and gold and\r\n      silver wire drawers, sempstresses, milliners, shoemakers,\r\n      hatmakers, and glovemakers; also upholsterers, joiners,\r\n      cabinet-makers, looking-glass makers, and innumerable trades\r\n      which depend upon such as these;\xe2\x80\x94I say, the master-workmen in\r\n      such stopped their work, dismissed their journeymen and workmen,\r\n      and all their dependents.\r\n\r\n      2. As merchandising was at a full stop, for very few ships\r\n      ventured to come up the river and none at all went out, so all\r\n      the extraordinary officers of the customs, likewise the watermen,\r\n      carmen, porters, and all the poor whose labour depended upon the\r\n      merchants, were at once dismissed and put out of business.\r\n\r\n      3. All the tradesmen usually employed in building or repairing of\r\n      houses were at a full stop, for the people were far from wanting\r\n      to build houses when so many thousand houses were at once\r\n      stripped of their inhabitants; so that this one article turned\r\n      all the ordinary workmen of that kind out of business, such as\r\n      bricklayers, masons, carpenters, joiners, plasterers, painters,\r\n      glaziers, smiths, plumbers, and all the labourers depending on\r\n      such.\r\n\r\n      4. As navigation was at a stop, our ships neither coming in or\r\n      going out as before, so the seamen were all out of employment,\r\n      and many of them in the last and lowest degree of distress; and\r\n      with the seamen were all the several tradesmen and workmen\r\n      belonging to and depending upon the building and fitting out of\r\n      ships, such as ship-carpenters, caulkers, ropemakers, dry\r\n      coopers, sailmakers, anchorsmiths, and other smiths; blockmakers,\r\n      carvers, gunsmiths, ship-chandlers, ship-carvers, and the like.\r\n      The masters of those perhaps might live upon their substance, but\r\n      the traders were universally at a stop, and consequently all\r\n      their workmen discharged. Add to these that the river was in a\r\n      manner without boats, and all or most part of the watermen,\r\n      lightermen, boat-builders, and lighter-builders in like manner\r\n      idle and laid by.\r\n\r\n      5. All families retrenched their living as much as possible, as\r\n      well those that fled as those that stayed; so that an innumerable\r\n      multitude of footmen, serving-men, shopkeepers, journeymen,\r\n      merchants\xe2\x80\x99 bookkeepers, and such sort of people, and especially\r\n      poor maid-servants, were turned off, and left friendless and\r\n      helpless, without employment and without habitation, and this was\r\n      really a dismal article.\r\n\r\n      I might be more particular as to this part, but it may suffice to\r\n      mention in general, all trades being stopped, employment ceased:\r\n      the labour, and by that the bread, of the poor were cut off; and\r\n      at first indeed the cries of the poor were most lamentable to\r\n      hear, though by the distribution of charity their misery that way\r\n      was greatly abated. Many indeed fled into the counties, but\r\n      thousands of them having stayed in London till nothing but\r\n      desperation sent them away, death overtook them on the road, and\r\n      they served for no better than the messengers of death; indeed,\r\n      others carrying the infection along with them, spread it very\r\n      unhappily into the remotest parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n      Many of these were the miserable objects of despair which I have\r\n      mentioned before, and were removed by the destruction which\r\n      followed. These might be said to perish not by the infection\r\n      itself but by the consequence of it; indeed, namely, by hunger\r\n      and distress and the want of all things: being without lodging,\r\n      without money, without friends, without means to get their bread,\r\n      or without anyone to give it them; for many of them were without\r\n      what we call legal settlements, and so could not claim of the\r\n      parishes, and all the support they had was by application to the\r\n      magistrates for relief, which relief was (to give the magistrates\r\n      their due) carefully and cheerfully administered as they found it\r\n      necessary, and those that stayed behind never felt the want and\r\n      distress of that kind which they felt who went away in the manner\r\n      above noted.\r\n\r\n      Let any one who is acquainted with what multitudes of people get\r\n      their daily bread in this city by their labour, whether\r\n      artificers or mere workmen\xe2\x80\x94I say, let any man consider what must\r\n      be the miserable condition of this town if, on a sudden, they\r\n      should be all turned out of employment, that labour should cease,\r\n      and wages for work be no more.\r\n\r\n      This was the case with us at that time; and had not the sums of\r\n      money contributed in charity by well-disposed people of every\r\n      kind, as well abroad as at home, been prodigiously great, it had\r\n      not been in the power of the Lord Mayor and sheriffs to have kept\r\n      the public peace. Nor were they without apprehensions, as it was,\r\n      that desperation should push the people upon tumults, and cause\r\n      them to rifle the houses of rich men and plunder the markets of\r\n      provisions; in which case the country people, who brought\r\n      provisions very freely and boldly to town, would have been\r\n      terrified from coming any more, and the town would have sunk\r\n      under an unavoidable famine.\r\n\r\n      But the prudence of my Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen\r\n      within the city, and of the justices of peace in the out-parts,\r\n      was such, and they were supported with money from all parts so\r\n      well, that the poor people were kept quiet, and their wants\r\n      everywhere relieved, as far as was possible to be done.\r\n\r\n      Two things besides this contributed to prevent the mob doing any\r\n      mischief. One was, that really the rich themselves had not laid\r\n      up stores of provisions in their houses as indeed they ought to\r\n      have done, and which if they had been wise enough to have done,\r\n      and locked themselves entirely up, as some few did, they had\r\n      perhaps escaped the disease better. But as it appeared they had\r\n      not, so the mob had no notion of finding stores of provisions\r\n      there if they had broken in as it is plain they were sometimes\r\n      very near doing, and which: if they had, they had finished the\r\n      ruin of the whole city, for there were no regular troops to have\r\n      withstood them, nor could the trained bands have been brought\r\n      together to defend the city, no men being to be found to bear\r\n      arms.\r\n\r\n      But the vigilance of the Lord Mayor and such magistrates as could\r\n      be had (for some, even of the aldermen, were dead, and some\r\n      absent) prevented this; and they did it by the most kind and\r\n      gentle methods they could think of, as particularly by relieving\r\n      the most desperate with money, and putting others into business,\r\n      and particularly that employment of watching houses that were\r\n      infected and shut up. And as the number of these were very great\r\n      (for it was said there was at one time ten thousand houses shut\r\n      up, and every house had two watchmen to guard it, viz., one by\r\n      night and the other by day), this gave opportunity to employ a\r\n      very great number of poor men at a time.\r\n\r\n      The women and servants that were turned off from their places\r\n      were likewise employed as nurses to tend the sick in all places,\r\n      and this took off a very great number of them.\r\n\r\n      And, which though a melancholy article in itself, yet was a\r\n      deliverance in its kind: namely, the plague, which raged in a\r\n      dreadful manner from the middle of August to the middle of\r\n      October, carried off in that time thirty or forty thousand of\r\n      these very people which, had they been left, would certainly have\r\n      been an insufferable burden by their poverty; that is to say, the\r\n      whole city could not have supported the expense of them, or have\r\n      provided food for them; and they would in time have been even\r\n      driven to the necessity of plundering either the city itself or\r\n      the country adjacent, to have subsisted themselves, which would\r\n      first or last have put the whole nation, as well as the city,\r\n      into the utmost terror and confusion.\r\n\r\n      It was observable, then, that this calamity of the people made\r\n      them very humble; for now for about nine weeks together there\r\n      died near a thousand a day, one day with another, even by the\r\n      account of the weekly bills, which yet, I have reason to be\r\n      assured, never gave a full account, by many thousands; the\r\n      confusion being such, and the carts working in the dark when they\r\n      carried the dead, that in some places no account at all was kept,\r\n      but they worked on, the clerks and sextons not attending for\r\n      weeks together, and not knowing what number they carried. This\r\n      account is verified by the following bills of mortality:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n -                        Of all of the\r\n     -                        Diseases.

I observed often that in the\r\n      parishes of Aldgate and Cripplegate, Whitechappel and Stepney,\r\n      there were five, six, seven, and eight hundred in a week in the\r\n      bills; whereas if we may believe the opinion of those that lived\r\n      in the city all the time as well as I, there died sometimes 2000\r\n      a week in those parishes; and I saw it under the hand of one that\r\n      made as strict an examination into that part as he could, that\r\n      there really died an hundred thousand people of the plague in\r\n      that one year whereas in the bills, the articles of the plague,\r\n      it was but 68,590.\r\n\r\n      If I may be allowed to give my opinion, by what I saw with my\r\n      eyes and heard from other people that were eye-witnesses, I do\r\n      verily believe the same, viz., that there died at least 100,000\r\n      of the plague only, besides other distempers and besides those\r\n      which died in the fields and highways and secret Places out of\r\n      the compass of the communication, as it was called, and who were\r\n      not put down in the bills though they really belonged to the body\r\n      of the inhabitants. It was known to us all that abundance of poor\r\n      despairing creatures who had the distemper upon them, and were\r\n      grown stupid or melancholy by their misery, as many were,\r\n      wandered away into the fields and Woods, and into secret uncouth\r\n      places almost anywhere, to creep into a bush or hedge and die.\r\n\r\n      The inhabitants of the villages adjacent would, in pity, carry\r\n      them food and set it at a distance, that they might fetch it, if\r\n      they were able; and sometimes they were not able, and the next\r\n      time they went they should find the poor wretches lie dead and\r\n      the food untouched. The number of these miserable objects were\r\n      many, and I know so many that perished thus, and so exactly\r\n      where, that I believe I could go to the very place and dig their\r\n      bones up still; for the country people would go and dig a hole at\r\n      a distance from them, and then with long poles, and hooks at the\r\n      end of them, drag the bodies into these pits, and then throw the\r\n      earth in from as far as they could cast it, to cover them, taking\r\n      notice how the wind blew, and so coming on that side which the\r\n      seamen call to windward, that the scent of the bodies might blow\r\n      from them; and thus great numbers went out of the world who were\r\n      never known, or any account of them taken, as well within the\r\n      bills of mortality as without.\r\n\r\n      This, indeed, I had in the main only from the relation of others,\r\n      for I seldom walked into the fields, except towards Bethnal Green\r\n      and Hackney, or as hereafter. But when I did walk, I always saw a\r\n      great many poor wanderers at a distance; but I could know little\r\n      of their cases, for whether it were in the street or in the\r\n      fields, if we had seen anybody coming, it was a general method to\r\n      walk away; yet I believe the account is exactly true.\r\n\r\n      As this puts me upon mentioning my walking the streets and\r\n      fields, I cannot omit taking notice what a desolate place the\r\n      city was at that time. The great street I lived in (which is\r\n      known to be one of the broadest of all the streets of London, I\r\n      mean of the suburbs as well as the liberties) all the side where\r\n      the butchers lived, especially without the bars, was more like a\r\n      green field than a paved street, and the people generally went in\r\n      the middle with the horses and carts. It is true that the\r\n      farthest end towards Whitechappel Church was not all paved, but\r\n      even the part that was paved was full of grass also; but this\r\n      need not seem strange, since the great streets within the city,\r\n      such as Leadenhall Street, Bishopsgate Street, Cornhill, and even\r\n      the Exchange itself, had grass growing in them in several places;\r\n      neither cart or coach were seen in the streets from morning to\r\n      evening, except some country carts to bring roots and beans, or\r\n      peas, hay, and straw, to the market, and those but very few\r\n      compared to what was usual. As for coaches, they were scarce used\r\n      but to carry sick people to the pest-house, and to other\r\n      hospitals, and some few to carry physicians to such places as\r\n      they thought fit to venture to visit; for really coaches were\r\n      dangerous things, and people did not care to venture into them,\r\n      because they did not know who might have been carried in them\r\n      last, and sick, infected people were, as I have said, ordinarily\r\n      carried in them to the pest-houses, and sometimes people expired\r\n      in them as they went along.\r\n\r\n      It is true, when the infection came to such a height as I have\r\n      now mentioned, there were very few physicians which cared to stir\r\n      abroad to sick houses, and very many of the most eminent of the\r\n      faculty were dead, as well as the surgeons also; for now it was\r\n      indeed a dismal time, and for about a month together, not taking\r\n      any notice of the bills of mortality, I believe there did not die\r\n      less than 1500 or 1700 a day, one day with another.\r\n\r\n      One of the worst days we had in the whole time, as I thought, was\r\n      in the beginning of September, when, indeed, good people began to\r\n      think that God was resolved to make a full end of the people in\r\n      this miserable city. This was at that time when the plague was\r\n      fully come into the eastern parishes. The parish of Aldgate, if I\r\n      may give my opinion, buried above a thousand a week for two\r\n      weeks, though the bills did not say so many;\xe2\x80\x94but it surrounded me\r\n      at so dismal a rate that there was not a house in twenty\r\n      uninfected in the Minories, in Houndsditch, and in those parts of\r\n      Aldgate parish about the Butcher Row and the alleys over against\r\n      me. I say, in those places death reigned in every corner.\r\n      Whitechappel parish was in the same condition, and though much\r\n      less than the parish I lived in, yet buried near 600 a week by\r\n      the bills, and in my opinion near twice as many. Whole families,\r\n      and indeed whole streets of families, were swept away together;\r\n      insomuch that it was frequent for neighbours to call to the\r\n      bellman to go to such-and-such houses and fetch out the people,\r\n      for that they were all dead.\r\n\r\n      And, indeed, the work of removing the dead bodies by carts was\r\n      now grown so very odious and dangerous that it was complained of\r\n      that the bearers did not take care to clear such houses where all\r\n      the inhabitants were dead, but that sometimes the bodies lay\r\n      several days unburied, till the neighbouring families were\r\n      offended with the stench, and consequently infected; and this\r\n      neglect of the officers was such that the churchwardens and\r\n      constables were summoned to look after it, and even the justices\r\n      of the Hamlets were obliged to venture their lives among them to\r\n      quicken and encourage them, for innumerable of the bearers died\r\n      of the distemper, infected by the bodies they were obliged to\r\n      come so near. And had it not been that the number of poor people\r\n      who wanted employment and wanted bread (as I have said before)\r\n      was so great that necessity drove them to undertake anything and\r\n      venture anything, they would never have found people to be\r\n      employed. And then the bodies of the dead would have lain above\r\n      ground, and have perished and rotted in a dreadful manner.\r\n\r\n      But the magistrates cannot be enough commended in this, that they\r\n      kept such good order for the burying of the dead, that as fast as\r\n      any of these they employed to carry off and bury the dead fell\r\n      sick or died, as was many times the case, they immediately\r\n      supplied the places with others, which, by reason of the great\r\n      number of poor that was left out of business, as above, was not\r\n      hard to do. This occasioned, that notwithstanding the infinite\r\n      number of people which died and were sick, almost all together,\r\n      yet they were always cleared away and carried off every night, so\r\n      that it was never to be said of London that the living were not\r\n      able to bury the dead.\r\n\r\n      As the desolation was greater during those terrible times, so the\r\n      amazement of the people increased, and a thousand unaccountable\r\n      things they would do in the violence of their fright, as others\r\n      did the same in the agonies of their distemper, and this part was\r\n      very affecting. Some went roaring and crying and wringing their\r\n      hands along the street; some would go praying and lifting up\r\n      their hands to heaven, calling upon God for mercy. I cannot say,\r\n      indeed, whether this was not in their distraction, but, be it so,\r\n      it was still an indication of a more serious mind, when they had\r\n      the use of their senses, and was much better, even as it was,\r\n      than the frightful yellings and cryings that every day, and\r\n      especially in the evenings, were heard in some streets. I suppose\r\n      the world has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle, an enthusiast.\r\n      He, though not infected at all but in his head, went about\r\n      denouncing of judgement upon the city in a frightful manner,\r\n      sometimes quite naked, and with a pan of burning charcoal on his\r\n      head. What he said, or pretended, indeed I could not learn.\r\n\r\n      I will not say whether that clergyman was distracted or not, or\r\n      whether he did it in pure zeal for the poor people, who went\r\n      every evening through the streets of Whitechappel, and, with his\r\n      hands lifted up, repeated that part of the Liturgy of the Church\r\n      continually, \xe2\x80\x98Spare us, good Lord; spare Thy people, whom Thou\r\n      has redeemed with Thy most precious blood.\xe2\x80\x99 I say, I cannot speak\r\n      positively of these things, because these were only the dismal\r\n      objects which represented themselves to me as I looked through my\r\n      chamber windows (for I seldom opened the casements), while I\r\n      confined myself within doors during that most violent raging of\r\n      the pestilence; when, indeed, as I have said, many began to\r\n      think, and even to say, that there would none escape; and indeed\r\n      I began to think so too, and therefore kept within doors for\r\n      about a fortnight and never stirred out. But I could not hold it.\r\n      Besides, there were some people who, notwithstanding the danger,\r\n      did not omit publicly to attend the worship of God, even in the\r\n      most dangerous times; and though it is true that a great many\r\n      clergymen did shut up their churches, and fled, as other people\r\n      did, for the safety of their lives, yet all did not do so. Some\r\n      ventured to officiate and to keep up the assemblies of the people\r\n      by constant prayers, and sometimes sermons or brief exhortations\r\n      to repentance and reformation, and this as long as any would come\r\n      to hear them. And Dissenters did the like also, and even in the\r\n      very churches where the parish ministers were either dead or\r\n      fled; nor was there any room for making difference at such a time\r\n      as this was.\r\n\r\n      It was indeed a lamentable thing to hear the miserable\r\n      lamentations of poor dying creatures calling out for ministers to\r\n      comfort them and pray with them, to counsel them and to direct\r\n      them, calling out to God for pardon and mercy, and confessing\r\n      aloud their past sins. It would make the stoutest heart bleed to\r\n      hear how many warnings were then given by dying penitents to\r\n      others not to put off and delay their repentance to the day of\r\n      distress; that such a time of calamity as this was no time for\r\n      repentance, was no time to call upon God. I wish I could repeat\r\n      the very sound of those groans and of those exclamations that I\r\n      heard from some poor dying creatures when in the height of their\r\n      agonies and distress, and that I could make him that reads this\r\n      hear, as I imagine I now hear them, for the sound seems still to\r\n      ring in my ears.\r\n\r\n      If I could but tell this part in such moving accents as should\r\n      alarm the very soul of the reader, I should rejoice that I\r\n      recorded those things, however short and imperfect.\r\n\r\n      It pleased God that I was still spared, and very hearty and sound\r\n      in health, but very impatient of being pent up within doors\r\n      without air, as I had been for fourteen days or thereabouts; and\r\n      I could not restrain myself, but I would go to carry a letter for\r\n      my brother to the post-house. Then it was indeed that I observed\r\n      a profound silence in the streets. When I came to the post-house,\r\n      as I went to put in my letter I saw a man stand in one corner of\r\n      the yard and talking to another at a window, and a third had\r\n      opened a door belonging to the office. In the middle of the yard\r\n      lay a small leather purse with two keys hanging at it, with money\r\n      in it, but nobody would meddle with it. I asked how long it had\r\n      lain there; the man at the window said it had lain almost an\r\n      hour, but that they had not meddled with it, because they did not\r\n      know but the person who dropped it might come back to look for\r\n      it. I had no such need of money, nor was the sum so big that I\r\n      had any inclination to meddle with it, or to get the money at the\r\n      hazard it might be attended with; so I seemed to go away, when\r\n      the man who had opened the door said he would take it up, but so\r\n      that if the right owner came for it he should be sure to have it.\r\n      So he went in and fetched a pail of water and set it down hard by\r\n      the purse, then went again and fetch some gunpowder, and cast a\r\n      good deal of powder upon the purse, and then made a train from\r\n      that which he had thrown loose upon the purse. The train reached\r\n      about two yards. After this he goes in a third time and fetches\r\n      out a pair of tongs red hot, and which he had prepared, I\r\n      suppose, on purpose; and first setting fire to the train of\r\n      powder, that singed the purse and also smoked the air\r\n      sufficiently. But he was not content with that, but he then takes\r\n      up the purse with the tongs, holding it so long till the tongs\r\n      burnt through the purse, and then he shook the money out into the\r\n      pail of water, so he carried it in. The money, as I remember, was\r\n      about thirteen shilling and some smooth groats and brass\r\n      farthings.\r\n\r\n      There might perhaps have been several poor people, as I have\r\n      observed above, that would have been hardy enough to have\r\n      ventured for the sake of the money; but you may easily see by\r\n      what I have observed that the few people who were spared were\r\n      very careful of themselves at that time when the distress was so\r\n      exceeding great.\r\n\r\n      Much about the same time I walked out into the fields towards\r\n      Bow; for I had a great mind to see how things were managed in the\r\n      river and among the ships; and as I had some concern in shipping,\r\n      I had a notion that it had been one of the best ways of securing\r\n      one\xe2\x80\x99s self from the infection to have retired into a ship; and\r\n      musing how to satisfy my curiosity in that point, I turned away\r\n      over the fields from Bow to Bromley, and down to Blackwall to the\r\n      stairs which are there for landing or taking water.\r\n\r\n      Here I saw a poor man walking on the bank, or sea-wall, as they\r\n      call it, by himself. I walked a while also about, seeing the\r\n      houses all shut up. At last I fell into some talk, at a distance,\r\n      with this poor man; first I asked him how people did thereabouts.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Alas, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98almost desolate; all dead or sick. Here\r\n      are very few families in this part, or in that village\xe2\x80\x99 (pointing\r\n      at Poplar), \xe2\x80\x98where half of them are not dead already, and the\r\n      rest sick.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he pointing to one house, \xe2\x80\x98There they are all\r\n      dead\xe2\x80\x99, said he, \xe2\x80\x98and the house stands open; nobody dares go into\r\n      it. A poor thief\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98ventured in to steal something, but\r\n      he paid dear for his theft, for he was carried to the churchyard\r\n      too last night.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he pointed to several other houses.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98they are all dead, the man and his wife, and\r\n      five children. There\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98they are shut up; you see a\r\n      watchman at the door\xe2\x80\x99; and so of other houses. \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 says I,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98what do you here all alone?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98I am a poor,\r\n      desolate man; it has pleased God I am not yet visited, though my\r\n      family is, and one of my children dead.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98How do you mean, then,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      said I, \xe2\x80\x98that you are not visited?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\n      house\xe2\x80\x99 (pointing to a very little, low-boarded house), \xe2\x80\x98and there\r\n      my poor wife and two children live,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98if they may be\r\n      said to live, for my wife and one of the children are visited,\r\n      but I do not come at them.\xe2\x80\x99 And with that word I saw the tears\r\n      run very plentifully down his face; and so they did down mine\r\n      too, I assure you.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98why do you not come at them? How can you abandon\r\n      your own flesh and blood?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98the Lord forbid!\r\n      I do not abandon them; I work for them as much as I am able; and,\r\n      blessed be the Lord, I keep them from want\xe2\x80\x99; and with that I\r\n      observed he lifted up his eyes to heaven, with a countenance that\r\n      presently told me I had happened on a man that was no hypocrite,\r\n      but a serious, religious, good man, and his ejaculation was an\r\n      expression of thankfulness that, in such a condition as he was\r\n      in, he should be able to say his family did not want. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      says I, \xe2\x80\x98honest man, that is a great mercy as things go now with\r\n      the poor. But how do you live, then, and how are you kept from\r\n      the dreadful calamity that is now upon us all?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\n      he, \xe2\x80\x98I am a waterman, and there\xe2\x80\x99s my boat,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and the\r\n      boat serves me for a house. I work in it in the day, and I sleep\r\n      in it in the night; and what I get I lay down upon that stone,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      says he, showing me a broad stone on the other side of the\r\n      street, a good way from his house; \xe2\x80\x98and then,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\n      halloo, and call to them till I make them hear; and they come and\r\n      fetch it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Well, friend,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98but how can you get any money as a\r\n      waterman? Does any body go by water these times?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      says he, \xe2\x80\x98in the way I am employed there does. Do you see there,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      says he, \xe2\x80\x98five ships lie at anchor\xe2\x80\x99 (pointing down the river a\r\n      good way below the town), \xe2\x80\x98and do you see\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98eight or\r\n      ten ships lie at the chain there, and at anchor yonder?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      (pointing above the town). \xe2\x80\x98All those ships have families on\r\n      board, of their merchants and owners, and such-like, who have\r\n      locked themselves up and live on board, close shut in, for fear\r\n      of the infection; and I tend on them to fetch things for them,\r\n      carry letters, and do what is absolutely necessary, that they may\r\n      not be obliged to come on shore; and every night I fasten my boat\r\n      on board one of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s boats, and there I sleep by myself,\r\n      and, blessed be God, I am preserved hitherto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98friend, but will they let you come on board\r\n      after you have been on shore here, when this is such a terrible\r\n      place, and so infected as it is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Why, as to that,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I very seldom go up the ship-side,\r\n      but deliver what I bring to their boat, or lie by the side, and\r\n      they hoist it on board. If I did, I think they are in no danger\r\n      from me, for I never go into any house on shore, or touch\r\n      anybody, no, not of my own family; but I fetch provisions for\r\n      them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98but that may be worse, for you must have those\r\n      provisions of somebody or other; and since all this part of the\r\n      town is so infected, it is dangerous so much as to speak with\r\n      anybody, for the village\xe2\x80\x99, said I, \xe2\x80\x98is, as it were, the beginning\r\n      of London, though it be at some distance from it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98That is true,\xe2\x80\x99 added he; \xe2\x80\x98but you do not understand me right; I\r\n      do not buy provisions for them here. I row up to Greenwich and\r\n      buy fresh meat there, and sometimes I row down the river to\r\n      Woolwich and buy there; then I go to single farm-houses on the\r\n      Kentish side, where I am known, and buy fowls and eggs and\r\n      butter, and bring to the ships, as they direct me, sometimes one,\r\n      sometimes the other. I seldom come on shore here, and I came now\r\n      only to call on my wife and hear how my family do, and give them\r\n      a little money, which I received last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Poor man!\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98and how much hast thou gotten for them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98I have gotten four shillings,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98which is a great sum,\r\n      as things go now with poor men; but they have given me a bag of\r\n      bread too, and a salt fish and some flesh; so all helps out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98and have you given it them yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98but I have called, and my wife has answered that\r\n      she cannot come out yet, but in half-an-hour she hopes to come,\r\n      and I am waiting for her. Poor woman!\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98she is brought\r\n      sadly down. She has a swelling, and it is broke, and I hope she\r\n      will recover; but I fear the child will die, but it is the Lord\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      Here he stopped, and wept very much.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Well, honest friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98thou hast a sure Comforter, if\r\n      thou hast brought thyself to be resigned to the will of God; He\r\n      is dealing with us all in judgement.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98it is infinite mercy if any of us are\r\n      spared, and who am I to repine!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Sayest thou so?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98and how much less is my faith than\r\n      thine?\xe2\x80\x99 And here my heart smote me, suggesting how much better\r\n      this poor man\xe2\x80\x99s foundation was on which he stayed in the danger\r\n      than mine; that he had nowhere to fly; that he had a family to\r\n      bind him to attendance, which I had not; and mine was mere\r\n      presumption, his a true dependence and a courage resting on God;\r\n      and yet that he used all possible caution for his safety.\r\n\r\n      I turned a little way from the man while these thoughts engaged\r\n      me, for, indeed, I could no more refrain from tears than he.\r\n\r\n      At length, after some further talk, the poor woman opened the\r\n      door and called, \xe2\x80\x98Robert, Robert\xe2\x80\x99. He answered, and bid her stay\r\n      a few moments and he would come; so he ran down the common stairs\r\n      to his boat and fetched up a sack, in which was the provisions he\r\n      had brought from the ships; and when he returned he hallooed\r\n      again. Then he went to the great stone which he showed me and\r\n      emptied the sack, and laid all out, everything by themselves, and\r\n      then retired; and his wife came with a little boy to fetch them\r\n      away, and called and said such a captain had sent such a thing,\r\n      and such a captain such a thing, and at the end adds, \xe2\x80\x98God has\r\n      sent it all; give thanks to Him.\xe2\x80\x99 When the poor woman had taken\r\n      up all, she was so weak she could not carry it at once in, though\r\n      the weight was not much neither; so she left the biscuit, which\r\n      was in a little bag, and left a little boy to watch it till she\r\n      came again.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Well, but\xe2\x80\x99, says I to him, \xe2\x80\x98did you leave her the four shillings\r\n      too, which you said was your week\xe2\x80\x99s pay?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98you shall hear her own it.\xe2\x80\x99 So he calls\r\n      again, \xe2\x80\x98Rachel, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x99 which it seems was her name, \xe2\x80\x98did you\r\n      take up the money?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98How much was it?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Four shillings and a groat,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 says he,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98the Lord keep you all\xe2\x80\x99; and so he turned to go away.\r\n\r\n      As I could not refrain contributing tears to this man\xe2\x80\x99s story, so\r\n      neither could I refrain my charity for his assistance. So I\r\n      called him, \xe2\x80\x98Hark thee, friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98come hither, for I\r\n      believe thou art in health, that I may venture thee\xe2\x80\x99; so I pulled\r\n      out my hand, which was in my pocket before, \xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98go\r\n      and call thy Rachel once more, and give her a little more comfort\r\n      from me. God will never forsake a family that trust in Him as\r\n      thou dost.\xe2\x80\x99 So I gave him four other shillings, and bid him go\r\n      lay them on the stone and call his wife.\r\n\r\n      I have not words to express the poor man\xe2\x80\x99s thankfulness, neither\r\n      could he express it himself but by tears running down his face.\r\n      He called his wife, and told her God had moved the heart of a\r\n      stranger, upon hearing their condition, to give them all that\r\n      money, and a great deal more such as that he said to her. The\r\n      woman, too, made signs of the like thankfulness, as well to\r\n      Heaven as to me, and joyfully picked it up; and I parted with no\r\n      money all that year that I thought better bestowed.\r\n\r\n      I then asked the poor man if the distemper had not reached to\r\n      Greenwich. He said it had not till about a fortnight before; but\r\n      that then he feared it had, but that it was only at that end of\r\n      the town which lay south towards Deptford Bridge; that he went\r\n      only to a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s shop and a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s, where he generally\r\n      bought such things as they sent him for, but was very careful.\r\n\r\n      I asked him then how it came to pass that those people who had so\r\n      shut themselves up in the ships had not laid in sufficient stores\r\n      of all things necessary. He said some of them had\xe2\x80\x94but, on the\r\n      other hand, some did not come on board till they were frighted\r\n      into it and till it was too dangerous for them to go to the\r\n      proper people to lay in quantities of things, and that he waited\r\n      on two ships, which he showed me, that had laid in little or\r\n      nothing but biscuit bread and ship beer, and that he had bought\r\n      everything else almost for them. I asked him if there was any\r\n      more ships that had separated themselves as those had done. He\r\n      told me yes, all the way up from the point, right against\r\n      Greenwich, to within the shore of Limehouse and Redriff, all the\r\n      ships that could have room rid two and two in the middle of the\r\n      stream, and that some of them had several families on board. I\r\n      asked him if the distemper had not reached them. He said he\r\n      believed it had not, except two or three ships whose people had\r\n      not been so watchful to keep the seamen from going on shore as\r\n      others had been, and he said it was a very fine sight to see how\r\n      the ships lay up the Pool.\r\n\r\n      When he said he was going over to Greenwich as soon as the tide\r\n      began to come in, I asked if he would let me go with him and\r\n      bring me back, for that I had a great mind to see how the ships\r\n      were ranged, as he had told me. He told me, if I would assure him\r\n      on the word of a Christian and of an honest man that I had not\r\n      the distemper, he would. I assured him that I had not; that it\r\n      had pleased God to preserve me; that I lived in Whitechappel, but\r\n      was too impatient of being so long within doors, and that I had\r\n      ventured out so far for the refreshment of a little air, but that\r\n      none in my house had so much as been touched with it.\r\n\r\n      Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98as your charity has been moved to pity me\r\n      and my poor family, sure you cannot have so little pity left as\r\n      to put yourself into my boat if you were not sound in health\r\n      which would be nothing less than killing me and ruining my whole\r\n      family.\xe2\x80\x99 The poor man troubled me so much when he spoke of his\r\n      family with such a sensible concern and in such an affectionate\r\n      manner, that I could not satisfy myself at first to go at all. I\r\n      told him I would lay aside my curiosity rather than make him\r\n      uneasy, though I was sure, and very thankful for it, that I had\r\n      no more distemper upon me than the freshest man in the world.\r\n      Well, he would not have me put it off neither, but to let me see\r\n      how confident he was that I was just to him, now importuned me to\r\n      go; so when the tide came up to his boat I went in, and he\r\n      carried me to Greenwich. While he bought the things which he had\r\n      in his charge to buy, I walked up to the top of the hill under\r\n      which the town stands, and on the east side of the town, to get a\r\n      prospect of the river. But it was a surprising sight to see the\r\n      number of ships which lay in rows, two and two, and some places\r\n      two or three such lines in the breadth of the river, and this not\r\n      only up quite to the town, between the houses which we call\r\n      Ratcliff and Redriff, which they name the Pool, but even down the\r\n      whole river as far as the head of Long Reach, which is as far as\r\n      the hills give us leave to see it.\r\n\r\n      I cannot guess at the number of ships, but I think there must be\r\n      several hundreds of sail; and I could not but applaud the\r\n      contrivance: for ten thousand people and more who attended ship\r\n      affairs were certainly sheltered here from the violence of the\r\n      contagion, and lived very safe and very easy.\r\n\r\n      I returned to my own dwelling very well satisfied with my day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      journey, and particularly with the poor man; also I rejoiced to\r\n      see that such little sanctuaries were provided for so many\r\n      families in a time of such desolation. I observed also that, as\r\n      the violence of the plague had increased, so the ships which had\r\n      families on board removed and went farther off, till, as I was\r\n      told, some went quite away to sea, and put into such harbours and\r\n      safe roads on the north coast as they could best come at.\r\n\r\n      But it was also true that all the people who thus left the land\r\n      and lived on board the ships were not entirely safe from the\r\n      infection, for many died and were thrown overboard into the\r\n      river, some in coffins, and some, as I heard, without coffins,\r\n      whose bodies were seen sometimes to drive up and down with the\r\n      tide in the river.\r\n\r\n      But I believe I may venture to say that in those ships which were\r\n      thus infected it either happened where the people had recourse to\r\n      them too late, and did not fly to the ship till they had stayed\r\n      too long on shore and had the distemper upon them (though perhaps\r\n      they might not perceive it) and so the distemper did not come to\r\n      them on board the ships, but they really carried it with them; or\r\n      it was in these ships where the poor waterman said they had not\r\n      had time to furnish themselves with provisions, but were obliged\r\n      to send often on shore to buy what they had occasion for, or\r\n      suffered boats to come to them from the shore. And so the\r\n      distemper was brought insensibly among them.\r\n\r\n      And here I cannot but take notice that the strange temper of the\r\n      people of London at that time contributed extremely to their own\r\n      destruction. The plague began, as I have observed, at the other\r\n      end of the town, namely, in Long Acre, Drury Lane, &c., and came\r\n      on towards the city very gradually and slowly. It was felt at\r\n      first in December, then again in February, then again in April,\r\n      and always but a very little at a time; then it stopped till May,\r\n      and even the last week in May there was but seventeen, and all at\r\n      that end of the town; and all this while, even so long as till\r\n      there died above 3000 a week, yet had the people in Redriff, and\r\n      in Wapping and Ratcliff, on both sides of the river, and almost\r\n      all Southwark side, a mighty fancy that they should not be\r\n      visited, or at least that it would not be so violent among them.\r\n      Some people fancied the smell of the pitch and tar, and such\r\n      other things as oil and rosin and brimstone, which is so much\r\n      used by all trades relating to shipping, would preserve them.\r\n      Others argued it, because it was in its extreamest violence in\r\n      Westminster and the parish of St Giles and St Andrew, &c., and\r\n      began to abate again before it came among them\xe2\x80\x94which was true\r\n      indeed, in part. For example\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n From the 8th to the 15th August\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -    St Giles-in-the-Fields               242\r\n     -    Cripplegate                          886\r\n     -    Stepney                              197\r\n     -    St Margaret, Bermondsey               24\r\n     -    Rotherhithe                            3\r\n     -    Total this week                     4030\r\n\r\n     From the 15th to the 22nd August\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -    St Giles-in-the-Fields               175\r\n     -    Cripplegate                          847\r\n     -    Stepney                              273\r\n     -    St Margaret, Bermondsey               36\r\n     -    Rotherhithe                            2\r\n     -    Total this week                     5319\r\n\r\n      N.B.\xe2\x80\x94That it was observed the numbers mentioned in Stepney parish\r\n      at that time were generally all on that side where Stepney parish\r\n      joined to Shoreditch, which we now call Spittlefields, where the\r\n      parish of Stepney comes up to the very wall of Shoreditch\r\n      Churchyard, and the plague at this time was abated at St\r\n      Giles-in-the-Fields, and raged most violently in Cripplegate,\r\n      Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch parishes; but there was not ten\r\n      people a week that died of it in all that part of Stepney parish\r\n      which takes in Limehouse, Ratcliff Highway, and which are now the\r\n      parishes of Shadwell and Wapping, even to St Katherine\xe2\x80\x99s by the\r\n      Tower, till after the whole month of August was expired. But they\r\n      paid for it afterwards, as I shall observe by-and-by.\r\n\r\n      This, I say, made the people of Redriff and Wapping, Ratcliff and\r\n      Limehouse, so secure, and flatter themselves so much with the\r\n      plague\xe2\x80\x99s going off without reaching them, that they took no care\r\n      either to fly into the country or shut themselves up. Nay, so far\r\n      were they from stirring that they rather received their friends\r\n      and relations from the city into their houses, and several from\r\n      other places really took sanctuary in that part of the town as a\r\n      Place of safety, and as a place which they thought God would pass\r\n      over, and not visit as the rest was visited.\r\n\r\n      And this was the reason that when it came upon them they were\r\n      more surprised, more unprovided, and more at a loss what to do\r\n      than they were in other places; for when it came among them\r\n      really and with violence, as it did indeed in September and\r\n      October, there was then no stirring out into the country, nobody\r\n      would suffer a stranger to come near them, no, nor near the towns\r\n      where they dwelt; and, as I have been told, several that wandered\r\n      into the country on Surrey side were found starved to death in\r\n      the woods and commons, that country being more open and more\r\n      woody than any other part so near London, especially about\r\n      Norwood and the parishes of Camberwell, Dullege, and Lusum,\r\n      where, it seems, nobody durst relieve the poor distressed people\r\n      for fear of the infection.\r\n\r\n      This notion having, as I said, prevailed with the people in that\r\n      part of the town, was in part the occasion, as I said before,\r\n      that they had recourse to ships for their retreat; and where they\r\n      did this early and with prudence, furnishing themselves so with\r\n      provisions that they had no need to go on shore for supplies or\r\n      suffer boats to come on board to bring them,\xe2\x80\x94I say, where they\r\n      did so they had certainly the safest retreat of any people\r\n      whatsoever; but the distress was such that people ran on board,\r\n      in their fright, without bread to eat, and some into ships that\r\n      had no men on board to remove them farther off, or to take the\r\n      boat and go down the river to buy provisions where it might be\r\n      done safely, and these often suffered and were infected on board\r\n      as much as on shore.\r\n\r\n      As the richer sort got into ships, so the lower rank got into\r\n      hoys, smacks, lighters, and fishing-boats; and many, especially\r\n      watermen, lay in their boats; but those made sad work of it,\r\n      especially the latter, for, going about for provision, and\r\n      perhaps to get their subsistence, the infection got in among them\r\n      and made a fearful havoc; many of the watermen died alone in\r\n      their wherries as they rid at their roads, as well as above\r\n      bridge as below, and were not found sometimes till they were not\r\n      in condition for anybody to touch or come near them.\r\n\r\n      Indeed, the distress of the people at this seafaring end of the\r\n      town was very deplorable, and deserved the greatest\r\n      commiseration. But, alas! this was a time when every one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      private safety lay so near them that they had no room to pity the\r\n      distresses of others; for every one had death, as it were, at his\r\n      door, and many even in their families, and knew not what to do or\r\n      whither to fly.\r\n\r\n      This, I say, took away all compassion; self-preservation, indeed,\r\n      appeared here to be the first law. For the children ran away from\r\n      their parents as they languished in the utmost distress. And in\r\n      some places, though not so frequent as the other, parents did the\r\n      like to their children; nay, some dreadful examples there were,\r\n      and particularly two in one week, of distressed mothers, raving\r\n      and distracted, killing their own children; one whereof was not\r\n      far off from where I dwelt, the poor lunatic creature not living\r\n      herself long enough to be sensible of the sin of what she had\r\n      done, much less to be punished for it.\r\n\r\n      It is not, indeed, to be wondered at: for the danger of immediate\r\n      death to ourselves took away all bowels of love, all concern for\r\n      one another. I speak in general, for there were many instances of\r\n      immovable affection, pity, and duty in many, and some that came\r\n      to my knowledge, that is to say, by hearsay; for I shall not take\r\n      upon me to vouch the truth of the particulars.\r\n\r\n      To introduce one, let me first mention that one of the most\r\n      deplorable cases in all the present calamity was that of women\r\n      with child, who, when they came to the hour of their sorrows, and\r\n      their pains come upon them, could neither have help of one kind\r\n      or another; neither midwife or neighbouring women to come near\r\n      them. Most of the midwives were dead, especially of such as\r\n      served the poor; and many, if not all the midwives of note, were\r\n      fled into the country; so that it was next to impossible for a\r\n      poor woman that could not pay an immoderate price to get any\r\n      midwife to come to her\xe2\x80\x94and if they did, those they could get were\r\n      generally unskilful and ignorant creatures; and the consequence\r\n      of this was that a most unusual and incredible number of women\r\n      were reduced to the utmost distress. Some were delivered and\r\n      spoiled by the rashness and ignorance of those who pretended to\r\n      lay them. Children without number were, I might say, murdered by\r\n      the same but a more justifiable ignorance: pretending they would\r\n      save the mother, whatever became of the child; and many times\r\n      both mother and child were lost in the same manner; and\r\n      especially where the mother had the distemper, there nobody would\r\n      come near them and both sometimes perished. Sometimes the mother\r\n      has died of the plague, and the infant, it may be, half born, or\r\n      born but not parted from the mother. Some died in the very pains\r\n      of their travail, and not delivered at all; and so many were the\r\n      cases of this kind that it is hard to judge of them.\r\n\r\n      Something of it will appear in the unusual numbers which are put\r\n      into the weekly bills (though I am far from allowing them to be\r\n      able to give anything of a full account) under the articles of\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     Child-bed. Abortive and Still-born. Chrisoms and Infants.\r\n\r\n      Take the weeks in which the plague was most violent, and compare\r\n      them with the weeks before the distemper began, even in the same\r\n      year.

In a word, the usual number that used to\r\n      die of these three articles, and, as I hear, did die of them the\r\n      year before, was thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      1664.                               1665.\r\n     Child-bed                   189     Child-bed                   625\r\n     Abortive and still-born     458     Abortive and still-born     617\r\n     -                          \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94                                \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -                           647                                1242\r\n\r\n\r\n      This inequality, I say, is exceedingly augmented when the numbers\r\n      of people are considered. I pretend not to make any exact\r\n      calculation of the numbers of people which were at this time in\r\n      the city, but I shall make a probable conjecture at that part\r\n      by-and-by. What I have said now is to explain the misery of those\r\n      poor creatures above; so that it might well be said, as in the\r\n      Scripture, Woe be to those who are with child, and to those which\r\n      give suck in that day. For, indeed, it was a woe to them in\r\n      particular.\r\n\r\n      I was not conversant in many particular families where these\r\n      things happened, but the outcries of the miserable were heard\r\n      afar off. As to those who were with child, we have seen some\r\n      calculation made; 291 women dead in child-bed in nine weeks, out\r\n      of one-third part of the number of whom there usually died in\r\n      that time but eighty-four of the same disaster. Let the reader\r\n      calculate the proportion.\r\n\r\n      There is no room to doubt but the misery of those that gave suck\r\n      was in proportion as great. Our bills of mortality could give but\r\n      little light in this, yet some it did. There were several more\r\n      than usual starved at nurse, but this was nothing. The misery was\r\n      where they were, first, starved for want of a nurse, the mother\r\n      dying and all the family and the infants found dead by them,\r\n      merely for want; and, if I may speak my opinion, I do believe\r\n      that many hundreds of poor helpless infants perished in this\r\n      manner. Secondly, not starved, but poisoned by the nurse. Nay,\r\n      even where the mother has been nurse, and having received the\r\n      infection, has poisoned, that is, infected the infant with her\r\n      milk even before they knew they were infected themselves; nay,\r\n      and the infant has died in such a case before the mother. I\r\n      cannot but remember to leave this admonition upon record, if ever\r\n      such another dreadful visitation should happen in this city, that\r\n      all women that are with child or that give suck should be gone,\r\n      if they have any possible means, out of the place, because their\r\n      misery, if infected, will so much exceed all other people\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n      I could tell here dismal stories of living infants being found\r\n      sucking the breasts of their mothers, or nurses, after they have\r\n      been dead of the plague. Of a mother in the parish where I lived,\r\n      who, having a child that was not well, sent for an apothecary to\r\n      view the child; and when he came, as the relation goes, was\r\n      giving the child suck at her breast, and to all appearance was\r\n      herself very well; but when the apothecary came close to her he\r\n      saw the tokens upon that breast with which she was suckling the\r\n      child. He was surprised enough, to be sure, but, not willing to\r\n      fright the poor woman too much, he desired she would give the\r\n      child into his hand; so he takes the child, and going to a cradle\r\n      in the room, lays it in, and opening its cloths, found the tokens\r\n      upon the child too, and both died before he could get home to\r\n      send a preventive medicine to the father of the child, to whom he\r\n      had told their condition. Whether the child infected the\r\n      nurse-mother or the mother the child was not certain, but the\r\n      last most likely. Likewise of a child brought home to the parents\r\n      from a nurse that had died of the plague, yet the tender mother\r\n      would not refuse to take in her child, and laid it in her bosom,\r\n      by which she was infected; and died with the child in her arms\r\n      dead also.\r\n\r\n      It would make the hardest heart move at the instances that were\r\n      frequently found of tender mothers tending and watching with\r\n      their dear children, and even dying before them, and sometimes\r\n      taking the distemper from them and dying, when the child for whom\r\n      the affectionate heart had been sacrificed has got over it and\r\n      escaped.\r\n\r\n      The like of a tradesman in East Smithfield, whose wife was big\r\n      with child of her first child, and fell in labour, having the\r\n      plague upon her. He could neither get midwife to assist her or\r\n      nurse to tend her, and two servants which he kept fled both from\r\n      her. He ran from house to house like one distracted, but could\r\n      get no help; the utmost he could get was, that a watchman, who\r\n      attended at an infected house shut up, promised to send a nurse\r\n      in the morning. The poor man, with his heart broke, went back,\r\n      assisted his wife what he could, acted the part of the midwife,\r\n      brought the child dead into the world, and his wife in about an\r\n      hour died in his arms, where he held her dead body fast till the\r\n      morning, when the watchman came and brought the nurse as he had\r\n      promised; and coming up the stairs (for he had left the door\r\n      open, or only latched), they found the man sitting with his dead\r\n      wife in his arms, and so overwhelmed with grief that he died in a\r\n      few hours after without any sign of the infection upon him, but\r\n      merely sunk under the weight of his grief.\r\n\r\n      I have heard also of some who, on the death of their relations,\r\n      have grown stupid with the insupportable sorrow; and of one, in\r\n      particular, who was so absolutely overcome with the pressure upon\r\n      his spirits that by degrees his head sank into his body, so\r\n      between his shoulders that the crown of his head was very little\r\n      seen above the bone of his shoulders; and by degrees losing both\r\n      voice and sense, his face, looking forward, lay against his\r\n      collarbone and could not be kept up any otherwise, unless held up\r\n      by the hands of other people; and the poor man never came to\r\n      himself again, but languished near a year in that condition, and\r\n      died. Nor was he ever once seen to lift up his eyes or to look\r\n      upon any particular object.\r\n\r\n      I cannot undertake to give any other than a summary of such\r\n      passages as these, because it was not possible to come at the\r\n      particulars, where sometimes the whole families where such things\r\n      happened were carried off by the distemper. But there were\r\n      innumerable cases of this kind which presented to the eye and the\r\n      ear, even in passing along the streets, as I have hinted above.\r\n      Nor is it easy to give any story of this or that family which\r\n      there was not divers parallel stories to be met with of the same\r\n      kind.\r\n\r\n      But as I am now talking of the time when the plague raged at the\r\n      easternmost part of the town\xe2\x80\x94how for a long time the people of\r\n      those parts had flattered themselves that they should escape, and\r\n      how they were surprised when it came upon them as it did; for,\r\n      indeed, it came upon them like an armed man when it did come;\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      say, this brings me back to the three poor men who wandered from\r\n      Wapping, not knowing whither to go or what to do, and whom I\r\n      mentioned before; one a biscuit-baker, one a sailmaker, and the\r\n      other a joiner, all of Wapping, or there-abouts.\r\n\r\n      The sleepiness and security of that part, as I have observed, was\r\n      such that they not only did not shift for themselves as others\r\n      did, but they boasted of being safe, and of safety being with\r\n      them; and many people fled out of the city, and out of the\r\n      infected suburbs, to Wapping, Ratcliff, Limehouse, Poplar, and\r\n      such Places, as to Places of security; and it is not at all\r\n      unlikely that their doing this helped to bring the plague that\r\n      way faster than it might otherwise have come. For though I am\r\n      much for people flying away and emptying such a town as this upon\r\n      the first appearance of a like visitation, and that all people\r\n      who have any possible retreat should make use of it in time and\r\n      be gone, yet I must say, when all that will fly are gone, those\r\n      that are left and must stand it should stand stock-still where\r\n      they are, and not shift from one end of the town or one part of\r\n      the town to the other; for that is the bane and mischief of the\r\n      whole, and they carry the plague from house to house in their\r\n      very clothes.\r\n\r\n      Wherefore were we ordered to kill all the dogs and cats, but\r\n      because as they were domestic animals, and are apt to run from\r\n      house to house and from street to street, so they are capable of\r\n      carrying the effluvia or infectious streams of bodies infected\r\n      even in their furs and hair? And therefore it was that, in the\r\n      beginning of the infection, an order was published by the Lord\r\n      Mayor, and by the magistrates, according to the advice of the\r\n      physicians, that all the dogs and cats should be immediately\r\n      killed, and an officer was appointed for the execution.\r\n\r\n      It is incredible, if their account is to be depended upon, what a\r\n      prodigious number of those creatures were destroyed. I think they\r\n      talked of forty thousand dogs, and five times as many cats; few\r\n      houses being without a cat, some having several, sometimes five\r\n      or six in a house. All possible endeavours were used also to\r\n      destroy the mice and rats, especially the latter, by laying\r\n      ratsbane and other poisons for them, and a prodigious multitude\r\n      of them were also destroyed.\r\n\r\n      I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole\r\n      body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity\r\n      upon them, and how it was for want of timely entering into\r\n      measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the\r\n      confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a\r\n      prodigious number of people sank in that disaster, which, if\r\n      proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have\r\n      been avoided, and which, if posterity think fit, they may take a\r\n      caution and warning from. But I shall come to this part again.\r\n\r\n      I come back to my three men. Their story has a moral in every\r\n      part of it, and their whole conduct, and that of some whom they\r\n      joined with, is a pattern for all poor men to follow, or women\r\n      either, if ever such a time comes again; and if there was no\r\n      other end in recording it, I think this a very just one, whether\r\n      my account be exactly according to fact or no.\r\n\r\n      Two of them are said to be brothers, the one an old soldier, but\r\n      now a biscuit-maker; the other a lame sailor, but now a\r\n      sailmaker; the third a joiner. Says John the biscuit-maker one\r\n      day to Thomas his brother, the sailmaker, \xe2\x80\x98Brother Tom, what will\r\n      become of us? The plague grows hot in the city, and increases\r\n      this way. What shall we do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Truly,\xe2\x80\x99 says Thomas, \xe2\x80\x98I am at a great loss what to do, for I\r\n      find if it comes down into Wapping I shall be turned out of my\r\n      lodging.\xe2\x80\x99 And thus they began to talk of it beforehand.\r\n\r\n      John. Turned out of your lodging, Tom! If you are, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\n      who will take you in; for people are so afraid of one another\r\n      now, there\xe2\x80\x99s no getting a lodging anywhere.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. Why, the people where I lodge are good, civil people, and\r\n      have kindness enough for me too; but they say I go abroad every\r\n      day to my work, and it will be dangerous; and they talk of\r\n      locking themselves up and letting nobody come near them.\r\n\r\n      John. Why, they are in the right, to be sure, if they resolve to\r\n      venture staying in town.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. Nay, I might even resolve to stay within doors too, for,\r\n      except a suit of sails that my master has in hand, and which I am\r\n      just finishing, I am like to get no more work a great while.\r\n      There\xe2\x80\x99s no trade stirs now. Workmen and servants are turned off\r\n      everywhere, so that I might be glad to be locked up too; but I do\r\n      not see they will be willing to consent to that, any more than to\r\n      the other.\r\n\r\n      John. Why, what will you do then, brother? And what shall I do?\r\n      for I am almost as bad as you. The people where I lodge are all\r\n      gone into the country but a maid, and she is to go next week, and\r\n      to shut the house quite up, so that I shall be turned adrift to\r\n      the wide world before you, and I am resolved to go away too, if I\r\n      knew but where to go.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. We were both distracted we did not go away at first; then\r\n      we might have travelled anywhere. There\xe2\x80\x99s no stirring now; we\r\n      shall be starved if we pretend to go out of town. They won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\n      us have victuals, no, not for our money, nor let us come into the\r\n      towns, much less into their houses.\r\n\r\n      John. And that which is almost as bad, I have but little money to\r\n      help myself with neither.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. As to that, we might make shift, I have a little, though\r\n      not much; but I tell you there\xe2\x80\x99s no stirring on the road. I know\r\n      a couple of poor honest men in our street have attempted to\r\n      travel, and at Barnet, or Whetstone, or thereabouts, the people\r\n      offered to fire at them if they pretended to go forward, so they\r\n      are come back again quite discouraged.\r\n\r\n      John. I would have ventured their fire if I had been there. If I\r\n      had been denied food for my money they should have seen me take\r\n      it before their faces, and if I had tendered money for it they\r\n      could not have taken any course with me by law.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. You talk your old soldier\xe2\x80\x99s language, as if you were in\r\n      the Low Countries now, but this is a serious thing. The people\r\n      have good reason to keep anybody off that they are not satisfied\r\n      are sound, at such a time as this, and we must not plunder them.\r\n\r\n      John. No, brother, you mistake the case, and mistake me too. I\r\n      would plunder nobody; but for any town upon the road to deny me\r\n      leave to pass through the town in the open highway, and deny me\r\n      provisions for my money, is to say the town has a right to starve\r\n      me to death, which cannot be true.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. But they do not deny you liberty to go back again from\r\n      whence you came, and therefore they do not starve you.\r\n\r\n      John. But the next town behind me will, by the same rule, deny me\r\n      leave to go back, and so they do starve me between them. Besides,\r\n      there is no law to prohibit my travelling wherever I will on the\r\n      road.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. But there will be so much difficulty in disputing with\r\n      them at every town on the road that it is not for poor men to do\r\n      it or undertake it, at such a time as this is especially.\r\n\r\n      John. Why, brother, our condition at this rate is worse than\r\n      anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s, for we can neither go away nor stay here. I am of\r\n      the same mind with the lepers of Samaria: \xe2\x80\x98If we stay here we are\r\n      sure to die\xe2\x80\x99, I mean especially as you and I are stated, without\r\n      a dwelling-house of our own, and without lodging in anybody\r\n      else\xe2\x80\x99s. There is no lying in the street at such a time as this;\r\n      we had as good go into the dead-cart at once. Therefore I say, if\r\n      we stay here we are sure to die, and if we go away we can but\r\n      die; I am resolved to be gone.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. You will go away. Whither will you go, and what can you\r\n      do? I would as willingly go away as you, if I knew whither. But\r\n      we have no acquaintance, no friends. Here we were born, and here\r\n      we must die.\r\n\r\n      John. Look you, Tom, the whole kingdom is my native country as\r\n      well as this town. You may as well say I must not go out of my\r\n      house if it is on fire as that I must not go out of the town I\r\n      was born in when it is infected with the plague. I was born in\r\n      England, and have a right to live in it if I can.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. But you know every vagrant person may by the laws of\r\n      England be taken up, and passed back to their last legal\r\n      settlement.\r\n\r\n      John. But how shall they make me vagrant? I desire only to travel\r\n      on, upon my lawful occasions.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. What lawful occasions can we pretend to travel, or rather\r\n      wander upon? They will not be put off with words.\r\n\r\n      John. Is not flying to save our lives a lawful occasion? And do\r\n      they not all know that the fact is true? We cannot be said to\r\n      dissemble.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. But suppose they let us pass, whither shall we go?\r\n\r\n      John. Anywhere, to save our lives; it is time enough to consider\r\n      that when we are got out of this town. If I am once out of this\r\n      dreadful place, I care not where I go.\r\n\r\n      Thomas. We shall be driven to great extremities. I know not what\r\n      to think of it.\r\n\r\n      John. Well, Tom, consider of it a little.\r\n\r\n      This was about the beginning of July; and though the plague was\r\n      come forward in the west and north parts of the town, yet all\r\n      Wapping, as I have observed before, and Redriff, and Ratdiff, and\r\n      Limehouse, and Poplar, in short, Deptford and Greenwich, all both\r\n      sides of the river from the Hermitage, and from over against it,\r\n      quite down to Blackwall, was entirely free; there had not one\r\n      person died of the plague in all Stepney parish, and not one on\r\n      the south side of Whitechappel Road, no, not in any parish; and\r\n      yet the weekly bill was that very week risen up to 1006.\r\n\r\n      It was a fortnight after this before the two brothers met again,\r\n      and then the case was a little altered, and the plague was\r\n      exceedingly advanced and the number greatly increased; the bill\r\n      was up at 2785, and prodigiously increasing, though still both\r\n      sides of the river, as below, kept pretty well. But some began to\r\n      die in Redriff, and about five or six in Ratcliff Highway, when\r\n      the sailmaker came to his brother John express, and in some\r\n      fright; for he was absolutely warned out of his lodging, and had\r\n      only a week to provide himself. His brother John was in as bad a\r\n      case, for he was quite out, and had only begged leave of his\r\n      master, the biscuit-maker, to lodge in an outhouse belonging to\r\n      his workhouse, where he only lay upon straw, with some\r\n      biscuit-sacks, or bread-sacks, as they called them, laid upon it,\r\n      and some of the same sacks to cover him.\r\n\r\n      Here they resolved (seeing all employment being at an end, and no\r\n      work or wages to be had), they would make the best of their way\r\n      to get out of the reach of the dreadful infection, and, being as\r\n      good husbands as they could, would endeavour to live upon what\r\n      they had as long as it would last, and then work for more if they\r\n      could get work anywhere, of any kind, let it be what it would.\r\n\r\n      While they were considering to put this resolution in practice in\r\n      the best manner they could, the third man, who was acquainted\r\n      very well with the sailmaker, came to know of the design, and got\r\n      leave to be one of the number; and thus they prepared to set out.\r\n\r\n      It happened that they had not an equal share of money; but as the\r\n      sailmaker, who had the best stock, was, besides his being lame,\r\n      the most unfit to expect to get anything by working in the\r\n      country, so he was content that what money they had should all go\r\n      into one public stock, on condition that whatever any one of them\r\n      could gain more than another, it should without any grudging be\r\n      all added to the public stock.\r\n\r\n      They resolved to load themselves with as little baggage as\r\n      possible because they resolved at first to travel on foot, and to\r\n      go a great way that they might, if possible, be effectually safe;\r\n      and a great many consultations they had with themselves before\r\n      they could agree about what way they should travel, which they\r\n      were so far from adjusting that even to the morning they set out\r\n      they were not resolved on it.\r\n\r\n      At last the seaman put in a hint that determined it. \xe2\x80\x98First,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      says he, \xe2\x80\x98the weather is very hot, and therefore I am for\r\n      travelling north, that we may not have the sun upon our faces and\r\n      beating on our breasts, which will heat and suffocate us; and I\r\n      have been told\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98that it is not good to overheat our\r\n      blood at a time when, for aught we know, the infection may be in\r\n      the very air. In the next place,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98I am for going the\r\n      way that may be contrary to the wind, as it may blow when we set\r\n      out, that we may not have the wind blow the air of the city on\r\n      our backs as we go.\xe2\x80\x99 These two cautions were approved of, if it\r\n      could be brought so to hit that the wind might not be in the\r\n      south when they set out to go north.\r\n\r\n      John the baker, who had been a soldier, then put in his opinion.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98First,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98we none of us expect to get any lodging on the\r\n      road, and it will be a little too hard to lie just in the open\r\n      air. Though it be warm weather, yet it may be wet and damp, and\r\n      we have a double reason to take care of our healths at such a\r\n      time as this; and therefore,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98you, brother Tom, that\r\n      are a sailmaker, might easily make us a little tent, and I will\r\n      undertake to set it up every night, and take it down, and a fig\r\n      for all the inns in England; if we have a good tent over our\r\n      heads we shall do well enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      The joiner opposed this, and told them, let them leave that to\r\n      him; he would undertake to build them a house every night with\r\n      his hatchet and mallet, though he had no other tools, which\r\n      should be fully to their satisfaction, and as good as a tent.\r\n\r\n      The soldier and the joiner disputed that point some time, but at\r\n      last the soldier carried it for a tent. The only objection\r\n      against it was, that it must be carried with them, and that would\r\n      increase their baggage too much, the weather being hot; but the\r\n      sailmaker had a piece of good hap, fell in which made that easy,\r\n      for his master whom he worked for, having a rope-walk as well as\r\n      sailmaking trade, had a little, poor horse that he made no use of\r\n      then; and being willing to assist the three honest men, he gave\r\n      them the horse for the carrying their baggage; also for a small\r\n      matter of three days\xe2\x80\x99 work that his man did for him before he\r\n      went, he let him have an old top-gallant sail that was worn out,\r\n      but was sufficient and more than enough to make a very good tent.\r\n      The soldier showed how to shape it, and they soon by his\r\n      direction made their tent, and fitted it with poles or staves for\r\n      the purpose; and thus they were furnished for their journey,\r\n      viz., three men, one tent, one horse, one gun\xe2\x80\x94for the soldier\r\n      would not go without arms, for now he said he was no more a\r\n      biscuit-baker, but a trooper.\r\n\r\n      The joiner had a small bag of tools such as might be useful if he\r\n      should get any work abroad, as well for their subsistence as his\r\n      own. What money they had they brought all into one public stock,\r\n      and thus they began their journey. It seems that in the morning\r\n      when they set out the wind blew, as the sailor said, by his\r\n      pocket-compass, at N.W. by W. So they directed, or rather\r\n      resolved to direct, their course N.W.\r\n\r\n      But then a difficulty came in their way, that, as they set out\r\n      from the hither end of Wapping, near the Hermitage, and that the\r\n      plague was now very violent, especially on the north side of the\r\n      city, as in Shoreditch and Cripplegate parish, they did not think\r\n      it safe for them to go near those parts; so they went away east\r\n      through Ratcliff Highway as far as Ratcliff Cross, and leaving\r\n      Stepney Church still on their left hand, being afraid to come up\r\n      from Ratcliff Cross to Mile End, because they must come just by\r\n      the churchyard, and because the wind, that seemed to blow more\r\n      from the west, blew directly from the side of the city where the\r\n      plague was hottest. So, I say, leaving Stepney they fetched a\r\n      long compass, and going to Poplar and Bromley, came into the\r\n      great road just at Bow.\r\n\r\n      Here the watch placed upon Bow Bridge would have questioned them,\r\n      but they, crossing the road into a narrow way that turns out of\r\n      the hither end of the town of Bow to Old Ford, avoided any\r\n      inquiry there, and travelled to Old Ford. The constables\r\n      everywhere were upon their guard not so much, It seems, to stop\r\n      people passing by as to stop them from taking up their abode in\r\n      their towns, and withal because of a report that was newly raised\r\n      at that time: and that, indeed, was not very improbable, viz.,\r\n      that the poor people in London, being distressed and starved for\r\n      want of work, and by that means for want of bread, were up in\r\n      arms and had raised a tumult, and that they would come out to all\r\n      the towns round to plunder for bread. This, I say, was only a\r\n      rumour, and it was very well it was no more. But it was not so\r\n      far off from being a reality as it has been thought, for in a few\r\n      weeks more the poor people became so desperate by the calamity\r\n      they suffered that they were with great difficulty kept from\r\n      going out into the fields and towns, and tearing all in pieces\r\n      wherever they came; and, as I have observed before, nothing\r\n      hindered them but that the plague raged so violently and fell in\r\n      upon them so furiously that they rather went to the grave by\r\n      thousands than into the fields in mobs by thousands; for, in the\r\n      parts about the parishes of St Sepulcher, Clarkenwell,\r\n      Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch, which were the places\r\n      where the mob began to threaten, the distemper came on so\r\n      furiously that there died in those few parishes even then, before\r\n      the plague was come to its height, no less than 5361 people in\r\n      the first three weeks in August; when at the same time the parts\r\n      about Wapping, Radcliff, and Rotherhithe were, as before\r\n      described, hardly touched, or but very lightly; so that in a word\r\n      though, as I said before, the good management of the Lord Mayor\r\n      and justices did much to prevent the rage and desperation of the\r\n      people from breaking out in rabbles and tumults, and in short\r\n      from the poor plundering the rich,\xe2\x80\x94I say, though they did much,\r\n      the dead-carts did more: for as I have said that in five parishes\r\n      only there died above 5000 in twenty days, so there might be\r\n      probably three times that number sick all that time; for some\r\n      recovered, and great numbers fell sick every day and died\r\n      afterwards. Besides, I must still be allowed to say that if the\r\n      bills of mortality said five thousand, I always believed it was\r\n      near twice as many in reality, there being no room to believe\r\n      that the account they gave was right, or that indeed they were\r\n      among such confusions as I saw them in, in any condition to keep\r\n      an exact account.\r\n\r\n      But to return to my travellers. Here they were only examined, and\r\n      as they seemed rather coming from the country than from the city,\r\n      they found the people the easier with them; that they talked to\r\n      them, let them come into a public-house where the constable and\r\n      his warders were, and gave them drink and some victuals which\r\n      greatly refreshed and encouraged them; and here it came into\r\n      their heads to say, when they should be inquired of afterwards,\r\n      not that they came from London, but that they came out of Essex.\r\n\r\n      To forward this little fraud, they obtained so much favour of the\r\n      constable at Old Ford as to give them a certificate of their\r\n      passing from Essex through that village, and that they had not\r\n      been at London; which, though false in the common acceptance of\r\n      London in the county, yet was literally true, Wapping or Ratcliff\r\n      being no part either of the city or liberty.\r\n\r\n      This certificate directed to the next constable that was at\r\n      Homerton, one of the hamlets of the parish of Hackney, was so\r\n      serviceable to them that it procured them, not a free passage\r\n      there only, but a full certificate of health from a justice of\r\n      the peace, who upon the constable\xe2\x80\x99s application granted it\r\n      without much difficulty; and thus they passed through the long\r\n      divided town of Hackney (for it lay then in several separated\r\n      hamlets), and travelled on till they came into the great north\r\n      road on the top of Stamford Hill.\r\n\r\n      By this time they began to be weary, and so in the back-road from\r\n      Hackney, a little before it opened into the said great road, they\r\n      resolved to set up their tent and encamp for the first night,\r\n      which they did accordingly, with this addition, that finding a\r\n      barn, or a building like a barn, and first searching as well as\r\n      they could to be sure there was nobody in it, they set up their\r\n      tent, with the head of it against the barn. This they did also\r\n      because the wind blew that night very high, and they were but\r\n      young at such a way of lodging, as well as at the managing their\r\n      tent.\r\n\r\n      Here they went to sleep; but the joiner, a grave and sober man,\r\n      and not pleased with their lying at this loose rate the first\r\n      night, could not sleep, and resolved, after trying to sleep to no\r\n      purpose, that he would get out, and, taking the gun in his hand,\r\n      stand sentinel and guard his companions. So with the gun in his\r\n      hand, he walked to and again before the barn, for that stood in\r\n      the field near the road, but within the hedge. He had not been\r\n      long upon the scout but he heard a noise of people coming on, as\r\n      if it had been a great number, and they came on, as he thought,\r\n      directly towards the barn. He did not presently awake his\r\n      companions; but in a few minutes more, their noise growing louder\r\n      and louder, the biscuit-baker called to him and asked him what\r\n      was the matter, and quickly started out too. The other, being the\r\n      lame sailmaker and most weary, lay still in the tent.\r\n\r\n      As they expected, so the people whom they had heard came on\r\n      directly to the barn, when one of our travellers challenged, like\r\n      soldiers upon the guard, with \xe2\x80\x98Who comes there?\xe2\x80\x99 The people did\r\n      not answer immediately, but one of them speaking to another that\r\n      was behind him, \xe2\x80\x98Alas! alas! we are all disappointed,\xe2\x80\x99 says he.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Here are some people before us; the barn is taken up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      They all stopped upon that, as under some surprise, and it seems\r\n      there was about thirteen of them in all, and some women among\r\n      them. They consulted together what they should do, and by their\r\n      discourse our travellers soon found they were poor, distressed\r\n      people too, like themselves, seeking shelter and safety; and\r\n      besides, our travellers had no need to be afraid of their coming\r\n      up to disturb them, for as soon as they heard the words, \xe2\x80\x98Who\r\n      comes there?\xe2\x80\x99 these could hear the women say, as if frighted, \xe2\x80\x98Do\r\n      not go near them. How do you know but they may have the plague?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      And when one of the men said, \xe2\x80\x98Let us but speak to them\xe2\x80\x99, the\r\n      women said, \xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t by any means. We have escaped thus far by\r\n      the goodness of God; do not let us run into danger now, we\r\n      beseech you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      Our travellers found by this that they were a good, sober sort of\r\n      people, and flying for their lives, as they were; and, as they\r\n      were encouraged by it, so John said to the joiner, his comrade,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Let us encourage them too as much as we can\xe2\x80\x99; so he called to\r\n      them, \xe2\x80\x98Hark ye, good people,\xe2\x80\x99 says the joiner, \xe2\x80\x98we find by your\r\n      talk that you are flying from the same dreadful enemy as we are.\r\n      Do not be afraid of us; we are only three poor men of us. If you\r\n      are free from the distemper you shall not be hurt by us. We are\r\n      not in the barn, but in a little tent here in the outside, and we\r\n      will remove for you; we can set up our tent again immediately\r\n      anywhere else\xe2\x80\x99; and upon this a parley began between the joiner,\r\n      whose name was Richard, and one of their men, who said his name\r\n      was Ford.\r\n\r\n      Ford. And do you assure us that you are all sound men?\r\n\r\n      Richard. Nay, we are concerned to tell you of it, that you may\r\n      not be uneasy or think yourselves in danger; but you see we do\r\n      not desire you should put yourselves into any danger, and\r\n      therefore I tell you that we have not made use of the barn, so we\r\n      will remove from it, that you may be safe and we also.\r\n\r\n      Ford. That is very kind and charitable; but if we have reason to\r\n      be satisfied that you are sound and free from the visitation, why\r\n      should we make you remove now you are settled in your lodging,\r\n      and, it may be, are laid down to rest? We will go into the barn,\r\n      if you please, to rest ourselves a while, and we need not disturb\r\n      you.\r\n\r\n      Richard. Well, but you are more than we are. I hope you will\r\n      assure us that you are all of you sound too, for the danger is as\r\n      great from you to us as from us to you.\r\n\r\n      Ford. Blessed be God that some do escape, though it is but few;\r\n      what may be our portion still we know not, but hitherto we are\r\n      preserved.\r\n\r\n      Richard. What part of the town do you come from? Was the plague\r\n      come to the places where you lived?\r\n\r\n      Ford. Ay, ay, in a most frightful and terrible manner, or else we\r\n      had not fled away as we do; but we believe there will be very few\r\n      left alive behind us.\r\n\r\n      Richard. What part do you come from?\r\n\r\n      Ford. We are most of us of Cripplegate parish, only two or three\r\n      of Clerkenwell parish, but on the hither side.\r\n\r\n      Richard. How then was it that you came away no sooner?\r\n\r\n      Ford. We have been away some time, and kept together as well as\r\n      we could at the hither end of Islington, where we got leave to\r\n      lie in an old uninhabited house, and had some bedding and\r\n      conveniences of our own that we brought with us; but the plague\r\n      is come up into Islington too, and a house next door to our poor\r\n      dwelling was infected and shut up; and we are come away in a\r\n      fright.\r\n\r\n      Richard. And what way are you going?\r\n\r\n      Ford. As our lot shall cast us; we know not whither, but God will\r\n      guide those that look up to Him.\r\n\r\n      They parleyed no further at that time, but came all up to the\r\n      barn, and with some difficulty got into it. There was nothing but\r\n      hay in the barn, but it was almost full of that, and they\r\n      accommodated themselves as well as they could, and went to rest;\r\n      but our travellers observed that before they went to sleep an\r\n      ancient man who it seems was father of one of the women, went to\r\n      prayer with all the company, recommending themselves to the\r\n      blessing and direction of Providence, before they went to sleep.\r\n\r\n      It was soon day at that time of the year, and as Richard the\r\n      joiner had kept guard the first part of the night, so John the\r\n      soldier relieved him, and he had the post in the morning, and\r\n      they began to be acquainted with one another. It seems when they\r\n      left Islington they intended to have gone north, away to\r\n      Highgate, but were stopped at Holloway, and there they would not\r\n      let them pass; so they crossed over the fields and hills to the\r\n      eastward, and came out at the Boarded River, and so avoiding the\r\n      towns, they left Hornsey on the left hand and Newington on the\r\n      right hand, and came into the great road about Stamford Hill on\r\n      that side, as the three travellers had done on the other side.\r\n      And now they had thoughts of going over the river in the marshes,\r\n      and make forwards to Epping Forest, where they hoped they should\r\n      get leave to rest. It seems they were not poor, at least not so\r\n      poor as to be in want; at least they had enough to subsist them\r\n      moderately for two or three months, when, as they said, they were\r\n      in hopes the cold weather would check the infection, or at least\r\n      the violence of it would have spent itself, and would abate, if\r\n      it were only for want of people left alive to be infected.\r\n\r\n      This was much the fate of our three travellers, only that they\r\n      seemed to be the better furnished for travelling, and had it in\r\n      their view to go farther off; for as to the first, they did not\r\n      propose to go farther than one day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, that so they might\r\n      have intelligence every two or three days how things were at\r\n      London.\r\n\r\n      But here our travellers found themselves under an unexpected\r\n      inconvenience: namely that of their horse, for by means of the\r\n      horse to carry their baggage they were obliged to keep in the\r\n      road, whereas the people of this other band went over the fields\r\n      or roads, path or no path, way or no way, as they pleased;\r\n      neither had they any occasion to pass through any town, or come\r\n      near any town, other than to buy such things as they wanted for\r\n      their necessary subsistence, and in that indeed they were put to\r\n      much difficulty; of which in its place.\r\n\r\n      But our three travellers were obliged to keep the road, or else\r\n      they must commit spoil, and do the country a great deal of damage\r\n      in breaking down fences and gates to go over enclosed fields,\r\n      which they were loth to do if they could help it.\r\n\r\n      Our three travellers, however, had a great mind to join\r\n      themselves to this company and take their lot with them; and\r\n      after some discourse they laid aside their first design which\r\n      looked northward, and resolved to follow the other into Essex; so\r\n      in the morning they took up their tent and loaded their horse,\r\n      and away they travelled all together.\r\n\r\n      They had some difficulty in passing the ferry at the river-side,\r\n      the ferryman being afraid of them; but after some parley at a\r\n      distance, the ferryman was content to bring his boat to a place\r\n      distant from the usual ferry, and leave it there for them to take\r\n      it; so putting themselves over, he directed them to leave the\r\n      boat, and he, having another boat, said he would fetch it again,\r\n      which it seems, however, he did not do for above eight days.\r\n\r\n      Here, giving the ferryman money beforehand, they had a supply of\r\n      victuals and drink, which he brought and left in the boat for\r\n      them; but not without, as I said, having received the money\r\n      beforehand. But now our travellers were at a great loss and\r\n      difficulty how to get the horse over, the boat being small and\r\n      not fit for it: and at last could not do it without unloading the\r\n      baggage and making him swim over.\r\n\r\n      From the river they travelled towards the forest, but when they\r\n      came to Walthamstow the people of that town denied to admit them,\r\n      as was the case everywhere. The constables and their watchmen\r\n      kept them off at a distance and parleyed with them. They gave the\r\n      same account of themselves as before, but these gave no credit to\r\n      what they said, giving it for a reason that two or three\r\n      companies had already come that way and made the like pretences,\r\n      but that they had given several people the distemper in the towns\r\n      where they had passed; and had been afterwards so hardly used by\r\n      the country (though with justice, too, as they had deserved) that\r\n      about Brentwood, or that way, several of them perished in the\r\n      fields\xe2\x80\x94whether of the plague or of mere want and distress they\r\n      could not tell.\r\n\r\n      This was a good reason indeed why the people of Walthamstow\r\n      should be very cautious, and why they should resolve not to\r\n      entertain anybody that they were not well satisfied of. But, as\r\n      Richard the joiner and one of the other men who parleyed with\r\n      them told them, it was no reason why they should block up the\r\n      roads and refuse to let people pass through the town, and who\r\n      asked nothing of them but to go through the street; that if their\r\n      people were afraid of them, they might go into their houses and\r\n      shut their doors; they would neither show them civility nor\r\n      incivility, but go on about their business.\r\n\r\n      The constables and attendants, not to be persuaded by reason,\r\n      continued obstinate, and would hearken to nothing; so the two men\r\n      that talked with them went back to their fellows to consult what\r\n      was to be done. It was very discouraging in the whole, and they\r\n      knew not what to do for a good while; but at last John the\r\n      soldier and biscuit-maker, considering a while, \xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 says he,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98leave the rest of the parley to me.\xe2\x80\x99 He had not appeared yet, so\r\n      he sets the joiner, Richard, to work to cut some poles out of the\r\n      trees and shape them as like guns as he could, and in a little\r\n      time he had five or six fair muskets, which at a distance would\r\n      not be known; and about the part where the lock of a gun is he\r\n      caused them to wrap cloth and rags such as they had, as soldiers\r\n      do in wet weather to preserve the locks of their pieces from\r\n      rust; the rest was discoloured with clay or mud, such as they\r\n      could get; and all this while the rest of them sat under the\r\n      trees by his direction, in two or three bodies, where they made\r\n      fires at a good distance from one another.\r\n\r\n      While this was doing he advanced himself and two or three with\r\n      him, and set up their tent in the lane within sight of the\r\n      barrier which the town\xe2\x80\x99s men had made, and set a sentinel just by\r\n      it with the real gun, the only one they had, and who walked to\r\n      and fro with the gun on his shoulder, so as that the people of\r\n      the town might see them. Also, he tied the horse to a gate in the\r\n      hedge just by, and got some dry sticks together and kindled a\r\n      fire on the other side of the tent, so that the people of the\r\n      town could see the fire and the smoke, but could not see what\r\n      they were doing at it.\r\n\r\n      After the country people had looked upon them very earnestly a\r\n      great while, and, by all that they could see, could not but\r\n      suppose that they were a great many in company, they began to be\r\n      uneasy, not for their going away, but for staying where they\r\n      were; and above all, perceiving they had horses and arms, for\r\n      they had seen one horse and one gun at the tent, and they had\r\n      seen others of them walk about the field on the inside of the\r\n      hedge by the side of the lane with their muskets, as they took\r\n      them to be, shouldered; I say, upon such a sight as this, you may\r\n      be assured they were alarmed and terribly frighted, and it seems\r\n      they went to a justice of the peace to know what they should do.\r\n      What the justice advised them to I know not, but towards the\r\n      evening they called from the barrier, as above, to the sentinel\r\n      at the tent.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99 says John.[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] It seems John was in the tent, but hearing them call, he\r\n      steps out, and taking the gun upon his shoulder, talked to them\r\n      as if he had been the sentinel placed there upon the guard by\r\n      some officer that was his superior. [Footnote in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Why, what do you intend to do?\xe2\x80\x99 says the constable. \xe2\x80\x98To do,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      says John; \xe2\x80\x98what would you have us to do?\xe2\x80\x99 Constable. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      you be gone? What do you stay there for?\r\n\r\n      John. Why do you stop us on the king\xe2\x80\x99s highway, and pretend to\r\n      refuse us leave to go on our way?\r\n\r\n      Constable. We are not bound to tell you our reason, though we did\r\n      let you know it was because of the plague.\r\n\r\n      John. We told you we were all sound and free from the plague,\r\n      which we were not bound to have satisfied you of, and yet you\r\n      pretend to stop us on the highway.\r\n\r\n      Constable. We have a right to stop it up, and our own safety\r\n      obliges us to it. Besides, this is not the king\xe2\x80\x99s highway; \xe2\x80\x99tis a\r\n      way upon sufferance. You see here is a gate, and if we do let\r\n      people pass here, we make them pay toll.\r\n\r\n      John. We have a right to seek our own safety as well as you, and\r\n      you may see we are flying for our lives: and \xe2\x80\x99tis very\r\n      unchristian and unjust to stop us.\r\n\r\n      Constable. You may go back from whence you came; we do not hinder\r\n      you from that.\r\n\r\n      John. No; it is a stronger enemy than you that keeps us from\r\n      doing that, or else we should not have come hither.\r\n\r\n      Constable. Well, you may go any other way, then.\r\n\r\n      John. No, no; I suppose you see we are able to send you going,\r\n      and all the people of your parish, and come through your town\r\n      when we will; but since you have stopped us here, we are content.\r\n      You see we have encamped here, and here we will live. We hope you\r\n      will furnish us with victuals.\r\n\r\n      Constable. We furnish you! What mean you by that?\r\n\r\n      John. Why, you would not have us starve, would you? If you stop\r\n      us here, you must keep us.\r\n\r\n      Constable. You will be ill kept at our maintenance.\r\n\r\n      John. If you stint us, we shall make ourselves the better\r\n      allowance.\r\n\r\n      Constable. Why, you will not pretend to quarter upon us by force,\r\n      will you?\r\n\r\n      John. We have offered no violence to you yet. Why do you seem to\r\n      oblige us to it? I am an old soldier, and cannot starve, and if\r\n      you think that we shall be obliged to go back for want of\r\n      provisions, you are mistaken.\r\n\r\n      Constable. Since you threaten us, we shall take care to be strong\r\n      enough for you. I have orders to raise the county upon you.\r\n\r\n      John. It is you that threaten, not we. And since you are for\r\n      mischief, you cannot blame us if we do not give you time for it;\r\n      we shall begin our march in a few minutes.[2]\r\n\r\n       [2] This frighted the constable and the people that were with\r\n       him, that they immediately changed their note.\r\n\r\n      Constable. What is it you demand of us?\r\n\r\n      John. At first we desired nothing of you but leave to go through\r\n      the town; we should have offered no injury to any of you, neither\r\n      would you have had any injury or loss by us. We are not thieves,\r\n      but poor people in distress, and flying from the dreadful plague\r\n      in London, which devours thousands every week. We wonder how you\r\n      could be so unmerciful!\r\n\r\n      Constable. Self-preservation obliges us.\r\n\r\n      John. What! To shut up your compassion in a case of such distress\r\n      as this?\r\n\r\n      Constable. Well, if you will pass over the fields on your left\r\n      hand, and behind that part of the town, I will endeavour to have\r\n      gates opened for you.\r\n\r\n      John. Our horsemen[3] cannot pass with our baggage that way; it\r\n      does not lead into the road that we want to go, and why should\r\n      you force us out of the road? Besides, you have kept us here all\r\n      day without any provisions but such as we brought with us. I\r\n      think you ought to send us some provisions for our relief.\r\n\r\n       [3] They had but one horse among them. [Footnotes in the\r\n       original.]\r\n\r\n      Constable. If you will go another way we will send you some\r\n      provisions.\r\n\r\n      John. That is the way to have all the towns in the county stop up\r\n      the ways against us.\r\n\r\n      Constable. If they all furnish you with food, what will you be\r\n      the worse? I see you have tents; you want no lodging.\r\n\r\n      John. Well, what quantity of provisions will you send us?\r\n\r\n      Constable. How many are you?\r\n\r\n      John. Nay, we do not ask enough for all our company; we are in\r\n      three companies. If you will send us bread for twenty men and\r\n      about six or seven women for three days, and show us the way over\r\n      the field you speak of, we desire not to put your people into any\r\n      fear for us; we will go out of our way to oblige you, though we\r\n      are as free from infection as you are.[4]\r\n\r\n       [4] Here he called to one of his men, and bade him order Captain\r\n       Richard and his people to march the lower way on the side of the\r\n       marches, and meet them in the forest; which was all a sham, for\r\n       they had no Captain Richard, or any such company. [Footnote in\r\n       the original.]\r\n\r\n      Constable. And will you assure us that your other people shall\r\n      offer us no new disturbance?\r\n\r\n      John. No, no you may depend on it.\r\n\r\n      Constable. You must oblige yourself, too, that none of your\r\n      people shall come a step nearer than where the provisions we send\r\n      you shall be set down.\r\n\r\n      John. I answer for it we will not.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly they sent to the place twenty loaves of bread and\r\n      three or four large pieces of good beef, and opened some gates,\r\n      through which they passed; but none of them had courage so much\r\n      as to look out to see them go, and, as it was evening, if they\r\n      had looked they could not have seen them as to know how few they\r\n      were.\r\n\r\n      This was John the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s management. But this gave such an\r\n      alarm to the county, that had they really been two or three\r\n      hundred the whole county would have been raised upon them, and\r\n      they would have been sent to prison, or perhaps knocked on the\r\n      head.\r\n\r\n      They were soon made sensible of this, for two days afterwards\r\n      they found several parties of horsemen and footmen also about, in\r\n      pursuit of three companies of men, armed, as they said, with\r\n      muskets, who were broke out from London and had the plague upon\r\n      them, and that were not only spreading the distemper among the\r\n      people, but plundering the country.\r\n\r\n      As they saw now the consequence of their case, they soon saw the\r\n      danger they were in; so they resolved by the advice also of the\r\n      old soldier to divide themselves again. John and his two\r\n      comrades, with the horse, went away, as if towards Waltham; the\r\n      other in two companies, but all a little asunder, and went\r\n      towards Epping.\r\n\r\n      The first night they encamped all in the forest, and not far off\r\n      of one another, but not setting up the tent, lest that should\r\n      discover them. On the other hand, Richard went to work with his\r\n      axe and his hatchet, and cutting down branches of trees, he built\r\n      three tents or hovels, in which they all encamped with as much\r\n      convenience as they could expect.\r\n\r\n      The provisions they had at Walthamstow served them very\r\n      plentifully this night; and as for the next, they left it to\r\n      Providence. They had fared so well with the old soldier\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\r\n      that they now willingly made him their leader, and the first of\r\n      his conduct appeared to be very good. He told them that they were\r\n      now at a proper distance enough from London; that as they need\r\n      not be immediately beholden to the country for relief, so they\r\n      ought to be as careful the country did not infect them as that\r\n      they did not infect the country; that what little money they had,\r\n      they must be as frugal of as they could; that as he would not\r\n      have them think of offering the country any violence, so they\r\n      must endeavour to make the sense of their condition go as far\r\n      with the country as it could. They all referred themselves to his\r\n      direction, so they left their three houses standing, and the next\r\n      day went away towards Epping. The captain also (for so they now\r\n      called him), and his two fellow-travellers, laid aside their\r\n      design of going to Waltham, and all went together.\r\n\r\n      When they came near Epping they halted, choosing out a proper\r\n      place in the open forest, not very near the highway, but not far\r\n      out of it on the north side, under a little cluster of low\r\n      pollard-trees. Here they pitched their little camp\xe2\x80\x94which\r\n      consisted of three large tents or huts made of poles which their\r\n      carpenter, and such as were his assistants, cut down and fixed in\r\n      the ground in a circle, binding all the small ends together at\r\n      the top and thickening the sides with boughs of trees and bushes,\r\n      so that they were completely close and warm. They had, besides\r\n      this, a little tent where the women lay by themselves, and a hut\r\n      to put the horse in.\r\n\r\n      It happened that the next day, or next but one, was market-day at\r\n      Epping, when Captain John and one of the other men went to market\r\n      and bought some provisions; that is to say, bread, and some\r\n      mutton and beef; and two of the women went separately, as if they\r\n      had not belonged to the rest, and bought more. John took the\r\n      horse to bring it home, and the sack which the carpenter carried\r\n      his tools in, to put it in. The carpenter went to work and made\r\n      them benches and stools to sit on, such as the wood he could get\r\n      would afford, and a kind of table to dine on.\r\n\r\n      They were taken no notice of for two or three days, but after\r\n      that abundance of people ran out of the town to look at them, and\r\n      all the country was alarmed about them. The people at first\r\n      seemed afraid to come near them; and, on the other hand, they\r\n      desired the people to keep off, for there was a rumour that the\r\n      plague was at Waltham, and that it had been in Epping two or\r\n      three days; so John called out to them not to come to them,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98for,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98we are all whole and sound people here, and we\r\n      would not have you bring the plague among us, nor pretend we\r\n      brought it among you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      After this the parish officers came up to them and parleyed with\r\n      them at a distance, and desired to know who they were, and by\r\n      what authority they pretended to fix their stand at that place.\r\n      John answered very frankly, they were poor distressed people from\r\n      London who, foreseeing the misery they should be reduced to if\r\n      plague spread into the city, had fled out in time for their\r\n      lives, and, having no acquaintance or relations to fly to, had\r\n      first taken up at Islington; but, the plague being come into that\r\n      town, were fled farther; and as they supposed that the people of\r\n      Epping might have refused them coming into their town, they had\r\n      pitched their tents thus in the open field and in the forest,\r\n      being willing to bear all the hardships of such a disconsolate\r\n      lodging rather than have any one think or be afraid that they\r\n      should receive injury by them.\r\n\r\n      At first the Epping people talked roughly to them, and told them\r\n      they must remove; that this was no place for them; and that they\r\n      pretended to be sound and well, but that they might be infected\r\n      with the plague for aught they knew, and might infect the whole\r\n      country, and they could not suffer them there.\r\n\r\n      John argued very calmly with them a great while, and told them\r\n      that London was the place by which they\xe2\x80\x94that is, the townsmen of\r\n      Epping and all the country round them\xe2\x80\x94subsisted; to whom they\r\n      sold the produce of their lands, and out of whom they made their\r\n      rent of their farms; and to be so cruel to the inhabitants of\r\n      London, or to any of those by whom they gained so much, was very\r\n      hard, and they would be loth to have it remembered hereafter, and\r\n      have it told how barbarous, how inhospitable, and how unkind they\r\n      were to the people of London when they fled from the face of the\r\n      most terrible enemy in the world; that it would be enough to make\r\n      the name of an Epping man hateful through all the city, and to\r\n      have the rabble stone them in the very streets whenever they came\r\n      so much as to market; that they were not yet secure from being\r\n      visited themselves, and that, as he heard, Waltham was already;\r\n      that they would think it very hard that when any of them fled for\r\n      fear before they were touched, they should be denied the liberty\r\n      of lying so much as in the open fields.\r\n\r\n      The Epping men told them again, that they, indeed, said they were\r\n      sound and free from the infection, but that they had no assurance\r\n      of it; and that it was reported that there had been a great\r\n      rabble of people at Walthamstow, who made such pretences of being\r\n      sound as they did, but that they threatened to plunder the town\r\n      and force their way, whether the parish officers would or no;\r\n      that there were near two hundred of them, and had arms and tents\r\n      like Low Country soldiers; that they extorted provisions from the\r\n      town, by threatening them with living upon them at free quarter,\r\n      showing their arms, and talking in the language of soldiers; and\r\n      that several of them being gone away toward Rumford and\r\n      Brentwood, the country had been infected by them, and the plague\r\n      spread into both those large towns, so that the people durst not\r\n      go to market there as usual; that it was very likely they were\r\n      some of that party; and if so, they deserved to be sent to the\r\n      county jail, and be secured till they had made satisfaction for\r\n      the damage they had done, and for the terror and fright they had\r\n      put the country into.\r\n\r\n      John answered that what other people had done was nothing to\r\n      them; that they assured them they were all of one company; that\r\n      they had never been more in number than they saw them at that\r\n      time (which, by the way, was very true); that they came out in\r\n      two separate companies, but joined by the way, their cases being\r\n      the same; that they were ready to give what account of themselves\r\n      anybody could desire of them, and to give in their names and\r\n      places of abode, that so they might be called to an account for\r\n      any disorder that they might be guilty of; that the townsmen\r\n      might see they were content to live hardly, and only desired a\r\n      little room to breathe in on the forest where it was wholesome;\r\n      for where it was not they could not stay, and would decamp if\r\n      they found it otherwise there.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said the townsmen, \xe2\x80\x98we have a great charge of poor upon\r\n      our hands already, and we must take care not to increase it; we\r\n      suppose you can give us no security against your being chargeable\r\n      to our parish and to the inhabitants, any more than you can of\r\n      being dangerous to us as to the infection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Why, look you,\xe2\x80\x99 says John, \xe2\x80\x98as to being chargeable to you, we\r\n      hope we shall not. If you will relieve us with provisions for our\r\n      present necessity, we will be very thankful; as we all lived\r\n      without charity when we were at home, so we will oblige ourselves\r\n      fully to repay you, if God pleases to bring us back to our own\r\n      families and houses in safety, and to restore health to the\r\n      people of London.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98As to our dying here: we assure you, if any of us die, we that\r\n      survive will bury them, and put you to no expense, except it\r\n      should be that we should all die; and then, indeed, the last man\r\n      not being able to bury himself, would put you to that single\r\n      expense which I am persuaded\xe2\x80\x99, says John, \xe2\x80\x98he would leave enough\r\n      behind him to pay you for the expense of.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98On the other hand,\xe2\x80\x99 says John, \xe2\x80\x98if you shut up all bowels of\r\n      compassion, and not relieve us at all, we shall not extort\r\n      anything by violence or steal from any one; but when what little\r\n      we have is spent, if we perish for want, God\xe2\x80\x99s will be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      John wrought so upon the townsmen, by talking thus rationally and\r\n      smoothly to them, that they went away; and though they did not\r\n      give any consent to their staying there, yet they did not molest\r\n      them; and the poor people continued there three or four days\r\n      longer without any disturbance. In this time they had got some\r\n      remote acquaintance with a victualling-house at the outskirts of\r\n      the town, to whom they called at a distance to bring some little\r\n      things that they wanted, and which they caused to be set down at\r\n      a distance, and always paid for very honestly.\r\n\r\n      During this time the younger people of the town came frequently\r\n      pretty near them, and would stand and look at them, and sometimes\r\n      talk with them at some space between; and particularly it was\r\n      observed that the first Sabbath-day the poor people kept retired,\r\n      worshipped God together, and were heard to sing psalms.\r\n\r\n      These things, and a quiet, inoffensive behaviour, began to get\r\n      them the good opinion of the country, and people began to pity\r\n      them and speak very well of them; the consequence of which was,\r\n      that upon the occasion of a very wet, rainy night, a certain\r\n      gentleman who lived in the neighbourhood sent them a little cart\r\n      with twelve trusses or bundles of straw, as well for them to\r\n      lodge upon as to cover and thatch their huts and to keep them\r\n      dry. The minister of a parish not far off, not knowing of the\r\n      other, sent them also about two bushels of wheat and half a\r\n      bushel of white peas.\r\n\r\n      They were very thankful, to be sure, for this relief, and\r\n      particularly the straw was a\xe2\x80\x94very great comfort to them; for\r\n      though the ingenious carpenter had made frames for them to lie in\r\n      like troughs, and filled them with leaves of trees, and such\r\n      things as they could get, and had cut all their tent-cloth out to\r\n      make them coverlids, yet they lay damp and hard and unwholesome\r\n      till this straw came, which was to them like feather-beds, and,\r\n      as John said, more welcome than feather-beds would have been at\r\n      another time.\r\n\r\n      This gentleman and the minister having thus begun, and given an\r\n      example of charity to these wanderers, others quickly followed,\r\n      and they received every day some benevolence or other from the\r\n      people, but chiefly from the gentlemen who dwelt in the country\r\n      round them. Some sent them chairs, stools, tables, and such\r\n      household things as they gave notice they wanted; some sent them\r\n      blankets, rugs, and coverlids, some earthenware, and some kitchen\r\n      ware for ordering their food.\r\n\r\n      Encouraged by this good usage, their carpenter in a few days\r\n      built them a large shed or house with rafters, and a roof in\r\n      form, and an upper floor, in which they lodged warm: for the\r\n      weather began to be damp and cold in the beginning of September.\r\n      But this house, being well thatched, and the sides and roof made\r\n      very thick, kept out the cold well enough. He made, also, an\r\n      earthen wall at one end with a chimney in it, and another of the\r\n      company, with a vast deal of trouble and pains, made a funnel to\r\n      the chimney to carry out the smoke.\r\n\r\n      Here they lived comfortably, though coarsely, till the beginning\r\n      of September, when they had the bad news to hear, whether true or\r\n      not, that the plague, which was very hot at Waltham Abbey on one\r\n      side and at Rumford and Brentwood on the other side, was also\r\n      coming to Epping, to Woodford, and to most of the towns upon the\r\n      Forest, and which, as they said, was brought down among them\r\n      chiefly by the higlers, and such people as went to and from\r\n      London with provisions.\r\n\r\n      If this was true, it was an evident contradiction to that report\r\n      which was afterwards spread all over England, but which, as I\r\n      have said, I cannot confirm of my own knowledge: namely, that the\r\n      market-people carrying provisions to the city never got the\r\n      infection or carried it back into the country; both which, I have\r\n      been assured, has been false.\r\n\r\n      It might be that they were preserved even beyond expectation,\r\n      though not to a miracle, that abundance went and came and were\r\n      not touched; and that was much for the encouragement of the poor\r\n      people of London, who had been completely miserable if the people\r\n      that brought provisions to the markets had not been many times\r\n      wonderfully preserved, or at least more preserved than could be\r\n      reasonably expected.\r\n\r\n      But now these new inmates began to be disturbed more effectually,\r\n      for the towns about them were really infected, and they began to\r\n      be afraid to trust one another so much as to go abroad for such\r\n      things as they wanted, and this pinched them very hard, for now\r\n      they had little or nothing but what the charitable gentlemen of\r\n      the country supplied them with. But, for their encouragement, it\r\n      happened that other gentlemen in the country who had not sent\r\n      them anything before, began to hear of them and supply them, and\r\n      one sent them a large pig\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, a porker\xe2\x80\x94another two\r\n      sheep, and another sent them a calf. In short, they had meat\r\n      enough, and sometimes had cheese and milk, and all such things.\r\n      They were chiefly put to it for bread, for when the gentlemen\r\n      sent them corn they had nowhere to bake it or to grind it. This\r\n      made them eat the first two bushel of wheat that was sent them in\r\n      parched corn, as the Israelites of old did, without grinding or\r\n      making bread of it.\r\n\r\n      At last they found means to carry their corn to a windmill near\r\n      Woodford, where they had it ground, and afterwards the\r\n      biscuit-maker made a hearth so hollow and dry that he could bake\r\n      biscuit-cakes tolerably well; and thus they came into a condition\r\n      to live without any assistance or supplies from the towns; and it\r\n      was well they did, for the country was soon after fully infected,\r\n      and about 120 were said to have died of the distemper in the\r\n      villages near them, which was a terrible thing to them.\r\n\r\n      On this they called a new council, and now the towns had no need\r\n      to be afraid they should settle near them; but, on the contrary,\r\n      several families of the poorer sort of the inhabitants quitted\r\n      their houses and built huts in the forest after the same manner\r\n      as they had done. But it was observed that several of these poor\r\n      people that had so removed had the sickness even in their huts or\r\n      booths; the reason of which was plain, namely, not because they\r\n      removed into the air, but, (1) because they did not remove time\r\n      enough; that is to say, not till, by openly conversing with the\r\n      other people their neighbours, they had the distemper upon them,\r\n      or (as may be said) among them, and so carried it about them\r\n      whither they went. Or (2) because they were not careful enough,\r\n      after they were safely removed out of the towns, not to come in\r\n      again and mingle with the diseased people.\r\n\r\n      But be it which of these it will, when our travellers began to\r\n      perceive that the plague was not only in the towns, but even in\r\n      the tents and huts on the forest near them, they began then not\r\n      only to be afraid, but to think of decamping and removing; for\r\n      had they stayed they would have been in manifest danger of their\r\n      lives.\r\n\r\n      It is not to be wondered that they were greatly afflicted at\r\n      being obliged to quit the place where they had been so kindly\r\n      received, and where they had been treated with so much humanity\r\n      and charity; but necessity and the hazard of life, which they\r\n      came out so far to preserve, prevailed with them, and they saw no\r\n      remedy. John, however, thought of a remedy for their present\r\n      misfortune: namely, that he would first acquaint that gentleman\r\n      who was their principal benefactor with the distress they were\r\n      in, and to crave his assistance and advice.\r\n\r\n      The good, charitable gentleman encouraged them to quit the Place\r\n      for fear they should be cut off from any retreat at all by the\r\n      violence of the distemper; but whither they should go, that he\r\n      found very hard to direct them to. At last John asked of him\r\n      whether he, being a justice of the peace, would give them\r\n      certificates of health to other justices whom they might come\r\n      before; that so whatever might be their lot, they might not be\r\n      repulsed now they had been also so long from London. This his\r\n      worship immediately granted, and gave them proper letters of\r\n      health, and from thence they were at liberty to travel whither\r\n      they pleased.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly they had a full certificate of health, intimating\r\n      that they had resided in a village in the county of Essex so long\r\n      that, being examined and scrutinised sufficiently, and having\r\n      been retired from all conversation for above forty days, without\r\n      any appearance of sickness, they were therefore certainly\r\n      concluded to be sound men, and might be safely entertained\r\n      anywhere, having at last removed rather for fear of the plague\r\n      which was come into such a town, rather than for having any\r\n      signal of infection upon them, or upon any belonging to them.\r\n\r\n      With this certificate they removed, though with great reluctance;\r\n      and John inclining not to go far from home, they moved towards\r\n      the marshes on the side of Waltham. But here they found a man\r\n      who, it seems, kept a weir or stop upon the river, made to raise\r\n      the water for the barges which go up and down the river, and he\r\n      terrified them with dismal stories of the sickness having been\r\n      spread into all the towns on the river and near the river, on the\r\n      side of Middlesex and Hertfordshire; that is to say, into\r\n      Waltham, Waltham Cross, Enfield, and Ware, and all the towns on\r\n      the road, that they were afraid to go that way; though it seems\r\n      the man imposed upon them, for that the thing was not really\r\n      true.\r\n\r\n      However, it terrified them, and they resolved to move across the\r\n      forest towards Rumford and Brentwood; but they heard that there\r\n      were numbers of people fled out of London that way, who lay up\r\n      and down in the forest called Henalt Forest, reaching near\r\n      Rumford, and who, having no subsistence or habitation, not only\r\n      lived oddly and suffered great extremities in the woods and\r\n      fields for want of relief, but were said to be made so desperate\r\n      by those extremities as that they offered many violences to the\r\n      county, robbed and plundered, and killed cattle, and the like;\r\n      that others, building huts and hovels by the roadside, begged,\r\n      and that with an importunity next door to demanding relief; so\r\n      that the county was very uneasy, and had been obliged to take\r\n      some of them up.\r\n\r\n      This in the first place intimated to them, that they would be\r\n      sure to find the charity and kindness of the county, which they\r\n      had found here where they were before, hardened and shut up\r\n      against them; and that, on the other hand, they would be\r\n      questioned wherever they came, and would be in danger of violence\r\n      from others in like cases as themselves.\r\n\r\n      Upon all these considerations John, their captain, in all their\r\n      names, went back to their good friend and benefactor, who had\r\n      relieved them before, and laying their case truly before him,\r\n      humbly asked his advice; and he as kindly advised them to take up\r\n      their old quarters again, or if not, to remove but a little\r\n      farther out of the road, and directed them to a proper place for\r\n      them; and as they really wanted some house rather than huts to\r\n      shelter them at that time of the year, it growing on towards\r\n      Michaelmas, they found an old decayed house which had been\r\n      formerly some cottage or little habitation but was so out of\r\n      repair as scarce habitable; and by the consent of a farmer to\r\n      whose farm it belonged, they got leave to make what use of it\r\n      they could.\r\n\r\n      The ingenious joiner, and all the rest, by his directions went to\r\n      work with it, and in a very few days made it capable to shelter\r\n      them all in case of bad weather; and in which there was an old\r\n      chimney and old oven, though both lying in ruins; yet they made\r\n      them both fit for use, and, raising additions, sheds, and leantos\r\n      on every side, they soon made the house capable to hold them all.\r\n\r\n      They chiefly wanted boards to make window-shutters, floors,\r\n      doors, and several other things; but as the gentlemen above\r\n      favoured them, and the country was by that means made easy with\r\n      them, and above all, that they were known to be all sound and in\r\n      good health, everybody helped them with what they could spare.\r\n\r\n      Here they encamped for good and all, and resolved to remove no\r\n      more. They saw plainly how terribly alarmed that county was\r\n      everywhere at anybody that came from London, and that they should\r\n      have no admittance anywhere but with the utmost difficulty; at\r\n      least no friendly reception and assistance as they had received\r\n      here.\r\n\r\n      Now, although they received great assistance and encouragement\r\n      from the country gentlemen and from the people round about them,\r\n      yet they were put to great straits: for the weather grew cold and\r\n      wet in October and November, and they had not been used to so\r\n      much hardship; so that they got colds in their limbs, and\r\n      distempers, but never had the infection; and thus about December\r\n      they came home to the city again.\r\n\r\n      I give this story thus at large, principally to give an account\r\n      what became of the great numbers of people which immediately\r\n      appeared in the city as soon as the sickness abated; for, as I\r\n      have said, great numbers of those that were able and had retreats\r\n      in the country fled to those retreats. So, when it was increased\r\n      to such a frightful extremity as I have related, the middling\r\n      people who had not friends fled to all parts of the country where\r\n      they could get shelter, as well those that had money to relieve\r\n      themselves as those that had not. Those that had money always\r\n      fled farthest, because they were able to subsist themselves; but\r\n      those who were empty suffered, as I have said, great hardships,\r\n      and were often driven by necessity to relieve their wants at the\r\n      expense of the country. By that means the country was made very\r\n      uneasy at them, and sometimes took them up; though even then they\r\n      scarce knew what to do with them, and were always very backward\r\n      to punish them, but often, too, they forced them from place to\r\n      place till they were obliged to come back again to London.\r\n\r\n      I have, since my knowing this story of John and his brother,\r\n      inquired and found that there were a great many of the poor\r\n      disconsolate people, as above, fled into the country every way;\r\n      and some of them got little sheds and barns and outhouses to live\r\n      in, where they could obtain so much kindness of the country, and\r\n      especially where they had any the least satisfactory account to\r\n      give of themselves, and particularly that they did not come out\r\n      of London too late. But others, and that in great numbers, built\r\n      themselves little huts and retreats in the fields and woods, and\r\n      lived like hermits in holes and caves, or any place they could\r\n      find, and where, we may be sure, they suffered great extremities,\r\n      such that many of them were obliged to come back again whatever\r\n      the danger was; and so those little huts were often found empty,\r\n      and the country people supposed the inhabitants lay dead in them\r\n      of the plague, and would not go near them for fear\xe2\x80\x94no, not in a\r\n      great while; nor is it unlikely but that some of the unhappy\r\n      wanderers might die so all alone, even sometimes for want of\r\n      help, as particularly in one tent or hut was found a man dead,\r\n      and on the gate of a field just by was cut with his knife in\r\n      uneven letters the following words, by which it may be supposed\r\n      the other man escaped, or that, one dying first, the other buried\r\n      him as well as he could:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     O mIsErY!\r\n     We BoTH ShaLL DyE,\r\n     WoE, WoE.\r\n\r\n      I have given an account already of what I found to have been the\r\n      case down the river among the seafaring men; how the ships lay in\r\n      the offing, as it\xe2\x80\x99s called, in rows or lines astern of one\r\n      another, quite down from the Pool as far as I could see. I have\r\n      been told that they lay in the same manner quite down the river\r\n      as low as Gravesend, and some far beyond: even everywhere or in\r\n      every place where they could ride with safety as to wind and\r\n      weather; nor did I ever hear that the plague reached to any of\r\n      the people on board those ships\xe2\x80\x94except such as lay up in the\r\n      Pool, or as high as Deptford Reach, although the people went\r\n      frequently on shore to the country towns and villages and\r\n      farmers\xe2\x80\x99 houses, to buy fresh provisions, fowls, pigs, calves,\r\n      and the like for their supply.\r\n\r\n      Likewise I found that the watermen on the river above the bridge\r\n      found means to convey themselves away up the river as far as they\r\n      could go, and that they had, many of them, their whole families\r\n      in their boats, covered with tilts and bales, as they call them,\r\n      and furnished with straw within for their lodging, and that they\r\n      lay thus all along by the shore in the marshes, some of them\r\n      setting up little tents with their sails, and so lying under them\r\n      on shore in the day, and going into their boats at night; and in\r\n      this manner, as I have heard, the river-sides were lined with\r\n      boats and people as long as they had anything to subsist on, or\r\n      could get anything of the country; and indeed the country people,\r\n      as well Gentlemen as others, on these and all other occasions,\r\n      were very forward to relieve them\xe2\x80\x94but they were by no means\r\n      willing to receive them into their towns and houses, and for that\r\n      we cannot blame them.\r\n\r\n      There was one unhappy citizen within my knowledge who had been\r\n      visited in a dreadful manner, so that his wife and all his\r\n      children were dead, and himself and two servants only left, with\r\n      an elderly woman, a near relation, who had nursed those that were\r\n      dead as well as she could. This disconsolate man goes to a\r\n      village near the town, though not within the bills of mortality,\r\n      and finding an empty house there, inquires out the owner, and\r\n      took the house. After a few days he got a cart and loaded it with\r\n      goods, and carries them down to the house; the people of the\r\n      village opposed his driving the cart along; but with some\r\n      arguings and some force, the men that drove the cart along got\r\n      through the street up to the door of the house. There the\r\n      constable resisted them again, and would not let them be brought\r\n      in. The man caused the goods to be unloaden and laid at the door,\r\n      and sent the cart away; upon which they carried the man before a\r\n      justice of peace; that is to say, they commanded him to go, which\r\n      he did. The justice ordered him to cause the cart to fetch away\r\n      the goods again, which he refused to do; upon which the justice\r\n      ordered the constable to pursue the carters and fetch them back,\r\n      and make them reload the goods and carry them away, or to set\r\n      them in the stocks till they came for further orders; and if they\r\n      could not find them, nor the man would not consent to take them\r\n      away, they should cause them to be drawn with hooks from the\r\n      house-door and burned in the street. The poor distressed man upon\r\n      this fetched the goods again, but with grievous cries and\r\n      lamentations at the hardship of his case. But there was no\r\n      remedy; self-preservation obliged the people to those severities\r\n      which they would not otherwise have been concerned in. Whether\r\n      this poor man lived or died I cannot tell, but it was reported\r\n      that he had the plague upon him at that time; and perhaps the\r\n      people might report that to justify their usage of him; but it\r\n      was not unlikely that either he or his goods, or both, were\r\n      dangerous, when his whole family had been dead of the distempers\r\n      so little a while before.\r\n\r\n      I know that the inhabitants of the towns adjacent to London were\r\n      much blamed for cruelty to the poor people that ran from the\r\n      contagion in their distress, and many very severe things were\r\n      done, as may be seen from what has been said; but I cannot but\r\n      say also that, where there was room for charity and assistance to\r\n      the people, without apparent danger to themselves, they were\r\n      willing enough to help and relieve them. But as every town were\r\n      indeed judges in their own case, so the poor people who ran\r\n      abroad in their extremities were often ill-used and driven back\r\n      again into the town; and this caused infinite exclamations and\r\n      outcries against the country towns, and made the clamour very\r\n      popular.\r\n\r\n      And yet, more or less, (with) all the caution, there was not a\r\n      town of any note within ten (or, I believe, twenty) miles of the\r\n      city but what was more or less infected and had some died among\r\n      them. I have heard the accounts of several, such as they were\r\n      reckoned up, as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     In Enfield           32          In Uxbridge        117\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Hornsey           58               \xe2\x80\x9d  Hertford    90\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Newington         17          \xe2\x80\x9d  Ware            160\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Tottenham         42          \xe2\x80\x9d  Hodsdon          30\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Edmonton          19          \xe2\x80\x9d  Waltham Abbey    23\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Barnet and Hadly  19          \xe2\x80\x9d  Epping           26\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  St Albans        121          \xe2\x80\x9d  Deptford        623\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Watford           45          \xe2\x80\x9d  Greenwich       231\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Eltham and Lusum  85          \xe2\x80\x9d  Kingston        122\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Croydon           61          \xe2\x80\x9d  Stanes           82\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Brentwood         70          \xe2\x80\x9d  Chertsey         18\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Rumford          109          \xe2\x80\x9d  Windsor         103\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Barking Abbot    200\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d  Brentford        432                       Cum aliis.\r\n\r\n      Another thing might render the country more strict with respect\r\n      to the citizens, and especially with respect to the poor, and\r\n      this was what I hinted at before: namely, that there was a\r\n      seeming propensity or a wicked inclination in those that were\r\n      infected to infect others.\r\n\r\n      There have been great debates among our physicians as to the\r\n      reason of this. Some will have it to be in the nature of the\r\n      disease, and that it impresses every one that is seized upon by\r\n      it with a kind of a rage, and a hatred against their own kind\xe2\x80\x94as\r\n      if there was a malignity not only in the distemper to communicate\r\n      itself, but in the very nature of man, prompting him with evil\r\n      will or an evil eye, that, as they say in the case of a mad dog,\r\n      who though the gentlest creature before of any of his kind, yet\r\n      then will fly upon and bite any one that comes next him, and\r\n      those as soon as any who had been most observed by him before.\r\n\r\n      Others placed it to the account of the corruption of human\r\n      nature, who cannot bear to see itself more miserable than others\r\n      of its own species, and has a kind of involuntary wish that all\r\n      men were as unhappy or in as bad a condition as itself.\r\n\r\n      Others say it was only a kind of desperation, not knowing or\r\n      regarding what they did, and consequently unconcerned at the\r\n      danger or safety not only of anybody near them, but even of\r\n      themselves also. And indeed, when men are once come to a\r\n      condition to abandon themselves, and be unconcerned for the\r\n      safety or at the danger of themselves, it cannot be so much\r\n      wondered that they should be careless of the safety of other\r\n      people.\r\n\r\n      But I choose to give this grave debate a quite different turn,\r\n      and answer it or resolve it all by saying that I do not grant the\r\n      fact. On the contrary, I say that the thing is not really so, but\r\n      that it was a general complaint raised by the people inhabiting\r\n      the outlying villages against the citizens to justify, or at\r\n      least excuse, those hardships and severities so much talked of,\r\n      and in which complaints both sides may be said to have injured\r\n      one another; that is to say, the citizens pressing to be received\r\n      and harboured in time of distress, and with the plague upon them,\r\n      complain of the cruelty and injustice of the country people in\r\n      being refused entrance and forced back again with their goods and\r\n      families; and the inhabitants, finding themselves so imposed\r\n      upon, and the citizens breaking in as it were upon them whether\r\n      they would or no, complain that when they were infected they were\r\n      not only regardless of others, but even willing to infect them;\r\n      neither of which were really true\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, in the colours\r\n      they were described in.\r\n\r\n      It is true there is something to be said for the frequent alarms\r\n      which were given to the country of the resolution of the people\r\n      of London to come out by force, not only for relief, but to\r\n      plunder and rob; that they ran about the streets with the\r\n      distemper upon them without any control; and that no care was\r\n      taken to shut up houses, and confine the sick people from\r\n      infecting others; whereas, to do the Londoners justice, they\r\n      never practised such things, except in such particular cases as I\r\n      have mentioned above, and such like. On the other hand,\r\n      everything was managed with so much care, and such excellent\r\n      order was observed in the whole city and suburbs by the care of\r\n      the Lord Mayor and aldermen and by the justices of the peace,\r\n      church-wardens, &c., in the outparts, that London may be a\r\n      pattern to all the cities in the world for the good government\r\n      and the excellent order that was everywhere kept, even in the\r\n      time of the most violent infection, and when the people were in\r\n      the utmost consternation and distress. But of this I shall speak\r\n      by itself.\r\n\r\n      One thing, it is to be observed, was owing principally to the\r\n      prudence of the magistrates, and ought to be mentioned to their\r\n      honour: viz., the moderation which they used in the great and\r\n      difficult work of shutting up of houses. It is true, as I have\r\n      mentioned, that the shutting up of houses was a great subject of\r\n      discontent, and I may say indeed the only subject of discontent\r\n      among the people at that time; for the confining the sound in the\r\n      same house with the sick was counted very terrible, and the\r\n      complaints of people so confined were very grievous. They were\r\n      heard into the very streets, and they were sometimes such that\r\n      called for resentment, though oftener for compassion. They had no\r\n      way to converse with any of their friends but out at their\r\n      windows, where they would make such piteous lamentations as often\r\n      moved the hearts of those they talked with, and of others who,\r\n      passing by, heard their story; and as those complaints oftentimes\r\n      reproached the severity, and sometimes the insolence, of the\r\n      watchmen placed at their doors, those watchmen would answer\r\n      saucily enough, and perhaps be apt to affront the people who were\r\n      in the street talking to the said families; for which, or for\r\n      their ill-treatment of the families, I think seven or eight of\r\n      them in several places were killed; I know not whether I should\r\n      say murdered or not, because I cannot enter into the particular\r\n      cases. It is true the watchmen were on their duty, and acting in\r\n      the post where they were placed by a lawful authority; and\r\n      killing any public legal officer in the execution of his office\r\n      is always, in the language of the law, called murder. But as they\r\n      were not authorised by the magistrates\xe2\x80\x99 instructions, or by the\r\n      power they acted under, to be injurious or abusive either to the\r\n      people who were under their observation or to any that concerned\r\n      themselves for them; so when they did so, they might be said to\r\n      act themselves, not their office; to act as private persons, not\r\n      as persons employed; and consequently, if they brought mischief\r\n      upon themselves by such an undue behaviour, that mischief was\r\n      upon their own heads; and indeed they had so much the hearty\r\n      curses of the people, whether they deserved it or not, that\r\n      whatever befell them nobody pitied them, and everybody was apt to\r\n      say they deserved it, whatever it was. Nor do I remember that\r\n      anybody was ever punished, at least to any considerable degree,\r\n      for whatever was done to the watchmen that guarded their houses.\r\n\r\n      What variety of stratagems were used to escape and get out of\r\n      houses thus shut up, by which the watchmen were deceived or\r\n      overpowered, and that the people got away, I have taken notice of\r\n      already, and shall say no more to that. But I say the magistrates\r\n      did moderate and ease families upon many occasions in this case,\r\n      and particularly in that of taking away, or suffering to be\r\n      removed, the sick persons out of such houses when they were\r\n      willing to be removed either to a pest-house or other Places; and\r\n      sometimes giving the well persons in the family so shut up, leave\r\n      to remove upon information given that they were well, and that\r\n      they would confine themselves in such houses where they went so\r\n      long as should be required of them. The concern, also, of the\r\n      magistrates for the supplying such poor families as were\r\n      infected\xe2\x80\x94I say, supplying them with necessaries, as well physic\r\n      as food\xe2\x80\x94was very great, and in which they did not content\r\n      themselves with giving the necessary orders to the officers\r\n      appointed, but the aldermen in person, and on horseback,\r\n      frequently rode to such houses and caused the people to be asked\r\n      at their windows whether they were duly attended or not; also,\r\n      whether they wanted anything that was necessary, and if the\r\n      officers had constantly carried their messages and fetched them\r\n      such things as they wanted or not. And if they answered in the\r\n      affirmative, all was well; but if they complained that they were\r\n      ill supplied, and that the officer did not do his duty, or did\r\n      not treat them civilly, they (the officers) were generally\r\n      removed, and others placed in their stead.\r\n\r\n      It is true such complaint might be unjust, and if the officer had\r\n      such arguments to use as would convince the magistrate that he\r\n      was right, and that the people had injured him, he was continued\r\n      and they reproved. But this part could not well bear a particular\r\n      inquiry, for the parties could very ill be well heard and\r\n      answered in the street from the windows, as was the case then.\r\n      The magistrates, therefore, generally chose to favour the people\r\n      and remove the man, as what seemed to be the least wrong and of\r\n      the least ill consequence; seeing if the watchman was injured,\r\n      yet they could easily make him amends by giving him another post\r\n      of the like nature; but if the family was injured, there was no\r\n      satisfaction could be made to them, the damage perhaps being\r\n      irreparable, as it concerned their lives.\r\n\r\n      A great variety of these cases frequently happened between the\r\n      watchmen and the poor people shut up, besides those I formerly\r\n      mentioned about escaping. Sometimes the watchmen were absent,\r\n      sometimes drunk, sometimes asleep when the people wanted them,\r\n      and such never failed to be punished severely, as indeed they\r\n      deserved.\r\n\r\n      But after all that was or could be done in these cases, the\r\n      shutting up of houses, so as to confine those that were well with\r\n      those that were sick, had very great inconveniences in it, and\r\n      some that were very tragical, and which merited to have been\r\n      considered if there had been room for it. But it was authorised\r\n      by a law, it had the public good in view as the end chiefly aimed\r\n      at, and all the private injuries that were done by the putting it\r\n      in execution must be put to the account of the public benefit.\r\n\r\n      It is doubtful to this day whether, in the whole, it contributed\r\n      anything to the stop of the infection; and indeed I cannot say it\r\n      did, for nothing could run with greater fury and rage than the\r\n      infection did when it was in its chief violence, though the\r\n      houses infected were shut up as exactly and as effectually as it\r\n      was possible. Certain it is that if all the infected persons were\r\n      effectually shut in, no sound person could have been infected by\r\n      them, because they could not have come near them. But the case\r\n      was this (and I shall only touch it here): namely, that the\r\n      infection was propagated insensibly, and by such persons as were\r\n      not visibly infected, who neither knew whom they infected or who\r\n      they were infected by.\r\n\r\n      A house in Whitechappel was shut up for the sake of one infected\r\n      maid, who had only spots, not the tokens come out upon her, and\r\n      recovered; yet these people obtained no liberty to stir, neither\r\n      for air or exercise, forty days. Want of breath, fear, anger,\r\n      vexation, and all the other gifts attending such an injurious\r\n      treatment cast the mistress of the family into a fever, and\r\n      visitors came into the house and said it was the plague, though\r\n      the physicians declared it was not. However, the family were\r\n      obliged to begin their quarantine anew on the report of the\r\n      visitors or examiner, though their former quarantine wanted but a\r\n      few days of being finished. This oppressed them so with anger and\r\n      grief, and, as before, straitened them also so much as to room,\r\n      and for want of breathing and free air, that most of the family\r\n      fell sick, one of one distemper, one of another, chiefly\r\n      scorbutic ailments; only one, a violent colic; till, after\r\n      several prolongings of their confinement, some or other of those\r\n      that came in with the visitors to inspect the persons that were\r\n      ill, in hopes of releasing them, brought the distemper with them\r\n      and infected the whole house; and all or most of them died, not\r\n      of the plague as really upon them before, but of the plague that\r\n      those people brought them, who should have been careful to have\r\n      protected them from it. And this was a thing which frequently\r\n      happened, and was indeed one of the worst consequences of\r\n      shutting houses up.\r\n\r\n      I had about this time a little hardship put upon me, which I was\r\n      at first greatly afflicted at, and very much disturbed about\r\n      though, as it proved, it did not expose me to any disaster; and\r\n      this was being appointed by the alderman of Portsoken Ward one of\r\n      the examiners of the houses in the precinct where I lived. We had\r\n      a large parish, and had no less than eighteen examiners, as the\r\n      order called us; the people called us visitors. I endeavoured\r\n      with all my might to be excused from such an employment, and used\r\n      many arguments with the alderman\xe2\x80\x99s deputy to be excused;\r\n      particularly I alleged that I was against shutting up houses at\r\n      all, and that it would be very hard to oblige me to be an\r\n      instrument in that which was against my judgement, and which I\r\n      did verily believe would not answer the end it was intended for;\r\n      but all the abatement I could get was only, that whereas the\r\n      officer was appointed by my Lord Mayor to continue two months, I\r\n      should be obliged to hold it but three weeks, on condition\r\n      nevertheless that I could then get some other sufficient\r\n      housekeeper to serve the rest of the time for me\xe2\x80\x94which was, in\r\n      short, but a very small favour, it being very difficult to get\r\n      any man to accept of such an employment, that was fit to be\r\n      entrusted with it.\r\n\r\n      It is true that shutting up of houses had one effect, which I am\r\n      sensible was of moment, namely, it confined the distempered\r\n      people, who would otherwise have been both very troublesome and\r\n      very dangerous in their running about streets with the distemper\r\n      upon them\xe2\x80\x94which, when they were delirious, they would have done\r\n      in a most frightful manner, and as indeed they began to do at\r\n      first very much, till they were thus restrained; nay, so very\r\n      open they were that the poor would go about and beg at people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      doors, and say they had the plague upon them, and beg rags for\r\n      their sores, or both, or anything that delirious nature happened\r\n      to think of.\r\n\r\n      A poor, unhappy gentlewoman, a substantial citizen\xe2\x80\x99s wife, was\r\n      (if the story be true) murdered by one of these creatures in\r\n      Aldersgate Street, or that way. He was going along the street,\r\n      raving mad to be sure, and singing; the people only said he was\r\n      drunk, but he himself said he had the plague upon him, which it\r\n      seems was true; and meeting this gentlewoman, he would kiss her.\r\n      She was terribly frighted, as he was only a rude fellow, and she\r\n      ran from him, but the street being very thin of people, there was\r\n      nobody near enough to help her. When she saw he would overtake\r\n      her, she turned and gave him a thrust so forcibly, he being but\r\n      weak, and pushed him down backward. But very unhappily, she being\r\n      so near, he caught hold of her and pulled her down also, and\r\n      getting up first, mastered her and kissed her; and which was\r\n      worst of all, when he had done, told her he had the plague, and\r\n      why should not she have it as well as he? She was frighted enough\r\n      before, being also young with child; but when she heard him say\r\n      he had the plague, she screamed out and fell down into a swoon,\r\n      or in a fit, which, though she recovered a little, yet killed her\r\n      in a very few days; and I never heard whether she had the plague\r\n      or no.\r\n\r\n      Another infected person came and knocked at the door of a\r\n      citizen\xe2\x80\x99s house where they knew him very well; the servant let\r\n      him in, and being told the master of the house was above, he ran\r\n      up and came into the room to them as the whole family was at\r\n      supper. They began to rise up, a little surprised, not knowing\r\n      what the matter was; but he bid them sit still, he only came to\r\n      take his leave of them. They asked him, \xe2\x80\x98Why, Mr\xe2\x80\x94, where are you\r\n      going?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Going,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98I have got the sickness, and shall die\r\n      tomorrow night.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99Tis easy to believe, though not to describe,\r\n      the consternation they were all in. The women and the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      daughters, which were but little girls, were frighted almost to\r\n      death and got up, one running out at one door and one at another,\r\n      some downstairs and some upstairs, and getting together as well\r\n      as they could, locked themselves into their chambers and screamed\r\n      out at the window for help, as if they had been frighted out of\r\n      their wits. The master, more composed than they, though both\r\n      frighted and provoked, was going to lay hands on him and throw\r\n      him downstairs, being in a passion; but then, considering a\r\n      little the condition of the man and the danger of touching him,\r\n      horror seized his mind, and he stood still like one astonished.\r\n      The poor distempered man all this while, being as well diseased\r\n      in his brain as in his body, stood still like one amazed. At\r\n      length he turns round: \xe2\x80\x98Ay!\xe2\x80\x99 says he, with all the seeming\r\n      calmness imaginable, \xe2\x80\x98is it so with you all? Are you all\r\n      disturbed at me? Why, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll e\xe2\x80\x99en go home and die there.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\n      so he goes immediately downstairs. The servant that had let him\r\n      in goes down after him with a candle, but was afraid to go past\r\n      him and open the door, so he stood on the stairs to see what he\r\n      would do. The man went and opened the door, and went out and\r\n      flung the door after him. It was some while before the family\r\n      recovered the fright, but as no ill consequence attended, they\r\n      have had occasion since to speak of it (You may be sure) with\r\n      great satisfaction. Though the man was gone, it was some\r\n      time\xe2\x80\x94nay, as I heard, some days before they recovered themselves\r\n      of the hurry they were in; nor did they go up and down the house\r\n      with any assurance till they had burnt a great variety of fumes\r\n      and perfumes in all the rooms, and made a great many smokes of\r\n      pitch, of gunpowder, and of sulphur, all separately shifted, and\r\n      washed their clothes, and the like. As to the poor man, whether\r\n      he lived or died I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\r\n\r\n      It is most certain that, if by the shutting up of houses the sick\r\n      had not been confined, multitudes who in the height of their\r\n      fever were delirious and distracted would have been continually\r\n      running up and down the streets; and even as it was a very great\r\n      number did so, and offered all sorts of violence to those they\r\n      met, even just as a mad dog runs on and bites at every one he\r\n      meets; nor can I doubt but that, should one of those infected,\r\n      diseased creatures have bitten any man or woman while the frenzy\r\n      of the distemper was upon them, they, I mean the person so\r\n      wounded, would as certainly have been incurably infected as one\r\n      that was sick before, and had the tokens upon him.\r\n\r\n      I heard of one infected creature who, running out of his bed in\r\n      his shirt in the anguish and agony of his swellings, of which he\r\n      had three upon him, got his shoes on and went to put on his coat;\r\n      but the nurse resisting, and snatching the coat from him, he\r\n      threw her down, ran over her, ran downstairs and into the street,\r\n      directly to the Thames in his shirt; the nurse running after him,\r\n      and calling to the watch to stop him; but the watchman, frighted\r\n      at the man, and afraid to touch him, let him go on; upon which he\r\n      ran down to the Stillyard stairs, threw away his shirt, and\r\n      plunged into the Thames, and, being a good swimmer, swam quite\r\n      over the river; and the tide being coming in, as they call it\r\n      (that is, running westward) he reached the land not till he came\r\n      about the Falcon stairs, where landing, and finding no people\r\n      there, it being in the night, he ran about the streets there,\r\n      naked as he was, for a good while, when, it being by that time\r\n      high water, he takes the river again, and swam back to the\r\n      Stillyard, landed, ran up the streets again to his own house,\r\n      knocking at the door, went up the stairs and into his bed again;\r\n      and that this terrible experiment cured him of the plague, that\r\n      is to say, that the violent motion of his arms and legs stretched\r\n      the parts where the swellings he had upon him were, that is to\r\n      say, under his arms and his groin, and caused them to ripen and\r\n      break; and that the cold of the water abated the fever in his\r\n      blood.\r\n\r\n      I have only to add that I do not relate this any more than some\r\n      of the other, as a fact within my own knowledge, so as that I can\r\n      vouch the truth of them, and especially that of the man being\r\n      cured by the extravagant adventure, which I confess I do not\r\n      think very possible; but it may serve to confirm the many\r\n      desperate things which the distressed people falling into\r\n      deliriums, and what we call light-headedness, were frequently run\r\n      upon at that time, and how infinitely more such there would have\r\n      been if such people had not been confined by the shutting up of\r\n      houses; and this I take to be the best, if not the only good\r\n      thing which was performed by that severe method.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, the complaints and the murmurings were very\r\n      bitter against the thing itself. It would pierce the hearts of\r\n      all that came by to hear the piteous cries of those infected\r\n      people, who, being thus out of their understandings by the\r\n      violence of their pain or the heat of their blood, were either\r\n      shut in or perhaps tied in their beds and chairs, to prevent\r\n      their doing themselves hurt\xe2\x80\x94and who would make a dreadful outcry\r\n      at their being confined, and at their being not permitted to die\r\n      at large, as they called it, and as they would have done before.\r\n\r\n      This running of distempered people about the streets was very\r\n      dismal, and the magistrates did their utmost to prevent it; but\r\n      as it was generally in the night and always sudden when such\r\n      attempts were made, the officers could not be at hand to prevent\r\n      it; and even when any got out in the day, the officers appointed\r\n      did not care to meddle with them, because, as they were all\r\n      grievously infected, to be sure, when they were come to that\r\n      height, so they were more than ordinarily infectious, and it was\r\n      one of the most dangerous things that could be to touch them. On\r\n      the other hand, they generally ran on, not knowing what they did,\r\n      till they dropped down stark dead, or till they had exhausted\r\n      their spirits so as that they would fall and then die in perhaps\r\n      half-an-hour or an hour; and, which was most piteous to hear,\r\n      they were sure to come to themselves entirely in that half-hour\r\n      or hour, and then to make most grievous and piercing cries and\r\n      lamentations in the deep, afflicting sense of the condition they\r\n      were in. This was much of it before the order for shutting up of\r\n      houses was strictly put in execution, for at first the watchmen\r\n      were not so vigorous and severe as they were afterward in the\r\n      keeping the people in; that is to say, before they were (I mean\r\n      some of them) severely punished for their neglect, failing in\r\n      their duty, and letting people who were under their care slip\r\n      away, or conniving at their going abroad, whether sick or well.\r\n      But after they saw the officers appointed to examine into their\r\n      conduct were resolved to have them do their duty or be punished\r\n      for the omission, they were more exact, and the people were\r\n      strictly restrained; which was a thing they took so ill and bore\r\n      so impatiently that their discontents can hardly be described.\r\n      But there was an absolute necessity for it, that must be\r\n      confessed, unless some other measures had been timely entered\r\n      upon, and it was too late for that.\r\n\r\n      Had not this particular (of the sick being restrained as above)\r\n      been our case at that time, London would have been the most\r\n      dreadful place that ever was in the world; there would, for aught\r\n      I know, have as many people died in the streets as died in their\r\n      houses; for when the distemper was at its height it generally\r\n      made them raving and delirious, and when they were so they would\r\n      never be persuaded to keep in their beds but by force; and many\r\n      who were not tied threw themselves out of windows when they found\r\n      they could not get leave to go out of their doors.\r\n\r\n      It was for want of people conversing one with another, in this\r\n      time of calamity, that it was impossible any particular person\r\n      could come at the knowledge of all the extraordinary cases that\r\n      occurred in different families; and particularly I believe it was\r\n      never known to this day how many people in their deliriums\r\n      drowned themselves in the Thames, and in the river which runs\r\n      from the marshes by Hackney, which we generally called Ware\r\n      River, or Hackney River. As to those which were set down in the\r\n      weekly bill, they were indeed few; nor could it be known of any\r\n      of those whether they drowned themselves by accident or not. But\r\n      I believe I might reckon up more who within the compass of my\r\n      knowledge or observation really drowned themselves in that year,\r\n      than are put down in the bill of all put together: for many of\r\n      the bodies were never found who yet were known to be lost; and\r\n      the like in other methods of self-destruction. There was also one\r\n      man in or about Whitecross Street burned himself to death in his\r\n      bed; some said it was done by himself, others that it was by the\r\n      treachery of the nurse that attended him; but that he had the\r\n      plague upon him was agreed by all.\r\n\r\n      It was a merciful disposition of Providence also, and which I\r\n      have many times thought of at that time, that no fires, or no\r\n      considerable ones at least, happened in the city during that\r\n      year, which, if it had been otherwise, would have been very\r\n      dreadful; and either the people must have let them alone\r\n      unquenched, or have come together in great crowds and throngs,\r\n      unconcerned at the danger of the infection, not concerned at the\r\n      houses they went into, at the goods they handled, or at the\r\n      persons or the people they came among. But so it was, that\r\n      excepting that in Cripplegate parish, and two or three little\r\n      eruptions of fires, which were presently extinguished, there was\r\n      no disaster of that kind happened in the whole year. They told us\r\n      a story of a house in a place called Swan Alley, passing from\r\n      Goswell Street, near the end of Old Street, into St John Street,\r\n      that a family was infected there in so terrible a manner that\r\n      every one of the house died. The last person lay dead on the\r\n      floor, and, as it is supposed, had lain herself all along to die\r\n      just before the fire; the fire, it seems, had fallen from its\r\n      place, being of wood, and had taken hold of the boards and the\r\n      joists they lay on, and burnt as far as just to the body, but had\r\n      not taken hold of the dead body (though she had little more than\r\n      her shift on) and had gone out of itself, not burning the rest of\r\n      the house, though it was a slight timber house. How true this\r\n      might be I do not determine, but the city being to suffer\r\n      severely the next year by fire, this year it felt very little of\r\n      that calamity.\r\n\r\n      Indeed, considering the deliriums which the agony threw people\r\n      into, and how I have mentioned in their madness, when they were\r\n      alone, they did many desperate things, it was very strange there\r\n      were no more disasters of that kind.\r\n\r\n      It has been frequently asked me, and I cannot say that I ever\r\n      knew how to give a direct answer to it, how it came to pass that\r\n      so many infected people appeared abroad in the streets at the\r\n      same time that the houses which were infected were so vigilantly\r\n      searched, and all of them shut up and guarded as they were.\r\n\r\n      I confess I know not what answer to give to this, unless it be\r\n      this: that in so great and populous a city as this is it was\r\n      impossible to discover every house that was infected as soon as\r\n      it was so, or to shut up all the houses that were infected; so\r\n      that people had the liberty of going about the streets, even\r\n      where they Pleased, unless they were known to belong to\r\n      such-and-such infected houses.\r\n\r\n      It is true that, as several physicians told my Lord Mayor, the\r\n      fury of the contagion was such at some particular times, and\r\n      people sickened so fast and died so soon, that it was impossible,\r\n      and indeed to no purpose, to go about to inquire who was sick and\r\n      who was well, or to shut them up with such exactness as the thing\r\n      required, almost every house in a whole street being infected,\r\n      and in many places every person in some of the houses; and that\r\n      which was still worse, by the time that the houses were known to\r\n      be infected, most of the persons infected would be stone dead,\r\n      and the rest run away for fear of being shut up; so that it was\r\n      to very small purpose to call them infected houses and shut them\r\n      up, the infection having ravaged and taken its leave of the house\r\n      before it was really known that the family was any way touched.\r\n\r\n      This might be sufficient to convince any reasonable person that\r\n      as it was not in the power of the magistrates or of any human\r\n      methods of policy, to prevent the spreading the infection, so\r\n      that this way of shutting up of houses was perfectly insufficient\r\n      for that end. Indeed it seemed to have no manner of public good\r\n      in it, equal or proportionable to the grievous burden that it was\r\n      to the particular families that were so shut up; and, as far as I\r\n      was employed by the public in directing that severity, I\r\n      frequently found occasion to see that it was incapable of\r\n      answering the end. For example, as I was desired, as a visitor or\r\n      examiner, to inquire into the particulars of several families\r\n      which were infected, we scarce came to any house where the plague\r\n      had visibly appeared in the family but that some of the family\r\n      were fled and gone. The magistrates would resent this, and charge\r\n      the examiners with being remiss in their examination or\r\n      inspection. But by that means houses were long infected before it\r\n      was known. Now, as I was in this dangerous office but half the\r\n      appointed time, which was two months, it was long enough to\r\n      inform myself that we were no way capable of coming at the\r\n      knowledge of the true state of any family but by inquiring at the\r\n      door or of the neighbours. As for going into every house to\r\n      search, that was a part no authority would offer to impose on the\r\n      inhabitants, or any citizen would undertake: for it would have\r\n      been exposing us to certain infection and death, and to the ruin\r\n      of our own families as well as of ourselves; nor would any\r\n      citizen of probity, and that could be depended upon, have stayed\r\n      in the town if they had been made liable to such a severity.\r\n\r\n      Seeing then that we could come at the certainty of things by no\r\n      method but that of inquiry of the neighbours or of the family,\r\n      and on that we could not justly depend, it was not possible but\r\n      that the uncertainty of this matter would remain as above.\r\n\r\n      It is true masters of families were bound by the order to give\r\n      notice to the examiner of the place wherein he lived, within two\r\n      hours after he should discover it, of any person being sick in\r\n      his house (that is to say, having signs of the infection)\xe2\x80\x94but\r\n      they found so many ways to evade this and excuse their negligence\r\n      that they seldom gave that notice till they had taken measures to\r\n      have every one escape out of the house who had a mind to escape,\r\n      whether they were sick or sound; and while this was so, it is\r\n      easy to see that the shutting up of houses was no way to be\r\n      depended upon as a sufficient method for putting a stop to the\r\n      infection because, as I have said elsewhere, many of those that\r\n      so went out of those infected houses had the plague really upon\r\n      them, though they might really think themselves sound. And some\r\n      of these were the people that walked the streets till they fell\r\n      down dead, not that they were suddenly struck with the distemper\r\n      as with a bullet that killed with the stroke, but that they\r\n      really had the infection in their blood long before; only, that\r\n      as it preyed secretly on the vitals, it appeared not till it\r\n      seized the heart with a mortal power, and the patient died in a\r\n      moment, as with a sudden fainting or an apoplectic fit.\r\n\r\n      I know that some even of our physicians thought for a time that\r\n      those people that so died in the streets were seized but that\r\n      moment they fell, as if they had been touched by a stroke from\r\n      heaven as men are killed by a flash of lightning\xe2\x80\x94but they found\r\n      reason to alter their opinion afterward; for upon examining the\r\n      bodies of such after they were dead, they always either had\r\n      tokens upon them or other evident proofs of the distemper having\r\n      been longer upon them than they had otherwise expected.\r\n\r\n      This often was the reason that, as I have said, we that were\r\n      examiners were not able to come at the knowledge of the infection\r\n      being entered into a house till it was too late to shut it up,\r\n      and sometimes not till the people that were left were all dead.\r\n      In Petticoat Lane two houses together were infected, and several\r\n      people sick; but the distemper was so well concealed, the\r\n      examiner, who was my neighbour, got no knowledge of it till\r\n      notice was sent him that the people were all dead, and that the\r\n      carts should call there to fetch them away. The two heads of the\r\n      families concerted their measures, and so ordered their matters\r\n      as that when the examiner was in the neighbourhood they appeared\r\n      generally at a time, and answered, that is, lied, for one\r\n      another, or got some of the neighbourhood to say they were all in\r\n      health\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps knew no better\xe2\x80\x94till, death making it\r\n      impossible to keep it any longer as a secret, the dead-carts were\r\n      called in the night to both the houses, and so it became public.\r\n      But when the examiner ordered the constable to shut up the houses\r\n      there was nobody left in them but three people, two in one house\r\n      and one in the other, just dying, and a nurse in each house who\r\n      acknowledged that they had buried five before, that the houses\r\n      had been infected nine or ten days, and that for all the rest of\r\n      the two families, which were many, they were gone, some sick,\r\n      some well, or whether sick or well could not be known.\r\n\r\n      In like manner, at another house in the same lane, a man having\r\n      his family infected but very unwilling to be shut up, when he\r\n      could conceal it no longer, shut up himself; that is to say, he\r\n      set the great red cross upon his door with the words, \xe2\x80\x98Lord have\r\n      mercy upon us\xe2\x80\x99, and so deluded the examiner, who supposed it had\r\n      been done by the constable by order of the other examiner, for\r\n      there were two examiners to every district or precinct. By this\r\n      means he had free egress and regress into his house again and out\r\n      of it, as he pleased, notwithstanding it was infected, till at\r\n      length his stratagem was found out; and then he, with the sound\r\n      part of his servants and family, made off and escaped, so they\r\n      were not shut up at all.\r\n\r\n      These things made it very hard, if not impossible, as I have\r\n      said, to prevent the spreading of an infection by the shutting up\r\n      of houses\xe2\x80\x94unless the people would think the shutting of their\r\n      houses no grievance, and be so willing to have it done as that\r\n      they would give notice duly and faithfully to the magistrates of\r\n      their being infected as soon as it was known by themselves; but\r\n      as that cannot be expected from them, and the examiners cannot be\r\n      supposed, as above, to go into their houses to visit and search,\r\n      all the good of shutting up houses will be defeated, and few\r\n      houses will be shut up in time, except those of the poor, who\r\n      cannot conceal it, and of some people who will be discovered by\r\n      the terror and consternation which the things put them into.\r\n\r\n      I got myself discharged of the dangerous office I was in as soon\r\n      as I could get another admitted, whom I had obtained for a little\r\n      money to accept of it; and so, instead of serving the two months,\r\n      which was directed, I was not above three weeks in it; and a\r\n      great while too, considering it was in the month of August, at\r\n      which time the distemper began to rage with great violence at our\r\n      end of the town.\r\n\r\n      In the execution of this office I could not refrain speaking my\r\n      opinion among my neighbours as to this shutting up the people in\r\n      their houses; in which we saw most evidently the severities that\r\n      were used, though grievous in themselves, had also this\r\n      particular objection against them: namely, that they did not\r\n      answer the end, as I have said, but that the distempered people\r\n      went day by day about the streets; and it was our united opinion\r\n      that a method to have removed the sound from the sick, in case of\r\n      a particular house being visited, would have been much more\r\n      reasonable on many accounts, leaving nobody with the sick persons\r\n      but such as should on such occasion request to stay and declare\r\n      themselves content to be shut up with them.\r\n\r\n      Our scheme for removing those that were sound from those that\r\n      were sick was only in such houses as were infected, and confining\r\n      the sick was no confinement; those that could not stir would not\r\n      complain while they were in their senses and while they had the\r\n      power of judging. Indeed, when they came to be delirious and\r\n      light-headed, then they would cry out of the cruelty of being\r\n      confined; but for the removal of those that were well, we thought\r\n      it highly reasonable and just, for their own sakes, they should\r\n      be removed from the sick, and that for other people\xe2\x80\x99s safety they\r\n      should keep retired for a while, to see that they were sound, and\r\n      might not infect others; and we thought twenty or thirty days\r\n      enough for this.\r\n\r\n      Now, certainly, if houses had been provided on purpose for those\r\n      that were sound to perform this demi-quarantine in, they would\r\n      have much less reason to think themselves injured in such a\r\n      restraint than in being confined with infected people in the\r\n      houses where they lived.\r\n\r\n      It is here, however, to be observed that after the funerals\r\n      became so many that people could not toll the bell, mourn or\r\n      weep, or wear black for one another, as they did before; no, nor\r\n      so much as make coffins for those that died; so after a while the\r\n      fury of the infection appeared to be so increased that, in short,\r\n      they shut up no houses at all. It seemed enough that all the\r\n      remedies of that kind had been used till they were found\r\n      fruitless, and that the plague spread itself with an irresistible\r\n      fury; so that as the fire the succeeding year spread itself, and\r\n      burned with such violence that the citizens, in despair, gave\r\n      over their endeavours to extinguish it, so in the plague it came\r\n      at last to such violence that the people sat still looking at one\r\n      another, and seemed quite abandoned to despair; whole streets\r\n      seemed to be desolated, and not to be shut up only, but to be\r\n      emptied of their inhabitants; doors were left open, windows stood\r\n      shattering with the wind in empty houses for want of people to\r\n      shut them. In a word, people began to give up themselves to their\r\n      fears and to think that all regulations and methods were in vain,\r\n      and that there was nothing to be hoped for but an universal\r\n      desolation; and it was even in the height of this general despair\r\n      that it Pleased God to stay His hand, and to slacken the fury of\r\n      the contagion in such a manner as was even surprising, like its\r\n      beginning, and demonstrated it to be His own particular hand, and\r\n      that above, if not without the agency of means, as I shall take\r\n      notice of in its proper place.\r\n\r\n      But I must still speak of the plague as in its height, raging\r\n      even to desolation, and the people under the most dreadful\r\n      consternation, even, as I have said, to despair. It is hardly\r\n      credible to what excess the passions of men carried them in this\r\n      extremity of the distemper, and this part, I think, was as moving\r\n      as the rest. What could affect a man in his full power of\r\n      reflection, and what could make deeper impressions on the soul,\r\n      than to see a man almost naked, and got out of his house, or\r\n      perhaps out of his bed, into the street, come out of Harrow\r\n      Alley, a populous conjunction or collection of alleys, courts,\r\n      and passages in the Butcher Row in Whitechappel,\xe2\x80\x94I say, what\r\n      could be more affecting than to see this poor man come out into\r\n      the open street, run dancing and singing and making a thousand\r\n      antic gestures, with five or six women and children running after\r\n      him, crying and calling upon him for the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s sake to come\r\n      back, and entreating the help of others to bring him back, but\r\n      all in vain, nobody daring to lay a hand upon him or to come near\r\n      him?\r\n\r\n      This was a most grievous and afflicting thing to me, who saw it\r\n      all from my own windows; for all this while the poor afflicted\r\n      man was, as I observed it, even then in the utmost agony of pain,\r\n      having (as they said) two swellings upon him which could not be\r\n      brought to break or to suppurate; but, by laying strong caustics\r\n      on them, the surgeons had, it seems, hopes to break them\xe2\x80\x94which\r\n      caustics were then upon him, burning his flesh as with a hot\r\n      iron. I cannot say what became of this poor man, but I think he\r\n      continued roving about in that manner till he fell down and died.\r\n\r\n      No wonder the aspect of the city itself was frightful. The usual\r\n      concourse of people in the streets, and which used to be supplied\r\n      from our end of the town, was abated. The Exchange was not kept\r\n      shut, indeed, but it was no more frequented. The fires were lost;\r\n      they had been almost extinguished for some days by a very smart\r\n      and hasty rain. But that was not all; some of the physicians\r\n      insisted that they were not only no benefit, but injurious to the\r\n      health of people. This they made a loud clamour about, and\r\n      complained to the Lord Mayor about it. On the other hand, others\r\n      of the same faculty, and eminent too, opposed them, and gave\r\n      their reasons why the fires were, and must be, useful to assuage\r\n      the violence of the distemper. I cannot give a full account of\r\n      their arguments on both sides; only this I remember, that they\r\n      cavilled very much with one another. Some were for fires, but\r\n      that they must be made of wood and not coal, and of particular\r\n      sorts of wood too, such as fir in particular, or cedar, because\r\n      of the strong effluvia of turpentine; others were for coal and\r\n      not wood, because of the sulphur and bitumen; and others were for\r\n      neither one or other. Upon the whole, the Lord Mayor ordered no\r\n      more fires, and especially on this account, namely, that the\r\n      plague was so fierce that they saw evidently it defied all means,\r\n      and rather seemed to increase than decrease upon any application\r\n      to check and abate it; and yet this amazement of the magistrates\r\n      proceeded rather from want of being able to apply any means\r\n      successfully than from any unwillingness either to expose\r\n      themselves or undertake the care and weight of business; for, to\r\n      do them justice, they neither spared their pains nor their\r\n      persons. But nothing answered; the infection raged, and the\r\n      people were now frighted and terrified to the last degree: so\r\n      that, as I may say, they gave themselves up, and, as I mentioned\r\n      above, abandoned themselves to their despair.\r\n\r\n      But let me observe here that, when I say the people abandoned\r\n      themselves to despair, I do not mean to what men call a religious\r\n      despair, or a despair of their eternal state, but I mean a\r\n      despair of their being able to escape the infection or to outlive\r\n      the plague which they saw was so raging and so irresistible in\r\n      its force that indeed few people that were touched with it in its\r\n      height, about August and September, escaped; and, which is very\r\n      particular, contrary to its ordinary operation in June and July,\r\n      and the beginning of August, when, as I have observed, many were\r\n      infected, and continued so many days, and then went off after\r\n      having had the poison in their blood a long time; but now, on the\r\n      contrary, most of the people who were taken during the two last\r\n      weeks in August and in the three first weeks in September,\r\n      generally died in two or three days at furthest, and many the\r\n      very same day they were taken; whether the dog-days, or, as our\r\n      astrologers pretended to express themselves, the influence of the\r\n      dog-star, had that malignant effect, or all those who had the\r\n      seeds of infection before in them brought it up to a maturity at\r\n      that time altogether, I know not; but this was the time when it\r\n      was reported that above 3000 people died in one night; and they\r\n      that would have us believe they more critically observed it\r\n      pretend to say that they all died within the space of two hours,\r\n      viz., between the hours of one and three in the morning.\r\n\r\n      As to the suddenness of people\xe2\x80\x99s dying at this time, more than\r\n      before, there were innumerable instances of it, and I could name\r\n      several in my neighbourhood. One family without the Bars, and not\r\n      far from me, were all seemingly well on the Monday, being ten in\r\n      family. That evening one maid and one apprentice were taken ill\r\n      and died the next morning\xe2\x80\x94when the other apprentice and two\r\n      children were touched, whereof one died the same evening, and the\r\n      other two on Wednesday. In a word, by Saturday at noon the\r\n      master, mistress, four children, and four servants were all gone,\r\n      and the house left entirely empty, except an ancient woman who\r\n      came in to take charge of the goods for the master of the\r\n      family\xe2\x80\x99s brother, who lived not far off, and who had not been\r\n      sick.\r\n\r\n      Many houses were then left desolate, all the people being carried\r\n      away dead, and especially in an alley farther on the same side\r\n      beyond the Bars, going in at the sign of Moses and Aaron, there\r\n      were several houses together which, they said, had not one person\r\n      left alive in them; and some that died last in several of those\r\n      houses were left a little too long before they were fetched out\r\n      to be buried; the reason of which was not, as some have written\r\n      very untruly, that the living were not sufficient to bury the\r\n      dead, but that the mortality was so great in the yard or alley\r\n      that there was nobody left to give notice to the buriers or\r\n      sextons that there were any dead bodies there to be buried. It\r\n      was said, how true I know not, that some of those bodies were so\r\n      much corrupted and so rotten that it was with difficulty they\r\n      were carried; and as the carts could not come any nearer than to\r\n      the Alley Gate in the High Street, it was so much the more\r\n      difficult to bring them along; but I am not certain how many\r\n      bodies were then left. I am sure that ordinarily it was not so.\r\n\r\n      As I have mentioned how the people were brought into a condition\r\n      to despair of life and abandon themselves, so this very thing had\r\n      a strange effect among us for three or four weeks; that is, it\r\n      made them bold and venturous: they were no more shy of one\r\n      another, or restrained within doors, but went anywhere and\r\n      everywhere, and began to converse. One would say to another, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\n      do not ask you how you are, or say how I am; it is certain we\r\n      shall all go; so \xe2\x80\x99tis no matter who is all sick or who is sound\xe2\x80\x99;\r\n      and so they ran desperately into any place or any company.\r\n\r\n      As it brought the people into public company, so it was\r\n      surprising how it brought them to crowd into the churches. They\r\n      inquired no more into whom they sat near to or far from, what\r\n      offensive smells they met with, or what condition the people\r\n      seemed to be in; but, looking upon themselves all as so many dead\r\n      corpses, they came to the churches without the least caution, and\r\n      crowded together as if their lives were of no consequence\r\n      compared to the work which they came about there. Indeed, the\r\n      zeal which they showed in coming, and the earnestness and\r\n      affection they showed in their attention to what they heard, made\r\n      it manifest what a value people would all put upon the worship of\r\n      God if they thought every day they attended at the church that it\r\n      would be their last.\r\n\r\n      Nor was it without other strange effects, for it took away, all\r\n      manner of prejudice at or scruple about the person whom they\r\n      found in the pulpit when they came to the churches. It cannot be\r\n      doubted but that many of the ministers of the parish churches\r\n      were cut off, among others, in so common and dreadful a calamity;\r\n      and others had not courage enough to stand it, but removed into\r\n      the country as they found means for escape. As then some parish\r\n      churches were quite vacant and forsaken, the people made no\r\n      scruple of desiring such Dissenters as had been a few years\r\n      before deprived of their livings by virtue of the Act of\r\n      Parliament called the Act of Uniformity to preach in the\r\n      churches; nor did the church ministers in that case make any\r\n      difficulty of accepting their assistance; so that many of those\r\n      whom they called silenced ministers had their mouths opened on\r\n      this occasion and preached publicly to the people.\r\n\r\n      Here we may observe and I hope it will not be amiss to take\r\n      notice of it that a near view of death would soon reconcile men\r\n      of good principles one to another, and that it is chiefly owing\r\n      to our easy situation in life and our putting these things far\r\n      from us that our breaches are fomented, ill blood continued,\r\n      prejudices, breach of charity and of Christian union, so much\r\n      kept and so far carried on among us as it is. Another plague year\r\n      would reconcile all these differences; a close conversing with\r\n      death, or with diseases that threaten death, would scum off the\r\n      gall from our tempers, remove the animosities among us, and bring\r\n      us to see with differing eyes than those which we looked on\r\n      things with before. As the people who had been used to join with\r\n      the Church were reconciled at this time with the admitting the\r\n      Dissenters to preach to them, so the Dissenters, who with an\r\n      uncommon prejudice had broken off from the communion of the\r\n      Church of England, were now content to come to their parish\r\n      churches and to conform to the worship which they did not approve\r\n      of before; but as the terror of the infection abated, those\r\n      things all returned again to their less desirable channel and to\r\n      the course they were in before.\r\n\r\n      I mention this but historically. I have no mind to enter into\r\n      arguments to move either or both sides to a more charitable\r\n      compliance one with another. I do not see that it is probable\r\n      such a discourse would be either suitable or successful; the\r\n      breaches seem rather to widen, and tend to a widening further,\r\n      than to closing, and who am I that I should think myself able to\r\n      influence either one side or other? But this I may repeat again,\r\n      that \xe2\x80\x99tis evident death will reconcile us all; on the other side\r\n      the grave we shall be all brethren again. In heaven, whither I\r\n      hope we may come from all parties and persuasions, we shall find\r\n      neither prejudice or scruple; there we shall be of one principle\r\n      and of one opinion. Why we cannot be content to go hand in hand\r\n      to the Place where we shall join heart and hand without the least\r\n      hesitation, and with the most complete harmony and affection\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      say, why we cannot do so here I can say nothing to, neither shall\r\n      I say anything more of it but that it remains to be lamented.\r\n\r\n      I could dwell a great while upon the calamities of this dreadful\r\n      time, and go on to describe the objects that appeared among us\r\n      every day, the dreadful extravagancies which the distraction of\r\n      sick people drove them into; how the streets began now to be\r\n      fuller of frightful objects, and families to be made even a\r\n      terror to themselves. But after I have told you, as I have above,\r\n      that one man, being tied in his bed, and finding no other way to\r\n      deliver himself, set the bed on fire with his candle, which\r\n      unhappily stood within his reach, and burnt himself in his bed;\r\n      and how another, by the insufferable torment he bore, danced and\r\n      sung naked in the streets, not knowing one ecstasy from another;\r\n      I say, after I have mentioned these things, what can be added\r\n      more? What can be said to represent the misery of these times\r\n      more lively to the reader, or to give him a more perfect idea of\r\n      a complicated distress?\r\n\r\n      I must acknowledge that this time was terrible, that I was\r\n      sometimes at the end of all my resolutions, and that I had not\r\n      the courage that I had at the beginning. As the extremity brought\r\n      other people abroad, it drove me home, and except having made my\r\n      voyage down to Blackwall and Greenwich, as I have related, which\r\n      was an excursion, I kept afterwards very much within doors, as I\r\n      had for about a fortnight before. I have said already that I\r\n      repented several times that I had ventured to stay in town, and\r\n      had not gone away with my brother and his family, but it was too\r\n      late for that now; and after I had retreated and stayed within\r\n      doors a good while before my impatience led me abroad, then they\r\n      called me, as I have said, to an ugly and dangerous office which\r\n      brought me out again; but as that was expired while the height of\r\n      the distemper lasted, I retired again, and continued close ten or\r\n      twelve days more, during which many dismal spectacles represented\r\n      themselves in my view out of my own windows and in our own\r\n      street\xe2\x80\x94as that particularly from Harrow Alley, of the poor\r\n      outrageous creature which danced and sung in his agony; and many\r\n      others there were. Scarce a day or night passed over but some\r\n      dismal thing or other happened at the end of that Harrow Alley,\r\n      which was a place full of poor people, most of them belonging to\r\n      the butchers or to employments depending upon the butchery.\r\n\r\n      Sometimes heaps and throngs of people would burst out of the\r\n      alley, most of them women, making a dreadful clamour, mixed or\r\n      compounded of screeches, cryings, and calling one another, that\r\n      we could not conceive what to make of it. Almost all the dead\r\n      part of the night the dead-cart stood at the end of that alley,\r\n      for if it went in it could not well turn again, and could go in\r\n      but a little way. There, I say, it stood to receive dead bodies,\r\n      and as the churchyard was but a little way off, if it went away\r\n      full it would soon be back again. It is impossible to describe\r\n      the most horrible cries and noise the poor people would make at\r\n      their bringing the dead bodies of their children and friends out\r\n      of the cart, and by the number one would have thought there had\r\n      been none left behind, or that there were people enough for a\r\n      small city living in those places. Several times they cried\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Murder\xe2\x80\x99, sometimes \xe2\x80\x98Fire\xe2\x80\x99; but it was easy to perceive it was\r\n      all distraction, and the complaints of distressed and distempered\r\n      people.\r\n\r\n      I believe it was everywhere thus as that time, for the plague\r\n      raged for six or seven weeks beyond all that I have expressed,\r\n      and came even to such a height that, in the extremity, they began\r\n      to break into that excellent order of which I have spoken so much\r\n      in behalf of the magistrates; namely, that no dead bodies were\r\n      seen in the street or burials in the daytime: for there was a\r\n      necessity in this extremity to bear with its being otherwise for\r\n      a little while.\r\n\r\n      One thing I cannot omit here, and indeed I thought it was\r\n      extraordinary, at least it seemed a remarkable hand of Divine\r\n      justice: viz., that all the predictors, astrologers,\r\n      fortune-tellers, and what they called cunning-men, conjurers, and\r\n      the like: calculators of nativities and dreamers of dream, and\r\n      such people, were gone and vanished; not one of them was to be\r\n      found. I am verily persuaded that a great number of them fell in\r\n      the heat of the calamity, having ventured to stay upon the\r\n      prospect of getting great estates; and indeed their gain was but\r\n      too great for a time, through the madness and folly of the\r\n      people. But now they were silent; many of them went to their long\r\n      home, not able to foretell their own fate or to calculate their\r\n      own nativities. Some have been critical enough to say that every\r\n      one of them died. I dare not affirm that; but this I must own,\r\n      that I never heard of one of them that ever appeared after the\r\n      calamity was over.\r\n\r\n      But to return to my particular observations during this dreadful\r\n      part of the visitation. I am now come, as I have said, to the\r\n      month of September, which was the most dreadful of its kind, I\r\n      believe, that ever London saw; for, by all the accounts which I\r\n      have seen of the preceding visitations which have been in London,\r\n      nothing has been like it, the number in the weekly bill amounting\r\n      to almost 40,000 from the 22nd of August to the 26th of\r\n      September, being but five weeks. The particulars of the bills are\r\n      as follows, viz.:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     From August the   22nd to the 29th             7496\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d     \xe2\x80\x9d           29th     \xe2\x80\x9d    5th September  8252\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d    September the 5th     \xe2\x80\x9d   12th            7690\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d     \xe2\x80\x9d           12th     \xe2\x80\x9d   19th            8297\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9d     \xe2\x80\x9d           19th     \xe2\x80\x9d   26th            6460\r\n                                                    \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n                                                  38,195\r\n\r\n      This was a prodigious number of itself, but if I should add the\r\n      reasons which I have to believe that this account was deficient,\r\n      and how deficient it was, you would, with me, make no scruple to\r\n      believe that there died above ten thousand a week for all those\r\n      weeks, one week with another, and a proportion for several weeks\r\n      both before and after. The confusion among the people, especially\r\n      within the city, at that time, was inexpressible. The terror was\r\n      so great at last that the courage of the people appointed to\r\n      carry away the dead began to fail them; nay, several of them\r\n      died, although they had the distemper before and were recovered,\r\n      and some of them dropped down when they have been carrying the\r\n      bodies even at the pit side, and just ready to throw them in; and\r\n      this confusion was greater in the city because they had flattered\r\n      themselves with hopes of escaping, and thought the bitterness of\r\n      death was past. One cart, they told us, going up Shoreditch was\r\n      forsaken of the drivers, or being left to one man to drive, he\r\n      died in the street; and the horses going on overthrew the cart,\r\n      and left the bodies, some thrown out here, some there, in a\r\n      dismal manner. Another cart was, it seems, found in the great pit\r\n      in Finsbury Fields, the driver being dead, or having been gone\r\n      and abandoned it, and the horses running too near it, the cart\r\n      fell in and drew the horses in also. It was suggested that the\r\n      driver was thrown in with it and that the cart fell upon him, by\r\n      reason his whip was seen to be in the pit among the bodies; but\r\n      that, I suppose, could not be certain.\r\n\r\n      In our parish of Aldgate the dead-carts were several times, as I\r\n      have heard, found standing at the churchyard gate full of dead\r\n      bodies, but neither bellman or driver or any one else with it;\r\n      neither in these or many other cases did they know what bodies\r\n      they had in their cart, for sometimes they were let down with\r\n      ropes out of balconies and out of windows, and sometimes the\r\n      bearers brought them to the cart, sometimes other people; nor, as\r\n      the men themselves said, did they trouble themselves to keep any\r\n      account of the numbers.\r\n\r\n      The vigilance of the magistrates was now put to the utmost\r\n      trial\xe2\x80\x94and, it must be confessed, can never be enough acknowledged\r\n      on this occasion also; whatever expense or trouble they were at,\r\n      two things were never neglected in the city or suburbs either:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      (1) Provisions were always to be had in full plenty, and the\r\n      price not much raised neither, hardly worth speaking.\r\n\r\n      (2) No dead bodies lay unburied or uncovered; and if one walked\r\n      from one end of the city to another, no funeral or sign of it was\r\n      to be seen in the daytime, except a little, as I have said above,\r\n      in the three first weeks in September.\r\n\r\n      This last article perhaps will hardly be believed when some\r\n      accounts which others have published since that shall be seen,\r\n      wherein they say that the dead lay unburied, which I am assured\r\n      was utterly false; at least, if it had been anywhere so, it must\r\n      have been in houses where the living were gone from the dead\r\n      (having found means, as I have observed, to escape) and where no\r\n      notice was given to the officers. All which amounts to nothing at\r\n      all in the case in hand; for this I am positive in, having myself\r\n      been employed a little in the direction of that part in the\r\n      parish in which I lived, and where as great a desolation was made\r\n      in proportion to the number of inhabitants as was anywhere; I\r\n      say, I am sure that there were no dead bodies remained unburied;\r\n      that is to say, none that the proper officers knew of; none for\r\n      want of people to carry them off, and buriers to put them into\r\n      the ground and cover them; and this is sufficient to the\r\n      argument; for what might lie in houses and holes, as in Moses and\r\n      Aaron Alley, is nothing; for it is most certain they were buried\r\n      as soon as they were found. As to the first article (namely, of\r\n      provisions, the scarcity or dearness), though I have mentioned it\r\n      before and shall speak of it again, yet I must observe here:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      (1) The price of bread in particular was not much raised; for in\r\n      the beginning of the year, viz., in the first week in March, the\r\n      penny wheaten loaf was ten ounces and a half; and in the height\r\n      of the contagion it was to be had at nine ounces and a half, and\r\n      never dearer, no, not all that season. And about the beginning of\r\n      November it was sold ten ounces and a half again; the like of\r\n      which, I believe, was never heard of in any city, under so\r\n      dreadful a visitation, before.\r\n\r\n      (2) Neither was there (which I wondered much at) any want of\r\n      bakers or ovens kept open to supply the people with the bread;\r\n      but this was indeed alleged by some families, viz., that their\r\n      maidservants, going to the bakehouses with their dough to be\r\n      baked, which was then the custom, sometimes came home with the\r\n      sickness (that is to say the plague) upon them.\r\n\r\n      In all this dreadful visitation there were, as I have said\r\n      before, but two pest-houses made use of, viz., one in the fields\r\n      beyond Old Street and one in Westminster; neither was there any\r\n      compulsion used in carrying people thither. Indeed there was no\r\n      need of compulsion in the case, for there were thousands of poor\r\n      distressed people who, having no help or conveniences or supplies\r\n      but of charity, would have been very glad to have been carried\r\n      thither and been taken care of; which, indeed, was the only thing\r\n      that I think was wanting in the whole public management of the\r\n      city, seeing nobody was here allowed to be brought to the\r\n      pest-house but where money was given, or security for money,\r\n      either at their introducing or upon their being cured and sent\r\n      out\xe2\x80\x94for very many were sent out again whole; and very good\r\n      physicians were appointed to those places, so that many people\r\n      did very well there, of which I shall make mention again. The\r\n      principal sort of people sent thither were, as I have said,\r\n      servants who got the distemper by going on errands to fetch\r\n      necessaries to the families where they lived, and who in that\r\n      case, if they came home sick, were removed to preserve the rest\r\n      of the house; and they were so well looked after there in all the\r\n      time of the visitation that there was but 156 buried in all at\r\n      the London pest-house, and 159 at that of Westminster.\r\n\r\n      By having more pest-houses I am far from meaning a forcing all\r\n      people into such places. Had the shutting up of houses been\r\n      omitted and the sick hurried out of their dwellings to\r\n      pest-houses, as some proposed, it seems, at that time as well as\r\n      since, it would certainly have been much worse than it was. The\r\n      very removing the sick would have been a spreading of the\r\n      infection, and rather because that removing could not effectually\r\n      clear the house where the sick person was of the distemper; and\r\n      the rest of the family, being then left at liberty, would\r\n      certainly spread it among others.\r\n\r\n      The methods also in private families, which would have been\r\n      universally used to have concealed the distemper and to have\r\n      concealed the persons being sick, would have been such that the\r\n      distemper would sometimes have seized a whole family before any\r\n      visitors or examiners could have known of it. On the other hand,\r\n      the prodigious numbers which would have been sick at a time would\r\n      have exceeded all the capacity of public pest-houses to receive\r\n      them, or of public officers to discover and remove them.\r\n\r\n      This was well considered in those days, and I have heard them\r\n      talk of it often. The magistrates had enough to do to bring\r\n      people to submit to having their houses shut up, and many ways\r\n      they deceived the watchmen and got out, as I have observed. But\r\n      that difficulty made it apparent that they would have found it\r\n      impracticable to have gone the other way to work, for they could\r\n      never have forced the sick people out of their beds and out of\r\n      their dwellings. It must not have been my Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s officers,\r\n      but an army of officers, that must have attempted it; and the\r\n      people, on the other hand, would have been enraged and desperate,\r\n      and would have killed those that should have offered to have\r\n      meddled with them or with their children and relations, whatever\r\n      had befallen them for it; so that they would have made the\r\n      people, who, as it was, were in the most terrible distraction\r\n      imaginable, I say, they would have made them stark mad; whereas\r\n      the magistrates found it proper on several accounts to treat them\r\n      with lenity and compassion, and not with violence and terror,\r\n      such as dragging the sick out of their houses or obliging them to\r\n      remove themselves, would have been.\r\n\r\n      This leads me again to mention the time when the plague first\r\n      began; that is to say, when it became certain that it would\r\n      spread over the whole town, when, as I have said, the better sort\r\n      of people first took the alarm and began to hurry themselves out\r\n      of town. It was true, as I observed in its place, that the throng\r\n      was so great, and the coaches, horses, waggons, and carts were so\r\n      many, driving and dragging the people away, that it looked as if\r\n      all the city was running away; and had any regulations been\r\n      published that had been terrifying at that time, especially such\r\n      as would pretend to dispose of the people otherwise than they\r\n      would dispose of themselves, it would have put both the city and\r\n      suburbs into the utmost confusion.\r\n\r\n      But the magistrates wisely caused the people to be encouraged,\r\n      made very good bye-laws for the regulating the citizens, keeping\r\n      good order in the streets, and making everything as eligible as\r\n      possible to all sorts of people.\r\n\r\n      In the first place, the Lord Mayor and the sheriffs, the Court of\r\n      Aldermen, and a certain number of the Common Council men, or\r\n      their deputies, came to a resolution and published it, viz., that\r\n      they would not quit the city themselves, but that they would be\r\n      always at hand for the preserving good order in every place and\r\n      for the doing justice on all occasions; as also for the\r\n      distributing the public charity to the poor; and, in a word, for\r\n      the doing the duty and discharging the trust reposed in them by\r\n      the citizens to the utmost of their power.\r\n\r\n      In pursuance of these orders, the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, &c., held\r\n      councils every day, more or less, for making such dispositions as\r\n      they found needful for preserving the civil peace; and though\r\n      they used the people with all possible gentleness and clemency,\r\n      yet all manner of presumptuous rogues such as thieves,\r\n      housebreakers, plunderers of the dead or of the sick, were duly\r\n      punished, and several declarations were continually published by\r\n      the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen against such.\r\n\r\n      Also all constables and churchwardens were enjoined to stay in\r\n      the city upon severe penalties, or to depute such able and\r\n      sufficient housekeepers as the deputy aldermen or Common Council\r\n      men of the precinct should approve, and for whom they should give\r\n      security; and also security in case of mortality that they would\r\n      forthwith constitute other constables in their stead.\r\n\r\n      These things re-established the minds of the people very much,\r\n      especially in the first of their fright, when they talked of\r\n      making so universal a flight that the city would have been in\r\n      danger of being entirely deserted of its inhabitants except the\r\n      poor, and the country of being plundered and laid waste by the\r\n      multitude. Nor were the magistrates deficient in performing their\r\n      part as boldly as they promised it; for my Lord Mayor and the\r\n      sheriffs were continually in the streets and at places of the\r\n      greatest danger, and though they did not care for having too\r\n      great a resort of people crowding about them, yet in emergent\r\n      cases they never denied the people access to them, and heard with\r\n      patience all their grievances and complaints. My Lord Mayor had a\r\n      low gallery built on purpose in his hall, where he stood a little\r\n      removed from the crowd when any complaint came to be heard, that\r\n      he might appear with as much safety as possible.\r\n\r\n      Likewise the proper officers, called my Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s officers,\r\n      constantly attended in their turns, as they were in waiting; and\r\n      if any of them were sick or infected, as some of them were,\r\n      others were instantly employed to fill up and officiate in their\r\n      places till it was known whether the other should live or die.\r\n\r\n      In like manner the sheriffs and aldermen did in their several\r\n      stations and wards, where they were placed by office, and the\r\n      sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s officers or sergeants were appointed to receive orders\r\n      from the respective aldermen in their turn, so that justice was\r\n      executed in all cases without interruption. In the next place, it\r\n      was one of their particular cares to see the orders for the\r\n      freedom of the markets observed, and in this part either the Lord\r\n      Mayor or one or both of the sheriffs were every market-day on\r\n      horseback to see their orders executed and to see that the\r\n      country people had all possible encouragement and freedom in\r\n      their coming to the markets and going back again, and that no\r\n      nuisances or frightful objects should be seen in the streets to\r\n      terrify them or make them unwilling to come. Also the bakers were\r\n      taken under particular order, and the Master of the Bakers\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      Company was, with his court of assistants, directed to see the\r\n      order of my Lord Mayor for their regulation put in execution, and\r\n      the due assize of bread (which was weekly appointed by my Lord\r\n      Mayor) observed; and all the bakers were obliged to keep their\r\n      oven going constantly, on pain of losing the privileges of a\r\n      freeman of the city of London.\r\n\r\n      By this means bread was always to be had in plenty, and as cheap\r\n      as usual, as I said above; and provisions were never wanting in\r\n      the markets, even to such a degree that I often wondered at it,\r\n      and reproached myself with being so timorous and cautious in\r\n      stirring abroad, when the country people came freely and boldly\r\n      to market, as if there had been no manner of infection in the\r\n      city, or danger of catching it.\r\n\r\n      It was indeed one admirable piece of conduct in the said\r\n      magistrates that the streets were kept constantly clear and free\r\n      from all manner of frightful objects, dead bodies, or any such\r\n      things as were indecent or unpleasant\xe2\x80\x94unless where anybody fell\r\n      down suddenly or died in the streets, as I have said above; and\r\n      these were generally covered with some cloth or blanket, or\r\n      removed into the next churchyard till night. All the needful\r\n      works that carried terror with them, that were both dismal and\r\n      dangerous, were done in the night; if any diseased bodies were\r\n      removed, or dead bodies buried, or infected clothes burnt, it was\r\n      done in the night; and all the bodies which were thrown into the\r\n      great pits in the several churchyards or burying-grounds, as has\r\n      been observed, were so removed in the night, and everything was\r\n      covered and closed before day. So that in the daytime there was\r\n      not the least signal of the calamity to be seen or heard of,\r\n      except what was to be observed from the emptiness of the streets,\r\n      and sometimes from the passionate outcries and lamentations of\r\n      the people, out at their windows, and from the numbers of houses\r\n      and shops shut up.\r\n\r\n      Nor was the silence and emptiness of the streets so much in the\r\n      city as in the out-parts, except just at one particular time\r\n      when, as I have mentioned, the plague came east and spread over\r\n      all the city. It was indeed a merciful disposition of God, that\r\n      as the plague began at one end of the town first (as has been\r\n      observed at large) so it proceeded progressively to other parts,\r\n      and did not come on this way, or eastward, till it had spent its\r\n      fury in the West part of the town; and so, as it came on one way,\r\n      it abated another. For example, it began at St Giles\xe2\x80\x99s and the\r\n      Westminster end of the town, and it was in its height in all that\r\n      part by about the middle of July, viz., in St\r\n      Giles-in-the-Fields, St Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s, Holborn, St Clement Danes, St\r\n      Martin-in-the-Fields, and in Westminster. The latter end of July\r\n      it decreased in those parishes; and coming east, it increased\r\n      prodigiously in Cripplegate, St Sepulcher\xe2\x80\x99s, St James\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\n      Clarkenwell, and St Bride\xe2\x80\x99s and Aldersgate. While it was in all\r\n      these parishes, the city and all the parishes of the Southwark\r\n      side of the water and all Stepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate,\r\n      Wapping, and Ratcliff, were very little touched; so that people\r\n      went about their business unconcerned, carried on their trades,\r\n      kept open their shops, and conversed freely with one another in\r\n      all the city, the east and north-east suburbs, and in Southwark,\r\n      almost as if the plague had not been among us.\r\n\r\n      Even when the north and north-west suburbs were fully infected,\r\n      viz., Cripplegate, Clarkenwell, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch, yet\r\n      still all the rest were tolerably well. For example from 25th\r\n      July to 1st August the bill stood thus of all diseases:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     St Giles, Cripplegate                              554\r\n     St Sepulchers                                      250\r\n     Clarkenwell                                        103\r\n     Bishopsgate                                        116\r\n     Shoreditch                                         110\r\n     Stepney parish                                     127\r\n     Aldgate                                             92\r\n     Whitechappel                                       104\r\n     All the ninety-seven parishes within the walls     228\r\n     All the parishes in Southwark                      205\r\n     -                                                \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94-\r\n     -    Total                                        1889\r\n\r\n      So that, in short, there died more that week in the two parishes\r\n      of Cripplegate and St Sepulcher by forty-eight than in all the\r\n      city, all the east suburbs, and all the Southwark parishes put\r\n      together. This caused the reputation of the city\xe2\x80\x99s health to\r\n      continue all over England\xe2\x80\x94and especially in the counties and\r\n      markets adjacent, from whence our supply of provisions chiefly\r\n      came even much longer than that health itself continued; for when\r\n      the people came into the streets from the country by Shoreditch\r\n      and Bishopsgate, or by Old Street and Smithfield, they would see\r\n      the out-streets empty and the houses and shops shut, and the few\r\n      people that were stirring there walk in the middle of the\r\n      streets. But when they came within the city, there things looked\r\n      better, and the markets and shops were open, and the people\r\n      walking about the streets as usual, though not quite so many; and\r\n      this continued till the latter end of August and the beginning of\r\n      September.\r\n\r\n      But then the case altered quite; the distemper abated in the west\r\n      and north-west parishes, and the weight of the infection lay on\r\n      the city and the eastern suburbs, and the Southwark side, and\r\n      this in a frightful manner. Then, indeed, the city began to look\r\n      dismal, shops to be shut, and the streets desolate. In the High\r\n      Street, indeed, necessity made people stir abroad on many\r\n      occasions; and there would be in the middle of the day a pretty\r\n      many people, but in the mornings and evenings scarce any to be\r\n      seen, even there, no, not in Cornhill and Cheapside.\r\n\r\n      These observations of mine were abundantly confirmed by the\r\n      weekly bills of mortality for those weeks, an abstract of which,\r\n      as they respect the parishes which I have mentioned and as they\r\n      make the calculations I speak of very evident, take as follows.\r\n\r\n      The weekly bill, which makes out this decrease of the burials in\r\n      the west and north side of the city, stands thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFrom the 12th of September to the 19th\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -    St Giles, Cripplegate                            456\r\n     -    St Giles-in-the-Fields                           140\r\n     -    Clarkenwell                                       77\r\n     -    St Sepulcher                                     214\r\n     -    St Leonard, Shoreditch                           183\r\n     -    Stepney parish                                   716\r\n     -    Aldgate                                          623\r\n     -    Whitechappel                                     532\r\n     -    In the ninety-seven parishes within the walls   1493\r\n     -    In the eight parishes on Southwark side         1636\r\n     -                                                    \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -         Total                                      6060\r\n\r\n      Here is a strange change of things indeed, and a sad change it\r\n      was; and had it held for two months more than it did, very few\r\n      people would have been left alive. But then such, I say, was the\r\n      merciful disposition of God that, when it was thus, the west and\r\n      north part which had been so dreadfully visited at first, grew,\r\n      as you see, much better; and as the people disappeared here, they\r\n      began to look abroad again there; and the next week or two\r\n      altered it still more; that is, more to the encouragement of the\r\n      other part of the town. For example:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFrom the 19th of September to the 26th\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -    St Giles, Cripplegate                           277\r\n     -    St Giles-in-the-Fields                          119\r\n     -    Clarkenwell                                      76\r\n     -    St Sepulchers                                   193\r\n     -    St Leonard, Shoreditch                          146\r\n     -    Stepney parish                                  616\r\n     -    Aldgate                                         496\r\n     -    Whitechappel                                    346\r\n     -    In the ninety-seven parishes within the walls  1268\r\n     -    In the eight parishes on Southwark side        1390\r\n     -                                                   \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -              Total                                4927\r\n\r\n     From the 26th of September to the 3rd of October\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -    St Giles, Cripplegate                           196\r\n     -    St Giles-in-the-Fields                           95\r\n     -    Clarkenwell                                      48\r\n     -    St Sepulchers                                   137\r\n     -    St Leonard, Shoreditch                          128\r\n     -    Stepney parish                                  674\r\n     -    Aldgate                                         372\r\n     -    Whitechappel                                    328\r\n     -    In the ninety-seven parishes within the walls  1149\r\n     -    In the eight parishes on Southwark side        1201\r\n     -                                                   \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     -    Total                                          4382\r\n\r\n      And now the misery of the city and of the said east and south\r\n      parts was complete indeed; for, as you see, the weight of the\r\n      distemper lay upon those parts, that is to say, the city, the\r\n      eight parishes over the river, with the parishes of Aldgate,\r\n      Whitechappel, and Stepney; and this was the time that the bills\r\n      came up to such a monstrous height as that I mentioned before,\r\n      and that eight or nine, and, as I believe, ten or twelve thousand\r\n      a week, died; for it is my settled opinion that they never could\r\n      come at any just account of the numbers, for the reasons which I\r\n      have given already.\r\n\r\n      Nay, one of the most eminent physicians, who has since published\r\n      in Latin an account of those times, and of his observations says\r\n      that in one week there died twelve thousand people, and that\r\n      particularly there died four thousand in one night; though I do\r\n      not remember that there ever was any such particular night so\r\n      remarkably fatal as that such a number died in it. However, all\r\n      this confirms what I have said above of the uncertainty of the\r\n      bills of mortality, &c., of which I shall say more hereafter.\r\n\r\n      And here let me take leave to enter again, though it may seem a\r\n      repetition of circumstances, into a description of the miserable\r\n      condition of the city itself, and of those parts where I lived at\r\n      this particular time. The city and those other parts,\r\n      notwithstanding the great numbers of people that were gone into\r\n      the country, was vastly full of people; and perhaps the fuller\r\n      because people had for a long time a strong belief that the\r\n      plague would not come into the city, nor into Southwark, no, nor\r\n      into Wapping or Ratcliff at all; nay, such was the assurance of\r\n      the people on that head that many removed from the suburbs on the\r\n      west and north sides, into those eastern and south sides as for\r\n      safety; and, as I verily believe, carried the plague amongst them\r\n      there perhaps sooner than they would otherwise have had it.\r\n\r\n      Here also I ought to leave a further remark for the use of\r\n      posterity, concerning the manner of people\xe2\x80\x99s infecting one\r\n      another; namely, that it was not the sick people only from whom\r\n      the plague was immediately received by others that were sound,\r\n      but the well. To explain myself: by the sick people I mean those\r\n      who were known to be sick, had taken their beds, had been under\r\n      cure, or had swellings and tumours upon them, and the like; these\r\n      everybody could beware of; they were either in their beds or in\r\n      such condition as could not be concealed.\r\n\r\n      By the well I mean such as had received the contagion, and had it\r\n      really upon them, and in their blood, yet did not show the\r\n      consequences of it in their countenances: nay, even were not\r\n      sensible of it themselves, as many were not for several days.\r\n      These breathed death in every place, and upon everybody who came\r\n      near them; nay, their very clothes retained the infection, their\r\n      hands would infect the things they touched, especially if they\r\n      were warm and sweaty, and they were generally apt to sweat too.\r\n\r\n      Now it was impossible to know these people, nor did they\r\n      sometimes, as I have said, know themselves to be infected. These\r\n      were the people that so often dropped down and fainted in the\r\n      streets; for oftentimes they would go about the streets to the\r\n      last, till on a sudden they would sweat, grow faint, sit down at\r\n      a door and die. It is true, finding themselves thus, they would\r\n      struggle hard to get home to their own doors, or at other times\r\n      would be just able to go into their houses and die instantly;\r\n      other times they would go about till they had the very tokens\r\n      come out upon them, and yet not know it, and would die in an hour\r\n      or two after they came home, but be well as long as they were\r\n      abroad. These were the dangerous people; these were the people of\r\n      whom the well people ought to have been afraid; but then, on the\r\n      other side, it was impossible to know them.\r\n\r\n      And this is the reason why it is impossible in a visitation to\r\n      prevent the spreading of the plague by the utmost human\r\n      vigilance: viz., that it is impossible to know the infected\r\n      people from the sound, or that the infected people should\r\n      perfectly know themselves. I knew a man who conversed freely in\r\n      London all the season of the plague in 1665, and kept about him\r\n      an antidote or cordial on purpose to take when he thought himself\r\n      in any danger, and he had such a rule to know or have warning of\r\n      the danger by as indeed I never met with before or since. How far\r\n      it may be depended on I know not. He had a wound in his leg, and\r\n      whenever he came among any people that were not sound, and the\r\n      infection began to affect him, he said he could know it by that\r\n      signal, viz., that his wound in his leg would smart, and look\r\n      pale and white; so as soon as ever he felt it smart it was time\r\n      for him to withdraw, or to take care of himself, taking his\r\n      drink, which he always carried about him for that purpose. Now it\r\n      seems he found his wound would smart many times when he was in\r\n      company with such who thought themselves to be sound, and who\r\n      appeared so to one another; but he would presently rise up and\r\n      say publicly, \xe2\x80\x98Friends, here is somebody in the room that has the\r\n      plague\xe2\x80\x99, and so would immediately break up the company. This was\r\n      indeed a faithful monitor to all people that the plague is not to\r\n      be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town\r\n      infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they\r\n      likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it\r\n      themselves; and in this case shutting up the well or removing the\r\n      sick will not do it, unless they can go back and shut up all\r\n      those that the sick had conversed with, even before they knew\r\n      themselves to be sick, and none knows how far to carry that back,\r\n      or where to stop; for none knows when or where or how they may\r\n      have received the infection, or from whom.\r\n\r\n      This I take to be the reason which makes so many people talk of\r\n      the air being corrupted and infected, and that they need not be\r\n      cautious of whom they converse with, for that the contagion was\r\n      in the air. I have seen them in strange agitations and surprises\r\n      on this account. \xe2\x80\x98I have never come near any infected body\xe2\x80\x99, says\r\n      the disturbed person; \xe2\x80\x98I have conversed with none but sound,\r\n      healthy people, and yet I have gotten the distemper!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am sure\r\n      I am struck from Heaven\xe2\x80\x99, says another, and he falls to the\r\n      serious part. Again, the first goes on exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98I have come\r\n      near no infection or any infected person; I am sure it is the\r\n      air. We draw in death when we breathe, and therefore \xe2\x80\x99tis the\r\n      hand of God; there is no withstanding it.\xe2\x80\x99 And this at last made\r\n      many people, being hardened to the danger, grow less concerned at\r\n      it; and less cautious towards the latter end of the time, and\r\n      when it was come to its height, than they were at first. Then,\r\n      with a kind of a Turkish predestinarianism, they would say, if it\r\n      pleased God to strike them, it was all one whether they went\r\n      abroad or stayed at home; they could not escape it, and therefore\r\n      they went boldly about, even into infected houses and infected\r\n      company; visited sick people; and, in short, lay in the beds with\r\n      their wives or relations when they were infected. And what was\r\n      the consequence, but the same that is the consequence in Turkey,\r\n      and in those countries where they do those things\xe2\x80\x94namely, that\r\n      they were infected too, and died by hundreds and thousands?\r\n\r\n      I would be far from lessening the awe of the judgements of God\r\n      and the reverence to His providence which ought always to be on\r\n      our minds on such occasions as these. Doubtless the visitation\r\n      itself is a stroke from Heaven upon a city, or country, or nation\r\n      where it falls; a messenger of His vengeance, and a loud call to\r\n      that nation or country or city to humiliation and repentance,\r\n      according to that of the prophet Jeremiah (xviii. 7, 8): \xe2\x80\x98At what\r\n      instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a\r\n      kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; if\r\n      that nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil,\r\n      I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.\xe2\x80\x99 Now to\r\n      prompt due impressions of the awe of God on the minds of men on\r\n      such occasions, and not to lessen them, it is that I have left\r\n      those minutes upon record.\r\n\r\n      I say, therefore, I reflect upon no man for putting the reason of\r\n      those things upon the immediate hand of God, and the appointment\r\n      and direction of His providence; nay, on the contrary, there were\r\n      many wonderful deliverances of persons from infection, and\r\n      deliverances of persons when infected, which intimate singular\r\n      and remarkable providence in the particular instances to which\r\n      they refer; and I esteem my own deliverance to be one next to\r\n      miraculous, and do record it with thankfulness.\r\n\r\n      But when I am speaking of the plague as a distemper arising from\r\n      natural causes, we must consider it as it was really propagated\r\n      by natural means; nor is it at all the less a judgement for its\r\n      being under the conduct of human causes and effects; for, as the\r\n      Divine Power has formed the whole scheme of nature and maintains\r\n      nature in its course, so the same Power thinks fit to let His own\r\n      actings with men, whether of mercy or judgement, to go on in the\r\n      ordinary course of natural causes; and He is pleased to act by\r\n      those natural causes as the ordinary means, excepting and\r\n      reserving to Himself nevertheless a power to act in a\r\n      supernatural way when He sees occasion. Now \xe2\x80\x99tis evident that in\r\n      the case of an infection there is no apparent extraordinary\r\n      occasion for supernatural operation, but the ordinary course of\r\n      things appears sufficiently armed, and made capable of all the\r\n      effects that Heaven usually directs by a contagion. Among these\r\n      causes and effects, this of the secret conveyance of infection,\r\n      imperceptible and unavoidable, is more than sufficient to execute\r\n      the fierceness of Divine vengeance, without putting it upon\r\n      supernaturals and miracle.\r\n\r\n      The acute penetrating nature of the disease itself was such, and\r\n      the infection was received so imperceptibly, that the most exact\r\n      caution could not secure us while in the place. But I must be\r\n      allowed to believe\xe2\x80\x94and I have so many examples fresh in my memory\r\n      to convince me of it, that I think none can resist their\r\n      evidence\xe2\x80\x94I say, I must be allowed to believe that no one in this\r\n      whole nation ever received the sickness or infection but who\r\n      received it in the ordinary way of infection from somebody, or\r\n      the clothes or touch or stench of somebody that was infected\r\n      before.\r\n\r\n      The manner of its coming first to London proves this also, viz.,\r\n      by goods brought over from Holland, and brought thither from the\r\n      Levant; the first breaking of it out in a house in Long Acre\r\n      where those goods were carried and first opened; its spreading\r\n      from that house to other houses by the visible unwary conversing\r\n      with those who were sick; and the infecting the parish officers\r\n      who were employed about the persons dead, and the like. These are\r\n      known authorities for this great foundation point\xe2\x80\x94that it went on\r\n      and proceeded from person to person and from house to house, and\r\n      no otherwise. In the first house that was infected there died\r\n      four persons. A neighbour, hearing the mistress of the first\r\n      house was sick, went to visit her, and went home and gave the\r\n      distemper to her family, and died, and all her household. A\r\n      minister, called to pray with the first sick person in the second\r\n      house, was said to sicken immediately and die with several more\r\n      in his house. Then the physicians began to consider, for they did\r\n      not at first dream of a general contagion. But the physicians\r\n      being sent to inspect the bodies, they assured the people that it\r\n      was neither more or less than the plague, with all its terrifying\r\n      particulars, and that it threatened an universal infection, so\r\n      many people having already conversed with the sick or\r\n      distempered, and having, as might be supposed, received infection\r\n      from them, that it would be impossible to put a stop to it.\r\n\r\n      Here the opinion of the physicians agreed with my observation\r\n      afterwards, namely, that the danger was spreading insensibly, for\r\n      the sick could infect none but those that came within reach of\r\n      the sick person; but that one man who may have really received\r\n      the infection and knows it not, but goes abroad and about as a\r\n      sound person, may give the plague to a thousand people, and they\r\n      to greater numbers in proportion, and neither the person giving\r\n      the infection or the persons receiving it know anything of it,\r\n      and perhaps not feel the effects of it for several days after.\r\n\r\n      For example, many persons in the time of this visitation never\r\n      perceived that they were infected till they found to their\r\n      unspeakable surprise, the tokens come out upon them; after which\r\n      they seldom lived six hours; for those spots they called the\r\n      tokens were really gangrene spots, or mortified flesh in small\r\n      knobs as broad as a little silver penny, and hard as a piece of\r\n      callus or horn; so that, when the disease was come up to that\r\n      length, there was nothing could follow but certain death; and\r\n      yet, as I said, they knew nothing of their being infected, nor\r\n      found themselves so much as out of order, till those mortal marks\r\n      were upon them. But everybody must allow that they were infected\r\n      in a high degree before, and must have been so some time, and\r\n      consequently their breath, their sweat, their very clothes, were\r\n      contagious for many days before. This occasioned a vast variety\r\n      of cases which physicians would have much more opportunity to\r\n      remember than I; but some came within the compass of my\r\n      observation or hearing, of which I shall name a few.\r\n\r\n      A certain citizen who had lived safe and untouched till the month\r\n      of September, when the weight of the distemper lay more in the\r\n      city than it had done before, was mighty cheerful, and something\r\n      too bold (as I think it was) in his talk of how secure he was,\r\n      how cautious he had been, and how he had never come near any sick\r\n      body. Says another citizen, a neighbour of his, to him one day,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Do not be too confident, Mr\xe2\x80\x94; it is hard to say who is sick and\r\n      who is well, for we see men alive and well to outward appearance\r\n      one hour, and dead the next.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That is true\xe2\x80\x99, says the first man,\r\n      for he was not a man presumptuously secure, but had escaped a\r\n      long while\xe2\x80\x94and men, as I said above, especially in the city began\r\n      to be over-easy upon that score. \xe2\x80\x98That is true,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98I do\r\n      not think myself secure, but I hope I have not been in company\r\n      with any person that there has been any danger in.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No?\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\n      his neighbour. \xe2\x80\x98Was not you at the Bull Head Tavern in\r\n      Gracechurch Street with Mr\xe2\x80\x94the night before last?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\n      the first, \xe2\x80\x98I was; but there was nobody there that we had any\r\n      reason to think dangerous.\xe2\x80\x99 Upon which his neighbour said no\r\n      more, being unwilling to surprise him; but this made him more\r\n      inquisitive, and as his neighbour appeared backward, he was the\r\n      more impatient, and in a kind of warmth says he aloud, \xe2\x80\x98Why, he\r\n      is not dead, is he?\xe2\x80\x99 Upon which his neighbour still was silent,\r\n      but cast up his eyes and said something to himself; at which the\r\n      first citizen turned pale, and said no more but this, \xe2\x80\x98Then I am\r\n      a dead man too\xe2\x80\x99, and went home immediately and sent for a\r\n      neighbouring apothecary to give him something preventive, for he\r\n      had not yet found himself ill; but the apothecary, opening his\r\n      breast, fetched a sigh, and said no more but this, \xe2\x80\x98Look up to\r\n      God\xe2\x80\x99; and the man died in a few hours.\r\n\r\n      Now let any man judge from a case like this if it is possible for\r\n      the regulations of magistrates, either by shutting up the sick or\r\n      removing them, to stop an infection which spreads itself from man\r\n      to man even while they are perfectly well and insensible of its\r\n      approach, and may be so for many days.\r\n\r\n      It may be proper to ask here how long it may be supposed men\r\n      might have the seeds of the contagion in them before it\r\n      discovered itself in this fatal manner, and how long they might\r\n      go about seemingly whole, and yet be contagious to all those that\r\n      came near them. I believe the most experienced physicians cannot\r\n      answer this question directly any more than I can; and something\r\n      an ordinary observer may take notice of, which may pass their\r\n      observations. The opinion of physicians abroad seems to be that\r\n      it may lie dormant in the spirits or in the blood-vessels a very\r\n      considerable time. Why else do they exact a quarantine of those\r\n      who came into their harbours and ports from suspected places?\r\n      Forty days is, one would think, too long for nature to struggle\r\n      with such an enemy as this, and not conquer it or yield to it.\r\n      But I could not think, by my own observation, that they can be\r\n      infected so as to be contagious to others above fifteen or\r\n      sixteen days at furthest; and on that score it was, that when a\r\n      house was shut up in the city and any one had died of the plague,\r\n      but nobody appeared to be ill in the family for sixteen or\r\n      eighteen days after, they were not so strict but that they would\r\n      connive at their going privately abroad; nor would people be much\r\n      afraid of them afterward, but rather think they were fortified\r\n      the better, having not been vulnerable when the enemy was in\r\n      their own house; but we sometimes found it had lain much longer\r\n      concealed.\r\n\r\n      Upon the foot of all these observations I must say that though\r\n      Providence seemed to direct my conduct to be otherwise, yet it is\r\n      my opinion, and I must leave it as a prescription, viz., that the\r\n      best physic against the plague is to run away from it. I know\r\n      people encourage themselves by saying God is able to keep us in\r\n      the midst of danger, and able to overtake us when we think\r\n      ourselves out of danger; and this kept thousands in the town\r\n      whose carcases went into the great pits by cartloads, and who, if\r\n      they had fled from the danger, had, I believe, been safe from the\r\n      disaster; at least \xe2\x80\x99tis probable they had been safe.\r\n\r\n      And were this very fundamental only duly considered by the people\r\n      on any future occasion of this or the like nature, I am persuaded\r\n      it would put them upon quite different measures for managing the\r\n      people from those that they took in 1665, or than any that have\r\n      been taken abroad that I have heard of. In a word, they would\r\n      consider of separating the people into smaller bodies, and\r\n      removing them in time farther from one another\xe2\x80\x94and not let such a\r\n      contagion as this, which is indeed chiefly dangerous to collected\r\n      bodies of people, find a million of people in a body together, as\r\n      was very near the case before, and would certainly be the case if\r\n      it should ever appear again.\r\n\r\n      The plague, like a great fire, if a few houses only are\r\n      contiguous where it happens, can only burn a few houses; or if it\r\n      begins in a single, or, as we call it, a lone house, can only\r\n      burn that lone house where it begins. But if it begins in a\r\n      close-built town or city and gets a head, there its fury\r\n      increases: it rages over the whole place, and consumes all it can\r\n      reach.\r\n\r\n      I could propose many schemes on the foot of which the government\r\n      of this city, if ever they should be under the apprehensions of\r\n      such another enemy (God forbid they should), might ease\r\n      themselves of the greatest part of the dangerous people that\r\n      belong to them; I mean such as the begging, starving, labouring\r\n      poor, and among them chiefly those who, in case of a siege, are\r\n      called the useless mouths; who being then prudently and to their\r\n      own advantage disposed of, and the wealthy inhabitants disposing\r\n      of themselves and of their servants and children, the city and\r\n      its adjacent parts would be so effectually evacuated that there\r\n      would not be above a tenth part of its people left together for\r\n      the disease to take hold upon. But suppose them to be a fifth\r\n      part, and that two hundred and fifty thousand people were left:\r\n      and if it did seize upon them, they would, by their living so\r\n      much at large, be much better prepared to defend themselves\r\n      against the infection, and be less liable to the effects of it\r\n      than if the same number of people lived close together in one\r\n      smaller city such as Dublin or Amsterdam or the like.\r\n\r\n      It is true hundreds, yea, thousands of families fled away at this\r\n      last plague, but then of them, many fled too late, and not only\r\n      died in their flight, but carried the distemper with them into\r\n      the countries where they went and infected those whom they went\r\n      among for safety; which confounded the thing, and made that be a\r\n      propagation of the distemper which was the best means to prevent\r\n      it; and this too is an evidence of it, and brings me back to what\r\n      I only hinted at before, but must speak more fully to here,\r\n      namely, that men went about apparently well many days after they\r\n      had the taint of the disease in their vitals, and after their\r\n      spirits were so seized as that they could never escape it, and\r\n      that all the while they did so they were dangerous to others; I\r\n      say, this proves that so it was; for such people infected the\r\n      very towns they went through, as well as the families they went\r\n      among; and it was by that means that almost all the great towns\r\n      in England had the distemper among them, more or less, and always\r\n      they would tell you such a Londoner or such a Londoner brought it\r\n      down.\r\n\r\n      It must not be omitted that when I speak of those people who were\r\n      really thus dangerous, I suppose them to be utterly ignorant of\r\n      their own conditions; for if they really knew their circumstances\r\n      to be such as indeed they were, they must have been a kind of\r\n      wilful murtherers if they would have gone abroad among healthy\r\n      people\xe2\x80\x94and it would have verified indeed the suggestion which I\r\n      mentioned above, and which I thought seemed untrue: viz., that\r\n      the infected people were utterly careless as to giving the\r\n      infection to others, and rather forward to do it than not; and I\r\n      believe it was partly from this very thing that they raised that\r\n      suggestion, which I hope was not really true in fact.\r\n\r\n      I confess no particular case is sufficient to prove a general,\r\n      but I could name several people within the knowledge of some of\r\n      their neighbours and families yet living who showed the contrary\r\n      to an extreme. One man, a master of a family in my neighbourhood,\r\n      having had the distemper, he thought he had it given him by a\r\n      poor workman whom he employed, and whom he went to his house to\r\n      see, or went for some work that he wanted to have finished; and\r\n      he had some apprehensions even while he was at the poor workman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      door, but did not discover it fully; but the next day it\r\n      discovered itself, and he was taken very in, upon which he\r\n      immediately caused himself to be carried into an outbuilding\r\n      which he had in his yard, and where there was a chamber over a\r\n      workhouse (the man being a brazier). Here he lay, and here he\r\n      died, and would be tended by none of his neighbours, but by a\r\n      nurse from abroad; and would not suffer his wife, nor children,\r\n      nor servants to come up into the room, lest they should be\r\n      infected\xe2\x80\x94but sent them his blessing and prayers for them by the\r\n      nurse, who spoke it to them at a distance, and all this for fear\r\n      of giving them the distemper; and without which he knew, as they\r\n      were kept up, they could not have it.\r\n\r\n      And here I must observe also that the plague, as I suppose all\r\n      distempers do, operated in a different manner on differing\r\n      constitutions; some were immediately overwhelmed with it, and it\r\n      came to violent fevers, vomitings, insufferable headaches, pains\r\n      in the back, and so up to ravings and ragings with those pains;\r\n      others with swellings and tumours in the neck or groin, or\r\n      armpits, which till they could be broke put them into\r\n      insufferable agonies and torment; while others, as I have\r\n      observed, were silently infected, the fever preying upon their\r\n      spirits insensibly, and they seeing little of it till they fell\r\n      into swooning, and faintings, and death without pain. I am not\r\n      physician enough to enter into the particular reasons and manner\r\n      of these differing effects of one and the same distemper, and of\r\n      its differing operation in several bodies; nor is it my business\r\n      here to record the observations which I really made, because the\r\n      doctors themselves have done that part much more effectually than\r\n      I can do, and because my opinion may in some things differ from\r\n      theirs. I am only relating what I know, or have heard, or believe\r\n      of the particular cases, and what fell within the compass of my\r\n      view, and the different nature of the infection as it appeared in\r\n      the particular cases which I have related; but this may be added\r\n      too: that though the former sort of those cases, namely, those\r\n      openly visited, were the worst for themselves as to pain\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\n      those that had such fevers, vomitings, headaches, pains, and\r\n      swellings, because they died in such a dreadful manner\xe2\x80\x94yet the\r\n      latter had the worst state of the disease; for in the former they\r\n      frequently recovered, especially if the swellings broke; but the\r\n      latter was inevitable death; no cure, no help, could be possible,\r\n      nothing could follow but death. And it was worse also to others,\r\n      because, as above, it secretly and unperceived by others or by\r\n      themselves, communicated death to those they conversed with, the\r\n      penetrating poison insinuating itself into their blood in a\r\n      manner which it is impossible to describe, or indeed conceive.\r\n\r\n      This infecting and being infected without so much as its being\r\n      known to either person is evident from two sorts of cases which\r\n      frequently happened at that time; and there is hardly anybody\r\n      living who was in London during the infection but must have known\r\n      several of the cases of both sorts.\r\n\r\n      (1) Fathers and mothers have gone about as if they had been well,\r\n      and have believed themselves to be so, till they have insensibly\r\n      infected and been the destruction of their whole families, which\r\n      they would have been far from doing if they had the least\r\n      apprehensions of their being unsound and dangerous themselves. A\r\n      family, whose story I have heard, was thus infected by the\r\n      father; and the distemper began to appear upon some of them even\r\n      before he found it upon himself. But searching more narrowly, it\r\n      appeared he had been affected some time; and as soon as he found\r\n      that his family had been poisoned by himself he went distracted,\r\n      and would have laid violent hands upon himself, but was kept from\r\n      that by those who looked to him, and in a few days died.\r\n\r\n      (2) The other particular is, that many people having been well to\r\n      the best of their own judgement, or by the best observation which\r\n      they could make of themselves for several days, and only finding\r\n      a decay of appetite, or a light sickness upon their stomachs;\r\n      nay, some whose appetite has been strong, and even craving, and\r\n      only a light pain in their heads, have sent for physicians to\r\n      know what ailed them, and have been found, to their great\r\n      surprise, at the brink of death: the tokens upon them, or the\r\n      plague grown up to an incurable height.\r\n\r\n      It was very sad to reflect how such a person as this last\r\n      mentioned above had been a walking destroyer perhaps for a week\r\n      or a fortnight before that; how he had ruined those that he would\r\n      have hazarded his life to save, and had been breathing death upon\r\n      them, even perhaps in his tender kissing and embracings of his\r\n      own children. Yet thus certainly it was, and often has been, and\r\n      I could give many particular cases where it has been so. If then\r\n      the blow is thus insensibly striking\xe2\x80\x94if the arrow flies thus\r\n      unseen, and cannot be discovered\xe2\x80\x94to what purpose are all the\r\n      schemes for shutting up or removing the sick people? Those\r\n      schemes cannot take place but upon those that appear to be sick,\r\n      or to be infected; whereas there are among them at the same time\r\n      thousands of people who seem to be well, but are all that while\r\n      carrying death with them into all companies which they come into.\r\n\r\n      This frequently puzzled our physicians, and especially the\r\n      apothecaries and surgeons, who knew not how to discover the sick\r\n      from the sound; they all allowed that it was really so, that many\r\n      people had the plague in their very blood, and preying upon their\r\n      spirits, and were in themselves but walking putrefied carcases\r\n      whose breath was infectious and their sweat poison, and yet were\r\n      as well to look on as other people, and even knew it not\r\n      themselves; I say, they all allowed that it was really true in\r\n      fact, but they knew not how to propose a discovery.\r\n\r\n      My friend Dr Heath was of opinion that it might be known by the\r\n      smell of their breath; but then, as he said, who durst smell to\r\n      that breath for his information? since, to know it, he must draw\r\n      the stench of the plague up into his own brain, in order to\r\n      distinguish the smell! I have heard it was the opinion of others\r\n      that it might be distinguished by the party\xe2\x80\x99s breathing upon a\r\n      piece of glass, where, the breath condensing, there might living\r\n      creatures be seen by a microscope, of strange, monstrous, and\r\n      frightful shapes, such as dragons, snakes, serpents, and devils,\r\n      horrible to behold. But this I very much question the truth of,\r\n      and we had no microscopes at that time, as I remember, to make\r\n      the experiment with.\r\n\r\n      It was the opinion also of another learned man, that the breath\r\n      of such a person would poison and instantly kill a bird; not only\r\n      a small bird, but even a cock or hen, and that, if it did not\r\n      immediately kill the latter, it would cause them to be roupy, as\r\n      they call it; particularly that if they had laid any eggs at any\r\n      time, they would be all rotten. But those are opinions which I\r\n      never found supported by any experiments, or heard of others that\r\n      had seen it; so I leave them as I find them; only with this\r\n      remark, namely, that I think the probabilities are very strong\r\n      for them.\r\n\r\n      Some have proposed that such persons should breathe hard upon\r\n      warm water, and that they would leave an unusual scum upon it, or\r\n      upon several other things, especially such as are of a glutinous\r\n      substance and are apt to receive a scum and support it.\r\n\r\n      But from the whole I found that the nature of this contagion was\r\n      such that it was impossible to discover it at all, or to prevent\r\n      its spreading from one to another by any human skill.\r\n\r\n      Here was indeed one difficulty which I could never thoroughly get\r\n      over to this time, and which there is but one way of answering\r\n      that I know of, and it is this, viz., the first person that died\r\n      of the plague was on December 20, or thereabouts, 1664, and in or\r\n      about long Acre; whence the first person had the infection was\r\n      generally said to be from a parcel of silks imported from\r\n      Holland, and first opened in that house.\r\n\r\n      But after this we heard no more of any person dying of the\r\n      plague, or of the distemper being in that place, till the 9th of\r\n      February, which was about seven weeks after, and then one more\r\n      was buried out of the same house. Then it was hushed, and we were\r\n      perfectly easy as to the public for a great while; for there were\r\n      no more entered in the weekly bill to be dead of the plague till\r\n      the 22nd of April, when there was two more buried, not out of the\r\n      same house, but out of the same street; and, as near as I can\r\n      remember, it was out of the next house to the first. This was\r\n      nine weeks asunder, and after this we had no more till a\r\n      fortnight, and then it broke out in several streets and spread\r\n      every way. Now the question seems to lie thus: Where lay the\r\n      seeds of the infection all this while? How came it to stop so\r\n      long, and not stop any longer? Either the distemper did not come\r\n      immediately by contagion from body to body, or, if it did, then a\r\n      body may be capable to continue infected without the disease\r\n      discovering itself many days, nay, weeks together; even not a\r\n      quarantine of days only, but soixantine; not only forty days, but\r\n      sixty days or longer.\r\n\r\n      It is true there was, as I observed at first, and is well known\r\n      to many yet living, a very cold winter and a long frost which\r\n      continued three months; and this, the doctors say, might check\r\n      the infection; but then the learned must allow me to say that if,\r\n      according to their notion, the disease was (as I may say) only\r\n      frozen up, it would like a frozen river have returned to its\r\n      usual force and current when it thawed\xe2\x80\x94whereas the principal\r\n      recess of this infection, which was from February to April, was\r\n      after the frost was broken and the weather mild and warm.\r\n\r\n      But there is another way of solving all this difficulty, which I\r\n      think my own remembrance of the thing will supply; and that is,\r\n      the fact is not granted\xe2\x80\x94namely, that there died none in those\r\n      long intervals, viz., from the 20th of December to the 9th of\r\n      February, and from thence to the 22nd of April. The weekly bills\r\n      are the only evidence on the other side, and those bills were not\r\n      of credit enough, at least with me, to support an hypothesis or\r\n      determine a question of such importance as this; for it was our\r\n      received opinion at that time, and I believe upon very good\r\n      grounds, that the fraud lay in the parish officers, searchers,\r\n      and persons appointed to give account of the dead, and what\r\n      diseases they died of; and as people were very loth at first to\r\n      have the neighbours believe their houses were infected, so they\r\n      gave money to procure, or otherwise procured, the dead persons to\r\n      be returned as dying of other distempers; and this I know was\r\n      practised afterwards in many places, I believe I might say in all\r\n      places where the distemper came, as will be seen by the vast\r\n      increase of the numbers placed in the weekly bills under other\r\n      articles of diseases during the time of the infection. For\r\n      example, in the months of July and August, when the plague was\r\n      coming on to its highest pitch, it was very ordinary to have from\r\n      a thousand to twelve hundred, nay, to almost fifteen hundred a\r\n      week of other distempers. Not that the numbers of those\r\n      distempers were really increased to such a degree, but the great\r\n      number of families and houses where really the infection was,\r\n      obtained the favour to have their dead be returned of other\r\n      distempers, to prevent the shutting up their houses.

Once, on a public day, whether a Sabbath-day or not I\r\n      do not remember, in Aldgate Church, in a pew full of people, on a\r\n      sudden one fancied she smelt an ill smell. Immediately she\r\n      fancies the plague was in the pew, whispers her notion or\r\n      suspicion to the next, then rises and goes out of the pew. It\r\n      immediately took with the next, and so to them all; and every one\r\n      of them, and of the two or three adjoining pews, got up and went\r\n      out of the church, nobody knowing what it was offended them, or\r\n      from whom.\r\n\r\n      This immediately filled everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mouths with one preparation\r\n      or other, such as the old woman directed, and some perhaps as\r\n      physicians directed, in order to prevent infection by the breath\r\n      of others; insomuch that if we came to go into a church when it\r\n      was anything full of people, there would be such a mixture of\r\n      smells at the entrance that it was much more strong, though\r\n      perhaps not so wholesome, than if you were going into an\r\n      apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s or druggist\xe2\x80\x99s shop. In a word, the whole church was\r\n      like a smelling-bottle; in one corner it was all perfumes; in\r\n      another, aromatics, balsamics, and variety of drugs and herbs; in\r\n      another, salts and spirits, as every one was furnished for their\r\n      own preservation. Yet I observed that after people were\r\n      possessed, as I have said, with the belief, or rather assurance,\r\n      of the infection being thus carried on by persons apparently in\r\n      health, the churches and meeting-houses were much thinner of\r\n      people than at other times before that they used to be. For this\r\n      is to be said of the people of London, that during the whole time\r\n      of the pestilence the churches or meetings were never wholly shut\r\n      up, nor did the people decline coming out to the public worship\r\n      of God, except only in some parishes when the violence of the\r\n      distemper was more particularly in that parish at that time, and\r\n      even then no longer than it continued to be so.\r\n\r\n      Indeed nothing was more strange than to see with what courage the\r\n      people went to the public service of God, even at that time when\r\n      they were afraid to stir out of their own houses upon any other\r\n      occasion; this, I mean, before the time of desperation, which I\r\n      have mentioned already. This was a proof of the exceeding\r\n      populousness of the city at the time of the infection,\r\n      notwithstanding the great numbers that were gone into the country\r\n      at the first alarm, and that fled out into the forests and woods\r\n      when they were further terrified with the extraordinary increase\r\n      of it. For when we came to see the crowds and throngs of people\r\n      which appeared on the Sabbath-days at the churches, and\r\n      especially in those parts of the town where the plague was\r\n      abated, or where it was not yet come to its height, it was\r\n      amazing. But of this I shall speak again presently. I return in\r\n      the meantime to the article of infecting one another at first,\r\n      before people came to right notions of the infection, and of\r\n      infecting one another. People were only shy of those that were\r\n      really sick, a man with a cap upon his head, or with clothes\r\n      round his neck, which was the case of those that had swellings\r\n      there. Such was indeed frightful; but when we saw a gentleman\r\n      dressed, with his band on and his gloves in his hand, his hat\r\n      upon his head, and his hair combed, of such we had not the least\r\n      apprehensions, and people conversed a great while freely,\r\n      especially with their neighbours and such as they knew. But when\r\n      the physicians assured us that the danger was as well from the\r\n      sound (that is, the seemingly sound) as the sick, and that those\r\n      people who thought themselves entirely free were oftentimes the\r\n      most fatal, and that it came to be generally understood that\r\n      people were sensible of it, and of the reason of it; then, I say,\r\n      they began to be jealous of everybody, and a vast number of\r\n      people locked themselves up, so as not to come abroad into any\r\n      company at all, nor suffer any that had been abroad in\r\n      promiscuous company to come into their houses, or near them\xe2\x80\x94at\r\n      least not so near them as to be within the reach of their breath\r\n      or of any smell from them; and when they were obliged to converse\r\n      at a distance with strangers, they would always have\r\n      preservatives in their mouths and about their clothes to repel\r\n      and keep off the infection.\r\n\r\n      It must be acknowledged that when people began to use these\r\n      cautions they were less exposed to danger, and the infection did\r\n      not break into such houses so furiously as it did into others\r\n      before; and thousands of families were preserved (speaking with\r\n      due reserve to the direction of Divine Providence) by that means.\r\n\r\n      But it was impossible to beat anything into the heads of the\r\n      poor. They went on with the usual impetuosity of their tempers,\r\n      full of outcries and lamentations when taken, but madly careless\r\n      of themselves, foolhardy and obstinate, while they were well.\r\n      Where they could get employment they pushed into any kind of\r\n      business, the most dangerous and the most liable to infection;\r\n      and if they were spoken to, their answer would be, \xe2\x80\x98I must trust\r\n      to God for that; if I am taken, then I am provided for, and there\r\n      is an end of me\xe2\x80\x99, and the like. Or thus, \xe2\x80\x98Why, what must I do? I\r\n      can\xe2\x80\x99t starve. I had as good have the plague as perish for want. I\r\n      have no work; what could I do? I must do this or beg.\xe2\x80\x99 Suppose it\r\n      was burying the dead, or attending the sick, or watching infected\r\n      houses, which were all terrible hazards; but their tale was\r\n      generally the same. It is true, necessity was a very justifiable,\r\n      warrantable plea, and nothing could be better; but their way of\r\n      talk was much the same where the necessities were not the same.\r\n      This adventurous conduct of the poor was that which brought the\r\n      plague among them in a most furious manner; and this, joined to\r\n      the distress of their circumstances when taken, was the reason\r\n      why they died so by heaps; for I cannot say I could observe one\r\n      jot of better husbandry among them, I mean the labouring poor,\r\n      while they were all well and getting money than there was before,\r\n      but as lavish, as extravagant, and as thoughtless for tomorrow as\r\n      ever; so that when they came to be taken sick they were\r\n      immediately in the utmost distress, as well for want as for\r\n      sickness, as well for lack of food as lack of health.\r\n\r\n      This misery of the poor I had many occasions to be an eyewitness\r\n      of, and sometimes also of the charitable assistance that some\r\n      pious people daily gave to such, sending them relief and supplies\r\n      both of food, physic, and other help, as they found they wanted;\r\n      and indeed it is a debt of justice due to the temper of the\r\n      people of that day to take notice here, that not only great sums,\r\n      very great sums of money were charitably sent to the Lord Mayor\r\n      and aldermen for the assistance and support of the poor\r\n      distempered people, but abundance of private people daily\r\n      distributed large sums of money for their relief, and sent people\r\n      about to inquire into the condition of particular distressed and\r\n      visited families, and relieved them; nay, some pious ladies were\r\n      so transported with zeal in so good a work, and so confident in\r\n      the protection of Providence in discharge of the great duty of\r\n      charity, that they went about in person distributing alms to the\r\n      poor, and even visiting poor families, though sick and infected,\r\n      in their very houses, appointing nurses to attend those that\r\n      wanted attending, and ordering apothecaries and surgeons, the\r\n      first to supply them with drugs or plasters, and such things as\r\n      they wanted; and the last to lance and dress the swellings and\r\n      tumours, where such were wanting; giving their blessing to the\r\n      poor in substantial relief to them, as well as hearty prayers for\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n      I will not undertake to say, as some do, that none of those\r\n      charitable people were suffered to fall under the calamity\r\n      itself; but this I may say, that I never knew any one of them\r\n      that miscarried, which I mention for the encouragement of others\r\n      in case of the like distress; and doubtless, if they that give to\r\n      the poor lend to the Lord, and He will repay them, those that\r\n      hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort and assist\r\n      the poor in such a misery as this, may hope to be protected in\r\n      the work.\r\n\r\n      Nor was this charity so extraordinary eminent only in a few, but\r\n      (for I cannot lightly quit this point) the charity of the rich,\r\n      as well in the city and suburbs as from the country, was so great\r\n      that, in a word, a prodigious number of people who must otherwise\r\n      inevitably have perished for want as well as sickness were\r\n      supported and subsisted by it; and though I could never, nor I\r\n      believe any one else, come to a full knowledge of what was so\r\n      contributed, yet I do believe that, as I heard one say that was a\r\n      critical observer of that part, there was not only many thousand\r\n      pounds contributed, but many hundred thousand pounds, to the\r\n      relief of the poor of this distressed, afflicted city; nay, one\r\n      man affirmed to me that he could reckon up above one hundred\r\n      thousand pounds a week, which was distributed by the\r\n      churchwardens at the several parish vestries by the Lord Mayor\r\n      and aldermen in the several wards and precincts, and by the\r\n      particular direction of the court and of the justices\r\n      respectively in the parts where they resided, over and above the\r\n      private charity distributed by pious bands in the manner I speak\r\n      of; and this continued for many weeks together.\r\n\r\n      I confess this is a very great sum; but if it be true that there\r\n      was distributed in the parish of Cripplegate only, 17,800 in one\r\n      week to the relief of the poor, as I heard reported, and which I\r\n      really believe was true, the other may not be improbable.\r\n\r\n      It was doubtless to be reckoned among the many signal good\r\n      providences which attended this great city, and of which there\r\n      were many other worth recording,\xe2\x80\x94I say, this was a very\r\n      remarkable one, that it pleased God thus to move the hearts of\r\n      the people in all parts of the kingdom so cheerfully to\r\n      contribute to the relief and support of the poor at London, the\r\n      good consequences of which were felt many ways, and particularly\r\n      in preserving the lives and recovering the health of so many\r\n      thousands, and keeping so many thousands of families from\r\n      perishing and starving.\r\n\r\n      And now I am talking of the merciful disposition of Providence in\r\n      this time of calamity, I cannot but mention again, though I have\r\n      spoken several times of it already on other accounts, I mean that\r\n      of the progression of the distemper; how it began at one end of\r\n      the town, and proceeded gradually and slowly from one part to\r\n      another, and like a dark cloud that passes over our heads, which,\r\n      as it thickens and overcasts the air at one end, clears up at the\r\n      other end; so, while the plague went on raging from west to east,\r\n      as it went forwards east, it abated in the west, by which means\r\n      those parts of the town which were not seized, or who were left,\r\n      and where it had spent its fury, were (as it were) spared to help\r\n      and assist the other; whereas, had the distemper spread itself\r\n      over the whole city and suburbs, at once, raging in all places\r\n      alike, as it has done since in some places abroad, the whole body\r\n      of the people must have been overwhelmed, and there would have\r\n      died twenty thousand a day, as they say there did at Naples; nor\r\n      would the people have been able to have helped or assisted one\r\n      another.\r\n\r\n      For it must be observed that where the plague was in its full\r\n      force, there indeed the people were very miserable, and the\r\n      consternation was inexpressible. But a little before it reached\r\n      even to that place, or presently after it was gone, they were\r\n      quite another sort of people; and I cannot but acknowledge that\r\n      there was too much of that common temper of mankind to be found\r\n      among us all at that time, namely, to forget the deliverance when\r\n      the danger is past. But I shall come to speak of that part again.\r\n\r\n      It must not be forgot here to take some notice of the state of\r\n      trade during the time of this common calamity, and this with\r\n      respect to foreign trade, as also to our home trade.\r\n\r\n      As to foreign trade, there needs little to be said. The trading\r\n      nations of Europe were all afraid of us; no port of France, or\r\n      Holland, or Spain, or Italy would admit our ships or correspond\r\n      with us; indeed we stood on ill terms with the Dutch, and were in\r\n      a furious war with them, but though in a bad condition to fight\r\n      abroad, who had such dreadful enemies to struggle with at home.\r\n\r\n      Our merchants were accordingly at a full stop; their ships could\r\n      go nowhere\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, to no place abroad; their manufactures\r\n      and merchandise\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, of our growth\xe2\x80\x94would not be\r\n      touched abroad. They were as much afraid of our goods as they\r\n      were of our people; and indeed they had reason: for our woollen\r\n      manufactures are as retentive of infection as human bodies, and\r\n      if packed up by persons infected, would receive the infection and\r\n      be as dangerous to touch as a man would be that was infected; and\r\n      therefore, when any English vessel arrived in foreign countries,\r\n      if they did take the goods on shore, they always caused the bales\r\n      to be opened and aired in places appointed for that purpose. But\r\n      from London they would not suffer them to come into port, much\r\n      less to unlade their goods, upon any terms whatever, and this\r\n      strictness was especially used with them in Spain and Italy. In\r\n      Turkey and the islands of the Arches indeed, as they are called,\r\n      as well those belonging to the Turks as to the Venetians, they\r\n      were not so very rigid. In the first there was no obstruction at\r\n      all; and four ships which were then in the river loading for\r\n      Italy\xe2\x80\x94that is, for Leghorn and Naples\xe2\x80\x94being denied product, as\r\n      they call it, went on to Turkey, and were freely admitted to\r\n      unlade their cargo without any difficulty; only that when they\r\n      arrived there, some of their cargo was not fit for sale in that\r\n      country; and other parts of it being consigned to merchants at\r\n      Leghorn, the captains of the ships had no right nor any orders to\r\n      dispose of the goods; so that great inconveniences followed to\r\n      the merchants. But this was nothing but what the necessity of\r\n      affairs required, and the merchants at Leghorn and Naples having\r\n      notice given them, sent again from thence to take care of the\r\n      effects which were particularly consigned to those ports, and to\r\n      bring back in other ships such as were improper for the markets\r\n      at Smyrna and Scanderoon.\r\n\r\n      The inconveniences in Spain and Portugal were still greater, for\r\n      they would by no means suffer our ships, especially those from\r\n      London, to come into any of their ports, much less to unlade.\r\n      There was a report that one of our ships having by stealth\r\n      delivered her cargo, among which was some bales of English cloth,\r\n      cotton, kerseys, and such-like goods, the Spaniards caused all\r\n      the goods to be burned, and punished the men with death who were\r\n      concerned in carrying them on shore. This, I believe, was in part\r\n      true, though I do not affirm it; but it is not at all unlikely,\r\n      seeing the danger was really very great, the infection being so\r\n      violent in London.\r\n\r\n      I heard likewise that the plague was carried into those countries\r\n      by some of our ships, and particularly to the port of Faro in the\r\n      kingdom of Algarve, belonging to the King of Portugal, and that\r\n      several persons died of it there; but it was not confirmed.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, though the Spaniards and Portuguese were so\r\n      shy of us, it is most certain that the plague (as has been said)\r\n      keeping at first much at that end of the town next Westminster,\r\n      the merchandising part of the town (such as the city and the\r\n      water-side) was perfectly sound till at least the beginning of\r\n      July, and the ships in the river till the beginning of August;\r\n      for to the 1st of July there had died but seven within the whole\r\n      city, and but sixty within the liberties, but one in all the\r\n      parishes of Stepney, Aldgate, and Whitechappel, and but two in\r\n      the eight parishes of Southwark. But it was the same thing\r\n      abroad, for the bad news was gone over the whole world that the\r\n      city of London was infected with the plague, and there was no\r\n      inquiring there how the infection proceeded, or at which part of\r\n      the town it was begun or was reached to.\r\n\r\n      Besides, after it began to spread it increased so fast, and the\r\n      bills grew so high all on a sudden, that it was to no purpose to\r\n      lessen the report of it, or endeavour to make the people abroad\r\n      think it better than it was; the account which the weekly bills\r\n      gave in was sufficient; and that there died two thousand to three\r\n      or four thousand a week was sufficient to alarm the whole trading\r\n      part of the world; and the following time, being so dreadful also\r\n      in the very city itself, put the whole world, I say, upon their\r\n      guard against it.\r\n\r\n      You may be sure, also, that the report of these things lost\r\n      nothing in the carriage. The plague was itself very terrible, and\r\n      the distress of the people very great, as you may observe of what\r\n      I have said. But the rumour was infinitely greater, and it must\r\n      not be wondered that our friends abroad (as my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      correspondents in particular were told there, namely, in Portugal\r\n      and Italy, where he chiefly traded) [said] that in London there\r\n      died twenty thousand in a week; that the dead bodies lay unburied\r\n      by heaps; that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead or\r\n      the sound to look after the sick; that all the kingdom was\r\n      infected likewise, so that it was an universal malady such as was\r\n      never heard of in those parts of the world; and they could hardly\r\n      believe us when we gave them an account how things really were,\r\n      and how there was not above one-tenth part of the people dead;\r\n      that there was 500,000, left that lived all the time in the town;\r\n      that now the people began to walk the streets again, and those\r\n      who were fled to return, there was no miss of the usual throng of\r\n      people in the streets, except as every family might miss their\r\n      relations and neighbours, and the like. I say they could not\r\n      believe these things; and if inquiry were now to be made in\r\n      Naples, or in other cities on the coast of Italy, they would tell\r\n      you that there was a dreadful infection in London so many years\r\n      ago, in which, as above, there died twenty thousand in a week,\r\n      &c., just as we have had it reported in London that there was a\r\n      plague in the city of Naples in the year 1656, in which there\r\n      died 20,000 people in a day, of which I have had very good\r\n      satisfaction that it was utterly false.\r\n\r\n      But these extravagant reports were very prejudicial to our trade,\r\n      as well as unjust and injurious in themselves, for it was a long\r\n      time after the plague was quite over before our trade could\r\n      recover itself in those parts of the world; and the Flemings and\r\n      Dutch (but especially the last) made very great advantages of it,\r\n      having all the market to themselves, and even buying our\r\n      manufactures in several parts of England where the plague was\r\n      not, and carrying them to Holland and Flanders, and from thence\r\n      transporting them to Spain and to Italy as if they had been of\r\n      their own making.\r\n\r\n      But they were detected sometimes and punished: that is to say,\r\n      their goods confiscated and ships also; for if it was true that\r\n      our manufactures as well as our people were infected, and that it\r\n      was dangerous to touch or to open and receive the smell of them,\r\n      then those people ran the hazard by that clandestine trade not\r\n      only of carrying the contagion into their own country, but also\r\n      of infecting the nations to whom they traded with those goods;\r\n      which, considering how many lives might be lost in consequence of\r\n      such an action, must be a trade that no men of conscience could\r\n      suffer themselves to be concerned in.\r\n\r\n      I do not take upon me to say that any harm was done, I mean of\r\n      that kind, by those people. But I doubt I need not make any such\r\n      proviso in the case of our own country; for either by our people\r\n      of London, or by the commerce which made their conversing with\r\n      all sorts of people in every country and of every considerable\r\n      town necessary, I say, by this means the plague was first or last\r\n      spread all over the kingdom, as well in London as in all the\r\n      cities and great towns, especially in the trading manufacturing\r\n      towns and seaports; so that, first or last, all the considerable\r\n      places in England were visited more or less, and the kingdom of\r\n      Ireland in some places, but not so universally. How it fared with\r\n      the people in Scotland I had no opportunity to inquire.\r\n\r\n      It is to be observed that while the plague continued so violent\r\n      in London, the outports, as they are called, enjoyed a very great\r\n      trade, especially to the adjacent countries and to our own\r\n      plantations. For example, the towns of Colchester, Yarmouth, and\r\n      Hull, on that side of England, exported to Holland and Hamburg\r\n      the manufactures of the adjacent countries for several months\r\n      after the trade with London was, as it were, entirely shut up;\r\n      likewise the cities of Bristol and Exeter, with the port of\r\n      Plymouth, had the like advantage to Spain, to the Canaries, to\r\n      Guinea, and to the West Indies, and particularly to Ireland; but\r\n      as the plague spread itself every way after it had been in London\r\n      to such a degree as it was in August and September, so all or\r\n      most of those cities and towns were infected first or last; and\r\n      then trade was, as it were, under a general embargo or at a full\r\n      stop\xe2\x80\x94as I shall observe further when I speak of our home trade.\r\n\r\n      One thing, however, must be observed: that as to ships coming in\r\n      from abroad (as many, you may be sure, did) some who were out in\r\n      all parts of the world a considerable while before, and some who\r\n      when they went out knew nothing of an infection, or at least of\r\n      one so terrible\xe2\x80\x94these came up the river boldly, and delivered\r\n      their cargoes as they were obliged to do, except just in the two\r\n      months of August and September, when the weight of the infection\r\n      lying, as I may say, all below Bridge, nobody durst appear in\r\n      business for a while. But as this continued but for a few weeks,\r\n      the homeward-bound ships, especially such whose cargoes were not\r\n      liable to spoil, came to an anchor for a time short of the\r\n      Pool,[5] or fresh-water part of the river, even as low as the\r\n      river Medway, where several of them ran in; and others lay at the\r\n      Nore, and in the Hope below Gravesend. So that by the latter end\r\n      of October there was a very great fleet of homeward-bound ships\r\n      to come up, such as the like had not been known for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] That part of the river where the ships lie up when they come home\r\n is called the Pool, and takes in all the river on both sides of the\r\n water, from the Tower to Cuckold\xe2\x80\x99s Point and Limehouse. [Footnote in\r\n the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Two particular trades were carried on by water-carriage all the\r\n      while of the infection, and that with little or no interruption,\r\n      very much to the advantage and comfort of the poor distressed\r\n      people of the city: and those were the coasting trade for corn\r\n      and the Newcastle trade for coals.\r\n\r\n      The first of these was particularly carried on by small vessels\r\n      from the port of Hull and other places on the Humber, by which\r\n      great quantities of corn were brought in from Yorkshire and\r\n      Lincolnshire. The other part of this corn-trade was from Lynn, in\r\n      Norfolk, from Wells and Burnham, and from Yarmouth, all in the\r\n      same county; and the third branch was from the river Medway, and\r\n      from Milton, Feversham, Margate, and Sandwich, and all the other\r\n      little places and ports round the coast of Kent and Essex.\r\n\r\n      There was also a very good trade from the coast of Suffolk with\r\n      corn, butter, and cheese; these vessels kept a constant course of\r\n      trade, and without interruption came up to that market known\r\n      still by the name of Bear Key, where they supplied the city\r\n      plentifully with corn when land-carriage began to fail, and when\r\n      the people began to be sick of coming from many places in the\r\n      country.\r\n\r\n      This also was much of it owing to the prudence and conduct of the\r\n      Lord Mayor, who took such care to keep the masters and seamen\r\n      from danger when they came up, causing their corn to be bought\r\n      off at any time they wanted a market (which, however, was very\r\n      seldom), and causing the corn-factors immediately to unlade and\r\n      deliver the vessels loaden with corn, that they had very little\r\n      occasion to come out of their ships or vessels, the money being\r\n      always carried on board to them and put into a pail of vinegar\r\n      before it was carried.\r\n\r\n      The second trade was that of coals from Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\r\n      without which the city would have been greatly distressed; for\r\n      not in the streets only, but in private houses and families,\r\n      great quantities of coals were then burnt, even all the summer\r\n      long and when the weather was hottest, which was done by the\r\n      advice of the physicians. Some indeed opposed it, and insisted\r\n      that to keep the houses and rooms hot was a means to propagate\r\n      the temper, which was a fermentation and heat already in the\r\n      blood; that it was known to spread and increase in hot weather\r\n      and abate in cold; and therefore they alleged that all contagious\r\n      distempers are the worse for heat, because the contagion was\r\n      nourished and gained strength in hot weather, and was, as it\r\n      were, propagated in heat.\r\n\r\n      Others said they granted that heat in the climate might propagate\r\n      infection\xe2\x80\x94as sultry, hot weather fills the air with vermin and\r\n      nourishes innumerable numbers and kinds of venomous creatures\r\n      which breed in our food, in the plants, and even in our bodies,\r\n      by the very stench of which infection may be propagated; also\r\n      that heat in the air, or heat of weather, as we ordinarily call\r\n      it, makes bodies relax and faint, exhausts the spirits, opens the\r\n      pores, and makes us more apt to receive infection, or any evil\r\n      influence, be it from noxious pestilential vapours or any other\r\n      thing in the air; but that the heat of fire, and especially of\r\n      coal fires kept in our houses, or near us, had a quite different\r\n      operation; the heat being not of the same kind, but quick and\r\n      fierce, tending not to nourish but to consume and dissipate all\r\n      those noxious fumes which the other kind of heat rather exhaled\r\n      and stagnated than separated and burnt up. Besides, it was\r\n      alleged that the sulphurous and nitrous particles that are often\r\n      found to be in the coal, with that bituminous substance which\r\n      burns, are all assisting to clear and purge the air, and render\r\n      it wholesome and safe to breathe in after the noxious particles,\r\n      as above, are dispersed and burnt up.\r\n\r\n      The latter opinion prevailed at that time, and, as I must\r\n      confess, I think with good reason; and the experience of the\r\n      citizens confirmed it, many houses which had constant fires kept\r\n      in the rooms having never been infected at all; and I must join\r\n      my experience to it, for I found the keeping good fires kept our\r\n      rooms sweet and wholesome, and I do verily believe made our whole\r\n      family so, more than would otherwise have been.\r\n\r\n      But I return to the coals as a trade. It was with no little\r\n      difficulty that this trade was kept open, and particularly\r\n      because, as we were in an open war with the Dutch at that time,\r\n      the Dutch capers at first took a great many of our collier-ships,\r\n      which made the rest cautious, and made them to stay to come in\r\n      fleets together. But after some time the capers were either\r\n      afraid to take them, or their masters, the States, were afraid\r\n      they should, and forbade them, lest the plague should be among\r\n      them, which made them fare the better.\r\n\r\n      For the security of those northern traders, the coal-ships were\r\n      ordered by my Lord Mayor not to come up into the Pool above a\r\n      certain number at a time, and ordered lighters and other vessels\r\n      such as the woodmongers (that is, the wharf-keepers or\r\n      coal-sellers) furnished, to go down and take out the coals as low\r\n      as Deptford and Greenwich, and some farther down.\r\n\r\n      Others delivered great quantities of coals in particular places\r\n      where the ships could come to the shore, as at Greenwich,\r\n      Blackwall, and other places, in vast heaps, as if to be kept for\r\n      sale; but were then fetched away after the ships which brought\r\n      them were gone, so that the seamen had no communication with the\r\n      river-men, nor so much as came near one another.\r\n\r\n      Yet all this caution could not effectually prevent the distemper\r\n      getting among the colliery: that is to say among the ships, by\r\n      which a great many seamen died of it; and that which was still\r\n      worse was, that they carried it down to Ipswich and Yarmouth, to\r\n      Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and other places on the coast\xe2\x80\x94where,\r\n      especially at Newcastle and at Sunderland, it carried off a great\r\n      number of people.\r\n\r\n      The making so many fires, as above, did indeed consume an unusual\r\n      quantity of coals; and that upon one or two stops of the ships\r\n      coming up, whether by contrary weather or by the interruption of\r\n      enemies I do not remember, but the price of coals was exceeding\r\n      dear, even as high as 4 l. a chalder; but it soon abated when the\r\n      ships came in, and as afterwards they had a freer passage, the\r\n      price was very reasonable all the rest of that year.\r\n\r\n      The public fires which were made on these occasions, as I have\r\n      calculated it, must necessarily have cost the city about 200\r\n      chalders of coals a week, if they had continued, which was indeed\r\n      a very great quantity; but as it was thought necessary, nothing\r\n      was spared. However, as some of the physicians cried them down,\r\n      they were not kept alight above four or five days. The fires were\r\n      ordered thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      One at the Custom House, one at Billingsgate, one at Queenhith,\r\n      and one at the Three Cranes; one in Blackfriars, and one at the\r\n      gate of Bridewell; one at the corner of Leadenhal Street and\r\n      Gracechurch; one at the north and one at the south gate of the\r\n      Royal Exchange; one at Guild Hall, and one at Blackwell Hall\r\n      gate; one at the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s door in St Helen\xe2\x80\x99s, one at the west\r\n      entrance into St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, and one at the entrance into Bow Church.\r\n      I do not remember whether there was any at the city gates, but\r\n      one at the Bridge-foot there was, just by St Magnus Church.\r\n\r\n      I know some have quarrelled since that at the experiment, and\r\n      said that there died the more people because of those fires; but\r\n      I am persuaded those that say so offer no evidence to prove it,\r\n      neither can I believe it on any account whatever.\r\n\r\n      It remains to give some account of the state of trade at home in\r\n      England during this dreadful time, and particularly as it relates\r\n      to the manufactures and the trade in the city. At the first\r\n      breaking out of the infection there was, as it is easy to\r\n      suppose, a very great fright among the people, and consequently a\r\n      general stop of trade, except in provisions and necessaries of\r\n      life; and even in those things, as there was a vast number of\r\n      people fled and a very great number always sick, besides the\r\n      number which died, so there could not be above two-thirds, if\r\n      above one-half, of the consumption of provisions in the city as\r\n      used to be.\r\n\r\n      It pleased God to send a very plentiful year of corn and fruit,\r\n      but not of hay or grass\xe2\x80\x94by which means bread was cheap, by reason\r\n      of the plenty of corn. Flesh was cheap, by reason of the scarcity\r\n      of grass; but butter and cheese were dear for the same reason,\r\n      and hay in the market just beyond Whitechappel Bars was sold at 4\r\n      pound per load. But that affected not the poor. There was a most\r\n      excessive plenty of all sorts of fruit, such as apples, pears,\r\n      plums, cherries, grapes, and they were the cheaper because of the\r\n      want of people; but this made the poor eat them to excess, and\r\n      this brought them into fluxes, griping of the guts, surfeits, and\r\n      the like, which often precipitated them into the plague.\r\n\r\n      But to come to matters of trade. First, foreign exportation being\r\n      stopped or at least very much interrupted and rendered difficult,\r\n      a general stop of all those manufactures followed of course which\r\n      were usually brought for exportation; and though sometimes\r\n      merchants abroad were importunate for goods, yet little was sent,\r\n      the passages being so generally stopped that the English ships\r\n      would not be admitted, as is said already, into their port.\r\n\r\n      This put a stop to the manufactures that were for exportation in\r\n      most parts of England, except in some out-ports; and even that\r\n      was soon stopped, for they all had the plague in their turn. But\r\n      though this was felt all over England, yet, what was still worse,\r\n      all intercourse of trade for home consumption of manufactures,\r\n      especially those which usually circulated through the Londoner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      hands, was stopped at once, the trade of the city being stopped.\r\n\r\n      All kinds of handicrafts in the city, &c., tradesmen and\r\n      mechanics, were, as I have said before, out of employ; and this\r\n      occasioned the putting-off and dismissing an innumerable number\r\n      of journeymen and workmen of all sorts, seeing nothing was done\r\n      relating to such trades but what might be said to be absolutely\r\n      necessary.\r\n\r\n      This caused the multitude of single people in London to be\r\n      unprovided for, as also families whose living depended upon the\r\n      labour of the heads of those families; I say, this reduced them\r\n      to extreme misery; and I must confess it is for the honour of the\r\n      city of London, and will be for many ages, as long as this is to\r\n      be spoken of, that they were able to supply with charitable\r\n      provision the wants of so many thousands of those as afterwards\r\n      fell sick and were distressed: so that it may be safely averred\r\n      that nobody perished for want, at least that the magistrates had\r\n      any notice given them of.\r\n\r\n      This stagnation of our manufacturing trade in the country would\r\n      have put the people there to much greater difficulties, but that\r\n      the master-workmen, clothiers and others, to the uttermost of\r\n      their stocks and strength, kept on making their goods to keep the\r\n      poor at work, believing that soon as the sickness should abate\r\n      they would have a quick demand in proportion to the decay of\r\n      their trade at that time. But as none but those masters that were\r\n      rich could do thus, and that many were poor and not able, the\r\n      manufacturing trade in England suffered greatly, and the poor\r\n      were pinched all over England by the calamity of the city of\r\n      London only.\r\n\r\n      It is true that the next year made them full amends by another\r\n      terrible calamity upon the city; so that the city by one calamity\r\n      impoverished and weakened the country, and by another calamity,\r\n      even terrible too of its kind, enriched the country and made them\r\n      again amends; for an infinite quantity of household Stuff,\r\n      wearing apparel, and other things, besides whole warehouses\r\n      filled with merchandise and manufactures such as come from all\r\n      parts of England, were consumed in the fire of London the next\r\n      year after this terrible visitation. It is incredible what a\r\n      trade this made all over the whole kingdom, to make good the want\r\n      and to supply that loss; so that, in short, all the manufacturing\r\n      hands in the nation were set on work, and were little enough for\r\n      several years to supply the market and answer the demands. All\r\n      foreign markets also were empty of our goods by the stop which\r\n      had been occasioned by the plague, and before an open trade was\r\n      allowed again; and the prodigious demand at home falling in,\r\n      joined to make a quick vent for all sort of goods; so that there\r\n      never was known such a trade all over England for the time as was\r\n      in the first seven years after the plague, and after the fire of\r\n      London.\r\n\r\n      It remains now that I should say something of the merciful part\r\n      of this terrible judgement. The last week in September, the\r\n      plague being come to its crisis, its fury began to assuage. I\r\n      remember my friend Dr Heath, coming to see me the week before,\r\n      told me he was sure that the violence of it would assuage in a\r\n      few days; but when I saw the weekly bill of that week, which was\r\n      the highest of the whole year, being 8297 of all diseases, I\r\n      upbraided him with it, and asked him what he had made his\r\n      judgement from. His answer, however, was not so much to seek as I\r\n      thought it would have been. \xe2\x80\x98Look you,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98by the number\r\n      which are at this time sick and infected, there should have been\r\n      twenty thousand dead the last week instead of eight thousand, if\r\n      the inveterate mortal contagion had been as it was two weeks ago;\r\n      for then it ordinarily killed in two or three days, now not under\r\n      eight or ten; and then not above one in five recovered, whereas I\r\n      have observed that now not above two in five miscarry. And,\r\n      observe it from me, the next bill will decrease, and you will see\r\n      many more people recover than used to do; for though a vast\r\n      multitude are now everywhere infected, and as many every day fall\r\n      sick, yet there will not so many die as there did, for the\r\n      malignity of the distemper is abated\xe2\x80\x99;\xe2\x80\x94adding that he began now\r\n      to hope, nay, more than hope, that the infection had passed its\r\n      crisis and was going off; and accordingly so it was, for the next\r\n      week being, as I said, the last in September, the bill decreased\r\n      almost two thousand.\r\n\r\n      It is true the plague was still at a frightful height, and the\r\n      next bill was no less than 6460, and the next to that, 5720; but\r\n      still my friend\xe2\x80\x99s observation was just, and it did appear the\r\n      people did recover faster and more in number than they used to\r\n      do; and indeed, if it had not been so, what had been the\r\n      condition of the city of London? For, according to my friend,\r\n      there were not fewer than 60,000 people at that time infected,\r\n      whereof, as above, 20,477 died, and near 40,000 recovered;\r\n      whereas, had it been as it was before, 50,000 of that number\r\n      would very probably have died, if not more, and 50,000 more would\r\n      have sickened; for, in a word, the whole mass of people began to\r\n      sicken, and it looked as if none would escape.\r\n\r\n      But this remark of my friend\xe2\x80\x99s appeared more evident in a few\r\n      weeks more, for the decrease went on, and another week in October\r\n      it decreased 1843, so that the number dead of the plague was but\r\n      2665; and the next week it decreased 1413 more, and yet it was\r\n      seen plainly that there was abundance of people sick, nay,\r\n      abundance more than ordinary, and abundance fell sick every day\r\n      but (as above) the malignity of the disease abated.\r\n\r\n      Such is the precipitant disposition of our people (whether it is\r\n      so or not all over the world, that\xe2\x80\x99s none of my particular\r\n      business to inquire), but I saw it apparently here, that as upon\r\n      the first fright of the infection they shunned one another, and\r\n      fled from one another\xe2\x80\x99s houses and from the city with an\r\n      unaccountable and, as I thought, unnecessary fright, so now, upon\r\n      this notion spreading, viz., that the distemper was not so\r\n      catching as formerly, and that if it was catched it was not so\r\n      mortal, and seeing abundance of people who really fell sick\r\n      recover again daily, they took to such a precipitant courage, and\r\n      grew so entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection,\r\n      that they made no more of the plague than of an ordinary fever,\r\n      nor indeed so much. They not only went boldly into company with\r\n      those who had tumours and carbuncles upon them that were running,\r\n      and consequently contagious, but ate and drank with them, nay,\r\n      into their houses to visit them, and even, as I was told, into\r\n      their very chambers where they lay sick.\r\n\r\n      This I could not see rational. My friend Dr Heath allowed, and it\r\n      was plain to experience, that the distemper was as catching as\r\n      ever, and as many fell sick, but only he alleged that so many of\r\n      those that fell sick did not die; but I think that while many did\r\n      die, and that at best the distemper itself was very terrible, the\r\n      sores and swellings very tormenting, and the danger of death not\r\n      left out of the circumstances of sickness, though not so frequent\r\n      as before; all those things, together with the exceeding\r\n      tediousness of the cure, the loathsomeness of the disease, and\r\n      many other articles, were enough to deter any man living from a\r\n      dangerous mixture with the sick people, and make them as anxious\r\n      almost to avoid the infections as before.\r\n\r\n      Nay, there was another thing which made the mere catching of the\r\n      distemper frightful, and that was the terrible burning of the\r\n      caustics which the surgeons laid on the swellings to bring them\r\n      to break and to run, without which the danger of death was very\r\n      great, even to the last. Also, the insufferable torment of the\r\n      swellings, which, though it might not make people raving and\r\n      distracted, as they were before, and as I have given several\r\n      instances of already, yet they put the patient to inexpressible\r\n      torment; and those that fell into it, though they did escape with\r\n      life, yet they made bitter complaints of those that had told them\r\n      there was no danger, and sadly repented their rashness and folly\r\n      in venturing to run into the reach of it.\r\n\r\n      Nor did this unwary conduct of the people end here, for a great\r\n      many that thus cast off their cautions suffered more deeply\r\n      still, and though many escaped, yet many died; and at least it\r\n      had this public mischief attending it, that it made the decrease\r\n      of burials slower than it would otherwise have been. For as this\r\n      notion ran like lightning through the city, and people\xe2\x80\x99s heads\r\n      were possessed with it, even as soon as the first great decrease\r\n      in the bills appeared, we found that the two next bills did not\r\n      decrease in proportion; the reason I take to be the people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      running so rashly into danger, giving up all their former\r\n      cautions and care, and all the shyness which they used to\r\n      practise, depending that the sickness would not reach them\xe2\x80\x94or\r\n      that if it did, they should not die.\r\n\r\n      The physicians opposed this thoughtless humour of the people with\r\n      all their might, and gave out printed directions, spreading them\r\n      all over the city and suburbs, advising the people to continue\r\n      reserved, and to use still the utmost caution in their ordinary\r\n      conduct, notwithstanding the decrease of the distemper,\r\n      terrifying them with the danger of bringing a relapse upon the\r\n      whole city, and telling them how such a relapse might be more\r\n      fatal and dangerous than the whole visitation that had been\r\n      already; with many arguments and reasons to explain and prove\r\n      that part to them, and which are too long to repeat here.\r\n\r\n      But it was all to no purpose; the audacious creatures were so\r\n      possessed with the first joy and so surprised with the\r\n      satisfaction of seeing a vast decrease in the weekly bills, that\r\n      they were impenetrable by any new terrors, and would not be\r\n      persuaded but that the bitterness of death was past; and it was\r\n      to no more purpose to talk to them than to an east wind; but they\r\n      opened shops, went about streets, did business, and conversed\r\n      with anybody that came in their way to converse with, whether\r\n      with business or without, neither inquiring of their health or so\r\n      much as being apprehensive of any danger from them, though they\r\n      knew them not to be sound.\r\n\r\n      This imprudent, rash conduct cost a great many their lives who\r\n      had with great care and caution shut themselves up and kept\r\n      retired, as it were, from all mankind, and had by that means,\r\n      under God\xe2\x80\x99s providence, been preserved through all the heat of\r\n      that infection.\r\n\r\n      This rash and foolish conduct, I say, of the people went so far\r\n      that the ministers took notice to them of it at last, and laid\r\n      before them both the folly and danger of it; and this checked it\r\n      a little, so that they grew more cautious. But it had another\r\n      effect, which they could not check; for as the first rumour had\r\n      spread not over the city only, but into the country, it had the\r\n      like effect: and the people were so tired with being so long from\r\n      London, and so eager to come back, that they flocked to town\r\n      without fear or forecast, and began to show themselves in the\r\n      streets as if all the danger was over. It was indeed surprising\r\n      to see it, for though there died still from 1000 to 1800 a week,\r\n      yet the people flocked to town as if all had been well.\r\n\r\n      The consequence of this was, that the bills increased again 400\r\n      the very first week in November; and if I might believe the\r\n      physicians, there was above 3000 fell sick that week, most of\r\n      them new-comers, too.\r\n\r\n      One John Cock, a barber in St Martin\xe2\x80\x99s-le-Grand, was an eminent\r\n      example of this; I mean of the hasty return of the people when\r\n      the plague was abated. This John Cock had left the town with his\r\n      whole family, and locked up his house, and was gone in the\r\n      country, as many others did; and finding the plague so decreased\r\n      in November that there died but 905 per week of all diseases, he\r\n      ventured home again. He had in his family ten persons; that is to\r\n      say, himself and wife, five children, two apprentices, and a\r\n      maid-servant. He had not returned to his house above a week, and\r\n      began to open his shop and carry on his trade, but the distemper\r\n      broke out in his family, and within about five days they all\r\n      died, except one; that is to say, himself, his wife, all his five\r\n      children, and his two apprentices; and only the maid remained\r\n      alive.\r\n\r\n      But the mercy of God was greater to the rest than we had reason\r\n      to expect; for the malignity (as I have said) of the distemper\r\n      was spent, the contagion was exhausted, and also the winter\r\n      weather came on apace, and the air was clear and cold, with sharp\r\n      frosts; and this increasing still, most of those that had fallen\r\n      sick recovered, and the health of the city began to return. There\r\n      were indeed some returns of the distemper even in the month of\r\n      December, and the bills increased near a hundred; but it went off\r\n      again, and so in a short while things began to return to their\r\n      own channel. And wonderful it was to see how populous the city\r\n      was again all on a sudden, so that a stranger could not miss the\r\n      numbers that were lost. Neither was there any miss of the\r\n      inhabitants as to their dwellings\xe2\x80\x94few or no empty houses were to\r\n      be seen, or if there were some, there was no want of tenants for\r\n      them.\r\n\r\n      I wish I could say that as the city had a new face, so the\r\n      manners of the people had a new appearance. I doubt not but there\r\n      were many that retained a sincere sense of their deliverance, and\r\n      were that heartily thankful to that Sovereign Hand that had\r\n      protected them in so dangerous a time; it would be very\r\n      uncharitable to judge otherwise in a city so populous, and where\r\n      the people were so devout as they were here in the time of the\r\n      visitation itself; but except what of this was to be found in\r\n      particular families and faces, it must be acknowledged that the\r\n      general practice of the people was just as it was before, and\r\n      very little difference was to be seen.\r\n\r\n      Some, indeed, said things were worse; that the morals of the\r\n      people declined from this very time; that the people, hardened by\r\n      the danger they had been in, like seamen after a storm is over,\r\n      were more wicked and more stupid, more bold and hardened, in\r\n      their vices and immoralities than they were before; but I will\r\n      not carry it so far neither. It would take up a history of no\r\n      small length to give a particular of all the gradations by which\r\n      the course of things in this city came to be restored again, and\r\n      to run in their own channel as they did before.\r\n\r\n      Some parts of England were now infected as violently as London\r\n      had been; the cities of Norwich, Peterborough, Lincoln,\r\n      Colchester, and other places were now visited; and the\r\n      magistrates of London began to set rules for our conduct as to\r\n      corresponding with those cities. It is true we could not pretend\r\n      to forbid their people coming to London, because it was\r\n      impossible to know them asunder; so, after many consultations,\r\n      the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen were obliged to drop it. All\r\n      they could do was to warn and caution the people not to entertain\r\n      in their houses or converse with any people who they knew came\r\n      from such infected places.\r\n\r\n      But they might as well have talked to the air, for the people of\r\n      London thought themselves so plague-free now that they were past\r\n      all admonitions; they seemed to depend upon it that the air was\r\n      restored, and that the air was like a man that had had the\r\n      smallpox, not capable of being infected again. This revived that\r\n      notion that the infection was all in the air, that there was no\r\n      such thing as contagion from the sick people to the sound; and so\r\n      strongly did this whimsy prevail among people that they ran all\r\n      together promiscuously, sick and well. Not the Mahometans, who,\r\n      prepossessed with the principle of predestination, value nothing\r\n      of contagion, let it be in what it will, could be more obstinate\r\n      than the people of London; they that were perfectly sound, and\r\n      came out of the wholesome air, as we call it, into the city, made\r\n      nothing of going into the same houses and chambers, nay, even\r\n      into the same beds, with those that had the distemper upon them,\r\n      and were not recovered.\r\n\r\n      Some, indeed, paid for their audacious boldness with the price of\r\n      their lives; an infinite number fell sick, and the physicians had\r\n      more work than ever, only with this difference, that more of\r\n      their patients recovered; that is to say, they generally\r\n      recovered, but certainly there were more people infected and fell\r\n      sick now, when there did not die above a thousand or twelve\r\n      hundred in a week, than there was when there died five or six\r\n      thousand a week, so entirely negligent were the people at that\r\n      time in the great and dangerous case of health and infection, and\r\n      so ill were they able to take or accept of the advice of those\r\n      who cautioned them for their good.\r\n\r\n      The people being thus returned, as it were, in general, it was\r\n      very strange to find that in their inquiring after their friends,\r\n      some whole families were so entirely swept away that there was no\r\n      remembrance of them left, neither was anybody to be found to\r\n      possess or show any title to that little they had left; for in\r\n      such cases what was to be found was generally embezzled and\r\n      purloined, some gone one way, some another.\r\n\r\n      It was said such abandoned effects came to the king, as the\r\n      universal heir; upon which we are told, and I suppose it was in\r\n      part true, that the king granted all such, as deodands, to the\r\n      Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen of London, to be applied to the\r\n      use of the poor, of whom there were very many. For it is to be\r\n      observed, that though the occasions of relief and the objects of\r\n      distress were very many more in the time of the violence of the\r\n      plague than now after all was over, yet the distress of the poor\r\n      was more now a great deal than it was then, because all the\r\n      sluices of general charity were now shut. People supposed the\r\n      main occasion to be over, and so stopped their hands; whereas\r\n      particular objects were still very moving, and the distress of\r\n      those that were poor was very great indeed.\r\n\r\n      Though the health of the city was now very much restored, yet\r\n      foreign trade did not begin to stir, neither would foreigners\r\n      admit our ships into their ports for a great while. As for the\r\n      Dutch, the misunderstandings between our court and them had\r\n      broken out into a war the year before, so that our trade that way\r\n      was wholly interrupted; but Spain and Portugal, Italy and\r\n      Barbary, as also Hamburg and all the ports in the Baltic, these\r\n      were all shy of us a great while, and would not restore trade\r\n      with us for many months.\r\n\r\n      The distemper sweeping away such multitudes, as I have observed,\r\n      many if not all the out-parishes were obliged to make new\r\n      burying-grounds, besides that I have mentioned in Bunhill Fields,\r\n      some of which were continued, and remain in use to this day. But\r\n      others were left off, and (which I confess I mention with some\r\n      reflection) being converted into other uses or built upon\r\n      afterwards, the dead bodies were disturbed, abused, dug up again,\r\n      some even before the flesh of them was perished from the bones,\r\n      and removed like dung or rubbish to other places. Some of those\r\n      which came within the reach of my observation are as follow:\r\n\r\n      (1) A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street, near Mount Mill,\r\n      being some of the remains of the old lines or fortifications of\r\n      the city, where abundance were buried promiscuously from the\r\n      parishes of Aldersgate, Clerkenwell, and even out of the city.\r\n      This ground, as I take it, was since made a physic garden, and\r\n      after that has been built upon.\r\n\r\n      (2) A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch, as it was then\r\n      called, at the end of Holloway Lane, in Shoreditch parish. It has\r\n      been since made a yard for keeping hogs, and for other ordinary\r\n      uses, but is quite out of use as a burying-ground.\r\n\r\n      (3) The upper end of Hand Alley, in Bishopsgate Street, which was\r\n      then a green field, and was taken in particularly for Bishopsgate\r\n      parish, though many of the carts out of the city brought their\r\n      dead thither also, particularly out of the parish of St\r\n      All-hallows on the Wall. This place I cannot mention without much\r\n      regret. It was, as I remember, about two or three years after the\r\n      plague was ceased that Sir Robert Clayton came to be possessed of\r\n      the ground. It was reported, how true I know not, that it fell to\r\n      the king for want of heirs, all those who had any right to it\r\n      being carried off by the pestilence, and that Sir Robert Clayton\r\n      obtained a grant of it from King Charles II. But however he came\r\n      by it, certain it is the ground was let out to build on, or built\r\n      upon, by his order. The first house built upon it was a large\r\n      fair house, still standing, which faces the street or way now\r\n      called Hand Alley which, though called an alley, is as wide as a\r\n      street. The houses in the same row with that house northward are\r\n      built on the very same ground where the poor people were buried,\r\n      and the bodies, on opening the ground for the foundations, were\r\n      dug up, some of them remaining so plain to be seen that the\r\n      women\xe2\x80\x99s skulls were distinguished by their long hair, and of\r\n      others the flesh was not quite perished; so that the people began\r\n      to exclaim loudly against it, and some suggested that it might\r\n      endanger a return of the contagion; after which the bones and\r\n      bodies, as fast as they came at them, were carried to another\r\n      part of the same ground and thrown all together into a deep pit,\r\n      dug on purpose, which now is to be known in that it is not built\r\n      on, but is a passage to another house at the upper end of Rose\r\n      Alley, just against the door of a meeting-house which has been\r\n      built there many years since; and the ground is palisadoed off\r\n      from the rest of the passage, in a little square; there lie the\r\n      bones and remains of near two thousand bodies, carried by the\r\n      dead carts to their grave in that one year.\r\n\r\n      (4) Besides this, there was a piece of ground in Moorfields; by\r\n      the going into the street which is now called Old Bethlem, which\r\n      was enlarged much, though not wholly taken in on the same\r\n      occasion.\r\n\r\n      [N.B.\xe2\x80\x94The author of this journal lies buried in that very ground,\r\n      being at his own desire, his sister having been buried there a\r\n      few years before.]\r\n\r\n      (5) Stepney parish, extending itself from the east part of London\r\n      to the north, even to the very edge of Shoreditch Churchyard, had\r\n      a piece of ground taken in to bury their dead close to the said\r\n      churchyard, and which for that very reason was left open, and is\r\n      since, I suppose, taken into the same churchyard. And they had\r\n      also two other burying-places in Spittlefields, one where since a\r\n      chapel or tabernacle has been built for ease to this great\r\n      parish, and another in Petticoat Lane.\r\n\r\n      There were no less than five other grounds made use of for the\r\n      parish of Stepney at that time: one where now stands the parish\r\n      church of St Paul, Shadwell, and the other where now stands the\r\n      parish church of St John\xe2\x80\x99s at Wapping, both which had not the\r\n      names of parishes at that time, but were belonging to Stepney\r\n      parish.\r\n\r\n      I could name many more, but these coming within my particular\r\n      knowledge, the circumstance, I thought, made it of use to record\r\n      them. From the whole, it may be observed that they were obliged\r\n      in this time of distress to take in new burying-grounds in most\r\n      of the out-parishes for laying the prodigious numbers of people\r\n      which died in so short a space of time; but why care was not\r\n      taken to keep those places separate from ordinary uses, that so\r\n      the bodies might rest undisturbed, that I cannot answer for, and\r\n      must confess I think it was wrong. Who were to blame I know not.\r\n\r\n      I should have mentioned that the Quakers had at that time also a\r\n      burying-ground set apart to their use, and which they still make\r\n      use of; and they had also a particular dead-cart to fetch their\r\n      dead from their houses; and the famous Solomon Eagle, who, as I\r\n      mentioned before, had predicted the plague as a judgement, and\r\n      ran naked through the streets, telling the people that it was\r\n      come upon them to punish them for their sins, had his own wife\r\n      died the very next day of the plague, and was carried, one of the\r\n      first in the Quakers\xe2\x80\x99 dead-cart, to their new burying-ground.\r\n\r\n      I might have thronged this account with many more remarkable\r\n      things which occurred in the time of the infection, and\r\n      particularly what passed between the Lord Mayor and the Court,\r\n      which was then at Oxford, and what directions were from time to\r\n      time received from the Government for their conduct on this\r\n      critical occasion. But really the Court concerned themselves so\r\n      little, and that little they did was of so small import, that I\r\n      do not see it of much moment to mention any part of it here:\r\n      except that of appointing a monthly fast in the city and the\r\n      sending the royal charity to the relief of the poor, both which I\r\n      have mentioned before.\r\n\r\n      Great was the reproach thrown on those physicians who left their\r\n      patients during the sickness, and now they came to town again\r\n      nobody cared to employ them. They were called deserters, and\r\n      frequently bills were set up upon their doors and written, \xe2\x80\x98Here\r\n      is a doctor to be let\xe2\x80\x99, so that several of those physicians were\r\n      fain for a while to sit still and look about them, or at least\r\n      remove their dwellings, and set up in new places and among new\r\n      acquaintance. The like was the case with the clergy, whom the\r\n      people were indeed very abusive to, writing verses and scandalous\r\n      reflections upon them, setting upon the church-door, \xe2\x80\x98Here is a\r\n      pulpit to be let\xe2\x80\x99, or sometimes, \xe2\x80\x98to be sold\xe2\x80\x99, which was worse.\r\n\r\n      It was not the least of our misfortunes that with our infection,\r\n      when it ceased, there did not cease the spirit of strife and\r\n      contention, slander and reproach, which was really the great\r\n      troubler of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s peace before. It was said to be the\r\n      remains of the old animosities, which had so lately involved us\r\n      all in blood and disorder. But as the late Act of Indemnity had\r\n      laid asleep the quarrel itself, so the Government had recommended\r\n      family and personal peace upon all occasions to the whole nation.\r\n\r\n      But it could not be obtained; and particularly after the ceasing\r\n      of the plague in London, when any one that had seen the condition\r\n      which the people had been in, and how they caressed one another\r\n      at that time, promised to have more charity for the future, and\r\n      to raise no more reproaches; I say, any one that had seen them\r\n      then would have thought they would have come together with\r\n      another spirit at last. But, I say, it could not be obtained. The\r\n      quarrel remained; the Church and the Presbyterians were\r\n      incompatible. As soon as the plague was removed, the Dissenting\r\n      ousted ministers who had supplied the pulpits which were deserted\r\n      by the incumbents retired; they could expect no other but that\r\n      they should immediately fall upon them and harass them with their\r\n      penal laws, accept their preaching while they were sick, and\r\n      persecute them as soon as they were recovered again; this even we\r\n      that were of the Church thought was very hard, and could by no\r\n      means approve of it.\r\n\r\n      But it was the Government, and we could say nothing to hinder it;\r\n      we could only say it was not our doing, and we could not answer\r\n      for it.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, the Dissenters reproaching those ministers of\r\n      the Church with going away and deserting their charge, abandoning\r\n      the people in their danger, and when they had most need of\r\n      comfort, and the like: this we could by no means approve, for all\r\n      men have not the same faith and the same courage, and the\r\n      Scripture commands us to judge the most favourably and according\r\n      to charity.\r\n\r\n      A plague is a formidable enemy, and is armed with terrors that\r\n      every man is not sufficiently fortified to resist or prepared to\r\n      stand the shock against. It is very certain that a great many of\r\n      the clergy who were in circumstances to do it withdrew and fled\r\n      for the safety of their lives; but \xe2\x80\x99tis true also that a great\r\n      many of them stayed, and many of them fell in the calamity and in\r\n      the discharge of their duty.\r\n\r\n      It is true some of the Dissenting turned-out ministers stayed,\r\n      and their courage is to be commended and highly valued\xe2\x80\x94but these\r\n      were not abundance; it cannot be said that they all stayed, and\r\n      that none retired into the country, any more than it can be said\r\n      of the Church clergy that they all went away. Neither did all\r\n      those that went away go without substituting curates and others\r\n      in their places, to do the offices needful and to visit the sick,\r\n      as far as it was practicable; so that, upon the whole, an\r\n      allowance of charity might have been made on both sides, and we\r\n      should have considered that such a time as this of 1665 is not to\r\n      be paralleled in history, and that it is not the stoutest courage\r\n      that will always support men in such cases. I had not said this,\r\n      but had rather chosen to record the courage and religious zeal of\r\n      those of both sides, who did hazard themselves for the service of\r\n      the poor people in their distress, without remembering that any\r\n      failed in their duty on either side. But the want of temper among\r\n      us has made the contrary to this necessary: some that stayed not\r\n      only boasting too much of themselves, but reviling those that\r\n      fled, branding them with cowardice, deserting their flocks, and\r\n      acting the part of the hireling, and the like. I recommend it to\r\n      the charity of all good people to look back and reflect duly upon\r\n      the terrors of the time, and whoever does so will see that it is\r\n      not an ordinary strength that could support it. It was not like\r\n      appearing in the head of an army or charging a body of horse in\r\n      the field, but it was charging Death itself on his pale horse; to\r\n      stay was indeed to die, and it could be esteemed nothing less,\r\n      especially as things appeared at the latter end of August and the\r\n      beginning of September, and as there was reason to expect them at\r\n      that time; for no man expected, and I dare say believed, that the\r\n      distemper would take so sudden a turn as it did, and fall\r\n      immediately two thousand in a week, when there was such a\r\n      prodigious number of people sick at that time as it was known\r\n      there was; and then it was that many shifted away that had stayed\r\n      most of the time before.\r\n\r\n      Besides, if God gave strength to some more than to others, was it\r\n      to boast of their ability to abide the stroke, and upbraid those\r\n      that had not the same gift and support, or ought not they rather\r\n      to have been humble and thankful if they were rendered more\r\n      useful than their brethren?\r\n\r\n      I think it ought to be recorded to the honour of such men, as\r\n      well clergy as physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, magistrates,\r\n      and officers of every kind, as also all useful people who\r\n      ventured their lives in discharge of their duty, as most\r\n      certainly all such as stayed did to the last degree; and several\r\n      of all these kinds did not only venture but lose their lives on\r\n      that sad occasion.\r\n\r\n      I was once making a list of all such, I mean of all those\r\n      professions and employments who thus died, as I call it, in the\r\n      way of their duty; but it was impossible for a private man to\r\n      come at a certainty in the particulars. I only remember that\r\n      there died sixteen clergymen, two aldermen, five physicians,\r\n      thirteen surgeons, within the city and liberties before the\r\n      beginning of September. But this being, as I said before, the\r\n      great crisis and extremity of the infection, it can be no\r\n      complete list. As to inferior people, I think there died\r\n      six-and-forty constables and head-boroughs in the two parishes of\r\n      Stepney and Whitechappel; but I could not carry my list on, for\r\n      when the violent rage of the distemper in September came upon us,\r\n      it drove us out of all measures. Men did then no more die by tale\r\n      and by number. They might put out a weekly bill, and call them\r\n      seven or eight thousand, or what they pleased; \xe2\x80\x99tis certain they\r\n      died by heaps, and were buried by heaps, that is to say, without\r\n      account. And if I might believe some people, who were more abroad\r\n      and more conversant with those things than I though I was public\r\n      enough for one that had no more business to do than I had,\xe2\x80\x94I say,\r\n      if I may believe them, there was not many less buried those first\r\n      three weeks in September than 20,000 per week. However, the\r\n      others aver the truth of it; yet I rather choose to keep to the\r\n      public account; seven and eight thousand per week is enough to\r\n      make good all that I have said of the terror of those times;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      it is much to the satisfaction of me that write, as well as those\r\n      that read, to be able to say that everything is set down with\r\n      moderation, and rather within compass than beyond it.\r\n\r\n      Upon all these accounts, I say, I could wish, when we were\r\n      recovered, our conduct had been more distinguished for charity\r\n      and kindness in remembrance of the past calamity, and not so much\r\n      a valuing ourselves upon our boldness in staying, as if all men\r\n      were cowards that fly from the hand of God, or that those who\r\n      stay do not sometimes owe their courage to their ignorance, and\r\n      despising the hand of their Maker\xe2\x80\x94which is a criminal kind of\r\n      desperation, and not a true courage.\r\n\r\n      I cannot but leave it upon record that the civil officers, such\r\n      as constables, head-boroughs, Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s and sheriffs\xe2\x80\x99-men, as\r\n      also parish officers, whose business it was to take charge of the\r\n      poor, did their duties in general with as much courage as any,\r\n      and perhaps with more, because their work was attended with more\r\n      hazards, and lay more among the poor, who were more subject to be\r\n      infected, and in the most pitiful plight when they were taken\r\n      with the infection. But then it must be added, too, that a great\r\n      number of them died; indeed it was scarce possible it should be\r\n      otherwise.\r\n\r\n      I have not said one word here about the physic or preparations\r\n      that we ordinarily made use of on this terrible occasion\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\n      we that went frequently abroad and up down street, as I did; much\r\n      of this was talked of in the books and bills of our quack\r\n      doctors, of whom I have said enough already. It may, however, be\r\n      added, that the College of Physicians were daily publishing\r\n      several preparations, which they had considered of in the process\r\n      of their practice, and which, being to be had in print, I avoid\r\n      repeating them for that reason.\r\n\r\n      One thing I could not help observing: what befell one of the\r\n      quacks, who published that he had a most excellent preservative\r\n      against the plague, which whoever kept about them should never be\r\n      infected or liable to infection. This man, who, we may reasonably\r\n      suppose, did not go abroad without some of this excellent\r\n      preservative in his pocket, yet was taken by the distemper, and\r\n      carried off in two or three days.\r\n\r\n      I am not of the number of the physic-haters or physic-despisers;\r\n      on the contrary, I have often mentioned the regard I had to the\r\n      dictates of my particular friend Dr Heath; but yet I must\r\n      acknowledge I made use of little or nothing\xe2\x80\x94except, as I have\r\n      observed, to keep a preparation of strong scent to have ready, in\r\n      case I met with anything of offensive smells or went too near any\r\n      burying-place or dead body.\r\n\r\n      Neither did I do what I know some did: keep the spirits always\r\n      high and hot with cordials and wine and such things; and which,\r\n      as I observed, one learned physician used himself so much to as\r\n      that he could not leave them off when the infection was quite\r\n      gone, and so became a sot for all his life after.\r\n\r\n      I remember my friend the doctor used to say that there was a\r\n      certain set of drugs and preparations which were all certainly\r\n      good and useful in the case of an infection; out of which, or\r\n      with which, physicians might make an infinite variety of\r\n      medicines, as the ringers of bells make several hundred different\r\n      rounds of music by the changing and order or sound but in six\r\n      bells, and that all these preparations shall be really very good:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Therefore,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I do not wonder that so vast a throng of\r\n      medicines is offered in the present calamity, and almost every\r\n      physician prescribes or prepares a different thing, as his\r\n      judgement or experience guides him; but\xe2\x80\x99, says my friend, \xe2\x80\x98let\r\n      all the prescriptions of all the physicians in London be\r\n      examined, and it will be found that they are all compounded of\r\n      the same things, with such variations only as the particular\r\n      fancy of the doctor leads him to; so that\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98every man,\r\n      judging a little of his own constitution and manner of his\r\n      living, and circumstances of his being infected, may direct his\r\n      own medicines out of the ordinary drugs and preparations. Only\r\n      that\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98some recommend one thing as most sovereign, and\r\n      some another. Some\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98think that pill. ruff., which is\r\n      called itself the anti-pestilential pill is the best preparation\r\n      that can be made; others think that Venice treacle is sufficient\r\n      of itself to resist the contagion; and I\xe2\x80\x99, says he, \xe2\x80\x98think as\r\n      both these think, viz., that the last is good to take beforehand\r\n      to prevent it, and the first, if touched, to expel it.\xe2\x80\x99 According\r\n      to this opinion, I several times took Venice treacle, and a sound\r\n      sweat upon it, and thought myself as well fortified against the\r\n      infection as any one could be fortified by the power of physic.\r\n\r\n      As for quackery and mountebanks, of which the town was so full, I\r\n      listened to none of them, and have observed often since, with\r\n      some wonder, that for two years after the plague I scarcely saw\r\n      or heard of one of them about town. Some fancied they were all\r\n      swept away in the infection to a man, and were for calling it a\r\n      particular mark of God\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance upon them for leading the poor\r\n      people into the pit of destruction, merely for the lucre of a\r\n      little money they got by them; but I cannot go that length\r\n      neither. That abundance of them died is certain\xe2\x80\x94many of them came\r\n      within the reach of my own knowledge\xe2\x80\x94but that all of them were\r\n      swept off I much question. I believe rather they fled into the\r\n      country and tried their practices upon the people there, who were\r\n      in apprehension of the infection before it came among them.\r\n\r\n      This, however, is certain, not a man of them appeared for a great\r\n      while in or about London. There were, indeed, several doctors who\r\n      published bills recommending their several physical preparations\r\n      for cleansing the body, as they call it, after the plague, and\r\n      needful, as they said, for such people to take who had been\r\n      visited and had been cured; whereas I must own I believe that it\r\n      was the opinion of the most eminent physicians at that time that\r\n      the plague was itself a sufficient purge, and that those who\r\n      escaped the infection needed no physic to cleanse their bodies of\r\n      any other things; the running sores, the tumours, &c., which were\r\n      broke and kept open by the directions of the physicians, having\r\n      sufficiently cleansed them; and that all other distempers, and\r\n      causes of distempers, were effectually carried off that way; and\r\n      as the physicians gave this as their opinions wherever they came,\r\n      the quacks got little business.\r\n\r\n      There were, indeed, several little hurries which happened after\r\n      the decrease of the plague, and which, whether they were\r\n      contrived to fright and disorder the people, as some imagined, I\r\n      cannot say, but sometimes we were told the plague would return by\r\n      such a time; and the famous Solomon Eagle, the naked Quaker I\r\n      have mentioned, prophesied evil tidings every day; and several\r\n      others telling us that London had not been sufficiently scourged,\r\n      and that sorer and severer strokes were yet behind. Had they\r\n      stopped there, or had they descended to particulars, and told us\r\n      that the city should the next year be destroyed by fire, then,\r\n      indeed, when we had seen it come to pass, we should not have been\r\n      to blame to have paid more than a common respect to their\r\n      prophetic spirits; at least we should have wondered at them, and\r\n      have been more serious in our inquiries after the meaning of it,\r\n      and whence they had the foreknowledge. But as they generally told\r\n      us of a relapse into the plague, we have had no concern since\r\n      that about them; yet by those frequent clamours, we were all kept\r\n      with some kind of apprehensions constantly upon us; and if any\r\n      died suddenly, or if the spotted fevers at any time increased, we\r\n      were presently alarmed; much more if the number of the plague\r\n      increased, for to the end of the year there were always between\r\n      200 and 300 of the plague. On any of these occasions, I say, we\r\n      were alarmed anew.\r\n\r\n      Those who remember the city of London before the fire must\r\n      remember that there was then no such place as we now call Newgate\r\n      Market, but that in the middle of the street which is now called\r\n      Blowbladder Street, and which had its name from the butchers, who\r\n      used to kill and dress their sheep there (and who, it seems, had\r\n      a custom to blow up their meat with pipes to make it look thicker\r\n      and fatter than it was, and were punished there for it by the\r\n      Lord Mayor); I say, from the end of the street towards Newgate\r\n      there stood two long rows of shambles for the selling meat.\r\n\r\n      It was in those shambles that two persons falling down dead, as\r\n      they were buying meat, gave rise to a rumour that the meat was\r\n      all infected; which, though it might affright the people, and\r\n      spoiled the market for two or three days, yet it appeared plainly\r\n      afterwards that there was nothing of truth in the suggestion. But\r\n      nobody can account for the possession of fear when it takes hold\r\n      of the mind.\r\n\r\n      However, it Pleased God, by the continuing of the winter weather,\r\n      so to restore the health of the city that by February following\r\n      we reckoned the distemper quite ceased, and then we were not so\r\n      easily frighted again.\r\n\r\n      There was still a question among the learned, and at first\r\n      perplexed the people a little: and that was in what manner to\r\n      purge the house and goods where the plague had been, and how to\r\n      render them habitable again, which had been left empty during the\r\n      time of the plague. Abundance of perfumes and preparations were\r\n      prescribed by physicians, some of one kind and some of another,\r\n      in which the people who listened to them put themselves to a\r\n      great, and indeed, in my opinion, to an unnecessary expense; and\r\n      the poorer people, who only set open their windows night and day,\r\n      burned brimstone, pitch, and gunpowder, and such things in their\r\n      rooms, did as well as the best; nay, the eager people who, as I\r\n      said above, came home in haste and at all hazards, found little\r\n      or no inconvenience in their houses, nor in the goods, and did\r\n      little or nothing to them.\r\n\r\n      However, in general, prudent, cautious people did enter into some\r\n      measures for airing and sweetening their houses, and burned\r\n      perfumes, incense, benjamin, rozin, and sulphur in their rooms\r\n      close shut up, and then let the air carry it all out with a blast\r\n      of gunpowder; others caused large fires to be made all day and\r\n      all night for several days and nights; by the same token that two\r\n      or three were pleased to set their houses on fire, and so\r\n      effectually sweetened them by burning them down to the ground; as\r\n      particularly one at Ratcliff, one in Holbourn, and one at\r\n      Westminster; besides two or three that were set on fire, but the\r\n      fire was happily got out again before it went far enough to burn\r\n      down the houses; and one citizen\xe2\x80\x99s servant, I think it was in\r\n      Thames Street, carried so much gunpowder into his master\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\n      for clearing it of the infection, and managed it so foolishly,\r\n      that he blew up part of the roof of the house. But the time was\r\n      not fully come that the city was to be purged by fire, nor was it\r\n      far off; for within nine months more I saw it all lying in ashes;\r\n      when, as some of our quacking philosophers pretend, the seeds of\r\n      the plague were entirely destroyed, and not before; a notion too\r\n      ridiculous to speak of here: since, had the seeds of the plague\r\n      remained in the houses, not to be destroyed but by fire, how has\r\n      it been that they have not since broken out, seeing all those\r\n      buildings in the suburbs and liberties, all in the great parishes\r\n      of Stepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch,\r\n      Cripplegate, and St Giles, where the fire never came, and where\r\n      the plague raged with the greatest violence, remain still in the\r\n      same condition they were in before?\r\n\r\n      But to leave these things just as I found them, it was certain\r\n      that those people who were more than ordinarily cautious of their\r\n      health, did take particular directions for what they called\r\n      seasoning of their houses, and abundance of costly things were\r\n      consumed on that account which I cannot but say not only seasoned\r\n      those houses, as they desired, but filled the air with very\r\n      grateful and wholesome smells which others had the share of the\r\n      benefit of as well as those who were at the expenses of them.\r\n\r\n      And yet after all, though the poor came to town very\r\n      precipitantly, as I have said, yet I must say the rich made no\r\n      such haste. The men of business, indeed, came up, but many of\r\n      them did not bring their families to town till the spring came\r\n      on, and that they saw reason to depend upon it that the plague\r\n      would not return.\r\n\r\n      The Court, indeed, came up soon after Christmas, but the nobility\r\n      and gentry, except such as depended upon and had employment under\r\n      the administration, did not come so soon.\r\n\r\n      I should have taken notice here that, notwithstanding the\r\n      violence of the plague in London and in other places, yet it was\r\n      very observable that it was never on board the fleet; and yet for\r\n      some time there was a strange press in the river, and even in the\r\n      streets, for seamen to man the fleet. But it was in the beginning\r\n      of the year, when the plague was scarce begun, and not at all\r\n      come down to that part of the city where they usually press for\r\n      seamen; and though a war with the Dutch was not at all grateful\r\n      to the people at that time, and the seamen went with a kind of\r\n      reluctancy into the service, and many complained of being dragged\r\n      into it by force, yet it proved in the event a happy violence to\r\n      several of them, who had probably perished in the general\r\n      calamity, and who, after the summer service was over, though they\r\n      had cause to lament the desolation of their families\xe2\x80\x94who, when\r\n      they came back, were many of them in their graves\xe2\x80\x94yet they had\r\n      room to be thankful that they were carried out of the reach of\r\n      it, though so much against their wills. We indeed had a hot war\r\n      with the Dutch that year, and one very great engagement at sea in\r\n      which the Dutch were worsted, but we lost a great many men and\r\n      some ships. But, as I observed, the plague was not in the fleet,\r\n      and when they came to lay up the ships in the river the violent\r\n      part of it began to abate.\r\n\r\n      I would be glad if I could close the account of this melancholy\r\n      year with some particular examples historically; I mean of the\r\n      thankfulness to God, our preserver, for our being delivered from\r\n      this dreadful calamity. Certainly the circumstance of the\r\n      deliverance, as well as the terrible enemy we were delivered\r\n      from, called upon the whole nation for it. The circumstances of\r\n      the deliverance were indeed very remarkable, as I have in part\r\n      mentioned already, and particularly the dreadful condition which\r\n      we were all in when we were to the surprise of the whole town\r\n      made joyful with the hope of a stop of the infection.\r\n\r\n      Nothing but the immediate finger of God, nothing but omnipotent\r\n      power, could have done it. The contagion despised all medicine;\r\n      death raged in every corner; and had it gone on as it did then, a\r\n      few weeks more would have cleared the town of all, and everything\r\n      that had a soul. Men everywhere began to despair; every heart\r\n      failed them for fear; people were made desperate through the\r\n      anguish of their souls, and the terrors of death sat in the very\r\n      faces and countenances of the people.\r\n\r\n      In that very moment when we might very well say, \xe2\x80\x98Vain was the\r\n      help of man\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94I say, in that very moment it pleased God, with a\r\n      most agreeable surprise, to cause the fury of it to abate, even\r\n      of itself; and the malignity declining, as I have said, though\r\n      infinite numbers were sick, yet fewer died, and the very first\r\n      weeks\xe2\x80\x99 bill decreased 1843; a vast number indeed!\r\n\r\n      It is impossible to express the change that appeared in the very\r\n      countenances of the people that Thursday morning when the weekly\r\n      bill came out. It might have been perceived in their countenances\r\n      that a secret surprise and smile of joy sat on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n      They shook one another by the hands in the streets, who would\r\n      hardly go on the same side of the way with one another before.\r\n      Where the streets were not too broad they would open their\r\n      windows and call from one house to another, and ask how they did,\r\n      and if they had heard the good news that the plague was abated.\r\n      Some would return, when they said good news, and ask, \xe2\x80\x98What good\r\n      news?\xe2\x80\x99 and when they answered that the plague was abated and the\r\n      bills decreased almost two thousand, they would cry out, \xe2\x80\x98God be\r\n      praised!\xe2\x80\x99 and would weep aloud for joy, telling them they had\r\n      heard nothing of it; and such was the joy of the people that it\r\n      was, as it were, life to them from the grave. I could almost set\r\n      down as many extravagant things done in the excess of their joy\r\n      as of their grief; but that would be to lessen the value of it.\r\n\r\n      I must confess myself to have been very much dejected just before\r\n      this happened; for the prodigious number that were taken sick the\r\n      week or two before, besides those that died, was such, and the\r\n      lamentations were so great everywhere, that a man must have\r\n      seemed to have acted even against his reason if he had so much as\r\n      expected to escape; and as there was hardly a house but mine in\r\n      all my neighbourhood but was infected, so had it gone on it would\r\n      not have been long that there would have been any more neighbours\r\n      to be infected. Indeed it is hardly credible what dreadful havoc\r\n      the last three weeks had made, for if I might believe the person\r\n      whose calculations I always found very well grounded, there were\r\n      not less than 30,000 people dead and near 100.000 fallen sick in\r\n      the three weeks I speak of; for the number that sickened was\r\n      surprising, indeed it was astonishing, and those whose courage\r\n      upheld them all the time before, sank under it now.\r\n\r\n      In the middle of their distress, when the condition of the city\r\n      of London was so truly calamitous, just then it pleased God\xe2\x80\x94as it\r\n      were by His immediate hand to disarm this enemy; the poison was\r\n      taken out of the sting. It was wonderful; even the physicians\r\n      themselves were surprised at it. Wherever they visited they found\r\n      their patients better; either they had sweated kindly, or the\r\n      tumours were broke, or the carbuncles went down and the\r\n      inflammations round them changed colour, or the fever was gone,\r\n      or the violent headache was assuaged, or some good symptom was in\r\n      the case; so that in a few days everybody was recovering, whole\r\n      families that were infected and down, that had ministers praying\r\n      with them, and expected death every hour, were revived and\r\n      healed, and none died at all out of them.\r\n\r\n      Nor was this by any new medicine found out, or new method of cure\r\n      discovered, or by any experience in the operation which the\r\n      physicians or surgeons attained to; but it was evidently from the\r\n      secret invisible hand of Him that had at first sent this disease\r\n      as a judgement upon us; and let the atheistic part of mankind\r\n      call my saying what they please, it is no enthusiasm; it was\r\n      acknowledged at that time by all mankind. The disease was\r\n      enervated and its malignity spent; and let it proceed from\r\n      whencesoever it will, let the philosophers search for reasons in\r\n      nature to account for it by, and labour as much as they will to\r\n      lessen the debt they owe to their Maker, those physicians who had\r\n      the least share of religion in them were obliged to acknowledge\r\n      that it was all supernatural, that it was extraordinary, and that\r\n      no account could be given of it.\r\n\r\n      If I should say that this is a visible summons to us all to\r\n      thankfulness, especially we that were under the terror of its\r\n      increase, perhaps it may be thought by some, after the sense of\r\n      the thing was over, an officious canting of religious things,\r\n      preaching a sermon instead of writing a history, making myself a\r\n      teacher instead of giving my observations of things; and this\r\n      restrains me very much from going on here as I might otherwise\r\n      do. But if ten lepers were healed, and but one returned to give\r\n      thanks, I desire to be as that one, and to be thankful for\r\n      myself.\r\n\r\n      Nor will I deny but there were abundance of people who, to all\r\n      appearance, were very thankful at that time; for their mouths\r\n      were stopped, even the mouths of those whose hearts were not\r\n      extraordinary long affected with it. But the impression was so\r\n      strong at that time that it could not be resisted; no, not by the\r\n      worst of the people.\r\n\r\n      It was a common thing to meet people in the street that were\r\n      strangers, and that we knew nothing at all of, expressing their\r\n      surprise. Going one day through Aldgate, and a pretty many people\r\n      being passing and repassing, there comes a man out of the end of\r\n      the Minories, and looking a little up the street and down, he\r\n      throws his hands abroad, \xe2\x80\x98Lord, what an alteration is here! Why,\r\n      last week I came along here, and hardly anybody was to be seen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      Another man\xe2\x80\x94I heard him\xe2\x80\x94adds to his words, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis all wonderful;\r\n      \xe2\x80\x99tis all a dream.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Blessed be God,\xe2\x80\x99 says a third man, and and\r\n      let us give thanks to Him, for \xe2\x80\x99tis all His own doing, human help\r\n      and human skill was at an end.\xe2\x80\x99 These were all strangers to one\r\n      another. But such salutations as these were frequent in the\r\n      street every day; and in spite of a loose behaviour, the very\r\n      common people went along the streets giving God thanks for their\r\n      deliverance.\r\n\r\n      It was now, as I said before, the people had cast off all\r\n      apprehensions, and that too fast; indeed we were no more afraid\r\n      now to pass by a man with a white cap upon his head, or with a\r\n      cloth wrapt round his neck, or with his leg limping, occasioned\r\n      by the sores in his groin, all which were frightful to the last\r\n      degree, but the week before. But now the street was full of them,\r\n      and these poor recovering creatures, give them their due,\r\n      appeared very sensible of their unexpected deliverance; and I\r\n      should wrong them very much if I should not acknowledge that I\r\n      believe many of them were really thankful. But I must own that,\r\n      for the generality of the people, it might too justly be said of\r\n      them as was said of the children of Israel after their being\r\n      delivered from the host of Pharaoh, when they passed the Red Sea,\r\n      and looked back and saw the Egyptians overwhelmed in the water:\r\n      viz., that they sang His praise, but they soon forgot His works.\r\n\r\n      I can go no farther here. I should be counted censorious, and\r\n      perhaps unjust, if I should enter into the unpleasing work of\r\n      reflecting, whatever cause there was for it, upon the\r\n      unthankfulness and return of all manner of wickedness among us,\r\n      which I was so much an eye-witness of myself. I shall conclude\r\n      the account of this calamitous year therefore with a coarse but\r\n      sincere stanza of my own, which I placed at the end of my\r\n      ordinary memorandums the same year they were written:\r\n\r\n     A dreadful plague in London was In the year sixty-five, Which\r\n     swept an hundred thousand souls Away; yet I alive!\r\n\r\n     H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
