Abstract    :
              9321350  Harbor  This award is for support for a project to use a finite element
               model for cross-sectional flow to constrain sliding and flow laws  for the
              Haut Glacier d'Arolla (Switzerland).  By varying sliding  law exponents, the
              piezometric surface form and position, and the  pattern of basil friction it
              will be possible to constrain the  range of conditions that yields velocity
              fields consistent with  empirical data.  This work takes advantage of a unique
              chance to  test and refine the general sliding law, and an opportunity to 
              explicitly examine spatial variations in sliding in the context of  detailed
              information on the temporal and spatial development of the  glacier's
              hydrologic system.  Although this work will be based on  data collected in a
              mid-latitude alpine area, the results will be  of direct relevance to polar
              glaciology because they can also be  applied to glaciers with temperate (warm
              based) areas in polar  regions.  ***
