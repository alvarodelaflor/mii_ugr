Abstract    :
              9316523  Schedl       Late Paleozoic tectonism along the Appalachian orogen
              resulted  in widespread remagnetization and Mississippi Valley Type 
              mineralization, both thought to be the result of hydrothermal  fluids.  This
              project will attempt to establish the timing of  remagnetization and
              characterize the mineralogic, fluid inclusion,  stable isotope and radiogenic
              isotope aspects of the system.   Results will  help determine if the
              remagnetization is related to  Mississippi Valley Type mineralization or to a
              separate fluid flow  event.
