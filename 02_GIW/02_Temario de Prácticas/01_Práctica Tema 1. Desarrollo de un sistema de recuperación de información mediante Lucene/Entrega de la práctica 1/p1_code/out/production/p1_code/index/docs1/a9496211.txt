Abstract    :
                   One mode of speciation that has been proposed for plants in               
              general, and especially flowering plants, is diploid/diploid                   
              hybridization.  This idea is in wide currency among plant                      
              evolutionary biologists although there a no unequivocal examples               
              of this process and theoretically it seems highly unlikely.  The               
              PI proposes the test to chart the evolutionary genetics of three               
              putative examples of this mode of speciation.  In the process, he              
              anticipates additional tests of the hypothesis that the three                  
              species are of hybrid origin.  Subsequent events, such as                      
              chromosomal rearrangement, that might have had a bearing on the                
              success of the hybrids and on isolation barriers will also be                  
              explored.  Because hybridization has been assumed to be of                     
              widespread importance among the flowering plants, the results of               
              this study could have a profound influence on our concepts of plant            
              evolution.
