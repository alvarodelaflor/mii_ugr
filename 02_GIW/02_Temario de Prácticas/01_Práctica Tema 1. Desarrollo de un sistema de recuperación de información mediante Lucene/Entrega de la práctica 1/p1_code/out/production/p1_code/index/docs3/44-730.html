<h2><a name="chap01"></a> CHAPTER I.<br />
TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
ATTENDING HIS BIRTH </h2>

<p>
Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will
be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious
name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a
workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not
trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to
the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality
whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.
</p>

<p>
For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by
the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the
child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more
than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had,
that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the
inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography,
extant in the literature of any age or country.
</p>

<p>
Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is
in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall
a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the
best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact
is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon
himself the office of respiration,&mdash;a troublesome practice, but one which
custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay
gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world
and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if,
during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers,
anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would
most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody
by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an
unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by
contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was,
that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to
advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been
imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have
been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful
appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a
quarter.
</p>

<p>
As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the
patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled;
the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint
voice imperfectly articulated the words, &ldquo;Let me see the child, and
die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the
palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he
rose, and advancing to the bed&rsquo;s head, said, with more kindness than
might have been expected of him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lor bless her dear heart, no!&rdquo; interposed the nurse, hastily
depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had
been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and
had thirteen children of her own, and all on &rsquo;em dead except two, and
them in the wurkus with me, she&rsquo;ll know better than to take on in that
way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there&rsquo;s a
dear young lamb do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother&rsquo;s prospects failed in
producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out her
hand towards the child.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips
passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly
round; shuddered; fell back&mdash;and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and
temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort.
They had been strangers too long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!&rdquo; said the surgeon at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, poor dear, so it is!&rdquo; said the nurse, picking up the cork of
the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up
the child. &ldquo;Poor dear!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t mind sending up to me, if the child cries,
nurse,&rdquo; said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely it <i>will</i> be troublesome. Give it a little
gruel if it is.&rdquo; He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his
way to the door, added, &ldquo;She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she
come from?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was brought here last night,&rdquo; replied the old woman, &ldquo;by
the overseer&rsquo;s order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked
some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or
where she was going to, nobody knows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. &ldquo;The old
story,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head: &ldquo;no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!
Good-night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more
applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire,
and proceeded to dress the infant.
</p>

<p>
What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was!
Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might
have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the
haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society. But now
that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the
same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at
once&mdash;a parish child&mdash;the orphan of a workhouse&mdash;the humble,
half-starved drudge&mdash;to be cuffed and buffeted through the
world&mdash;despised by all, and pitied by none.
</p>

<p>
Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the
tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the
louder.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap02"></a> CHAPTER II.<br />
TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST&rsquo;S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD </h2>

<p>
For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course
of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute
situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities
to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the
workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in &ldquo;the
house&rdquo; who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation
and nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied
with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities
magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be
&ldquo;farmed,&rdquo; or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a
branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile
offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the
inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental
superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the
consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.
Sevenpence-halfpenny&rsquo;s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a
great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its
stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom
and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very
accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the
greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising
parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided
for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving
herself a very great experimental philosopher.
</p>

<p>
Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great
theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it
so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would
unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on
nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have
had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental
philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered
over, a similar result usually attended the operation of <i>her</i> system; for
at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest
possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in
eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold,
or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any
one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into
another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a
parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently
scalded to death when there happened to be a washing&mdash;though the latter
accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare
occurrence in the farm&mdash;the jury would take it into their heads to ask
troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their
signatures to a remonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by
the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of
whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very
probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish
wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board made periodical
pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they
were going. The children were neat and clean to behold, when <i>they</i> went;
and what more would the people have!
</p>

<p>
It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very
extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist&rsquo;s ninth birthday found him
a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in
circumference. But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in
Oliver&rsquo;s breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare
diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed
his having any ninth birth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his
ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of
two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound
thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs.
Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition
of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Goodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann,
thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.
&ldquo;(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash &rsquo;em
directly.)&mdash;My heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you,
sure-ly!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to
this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a
tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated
from no leg but a beadle&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lor, only think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann, running out,&mdash;for the three
boys had been removed by this time,&mdash;&ldquo;only think of that! That I
should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of
them dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have
softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, &ldquo;to keep the parish officers a
waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with
the porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a
porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the
dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Mann with great humility.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance. He had
displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He relaxed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, Mrs. Mann,&rdquo; he replied in a calmer tone; &ldquo;it may
be as you say; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business,
and have something to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a
seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table
before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk
had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he
smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you be offended at what I&rsquo;m a going to say,&rdquo;
observed Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a long
walk, you know, or I wouldn&rsquo;t mention it. Now, will you take a little
drop of somethink, Mr. Bumble?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a drop. Nor a drop,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in
a dignified, but placid manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you will,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the
refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. &ldquo;Just a leetle drop,
with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble coughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, just a leetle drop,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann persuasively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired the beadle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m obliged to keep a little of in the house,
to put into the blessed infants&rsquo; Daffy, when they ain&rsquo;t well, Mr.
Bumble,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down
a bottle and glass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gin. I&rsquo;ll not deceive you, Mr. B.
It&rsquo;s gin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?&rdquo; inquired Bumble,
following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, bless &rsquo;em, that I do, dear as it is,&rdquo; replied the nurse.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em suffer before my very eyes, you know
sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&rdquo;; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; &ldquo;no, you could not. You
are a humane woman, Mrs. Mann.&rdquo; (Here she set down the glass.) &ldquo;I
shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.&rdquo;
(He drew it towards him.) &ldquo;You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.&rdquo; (He
stirred the gin-and-water.) &ldquo;I&mdash;I drink your health with
cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann&rdquo;; and he swallowed half of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now about business,&rdquo; said the beadle, taking out a leathern
pocket-book. &ldquo;The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year
old to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless him!&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the
corner of her apron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards
increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may
say, supernat&rsquo;ral exertions on the part of this parish,&rdquo; said
Bumble, &ldquo;we have never been able to discover who is his father, or what
was his mother&rsquo;s settlement, name, or condition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment&rsquo;s
reflection, &ldquo;How comes he to have any name at all, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, &ldquo;I inwented
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You, Mr. Bumble!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last was
a S,&mdash;Swubble, I named him. This was a T,&mdash;Twist, I named <i>him</i>.
The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names ready
made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when we come
to Z.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re quite a literary character, sir!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Mann.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the beadle, evidently gratified with the
compliment; &ldquo;perhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.&rdquo; He
finished the gin-and-water, and added, &ldquo;Oliver being now too old to
remain here, the board have determined to have him back into the house. I have
come out myself to take him there. So let me see him at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch him directly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room
for that purpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of
dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in
one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann.
</p>

<p>
Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and the
cocked hat on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you go along with me, Oliver?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic
voice.
</p>

<p>
Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great
readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had got
behind the beadle&rsquo;s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a furious
countenance. He took the hint at once, for the fist had been too often
impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will she go with me?&rdquo; inquired poor Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll
come and see you sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was, however, he
had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away. It was
no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes. Hunger and
recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very
naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver
wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too
hungry when he got to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and
the little brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.
Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the
gloom of his infant years. And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief, as
the cottage-gate closed after him. Wretched as were the little companions in
misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and
a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child&rsquo;s
heart for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his
gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter of a
mile whether they were &ldquo;nearly there.&rdquo; To these interrogations Mr.
Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness
which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he
was once again a beadle.
</p>

<p>
Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and
had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread, when Mr.
Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old woman, returned; and,
telling him it was a board night, informed him that the board had said he was
to appear before it forthwith.
</p>

<p>
Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was
rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he
ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about the matter, however; for
Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and
another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted
him into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were
sitting round a table. At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather
higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red
face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bow to the board,&rdquo; said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three
tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table,
fortunately bowed to that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, boy?&rdquo; said the gentleman in the high
chair.
</p>

<p>
Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him
tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry. These
two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a
gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool. Which was a capital way of
raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said the gentleman in the high chair, &ldquo;listen to me.
You know you&rsquo;re an orphan, I suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, sir?&rdquo; inquired poor Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy <i>is</i> a fool&mdash;I thought he was,&rdquo; said the
gentleman in the white waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the gentleman who had spoken first. &ldquo;You know
you&rsquo;ve got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the
parish, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you crying for?&rdquo; inquired the gentleman in the white
waistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What <i>could</i> the boy
be crying for?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you say your prayers every night,&rdquo; said another gentleman
in a gruff voice; &ldquo;and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of
you&mdash;like a Christian.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was
unconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a
marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed
and took care of <i>him</i>. But he hadn&rsquo;t, because nobody had taught
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful
trade,&rdquo; said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; added the surly one in the white waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of
picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then
hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to
sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England! They let the
paupers go to sleep!
</p>

<p>
Poor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of
all around him, that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which
would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes. But
they had. And this was it:
</p>

<p>
The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when
they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once,
what ordinary folks would never have discovered&mdash;the poor people liked it!
It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern
where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all
the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work.
&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said the board, looking very knowing; &ldquo;we are the
fellows to set this to rights; we&rsquo;ll stop it all, in no time.&rdquo; So,
they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative
(for they would compel nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process
in the house, or by a quick one out of it. With this view, they contracted with
the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn-factor
to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of
thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays. They
made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the
ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor
married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors&rsquo;
Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had
theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a bachelor! There
is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might
have started up in all classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the
workhouse; but the board were long-headed men, and had provided for this
difficulty. The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and
that frightened people.
</p>

<p>
For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full
operation. It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the increase in
the undertaker&rsquo;s bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all
the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a
week or two&rsquo;s gruel. But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well
as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.
</p>

<p>
The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper at
one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose, and
assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes. Of this festive
composition each boy had one porringer, and no more&mdash;except on occasions
of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread
besides.
</p>

<p>
The bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their spoons till
they shone again; and when they had performed this operation (which never took
very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they would sit
staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the
very bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in
sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray
splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally
excellent appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of
slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild with
hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn&rsquo;t been used to
that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small cook-shop), hinted darkly
to his companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem, he was
afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who
happened to be a weakly youth of tender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and
they implicitly believed him. A council was held; lots were cast who should
walk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell
to Oliver Twist.
</p>

<p>
The evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master, in his
cook&rsquo;s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants
ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long grace was
said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each
other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. Child as he
was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery. He rose from the
table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat
alarmed at his own temerity:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, sir, I want some more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in
stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for
support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with
fear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the master at length, in a faint voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver, &ldquo;I want some more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The master aimed a blow at Oliver&rsquo;s head with the ladle; pinioned him in
his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.
</p>

<p>
The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room
in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for
more!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For <i>more</i>!&rdquo; said Mr. Limbkins. &ldquo;Compose yourself,
Bumble, and answer me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after
he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He did, sir,&rdquo; replied Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That boy will be hung,&rdquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
&ldquo;I know that boy will be hung.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman&rsquo;s opinion. An animated
discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill
was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward of five
pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish. In
other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who
wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never was more convinced of anything in my life,&rdquo; said the
gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill
next morning: &ldquo;I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I
am that that boy will come to be hung.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was
right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it
to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of
Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no.

<h2><a name="chap03"></a> CHAPTER III.<br />
RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN A SINECURE </h2>

<p>
For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking
for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to
which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board. It appears,
at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a
becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white
waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual&rsquo;s prophetic
character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a
hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of
this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs
being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages,
removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council
assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals. There was
a still greater obstacle in Oliver&rsquo;s youth and childishness. He only
cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his
little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the
corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and
drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard
surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him.
</p>

<p>
Let it not be supposed by the enemies of &ldquo;the system,&rdquo; that, during
the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of
exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation.
As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his
ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr.
Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to
pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane. As for society, he was
carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably
flogged as a public warning and example. And so far from being denied the
advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment
every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his
mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause,
therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made
good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and
vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under
the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an
article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.
</p>

<p>
It chanced one morning, while Oliver&rsquo;s affairs were in this auspicious
and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way down the
High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain
arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing. Mr.
Gamfield&rsquo;s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them
within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of
arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his
donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wo&mdash;o!&rdquo; said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.
</p>

<p>
The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether
he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed
of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without
noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more
particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head,
which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey&rsquo;s. Then,
catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle
reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round.
He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back
again. Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read
the bill.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands
behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the
board-room. Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the
donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he
saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist
wanted. Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds
was just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was
encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well
knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves.
So, he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching
his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white
waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to &rsquo;prentis,&rdquo; said
Mr. Gamfield.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, my man,&rdquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a
condescending smile. &ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good
&rsquo;spectable chimbley-sweepin&rsquo; bisness,&rdquo; said Mr. Gamfield,
&ldquo;I wants a &rsquo;prentis, and I am ready to take him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Walk in,&rdquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield
having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and
another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence,
followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had
first seen him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nasty trade,&rdquo; said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had
again stated his wish.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,&rdquo; said
another gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the
chimbley to make &rsquo;em come down again,&rdquo; said Gamfield;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain&rsquo;t o&rsquo;
no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and
that&rsquo;s wot he likes. Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy,
Gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men, and there&rsquo;s nothink like a good hot blaze to make
&rsquo;em come down vith a run. It&rsquo;s humane too, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men,
acause, even if they&rsquo;ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes
&rsquo;em struggle to hextricate theirselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this
explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins.
The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in
so low a tone, that the words &ldquo;saving of expenditure,&rdquo;
&ldquo;looked well in the accounts,&rdquo; &ldquo;have a printed report
published,&rdquo; were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed,
or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.
</p>

<p>
At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed
their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have considered your proposition, and we don&rsquo;t approve of
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Decidedly not,&rdquo; added the other members.
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having
bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the board
had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this
extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. It was very
unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had
no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and
walked slowly from the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t let me have him, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men?&rdquo; said
Mr. Gamfield, pausing near the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Limbkins; &ldquo;at least, as it&rsquo;s a nasty
business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we
offered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gamfield&rsquo;s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned
to the table, and said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you give, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men? Come! Don&rsquo;t be too
hard on a poor man. What&rsquo;ll you give?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should say, three pound ten was plenty,&rdquo; said Mr. Limbkins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ten shillings too much,&rdquo; said the gentleman in the white
waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Gamfield; &ldquo;say four pound,
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men. Say four pound, and you&rsquo;ve got rid of him for good
and all. There!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three pound ten,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come! I&rsquo;ll split the diff&rsquo;erence,
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men,&rdquo; urged Gamfield. &ldquo;Three pound
fifteen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a farthing more,&rdquo; was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re desperate hard upon me, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men,&rdquo; said
Gamfield, wavering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh! pooh! nonsense!&rdquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you
silly fellow! He&rsquo;s just the boy for you. He wants the stick, now and
then: it&rsquo;ll do him good; and his board needn&rsquo;t come very expensive,
for he hasn&rsquo;t been overfed since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and, observing a
smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself. The bargain was
made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures
were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that
very afternoon.
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive
astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a
clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance,
when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the
holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread. At this tremendous
sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the
board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never
would have begun to fatten him up in that way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be
thankful,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a going to be made a &rsquo;prentice of, Oliver.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A prentice, sir!&rdquo; said the child, trembling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Oliver,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;The kind and blessed
gentleman which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your
own: are a going to &ldquo;prentice&rdquo; you: and to set you up in life, and
make a man of you: although the expense to the parish is three pound
ten!&mdash;three pound ten, Oliver!&mdash;seventy shillins&mdash;one hundred
and forty sixpences!&mdash;and all for a naughty orphan which nobody
can&rsquo;t love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an awful
voice, the tears rolled down the poor child&rsquo;s face, and he sobbed
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was
gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;
&ldquo;Come, Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and
don&rsquo;t cry into your gruel; that&rsquo;s a very foolish action,
Oliver.&rdquo; It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it
already.
</p>

<p>
On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would
have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him
if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both
of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in
a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling
what would be done to him. When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a
little room by himself, and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he
came back to fetch him.
</p>

<p>
There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. At the
expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned with the
cocked hat, and said aloud:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.&rdquo; As Mr. Bumble said
this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice,
&ldquo;Mind what I told you, you young rascal!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s face at this somewhat
contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his offering any
remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room: the door of
which was open. It was a large room, with a great window. Behind a desk, sat
two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper;
while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell
spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was
standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially
washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots,
were lounging about.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little bit
of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been stationed by
Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the boy, your worship,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment,
and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last-mentioned
old gentleman woke up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, is this the boy?&rdquo; said the old gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is him, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;Bow to the
magistrate, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been wondering, with
his eyes fixed on the magistrates&rsquo; powder, whether all boards were born
with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that
account.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s fond of
chimney-sweeping?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doats on it, your worship,&rdquo; replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly
pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he <i>will</i> be a sweep, will he?&rdquo; inquired the old
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he&rsquo;d run away
simultaneous, your worship,&rdquo; replied Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this man that&rsquo;s to be his master&mdash;you,
sir&mdash;you&rsquo;ll treat him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of
thing, will you?&rdquo; said the old gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I says I will, I means I will,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gamfield
doggedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,
open-hearted man,&rdquo; said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the
direction of the candidate for Oliver&rsquo;s premium, whose villainous
countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the magistrate was
half blind and half childish, so he couldn&rsquo;t reasonably be expected to
discern what other people did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope I am, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt you are, my friend,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman:
fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the
inkstand.
</p>

<p>
It was the critical moment of Oliver&rsquo;s fate. If the inkstand had been
where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into it,
and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off.
But, as it chanced to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter
of course, that he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and
happening in the course of his search to look straight before him, his gaze
encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the
admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance
of his future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too
palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to Mr.
Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;you look pale and alarmed.
What is the matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand a little away from him, Beadle,&rdquo; said the other magistrate:
laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest.
&ldquo;Now, boy, tell us what&rsquo;s the matter: don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that they
would order him back to the dark room&mdash;that they would starve
him&mdash;beat him&mdash;kill him if they pleased&mdash;rather than send him
away with that dreadful man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most
impressive solemnity. &ldquo;Well! of all the artful and designing orphans that
ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Beadle,&rdquo; said the second old gentleman, when Mr.
Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your worship&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, incredulous
of having heard aright. &ldquo;Did your worship speak to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Hold your tongue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold his
tongue! A moral revolution!
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his companion, he
nodded significantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We refuse to sanction these indentures,&rdquo; said the old gentleman:
tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; stammered Mr. Limbkins: &ldquo;I hope the magistrates
will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper
conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the
matter,&rdquo; said the second old gentleman sharply. &ldquo;Take the boy back
to the workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and
decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be
drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy
mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield
replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although he agreed with
the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite
description.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again To
Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of
him.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap04"></a> CHAPTER IV.<br />
OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE
</h2>

<p>
In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in
possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is
growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea. The board, in
imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on the
expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to
a good unhealthy port. This suggested itself as the very best thing that could
possibly be done with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog
him to death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his
brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known,
very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class. The more
the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more
manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion
that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea
without delay.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with the
view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any
friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his
mission; when he encountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry,
the parochial undertaker.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit of
threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to
answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but
he was in general rather given to professional jocosity. His step was elastic,
and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and
shook him cordially by the hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.
Bumble,&rdquo; said the undertaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,&rdquo; said the beadle,
as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the
undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. &ldquo;I
say you&rsquo;ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bumble,
tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his cane.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and
half disputed the probability of the event. &ldquo;The prices allowed by the
board are very small, Mr. Bumble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So are the coffins,&rdquo; replied the beadle: with precisely as near an
approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and
laughed a long time without cessation. &ldquo;Well, well, Mr. Bumble,&rdquo; he
said at length, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no denying that, since the new system of
feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than
they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble. Well-seasoned timber
is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from
Birmingham.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, &ldquo;every trade has its
drawbacks. A fair profit is, of course, allowable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; replied the undertaker; &ldquo;and if I
don&rsquo;t get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it
up in the long-run, you see&mdash;he! he! he!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Though I must say,&rdquo; continued the undertaker, resuming the current
of observations which the beadle had interrupted: &ldquo;though I must say, Mr.
Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is,
that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who have been better
off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink when they come
into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four inches over
one&rsquo;s calculation makes a great hole in one&rsquo;s profits: especially
when one has a family to provide for, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man;
and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the
honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the
subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know anybody
who wants a boy, do you? A porochial &rsquo;prentis, who is at present a
dead-weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal
terms, Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?&rdquo; As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his
cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words
&ldquo;five pounds&rdquo;: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of
gigantic size.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gadso!&rdquo; said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged
lappel of his official coat; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just the very thing I wanted
to speak to you about. You know&mdash;dear me, what a very elegant button this
is, Mr. Bumble! I never noticed it before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I think it rather pretty,&rdquo; said the beadle, glancing proudly
downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. &ldquo;The die
is the same as the porochial seal&mdash;the Good Samaritan healing the sick and
bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear&rsquo;s morning, Mr.
Sowerberry. I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest
on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I recollect,&rdquo; said the undertaker. &ldquo;The jury brought it in,
&lsquo;Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of
life,&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And they made it a special verdict, I think,&rdquo; said the undertaker,
&ldquo;by adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer
had&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tush! Foolery!&rdquo; interposed the beadle. &ldquo;If the board
attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they&rsquo;d have
enough to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the undertaker; &ldquo;they would indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Juries,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his
wont when working into a passion: &ldquo;juries is ineddicated, vulgar,
grovelling wretches.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; said the undertaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t no more philosophy nor political economy about
&rsquo;em than that,&rdquo; said the beadle, snapping his fingers
contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more they have,&rdquo; acquiesced the undertaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I despise &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the beadle, growing very red in the
face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; rejoined the undertaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I only wish we&rsquo;d a jury of the independent sort, in the house
for a week or two,&rdquo; said the beadle; &ldquo;the rules and regulations of
the board would soon bring their spirit down for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em alone for that,&rdquo; replied the undertaker. So saying,
he smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish
officer.
</p>

<p>
Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the
crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered;
fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer
voice:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well; what about the boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the undertaker; &ldquo;why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I
pay a good deal towards the poor&rsquo;s rates.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the undertaker, &ldquo;I was thinking that if I pay
so much towards &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;ve a right to get as much out of &rsquo;em
as I can, Mr. Bumble; and so&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll take the boy
myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the building.
Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was
arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening &ldquo;upon
liking&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice,
that if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of
a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of
years, to do what he likes with.
</p>

<p>
When little Oliver was taken before &ldquo;the gentlemen&rdquo; that evening;
and informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a
coffin-maker&rsquo;s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever came
back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or
knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so little emotion, that
they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr.
Bumble to remove him forthwith.
</p>

<p>
Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world,
should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the
smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather
out, in this particular instance. The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of
possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way
of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by
the ill usage he had received. He heard the news of his destination, in perfect
silence; and, having had his luggage put into his hand&mdash;which was not very
difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a
brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep&mdash;he
pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of
suffering.
</p>

<p>
For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the
beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a
windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his
flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. As they drew near to their
destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down, and see
that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master: which he
accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oliver!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his
unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he looked
up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his
cheek. It was followed by another, and another. The child made a strong effort,
but it was an unsuccessful one. Withdrawing his other hand from Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s he covered his face with both; and wept until the tears sprung
out from between his chin and bony fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his
little charge a look of intense malignity. &ldquo;Well! Of <i>all</i> the
ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are
the&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, sir,&rdquo; sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the
well-known cane; &ldquo;no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I
will, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So lonely, sir! So very lonely!&rdquo; cried the child. &ldquo;Everybody
hates me. Oh! sir, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t pray be cross to me!&rdquo; The
child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion&rsquo;s face,
with tears of real agony.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver&rsquo;s piteous and helpless look, with some
astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner;
and after muttering something about &ldquo;that troublesome cough,&rdquo; bade
Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his hand, he
walked on with him in silence.
</p>

<p>
The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was making some
entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle, when
Mr. Bumble entered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing
in the middle of a word; &ldquo;is that you, Bumble?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,&rdquo; replied the beadle. &ldquo;Here!
I&rsquo;ve brought the boy.&rdquo; Oliver made a bow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s the boy, is it?&rdquo; said the undertaker: raising the
candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. &ldquo;Mrs. Sowerberry,
will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented the
form of a short, thin, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish countenance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, &ldquo;this is the
boy from the workhouse that I told you of.&rdquo; Oliver bowed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the undertaker&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s very
small.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, he <i>is</i> rather small,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble: looking at
Oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger; &ldquo;he is small.
There&rsquo;s no denying it. But he&rsquo;ll grow, Mrs.
Sowerberry&mdash;he&rsquo;ll grow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! I dare say he will,&rdquo; replied the lady pettishly, &ldquo;on our
victuals and our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they
always cost more to keep, than they&rsquo;re worth. However, men always think
they know best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o&rsquo; bones.&rdquo; With
this, the undertaker&rsquo;s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a
steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante-room
to the coal-cellar, and denominated &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo;; wherein sat a
slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much
out of repair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, Charlotte,&rdquo; said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver
down, &ldquo;give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He
hasn&rsquo;t come home since the morning, so he may go without &rsquo;em. I
dare say the boy isn&rsquo;t too dainty to eat &rsquo;em&mdash;are you,
boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was trembling
with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse
broken victuals was set before him.
</p>

<p>
I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him;
whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching
at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected. I wish he could have witnessed
the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the
ferocity of famine. There is only one thing I should like better; and that
would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the
same relish.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the undertaker&rsquo;s wife, when Oliver had finished
his supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries
of his future appetite: &ldquo;have you done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the
affirmative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then come with me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and
dirty lamp, and leading the way upstairs; &ldquo;your bed&rsquo;s under the
counter. You don&rsquo;t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it
doesn&rsquo;t much matter whether you do or don&rsquo;t, for you can&rsquo;t
sleep anywhere else. Come; don&rsquo;t keep me here all night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap05"></a> CHAPTER V.<br />
OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE
FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER&rsquo;S BUSINESS </h2>

<p>
Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker&rsquo;s shop, set the lamp down
on a workman&rsquo;s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe
and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to
understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle
of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him,
every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which
he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive
him mad with terror. Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row
of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like
high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.
Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay
scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a
lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large
private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the
distance. The shop was close and hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the
smell of coffins. The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress
was thrust, looked like a grave.
</p>

<p>
Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was alone in
a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will
sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no friends to care for, or to
care for him. The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the
absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.
</p>

<p>
But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his
narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and
lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above
his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.
</p>

<p>
Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the
shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an
angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times. When he began to undo the
chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Open the door, will yer?&rdquo; cried the voice which belonged to the
legs which had kicked at the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will, directly, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and
turning the key.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose yer the new boy, ain&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo; said the voice
through the key-hole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How old are yer?&rdquo; inquired the voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ten, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll whop yer when I get in,&rdquo; said the voice;
&ldquo;you just see if I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all, my work&rsquo;us
brat!&rdquo; and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle.
</p>

<p>
Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive
monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt
that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most
honourably. He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and
over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him
through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody
did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house,
eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his
mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver at length: seeing that no
other visitor made his appearance; &ldquo;did you knock?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I kicked,&rdquo; replied the charity-boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you want a coffin, sir?&rdquo; inquired Oliver, innocently.
</p>

<p>
At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would
want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t know who I am, I suppose, Work&rsquo;us?&rdquo; said the
charity-boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile,
with edifying gravity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mister Noah Claypole,&rdquo; said the charity-boy, &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;re under me. Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!&rdquo;
With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop
with a dignified air, which did him great credit. It is difficult for a
large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to
look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when
superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.
</p>

<p>
Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his
effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at
the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously
assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that
&ldquo;he&rsquo;d catch it,&rdquo; condescended to help him. Mr. Sowerberry
came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared. Oliver
having &ldquo;caught it,&rdquo; in fulfilment of Noah&rsquo;s prediction,
followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come near the fire, Noah,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;I saved a nice
little bit of bacon for you from master&rsquo;s breakfast. Oliver, shut that
door at Mister Noah&rsquo;s back, and take them bits that I&rsquo;ve put out on
the cover of the bread-pan. There&rsquo;s your tea; take it away to that box,
and drink it there, and make haste, for they&rsquo;ll want you to mind the
shop. D&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear, Work&rsquo;us?&rdquo; said Noah Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lor, Noah!&rdquo; said Charlotte, &ldquo;what a rum creature you are!
Why don&rsquo;t you let the boy alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him alone!&rdquo; said Noah. &ldquo;Why everybody lets him alone
enough, for the matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever
interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty well. Eh,
Charlotte? He! he! he!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you queer soul!&rdquo; said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh,
in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at
poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the
room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him.
</p>

<p>
Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance-child was he, for
he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard
by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier,
discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and
an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in
the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets
of &ldquo;leathers,&rdquo; &ldquo;charity,&rdquo; and the like; and Noah had
bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless
orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted
on him with interest. This affords charming food for contemplation. It shows us
what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the
same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest
charity-boy.
</p>

<p>
Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker&rsquo;s some three weeks or a
month. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry&mdash;the shop being shut up&mdash;were taking
their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several
deferential glances at his wife, said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo; He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry
looking up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, my dear, nothing,&rdquo; said Mr. Sowerberry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ugh, you brute!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. &ldquo;I thought
you didn&rsquo;t want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me what you were going to say,&rdquo; interposed
Mrs. Sowerberry. &ldquo;I am nobody; don&rsquo;t consult me, pray. <i>I</i>
don&rsquo;t want to intrude upon your secrets.&rdquo; As Mrs. Sowerberry said
this, she gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; said Sowerberry, &ldquo;I want to ask your
advice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t ask mine,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an
affecting manner: &ldquo;ask somebody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Here, there was
another hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a
very common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often
very effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special
favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear.
After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about young Twist, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Sowerberry.
&ldquo;A very good-looking boy, that, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He need be, for he eats enough,&rdquo; observed the lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,&rdquo;
resumed Mr. Sowerberry, &ldquo;which is very interesting. He would make a
delightful mute, my love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment. Mr.
Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation on the
good lady&rsquo;s part, proceeded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear,
but only for children&rsquo;s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in
proportion, my dear. You may depend upon it, it would have a superb
effect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was much
struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been compromising her
dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances, she merely inquired,
with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to
her husband&rsquo;s mind before? Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an
acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that
Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with
this view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his
services being required.
</p>

<p>
The occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next morning,
Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the counter, drew
forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he selected a small scrap of
paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively
countenance; &ldquo;an order for a coffin, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like
himself, was very corpulent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bayton,&rdquo; said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to
Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;I never heard the name before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bumble shook his head, as he replied, &ldquo;Obstinate people, Mr. Sowerberry;
very obstinate. Proud, too, I&rsquo;m afraid, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Proud, eh?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. &ldquo;Come,
that&rsquo;s too much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s sickening,&rdquo; replied the beadle. &ldquo;Antimonial,
Mr. Sowerberry!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; acquiesced the undertaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We only heard of the family the night before last,&rdquo; said the
beadle; &ldquo;and we shouldn&rsquo;t have known anything about them, then,
only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial
committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very
bad. He had gone out to dinner; but his &rsquo;prentice (which is a very clever
lad) sent &rsquo;em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s promptness,&rdquo; said the undertaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Promptness, indeed!&rdquo; replied the beadle. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s
the consequence; what&rsquo;s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir?
Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won&rsquo;t suit his
wife&rsquo;s complaint, and so she shan&rsquo;t take it&mdash;says she
shan&rsquo;t take it, sir! Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given with
great success to two Irish labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week
before&mdash;sent &rsquo;em for nothing, with a blackin&rsquo;-bottle
in,&mdash;and he sends back word that she shan&rsquo;t take it, sir!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s mind in full force, he
struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with indignation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the undertaker, &ldquo;I
ne&mdash;ver&mdash;did&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never did, sir!&rdquo; ejaculated the beadle. &ldquo;No, nor nobody
never did; but now she&rsquo;s dead, we&rsquo;ve got to bury her; and
that&rsquo;s the direction; and the sooner it&rsquo;s done, the better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of
parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after
you!&rdquo; said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the
street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of
sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere
recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s voice.
</p>

<p>
He needn&rsquo;t haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s
glance, however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman
in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the
undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such
time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his being
returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally
overcome.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, &ldquo;the sooner
this job is done, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your
cap, and come with me.&rdquo; Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his
professional mission.
</p>

<p>
They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely inhabited
part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more dirty and
miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house
which was the object of their search. The houses on either side were high and
large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their
neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent
testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with
folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along. A great many
of the tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering
away; only the upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become
insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by
huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road;
but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of
some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place
of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture
wide enough for the passage of a human body. The kennel was stagnant and
filthy. The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness,
were hideous with famine.
</p>

<p>
There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver and his
master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark passage, and
bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to
the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling against a door on the landing,
he rapped at it with his knuckles.
</p>

<p>
It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker at once
saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment to which he
had been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed him.
</p>

<p>
There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the
empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and
was sitting beside him. There were some ragged children in another corner; and
in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something
covered with an old blanket. Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the
place, and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered
up, the boy felt that it was a corpse.
</p>

<p>
The man&rsquo;s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly;
his eyes were bloodshot. The old woman&rsquo;s face was wrinkled; her two
remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and
piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They seemed so
like the rats he had seen outside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody shall go near her,&rdquo; said the man, starting fiercely up, as
the undertaker approached the recess. &ldquo;Keep back! Damn you, keep back, if
you&rsquo;ve a life to lose!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, my good man,&rdquo; said the undertaker, who was pretty well
used to misery in all its shapes. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping
furiously on the floor,&mdash;&ldquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t have her put into
the ground. She couldn&rsquo;t rest there. The worms would worry her&mdash;not
eat her&mdash;she is so worn away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his
pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees
at the feet of the dead woman; &ldquo;kneel down, kneel down&mdash;kneel round
her, every one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death. I
never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her bones
were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor candle; she died in
the dark&mdash;in the dark! She couldn&rsquo;t even see her children&rsquo;s
faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged for her in the
streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back, she was dying; and all
the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death. I swear it
before the God that saw it! They starved her!&rdquo; He twined his hands in his
hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes
fixed, and the foam covering his lips.
</p>

<p>
The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto
remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed, menaced
them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained
extended on the ground, she tottered towards the undertaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was my daughter,&rdquo; said the old woman, nodding her head in the
direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly than
even the presence of death in such a place. &ldquo;Lord, Lord! Well, it
<i>is</i> strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be
alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and stiff! Lord,
Lord!&mdash;to think of it; it&rsquo;s as good as a play&mdash;as good as a
play!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the
undertaker turned to go away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; said the old woman in a loud whisper. &ldquo;Will she
be buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night? I laid her out; and I must walk,
you know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold. We
should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send some
bread&mdash;only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some bread,
dear?&rdquo; she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker&rsquo;s coat, as he
once more moved towards the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the undertaker,&rdquo;of course. Anything you
like!&rdquo; He disengaged himself from the old woman&rsquo;s grasp; and,
drawing Oliver after him, hurried away.
</p>

<p>
The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half-quartern
loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and
his master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr. Bumble had already
arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as
bearers. An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and
the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the
shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!&rdquo; whispered
Sowerberry in the old woman&rsquo;s ear; &ldquo;we are rather late; and it
won&rsquo;t do, to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,&mdash;as quick
as you like!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two
mourners kept as near them, as they could. Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at
a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his
master&rsquo;s, ran by the side.
</p>

<p>
There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had
anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the
churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were made,
the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the
vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an
hour or so, before he came. So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave;
and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain
drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the
churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied
their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. Mr.
Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire
with him, and read the paper.
</p>

<p>
At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and
Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave. Immediately
afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice as he came along.
Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend
gentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed
into four minutes, gave his surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Bill!&rdquo; said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. &ldquo;Fill
up!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the uppermost
coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The grave-digger shovelled in the
earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered his spade; and walked
off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being
over so soon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, my good fellow!&rdquo; said Bumble, tapping the man on the back.
&ldquo;They want to shut up the yard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the grave
side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had addressed him,
walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon. The crazy old woman
was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker
had taken off), to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water
over him; and when he came to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the
gate, and departed on their different ways.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Oliver,&rdquo; said Sowerberry, as they walked home, &ldquo;how do
you like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty well, thank you, sir&rdquo; replied Oliver, with considerable
hesitation. &ldquo;Not very much, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ll get used to it in time, Oliver,&rdquo; said Sowerberry.
&ldquo;Nothing when you <i>are</i> used to it, my boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get
Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask the question;
and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap06"></a> CHAPTER VI.<br />
OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER
ASTONISHES HIM </h2>

<p>
The month&rsquo;s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice
sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up;
and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience.
The success of Mr. Sowerberry&rsquo;s ingenious speculation, exceeded even his
most sanguine hopes. The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which
measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were
the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching
down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the
mothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult
expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour
and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had
many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with
which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses.
</p>

<p>
For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady
or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who
had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief
had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be
as happy among themselves as need be&mdash;quite cheerful and
contented&mdash;conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if
nothing whatever had happened to disturb them. Husbands, too, bore the loss of
their wives with the most heroic calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their
husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up
their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was
observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish
during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached
home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. All this was
very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.
</p>

<p>
That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people,
I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of
confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he continued
meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used
him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new
boy promoted to the black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained
stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because
Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was
disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of
funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry
pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery.
</p>

<p>
And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver&rsquo;s history; for I
have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which
indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and
proceedings.
</p>

<p>
One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual
dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton&mdash;a pound and a half
of the worst end of the neck&mdash;when Charlotte being called out of the way,
there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and
vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than
aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.
</p>

<p>
Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table-cloth; and
pulled Oliver&rsquo;s hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion
that he was a &ldquo;sneak&rdquo;; and furthermore announced his intention of
coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and
entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and
ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was. But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted
to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to
this day, when they want to be funny. He got rather personal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Work&rsquo;us,&rdquo; said Noah, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; replied Oliver; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you say
anything about her to me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver&rsquo;s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there was
a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole thought must be
the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying. Under this impression he
returned to the charge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did she die of, Work&rsquo;us?&rdquo; said Noah.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,&rdquo; replied
Oliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. &ldquo;I
think I know what it must be to die of that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work&rsquo;us,&rdquo; said Noah, as
a tear rolled down Oliver&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s set you a
snivelling now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not <i>you</i>,&rdquo; replied Oliver, sharply. &ldquo;There;
that&rsquo;s enough. Don&rsquo;t say anything more to me about her; you&rsquo;d
better not!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better not!&rdquo; exclaimed Noah. &ldquo;Well! Better not!
Work&rsquo;us, don&rsquo;t be impudent. <i>Your</i> mother, too! She was a nice
&rsquo;un she was. Oh, Lor!&rdquo; And here, Noah nodded his head expressively;
and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect
together, for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yer know, Work&rsquo;us,&rdquo; continued Noah, emboldened by
Oliver&rsquo;s silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all
tones the most annoying: &ldquo;Yer know, Work&rsquo;us, it can&rsquo;t be
helped now; and of course yer couldn&rsquo;t help it then; and I am very sorry
for it; and I&rsquo;m sure we all are, and pity yer very much. But yer must
know, Work&rsquo;us, yer mother was a regular right-down bad &rsquo;un.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A regular right-down bad &rsquo;un, Work&rsquo;us,&rdquo; replied Noah,
coolly. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a great deal better, Work&rsquo;us, that she died
when she did, or else she&rsquo;d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or
transported, or hung; which is more likely than either, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table; seized
Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till his teeth
chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow,
felled him to the ground.
</p>

<p>
A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature that
harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused at last; the cruel
insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. His breast heaved; his
attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he
stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet;
and defied him with an energy he had never known before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll murder me!&rdquo; blubbered Noah. &ldquo;Charlotte! missis!
Here&rsquo;s the new boy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver&rsquo;s gone
mad! Char&mdash;lotte!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noah&rsquo;s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a
louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a
side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain
that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further
down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you little wretch!&rdquo; screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with
her utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in
particularly good training. &ldquo;Oh, you little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous,
hor-rid villain!&rdquo; And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a
blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of
society.
</p>

<p>
Charlotte&rsquo;s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not be
effectual in calming Oliver&rsquo;s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the
kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she scratched his face
with the other. In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose from the
ground, and pommelled him behind.
</p>

<p>
This was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all wearied
out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and
shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up.
This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless her, she&rsquo;s going off!&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;A glass
of water, Noah, dear. Make haste!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Charlotte,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she
could, through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which
Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. &ldquo;Oh! Charlotte, what a mercy
we have not all been murdered in our beds!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! mercy indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; was the reply. I only hope
this&rsquo;ll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures,
that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He
was all but killed, ma&rsquo;am, when I come in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the
charity-boy.
</p>

<p>
Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the
crown of Oliver&rsquo;s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists
while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed some affecting
tears and sniffs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. &ldquo;Your
master&rsquo;s not at home; there&rsquo;s not a man in the house, and
he&rsquo;ll kick that door down in ten minutes.&rdquo; Oliver&rsquo;s vigorous
plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly
probable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear, dear! I don&rsquo;t know, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Charlotte,
&ldquo;unless we send for the police-officers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or the millingtary,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of
Oliver&rsquo;s old friend. &ldquo;Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come
here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You
can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It&rsquo;ll keep the
swelling down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and very
much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity-boy
tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his head, and a
clasp-knife at his eye.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap07"></a> CHAPTER VII.<br />
OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY </h2>

<p>
Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once
for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested here, for a
minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and
terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to
the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces
about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with the boy!&rdquo; said the old pauper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!&rdquo; cried Noah, with well-affected dismay:
and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.
Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he
rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,&mdash;which is a very curious and
remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and
powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of
self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!&rdquo; said Noah: &ldquo;Oliver, sir,&mdash;Oliver
has&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What? What?&rdquo; interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in
his metallic eyes. &ldquo;Not run away; he hasn&rsquo;t run away, has he,
Noah?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he&rsquo;s turned wicious,&rdquo;
replied Noah. &ldquo;He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder
Charlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony, please,
sir!&rdquo; And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive
variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that,
from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe
internal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment suffering the
acutest torture.
</p>

<p>
When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr.
Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful
wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a
white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than
ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse
the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman&rsquo;s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked
three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was
howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something which would
render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary
process?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Bumble, &ldquo;who has been nearly murdered&mdash;all but murdered,
sir,&mdash;by young Twist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping
short. &ldquo;I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,
that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,&rdquo;
said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And his missis,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?&rdquo; added Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No! he&rsquo;s out, or he would have murdered him,&rdquo; replied Noah.
&ldquo;He said he wanted to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?&rdquo; inquired the gentleman in
the white waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Noah. &ldquo;And please, sir, missis wants to
know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog
him&mdash;&rsquo;cause master&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, my boy; certainly,&rdquo; said the gentleman in the white
waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah&rsquo;s head, which was about
three inches higher than his own. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good boy&mdash;a very
good boy. Here&rsquo;s a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to
Sowerberry&rsquo;s with your cane, and see what&rsquo;s best to be done.
Don&rsquo;t spare him, Bumble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I will not, sir,&rdquo; replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and
cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner&rsquo;s satisfaction,
Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the
undertaker&rsquo;s shop.
</p>

<p>
Here the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had not yet
returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the
cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and
Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to
parley, before opening the door. With this view he gave a kick at the outside,
by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a
deep and impressive tone:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oliver!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come; you let me out!&rdquo; replied Oliver, from the inside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know this here voice, Oliver?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you afraid of it, sir? Ain&rsquo;t you a-trembling while I
speak, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Oliver, boldly.
</p>

<p>
An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in the
habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He stepped back from the
keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one to another of
the three bystanders, in mute astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Madness, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble, after a
few moments of deep meditation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Meat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meat, ma&rsquo;am, meat,&rdquo; replied Bumble, with stern emphasis.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve over-fed him, ma&rsquo;am. You&rsquo;ve raised a artificial
soul and spirit in him, ma&rsquo;am unbecoming a person of his condition: as
the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What
have paupers to do with soul or spirit? It&rsquo;s quite enough that we let
&rsquo;em have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma&rsquo;am, this
would never have happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes
to the kitchen ceiling: &ldquo;this comes of being liberal!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse
bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat;
so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily
remaining under Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s heavy accusation. Of which, to do her
justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth
again; &ldquo;the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave
him in the cellar for a day or so, till he&rsquo;s a little starved down; and
then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship. He
comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry! Both the nurse and
doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against difficulties
and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman, weeks before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this point of Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to
know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking, with
a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible. Sowerberry returned at
this juncture. Oliver&rsquo;s offence having been explained to him, with such
exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he
unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice
out, by the collar.
</p>

<p>
Oliver&rsquo;s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face
was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead. The angry
flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison,
he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He called my mother names,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Sowerberry. &ldquo;She deserved what he said, and worse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t&rdquo; said Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; said Oliver.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.
</p>

<p>
This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had hesitated for
one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every
experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in
disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting
creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too
numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter. To do him justice, he
was, as far as his power went&mdash;it was not very extensive&mdash;kindly
disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so;
perhaps, because his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him
no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.
Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s subsequent application of
the parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was shut up
in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night,
Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means
complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst
the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his
dismal bed.
</p>

<p>
It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy
workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the
day&rsquo;s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child.
He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash
without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have
kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive. But now,
when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor;
and, hiding his face in his hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit
of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him!
</p>

<p>
For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The candle was
burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having gazed cautiously
round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door,
and looked abroad.
</p>

<p>
It was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy&rsquo;s eyes, farther
from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the
sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and
death-like, from being so still. He softly reclosed the door. Having availed
himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few
articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for
morning.
</p>

<p>
With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the
shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look
around&mdash;one moment&rsquo;s pause of hesitation&mdash;he had closed it
behind him, and was in the open street.
</p>

<p>
He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.
</p>

<p>
He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill.
He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields: which he
knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and
walked quickly on.
</p>

<p>
Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside Mr.
Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm. His way lay
directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly when he bethought
himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back. He had come a long way
though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so. Besides, it was so
early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on.
</p>

<p>
He reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that
early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child was weeding one
of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the
features of one of his former companions. Oliver felt glad to see him, before
he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and
playmate. They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and
many a time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, Dick!&rdquo; said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust
his thin arm between the rails to greet him. &ldquo;Is any one up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody but me,&rdquo; replied the child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You musn&rsquo;t say you saw me, Dick,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;I am
running away. They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my
fortune, some long way off. I don&rsquo;t know where. How pale you are!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,&rdquo; replied the child with
a faint smile. &ldquo;I am very glad to see you, dear; but don&rsquo;t stop,
don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b&rsquo;ye to you,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
&ldquo;I shall see you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and
happy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied the child. &ldquo;After I am dead, but not
before. I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of
Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake. Kiss
me,&rdquo; said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little
arms round Oliver&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Good-b&rsquo;ye, dear! God bless
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The blessing was from a young child&rsquo;s lips, but it was the first that
Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and
sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot
it.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap08"></a> CHAPTER VIII.<br />
OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG
GENTLEMAN </h2>

<p>
Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more gained
the high-road. It was eight o&rsquo;clock now. Though he was nearly five miles
away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon:
fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then he sat down to rest by the
side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he had
better go and try to live.
</p>

<p>
The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that
it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The name awakened a new
train of ideas in the boy&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
London!&mdash;that great place!&mdash;nobody&mdash;not even Mr.
Bumble&mdash;could ever find him there! He had often heard the old men in the
workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there
were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in
country parts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who
must die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things passed
through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward.
</p>

<p>
He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles
more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach
his place of destination. As this consideration forced itself upon him, he
slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting there. He
had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his
bundle. He had a penny too&mdash;a gift of Sowerberry&rsquo;s after some
funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well&mdash;in
his pocket. &ldquo;A clean shirt,&rdquo; thought Oliver, &ldquo;is a very
comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny;
but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles&rsquo; walk in winter
time.&rdquo; But Oliver&rsquo;s thoughts, like those of most other people,
although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties,
were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so,
after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little
bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.
</p>

<p>
Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the
crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at the
cottage-doors by the road-side. When the night came, he turned into a meadow;
and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning. He
felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields:
and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had ever felt before. Being
very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.
</p>

<p>
He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he was
obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village
through which he passed. He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night
closed in again. His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled
beneath him. Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him worse; when
he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along.
</p>

<p>
He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and then
begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice
of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill,
and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried
to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of
his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence
back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and
didn&rsquo;t deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud
of dust behind.
</p>

<p>
In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who
begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail. This frightened
Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all
possible expedition. In others, he would stand about the inn-yards, and look
mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in
the landlady&rsquo;s ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging about, to
drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal
something. If he begged at a farmer&rsquo;s house, ten to one but they
threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they
talked about the beadle&mdash;which brought Oliver&rsquo;s heart into his
mouth,&mdash;very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together.
</p>

<p>
In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a benevolent
old lady, Oliver&rsquo;s troubles would have been shortened by the very same
process which had put an end to his mother&rsquo;s; in other words, he would
most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king&rsquo;s highway. But the
turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a
shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took
pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could afford&mdash;and
more&mdash;with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and
compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver&rsquo;s soul, than all the
sufferings he had ever undergone.
</p>

<p>
Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver limped
slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were closed; the
street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day. The sun
was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the
boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding feet and
covered with dust, upon a door-step.
</p>

<p>
By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up; and
people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a
moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none
relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there. He had no
heart to beg. And there he sat.
</p>

<p>
He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number
of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small),
gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how
strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had
taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to
accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him
carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most
earnestly from the opposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at
first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long,
that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon this, the boy
crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, my covey! What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his own
age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen. He was a
snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as
one would wish to see; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man.
He was short of his age: with rather bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes.
His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall
off every moment&mdash;and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had
not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which
brought it back to its old place again. He wore a man&rsquo;s coat, which
reached nearly to his heels. He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm,
to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of
thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept
them. He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as
ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, my covey! What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; said this strange young
gentleman to Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very hungry and tired,&rdquo; replied Oliver: the tears standing in
his eyes as he spoke. &ldquo;I have walked a long way. I have been walking
these seven days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Walking for sivin days!&rdquo; said the young gentleman. &ldquo;Oh, I
see. Beak&rsquo;s order, eh? But,&rdquo; he added, noticing Oliver&rsquo;s look
of surprise, &ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t know what a beak is, my flash
com-pan-i-on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird&rsquo;s mouth described
by the term in question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My eyes, how green!&rdquo; exclaimed the young gentleman. &ldquo;Why, a
beak&rsquo;s a madgst&rsquo;rate; and when you walk by a beak&rsquo;s order,
it&rsquo;s not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down
agin. Was you never on the mill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What mill?&rdquo; inquired Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What mill! Why, <i>the</i> mill&mdash;the mill as takes up so little
room that it&rsquo;ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the
wind&rsquo;s low with people, than when it&rsquo;s high; acos then they
can&rsquo;t get workmen. But come,&rdquo; said the young gentleman; &ldquo;you
want grub, and you shall have it. I&rsquo;m at low-water-mark myself&mdash;only
one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I&rsquo;ll fork out and stump. Up
with you on your pins. There! Now then! &ldquo;Morrice!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent
chandler&rsquo;s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham
and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, &ldquo;a fourpenny
bran!&rdquo; the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious
expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb,
and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentlman
turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of
the premises. Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the
mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his new friend&rsquo;s bidding,
made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed
him from time to time with great attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Going to London?&rdquo; said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length
concluded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Got any lodgings?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Money?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the big
coat-sleeves would let them go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you live in London?&rdquo; inquired Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I do, when I&rsquo;m at home,&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;I
suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do, indeed,&rdquo; answered Oliver. &ldquo;I have not slept under a
roof since I left the country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret your eyelids on that score,&rdquo; said the young
gentleman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a
&rsquo;spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot&rsquo;ll give you lodgings
for nothink, and never ask for the change&mdash;that is, if any genelman he
knows interduces you. And don&rsquo;t he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By
no means. Certainly not!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of
discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so.
</p>

<p>
This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as
it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman
referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without
loss of time. This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which
Oliver discovered that his friend&rsquo;s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he
was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dawkin&rsquo;s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts
which his patron&rsquo;s interest obtained for those whom he took under his
protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing,
and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by
the sobriquet of &ldquo;The Artful Dodger,&rdquo; Oliver concluded that, being
of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had
hitherto been thrown away upon him. Under this impression, he secretly resolved
to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and,
if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should,
to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was
nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington. They
crossed from the Angel into St. John&rsquo;s Road; struck down the small street
which terminates at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and
Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the
classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into
Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger
scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.
</p>

<p>
Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his
leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the
way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen.
The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy
odours.
</p>

<p>
There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be
heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at
the doors, or screaming from the inside. The sole places that seemed to prosper
amid the general blight of the place, were the public-houses; and in them, the
lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and
yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little
knots of houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in
filth; and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were
cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed or
harmless errands.
</p>

<p>
Oliver was just considering whether he hadn&rsquo;t better run away, when they
reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor, catching him by the arm, pushed
open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him into the passage,
closed it behind them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then!&rdquo; cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from
the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Plummy and slam!&rdquo; was the reply.
</p>

<p>
This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of
a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a
man&rsquo;s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old kitchen
staircase had been broken away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two on you,&rdquo; said the man, thrusting the candle
farther out, and shielding his eyes with his hand. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the
t&rsquo;other one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A new pal,&rdquo; replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did he come from?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a sortin&rsquo; the wipes. Up with you!&rdquo; The
candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by
his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which
his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well
acquainted with them.
</p>

<p>
He threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.
</p>

<p>
The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt. There
was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in a
ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate.
In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to the
mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them,
with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose
villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red
hair. He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed
to be dividing his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over
which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. Several rough beds
made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round the
table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay
pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men. These all crowded
about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned
round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is him, Fagin,&rdquo; said Jack Dawkins; &ldquo;my friend Oliver
Twist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the hand,
and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance. Upon this,
the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands
very hard&mdash;especially the one in which he held his little bundle. One
young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so
obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very
tired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to
bed. These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a
liberal exercise of the Jew&rsquo;s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of
the affectionate youths who offered them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,&rdquo; said the Jew.
&ldquo;Dodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver.
Ah, you&rsquo;re a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are
a good many of &rsquo;em, ain&rsquo;t there? We&rsquo;ve just looked &rsquo;em
out, ready for the wash; that&rsquo;s all, Oliver; that&rsquo;s all. Ha! ha!
ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the
hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of which they went to
supper.
</p>

<p>
Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water:
telling him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the
tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired. Immediately afterwards he felt himself
gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap09"></a> CHAPTER IX.<br />
CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS
HOPEFUL PUPILS </h2>

<p>
It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. There was
no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a
saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round
and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when
there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go
on whistling and stirring again, as before.
</p>

<p>
Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake.
There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in
five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of
everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your
eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness. At such
time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some
glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and
spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal
associate.
</p>

<p>
Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his half-closed
eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating
against the saucepan&rsquo;s sides: and yet the self-same senses were mentally
engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he had ever
known.
</p>

<p>
When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob. Standing, then
in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to
employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his
name. He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep.
</p>

<p>
After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door:
which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap
in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table. His eyes
glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in. Dragging an old chair to the
table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with
jewels.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting
every feature with a hideous grin. &ldquo;Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to
the last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old
Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn&rsquo;t have loosened the knot, or kept
the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once
more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a dozen more
were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure;
besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such
magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of
their names.
</p>

<p>
Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay
in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it;
for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his hand, pored
over it, long and earnestly. At length he put it down, as if despairing of
success; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead men
never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it&rsquo;s a fine thing for the
trade! Five of &rsquo;em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or
turn white-livered!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been staring
vacantly before him, fell on Oliver&rsquo;s face; the boy&rsquo;s eyes were
fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an
instant&mdash;for the briefest space of time that can possibly be
conceived&mdash;it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.
</p>

<p>
He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a bread
knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled very much
though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in
the air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;What do you watch me for?
Why are you awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick&mdash;quick! for
your life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t able to sleep any longer, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver,
meekly. &ldquo;I am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were not awake an hour ago?&rdquo; said the Jew, scowling fiercely
on the boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No! No, indeed!&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than
before: and a threatening attitude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon my word I was not, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver, earnestly. &ldquo;I
was not, indeed, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tush, tush, my dear!&rdquo; said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old
manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to
induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. &ldquo;Of course I
know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You&rsquo;re a brave boy. Ha!
ha! you&rsquo;re a brave boy, Oliver.&rdquo; The Jew rubbed his hands with a
chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?&rdquo; said the Jew,
laying his hand upon it after a short pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Jew, turning rather pale.
&ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re mine, Oliver; my little property. All I have to
live upon, in my old age. The folks call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser;
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a
dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for
the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a
deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, my dear, certainly,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman.
&ldquo;Stay. There&rsquo;s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring
it here; and I&rsquo;ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the
pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.
</p>

<p>
He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin
out of the window, agreeably to the Jew&rsquo;s directions, when the Dodger
returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen
smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as
Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot
rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing
himself to the Dodger, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve been at work this morning, my
dears?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hard,&rdquo; replied the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As nails,&rdquo; added Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good boys, good boys!&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;What have you got,
Dodger?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A couple of pocket-books,&rdquo; replied that young gentlman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lined?&rdquo; inquired the Jew, with eagerness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one
green, and the other red.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so heavy as they might be,&rdquo; said the Jew, after looking at the
insides carefully; &ldquo;but very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman,
ain&rsquo;t he, Oliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very indeed, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed
uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh
at, in anything that had passed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what have you got, my dear?&rdquo; said Fagin to Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wipes,&rdquo; replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four
pocket-handkerchiefs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Jew, inspecting them closely; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
very good ones, very. You haven&rsquo;t marked them well, though, Charley; so
the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we&rsquo;ll teach Oliver how
to do it. Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as
Charley Bates, wouldn&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rdquo; said the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very much, indeed, if you&rsquo;ll teach me, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he
burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and
carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his premature
suffocation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is so jolly green!&rdquo; said Charley when he recovered, as an
apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour.
</p>

<p>
The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver&rsquo;s hair over his eyes, and
said he&rsquo;d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing
Oliver&rsquo;s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had
been much of a crowd at the execution that morning? This made him wonder more
and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both
been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found
time to be so very industrious.
</p>

<p>
When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two boys
played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way.
The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a
note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain
round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat
tight round him, and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his
pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner
in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he
stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he
was staring with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would look
constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his
pockets in turn, to see that he hadn&rsquo;t lost anything, in such a very
funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face.
All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his
sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow
their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot
accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one
moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box,
note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the
spectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he
cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again.
</p>

<p>
When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young ladies
called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and the other
Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and
were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings. They were not exactly pretty,
perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite
stout and hearty. Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver
thought them very nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.
</p>

<p>
The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence of one
of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the
conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length, Charley Bates
expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof. This, it occurred to
Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and
Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly
furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, my dear,&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pleasant life,
isn&rsquo;t it? They have gone out for the day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have they done work, sir?&rdquo; inquired Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;that is, unless they should
unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won&rsquo;t neglect
it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it. Make &rsquo;em your models, my dear.
Make &rsquo;em your models,&rdquo; tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add
force to his words; &ldquo;do everything they bid you, and take their advice in
all matters&mdash;especially the Dodger&rsquo;s, my dear. He&rsquo;ll be a
great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by
him.&mdash;Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?&rdquo; said
the Jew, stopping short.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do,
when we were at play this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the
Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it gone?&rdquo; cried the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here it is, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver, showing it in his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a clever boy, my dear,&rdquo; said the playful old
gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly. &ldquo;I never saw a sharper
lad. Here&rsquo;s a shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you&rsquo;ll
be the greatest man of the time. And now come here, and I&rsquo;ll show you how
to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman&rsquo;s pocket in play, had to
do with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew, being so
much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was
soon deeply involved in his new study.

<h2><a name="chap10"></a> CHAPTER X.<br />
OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND
PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT
CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY </h2>

<p>
For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew&rsquo;s room, picking the marks out
of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and
sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the
Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length, he began to languish for fresh
air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow
him to go out to work with his two companions.
</p>

<p>
Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he had
seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman&rsquo;s character. Whenever the
Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed, he would expatiate
with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce
upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed.
On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a
flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual
extent.
</p>

<p>
At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly
sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days,
and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these were reasons for the old
gentleman&rsquo;s giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told
Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley
Bates, and his friend the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up, and his
hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his
pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what
branch of manufacture he would be instructed in, first.
</p>

<p>
The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter, that
Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old
gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a vicious propensity,
too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down
areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the
rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at
the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly
capacious, that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every
direction. These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of
declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when
his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious
change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in
Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms,
&ldquo;The Green&rdquo;: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his
finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution
and circumspection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied the Dodger. &ldquo;Do you see that old cove at the
book-stall?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The old gentleman over the way?&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;Yes, I see
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A prime plant,&rdquo; observed Master Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he was not
permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the
road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had
been directed. Oliver walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether
to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered
head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black
velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his
arm. He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away,
as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible
that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction,
that he saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short,
anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning
over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of
the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness.
</p>

<p>
What was Oliver&rsquo;s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking
on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger
plunge his hand into the old gentleman&rsquo;s pocket, and draw from thence a
handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold
them, both running away round the corner at full speed!
</p>

<p>
In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the
jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from
terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and
frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as
fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.
</p>

<p>
This was all done in a minute&rsquo;s space. In the very instant when Oliver
began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing
his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding away at such a
rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting
&ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo; with all his might, made off after him, book in hand.
</p>

<p>
But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry. The
Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down
the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the
corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing
exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and,
shouting &ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo; too, joined in the pursuit like good
citizens.
</p>

<p>
Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically
acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of
nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this. Not being
prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with
the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rdquo; There is a magic in the sound. The
tradesman leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws
down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his
parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his
battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing,
yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners,
rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and
courts, re-echo with the sound.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rdquo; The cry is taken up by a hundred voices,
and the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through the
mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people,
onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the
plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour
to the cry, &ldquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rdquo; There is a passion FOR <i>hunting</i>
<i>something</i> deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless
child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large
drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head
upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him every
instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy. &ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo;
Ay, stop him for God&rsquo;s sake, were it only in mercy!
</p>

<p>
Stopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the crowd
eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling with the
others to catch a glimpse. &ldquo;Stand aside!&rdquo; &ldquo;Give him a little
air!&rdquo; &ldquo;Nonsense! he don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the gentleman?&rdquo; &ldquo;Here his is, coming down the
street.&rdquo; &ldquo;Make room there for the gentleman!&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this
the boy, sir!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking
wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the old gentleman
was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the
pursuers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;I am afraid it is the boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; murmured the crowd. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good
&rsquo;un!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;he has hurt
himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> did that, sir,&rdquo; said a great lubberly fellow, stepping
forward; &ldquo;and preciously I cut my knuckle agin&rsquo; his mouth. I
stopped him, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his pains; but,
the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike, look anxiously
round, as if he contemplated running away himself: which it is very possible he
might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded another chase, had not a
police officer (who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at
that moment made his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, get up,&rdquo; said the man, roughly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other
boys,&rdquo; said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round.
&ldquo;They are here somewhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, they ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the officer. He meant this to be
ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed
off down the first convenient court they came to.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, get up!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, compassionately.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I won&rsquo;t hurt him,&rdquo; replied the officer, tearing his
jacket half off his back, in proof thereof. &ldquo;Come, I know you; it
won&rsquo;t do. Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet, and
was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at a rapid pace. The
gentleman walked on with them by the officer&rsquo;s side; and as many of the
crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at Oliver
from time to time. The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went.

<h2><a name="chap11"></a> CHAPTER XI.<br />
TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF
HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE </h2>

<p>
The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate
neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office. The crowd had
only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and
down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up
a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way. It was
a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout
man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; said the man carelessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A young fogle-hunter,&rdquo; replied the man who had Oliver in charge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you the party that&rsquo;s been robbed, sir?&rdquo; inquired the man
with the keys.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman; &ldquo;but I am not sure
that this boy actually took the handkerchief. I&mdash;I would rather not press
the case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Must go before the magistrate now, sir,&rdquo; replied the man.
&ldquo;His worship will be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young
gallows!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as
he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was searched; and nothing
being found upon him, locked up.
</p>

<p>
This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so
light. It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had
been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since
Saturday night. But this is little. In our station-houses, men and women are
every night confined on the most trivial charges&mdash;the word is worth
noting&mdash;in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by
the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death,
are palaces. Let any one who doubts this, compare the two.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the
lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of
all this disturbance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is something in that boy&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; said the old
gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover
of the book, in a thoughtful manner; &ldquo;something that touches and
interests me. <i>Can</i> he be innocent? He looked like&mdash;Bye the
bye,&rdquo; exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up
into the sky, &ldquo;Bless my soul!&mdash;where have I seen something like that
look before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same
meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there,
retiring into a corner, called up before his mind&rsquo;s eye a vast
amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, shaking his head; &ldquo;it must be
imagination.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was not easy
to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There were the faces of
friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering
intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls
that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed
upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old
freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of
the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of
beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only
to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to
Heaven.
</p>

<p>
But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver&rsquo;s
features bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened;
and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in
the pages of the musty book.
</p>

<p>
He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the
keys to follow him into the office. He closed his book hastily; and was at once
ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang.
</p>

<p>
The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. Mr. Fang sat behind a
bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in
which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the
awfulness of the scene.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with no great
quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his head.
His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were really not in the habit of
drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought
action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate&rsquo;s
desk, said, suiting the action to the word, &ldquo;That is my name and address,
sir.&rdquo; He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and
gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.
</p>

<p>
Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article
in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his, and
commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and
particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. He was out
of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said Mr. Fang.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Officer!&rdquo; said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with
the newspaper. &ldquo;Who is this fellow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My name, sir,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, speaking <i>like</i> a
gentleman, &ldquo;my name, sir, is Brownlow. Permit me to inquire the name of
the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable
person, under the protection of the bench.&rdquo; Saying this, Mr. Brownlow
looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him
the required information.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Officer!&rdquo; said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s this fellow charged with?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not charged at all, your worship,&rdquo; replied the officer.
&ldquo;He appears against this boy, your worship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a safe
one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Appears against the boy, does he?&rdquo; said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr.
Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot. &ldquo;Swear him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow;
&ldquo;and that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have
believed&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir!&rdquo; said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will not, sir!&rdquo; replied the old gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue this instant, or I&rsquo;ll have you turned out of the
office!&rdquo; said Mr. Fang. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an insolent impertinent
fellow. How dare you bully a magistrate!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Swear this person!&rdquo; said Fang to the clerk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
hear another word. Swear him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps,
that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his
feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Fang, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the charge against this boy?
What have you got to say, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was standing at a bookstall&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Brownlow began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Fang. &ldquo;Policeman!
Where&rsquo;s the policeman? Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what
is this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how
he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all
he knew about it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are there any witnesses?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Fang.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None, your worship,&rdquo; replied the policeman.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the
prosecutor, said in a towering passion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do
you not? You have been sworn. Now, if you stand there, refusing to give
evidence, I&rsquo;ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will,
by&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud,
just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor,
thus preventing the word from being heard&mdash;accidently, of course.
</p>

<p>
With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to state
his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the
boy because he had saw him running away; and expressing his hope that, if the
magistrate should believe him, although not actually the thief, to be connected
with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has been hurt already,&rdquo; said the old gentleman in conclusion.
&ldquo;And I fear,&rdquo; he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar,
&ldquo;I really fear that he is ill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! yes, I dare say!&rdquo; said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. &ldquo;Come,
none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won&rsquo;t do. What&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him. He was deadly pale; and the
whole place seemed turning round and round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, you hardened scoundrel?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Fang. &ldquo;Officer, what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was
standing by the bar. He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding
him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not
replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity
of his sentence; he hazarded a guess.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says his name&rsquo;s Tom White, your worship,&rdquo; said the
kind-hearted thief-taker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t speak out, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Fang.
&ldquo;Very well, very well. Where does he live?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where he can, your worship,&rdquo; replied the officer; again pretending
to receive Oliver&rsquo;s answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he any parents?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Fang.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says they died in his infancy, your worship,&rdquo; replied the
officer: hazarding the usual reply.
</p>

<p>
At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with
imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; said Mr. Fang: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to make
a fool of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think he really is ill, your worship,&rdquo; remonstrated the officer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know better,&rdquo; said Mr. Fang.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take care of him, officer,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, raising his
hands instinctively; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll fall down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand away, officer,&rdquo; cried Fang; &ldquo;let him, if he
likes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a
fainting fit. The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to
stir.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew he was shamming,&rdquo; said Fang, as if this were incontestable
proof of the fact. &ldquo;Let him lie there; he&rsquo;ll soon be tired of
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?&rdquo; inquired the clerk
in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Summarily,&rdquo; replied Mr. Fang. &ldquo;He stands committed for three
months&mdash;hard labour of course. Clear the office.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing to
carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor
appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the office, and
advanced towards the bench.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop! don&rsquo;t take him away! For Heaven&rsquo;s sake stop a
moment!&rdquo; cried the new comer, breathless with haste.
</p>

<p>
Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and
arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the
lives, of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, especially of the poorer class; and
although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make
the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the
medium of the daily press.[Footnote: Or were virtually, then.] Mr. Fang was
consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such
irreverent disorder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the office!&rdquo;
cried Mr. Fang.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>will</i> speak,&rdquo; cried the man; &ldquo;I will not be turned
out. I saw it all. I keep the book-stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be
put down. Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You must not refuse, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man was right. His manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather
too serious to be hushed up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Swear the man,&rdquo; growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace.
&ldquo;Now, man, what have you got to say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the man: &ldquo;I saw three boys: two others and the
prisoner here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman
was reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done; and I saw
that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.&rdquo; Having by this
time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to
relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come here before?&rdquo; said Fang, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t a soul to mind the shop,&rdquo; replied the man.
&ldquo;Everybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could
get nobody till five minutes ago; and I&rsquo;ve run here all the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The prosecutor was reading, was he?&rdquo; inquired Fang, after another
pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;The very book he has in his
hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that book, eh?&rdquo; said Fang. &ldquo;Is it paid for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it is not,&rdquo; replied the man, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, I forgot all about it!&rdquo; exclaimed the absent old
gentleman, innocently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!&rdquo; said Fang,
with a comical effort to look humane. &ldquo;I consider, sir, that you have
obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable
circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the
property declines to prosecute. Let this be a lesson to you, my man, or the law
will overtake you yet. The boy is discharged. Clear the office!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&mdash;n me!&rdquo; cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage
he had kept down so long, &ldquo;d&mdash;n me! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Clear the office!&rdquo; said the magistrate. &ldquo;Officers, do you
hear? Clear the office!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out, with
the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect phrenzy of
rage and defiance. He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment.
Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned,
and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble
convulsing his whole frame.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor boy, poor boy!&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him.
&ldquo;Call a coach, somebody, pray. Directly!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the
old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I accompany you?&rdquo; said the book-stall keeper, looking in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless me, yes, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow quickly. &ldquo;I
forgot you. Dear, dear! I have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor fellow!
There&rsquo;s no time to lose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.

<h2><a name="chap12"></a> CHAPTER XII.<br />
IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN WHICH
THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS.
</h2>

<p>
The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had
traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning
a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length
before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville. Here, a bed was
prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge
carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness
and solicitude that knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new
friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after
that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath
the dry and wasting heat of fever. The worm does not work more surely on the
dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame.
</p>

<p>
Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a
long and troubled dream. Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head
resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What room is this? Where have I been brought to?&rdquo; said Oliver.
&ldquo;This is not the place I went to sleep in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but they
were overheard at once. The curtain at the bed&rsquo;s head was hastily drawn
back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she
undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which she had been sitting at
needle-work.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, my dear,&rdquo; said the old lady softly. &ldquo;You must be very
quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,&mdash;as bad as
bad could be, pretty nigh. Lie down again; there&rsquo;s a dear!&rdquo; With
those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver&rsquo;s head upon the
pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and
loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in
hers, and drawing it round his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Save us!&rdquo; said the old lady, with tears in her eyes. &ldquo;What a
grateful little dear it is. Pretty creetur! What would his mother feel if she
had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps she does see me,&rdquo; whispered Oliver, folding his hands
together; &ldquo;perhaps she has sat by me. I almost feel as if she had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was the fever, my dear,&rdquo; said the old lady mildly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it was,&rdquo; replied Oliver, &ldquo;because heaven is a long
way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor
boy. But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she
was very ill herself before she died. She can&rsquo;t know anything about me
though,&rdquo; added Oliver after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;If she had
seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked
sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her
spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and
parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and
then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be
ill again.
</p>

<p>
So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old
lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely
exhausted with what he had already said. He soon fell into a gentle doze, from
which he was awakened by the light of a candle: which, being brought near the
bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in
his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <i>are</i> a great deal better, are you not, my dear?&rdquo; said
the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know you are,&rdquo; said the gentleman: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
hungry too, an&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;No, I know you&rsquo;re not. He
is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin,&rdquo; said the gentleman: looking very wise.
</p>

<p>
The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to say
that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor appeared much of
the same opinion himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You feel sleepy, don&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rdquo; said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sleepy. Nor thirsty. Are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, rather thirsty,&rdquo; answered Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,&rdquo; said the doctor.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very natural that he should be thirsty. You may give him a
little tea, ma&rsquo;am, and some dry toast without any butter. Don&rsquo;t
keep him too warm, ma&rsquo;am; but be careful that you don&rsquo;t let him be
too cold; will you have the goodness?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady dropped a curtsey. The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and
expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his boots creaking in a
very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs.
</p>

<p>
Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve
o&rsquo;clock. The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly afterwards,
and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come: bringing with her,
in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap. Putting the
latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling
Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire
and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with
sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no
worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep
again.
</p>

<p>
And thus the night crept slowly on. Oliver lay awake for some time, counting
the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw
upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the
paper on the wall. The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very
solemn; as they brought into the boy&rsquo;s mind the thought that death had
been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the
gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and
fervently prayed to Heaven.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent
suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake
from. Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and
turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the
future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past!
</p>

<p>
It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt
cheerful and happy. The crisis of the disease was safely past. He belonged to
the world again.
</p>

<p>
In three days&rsquo; time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped up
with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him
carried downstairs into the little housekeeper&rsquo;s room, which belonged to
her. Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself down
too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much
better, forthwith began to cry most violently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind me, my dear,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only
having a regular good cry. There; it&rsquo;s all over now; and I&rsquo;m quite
comfortable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very, very kind to me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, never you mind that, my dear,&rdquo; said the old lady;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with your broth; and it&rsquo;s full time
you had it; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this
morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the
more he&rsquo;ll be pleased.&rdquo; And with this, the old lady applied herself
to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough,
Oliver thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation
strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you fond of pictures, dear?&rdquo; inquired the old lady, seeing
that Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against
the wall; just opposite his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Oliver, without
taking his eyes from the canvas; &ldquo;I have seen so few that I hardly know.
What a beautiful, mild face that lady&rsquo;s is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;painters always make ladies out
prettier than they are, or they wouldn&rsquo;t get any custom, child. The man
that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would
never succeed; it&rsquo;s a deal too honest. A deal,&rdquo; said the old lady,
laughing very heartily at her own acuteness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is&mdash;is that a likeness, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a portrait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whose, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, really, my dear, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the old lady
in a good-humoured manner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a likeness of anybody that you
or I know, I expect. It seems to strike your fancy, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is so pretty,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, sure you&rsquo;re not afraid of it?&rdquo; said the old lady:
observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the
painting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, no,&rdquo; returned Oliver quickly; &ldquo;but the eyes look so
sorrowful; and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. It makes my heart
beat,&rdquo; added Oliver in a low voice, &ldquo;as if it was alive, and wanted
to speak to me, but couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord save us!&rdquo; exclaimed the old lady, starting;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk in that way, child. You&rsquo;re weak and nervous after
your illness. Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you
won&rsquo;t see it. There!&rdquo; said the old lady, suiting the action to the
word; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t see it now, at all events.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver <i>did</i> see it in his mind&rsquo;s eye as distinctly as if he had not
altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady;
so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he
felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth,
with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation. Oliver got through it
with extraordinary expedition. He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful,
when there came a soft rap at the door. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the old
lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner
raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the skirts
of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his countenance
underwent a very great variety of odd contortions. Oliver looked very worn and
shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of
respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair
again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s
heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane
disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process
which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor boy, poor boy!&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin. I&rsquo;m afraid I
have caught cold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope not, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bedwin. &ldquo;Everything you have
had, has been well aired, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Bedwin. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr.
Brownlow; &ldquo;I rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday;
but never mind that. How do you feel, my dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very happy, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver. &ldquo;And very grateful indeed,
sir, for your goodness to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good by,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. &ldquo;Have you given him
any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Bedwin: drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the
last word: to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded, there
existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; &ldquo;a couple of
glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn&rsquo;t
they, Tom White, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My name is Oliver, sir,&rdquo; replied the little invalid: with a look
of great astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;Oliver what? Oliver White,
eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Queer name!&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;What made you tell the
magistrate your name was White?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never told him so, sir,&rdquo; returned Oliver in amazement.
</p>

<p>
This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat
sternly in Oliver&rsquo;s face. It was impossible to doubt him; there was truth
in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some mistake,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow. But, although his motive for
looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance
between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly, that he
could not withdraw his gaze.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you are not angry with me, sir?&rdquo; said Oliver, raising his
eyes beseechingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman. &ldquo;Why! what&rsquo;s this?
Bedwin, look there!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver&rsquo;s head, and
then to the boy&rsquo;s face. There was its living copy. The eyes, the head,
the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the instant, so
precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy!
</p>

<p>
Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong
enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away. A weakness on his part,
which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from
suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of
recording&mdash;
</p>

<p>
That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the
hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver&rsquo;s heels, in consequence of their
executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s personal property, as
has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming
regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the
liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a
true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this
action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic
men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for
their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little
code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid
down as the main-springs of all Nature&rsquo;s deeds and actions: the said
philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady&rsquo;s proceedings to matters
of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted
wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of
heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For, these are matters totally beneath
a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the
numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex.
</p>

<p>
If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the
conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should
at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this
narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed
upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible
cut. Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of
renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their
course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions
and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the
pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I do mean
to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many
mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and
foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed
at all likely to affect themselves. Thus, to do a great right, you may do a
little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will
justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the
distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned,
to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of
his own particular case.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most
intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath
a low and dark archway. Having remained silent here, just long enough to
recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and
delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself
upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; roared Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your noise,&rdquo; remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously
round. &ldquo;Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Charley, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help
it! To see him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and
knocking up again&rsquo; the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of
iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter
him&mdash;oh, my eye!&rdquo; The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented
the scene before him in too strong colours. As he arrived at this apostrophe,
he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll Fagin say?&rdquo; inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of
the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the
question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; repeated Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, what?&rdquo; said the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what should he say?&rdquo; inquired Charley: stopping rather
suddenly in his merriment; for the Dodger&rsquo;s manner was impressive.
&ldquo;What should he say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat,
scratched his head, and nodded thrice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Charley.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn&rsquo;t, and
high cockolorum,&rdquo; said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his
intellectual countenance.
</p>

<p>
This was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so; and again
said, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the
skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his cheek,
slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in a familiar but
expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court. Master Bates
followed, with a thoughtful countenance.
</p>

<p>
The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the
occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over
the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife in his
right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a rascally smile on his white
face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his thick red
eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; muttered the Jew: changing countenance;
&ldquo;only two of &rsquo;em? Where&rsquo;s the third? They can&rsquo;t have
got into trouble. Hark!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was slowly
opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind them.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap13"></a> CHAPTER XIII.<br />
SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH
WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY </h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Oliver?&rdquo; said the Jew, rising with a menacing look.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence;
and looked uneasily at each other. But they made no reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of the boy?&rdquo; said the Jew, seizing the Dodger
tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations.
&ldquo;Speak out, or I&rsquo;ll throttle you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed it
prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no means
improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his
knees, and raised a loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar&mdash;something
between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you speak?&rdquo; thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much
that his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, the traps have got him, and that&rsquo;s all about it,&rdquo; said
the Dodger, sullenly. &ldquo;Come, let go o&rsquo; me, will you!&rdquo; And,
swinging himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the
Jew&rsquo;s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at
the merry old gentleman&rsquo;s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would
have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced.
</p>

<p>
The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have been
anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the pot,
prepared to hurl it at his assailant&rsquo;s head. But Charley Bates, at this
moment, calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he suddenly altered
its destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!&rdquo; growled a deep voice.
&ldquo;Who pitched that &rsquo;ere at me? It&rsquo;s well it&rsquo;s the beer,
and not the pot, as hit me, or I&rsquo;d have settled somebody. I might have
know&rsquo;d, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew
could afford to throw away any drink but water&mdash;and not that, unless he
done the River Company every quarter. Wot&rsquo;s it all about, Fagin?
D&mdash;me, if my neck-handkercher an&rsquo;t lined with beer! Come in, you
sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of
your master! Come in!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of about
five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace-up
half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with
large swelling calves;&mdash;the kind of legs, which in such costume, always
look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish
them. He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round
his neck: with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face
as he spoke. He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with
a beard of three days&rsquo; growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which
displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a
blow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in, d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo; growled this engaging ruffian.
</p>

<p>
A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different
places, skulked into the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come in afore?&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting too proud to own me afore company, are you? Lie
down!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the other
end of the room. He appeared well used to it, however; for he coiled himself up
in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking his very
ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking
a survey of the apartment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you up to? Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious,
in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?&rdquo; said the man, seating himself deliberately.
&ldquo;I wonder they don&rsquo;t murder you! I would if I was them. If
I&rsquo;d been your &rsquo;prentice, I&rsquo;d have done it long ago,
and&mdash;no, I couldn&rsquo;t have sold you afterwards, for you&rsquo;re fit
for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I
suppose they don&rsquo;t blow glass bottles large enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes,&rdquo; said the Jew, trembling;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak so loud!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None of your mistering,&rdquo; replied the ruffian; &ldquo;you always
mean mischief when you come that. You know my name: out with it! I shan&rsquo;t
disgrace it when the time comes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, then&mdash;Bill Sikes,&rdquo; said the Jew, with abject
humility. &ldquo;You seem out of humour, Bill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; replied Sikes; &ldquo;I should think you was rather
out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots
about, as you do when you blab and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and
pointing towards the boys.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear,
and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show which the
Jew appeared to understand perfectly. He then, in cant terms, with which his
whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be quite
unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass of liquor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And mind you don&rsquo;t poison it,&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, laying his
hat upon the table.
</p>

<p>
This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with
which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he might
have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all events) to
improve upon the distiller&rsquo;s ingenuity not very far from the old
gentleman&rsquo;s merry heart.
</p>

<p>
After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes condescended to
take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a
conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver&rsquo;s capture were
circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the truth,
as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that he may say something
which will get us into trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very likely,&rdquo; returned Sikes with a malicious grin.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re blowed upon, Fagin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid, you see,&rdquo; added the Jew, speaking as if he
had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did
so,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be
up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than
it would for me, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man started, and turned round upon the Jew. But the old gentleman&rsquo;s
shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring on
the opposite wall.
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie appeared
plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain
malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs
of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went
out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Somebody must find out wot&rsquo;s been done at the office,&rdquo; said
Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.
</p>

<p>
The Jew nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t peached, and is committed, there&rsquo;s no fear till
he comes out again,&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, &ldquo;and then he must be taken
care on. You must get hold of him somehow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again the Jew nodded.
</p>

<p>
The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but, unfortunately,
there was one very strong objection to its being adopted. This was, that the
Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and
all, to entertain a violent and deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a
police-office on any ground or pretext whatever.
</p>

<p>
How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of
uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess. It is
not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden
entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion,
caused the conversation to flow afresh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;Bet will go; won&rsquo;t
you, my dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wheres?&rdquo; inquired the young lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only just up to the office, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew coaxingly.
</p>

<p>
It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she
would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be
&ldquo;blessed&rdquo; if she would; a polite and delicate evasion of the
request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good
breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a
direct and pointed refusal.
</p>

<p>
The Jew&rsquo;s countenance fell. He turned from this young lady, who was
gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow
curl-papers, to the other female.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nancy, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew in a soothing manner, &ldquo;what do
<i>you</i> say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That it won&rsquo;t do; so it&rsquo;s no use a-trying it on,
Fagin,&rdquo; replied Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly
manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I say, Bill,&rdquo; replied the lady collectedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re just the very person for it,&rdquo; reasoned Mr.
Sikes: &ldquo;nobody about here knows anything of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And as I don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em to, neither,&rdquo; replied Nancy in
the same composed manner, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather more no than yes with me,
Bill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll go, Fagin,&rdquo; said Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t, Fagin,&rdquo; said Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she will, Fagin,&rdquo; said Sikes.
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes,
the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission.
She was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable
friend; for, having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from
the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same
apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers
tucked up under a straw bonnet,&mdash;both articles of dress being provided
from the Jew&rsquo;s inexhaustible stock,&mdash;Miss Nancy prepared to issue
forth on her errand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop a minute, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew, producing, a little covered
basket. &ldquo;Carry that in one hand. It looks more respectable, my
dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give her a door-key to carry in her t&rsquo;other one, Fagin,&rdquo;
said Sikes; &ldquo;it looks real and genivine like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,&rdquo; said the Jew, hanging a large
street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady&rsquo;s right hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There; very good! Very good indeed, my dear!&rdquo; said the Jew,
rubbing his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!&rdquo;
exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the
street-door key in an agony of distress. &ldquo;What has become of him! Where
have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what&rsquo;s been done
with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone: to the
immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked to the company,
nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s a clever girl, my dears,&rdquo; said the Jew, turning
round to his young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute
admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a honour to her sex,&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, filling his
glass, and smiting the table with his enormous fist. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s her
health, and wishing they was all like her!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the accomplished
Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office; whither,
notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the
streets alone and unprotected, she arrived in perfect safety shortly
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the
cell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and
listened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nolly, dear?&rdquo; murmured Nancy in a gentle voice;
&ldquo;Nolly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been taken
up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society having been
clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of
Correction for one month; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he
had so much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the
treadmill than in a musical instrument. He made no answer: being occupied
mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the
use of the county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried a faint and feeble voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there a little boy here?&rdquo; inquired Nancy, with a preliminary
sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the voice; &ldquo;God forbid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for <i>not</i>
playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and doing
nothing for his livelihood. In the next cell was another man, who was going to
the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing
something for his living, in defiance of the Stamp-office.
</p>

<p>
But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew
anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped
waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more
piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key and the little
basket, demanded her own dear brother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got him, my dear,&rdquo; said the old man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, the gentleman&rsquo;s got him,&rdquo; replied the officer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?&rdquo; exclaimed
Nancy.
</p>

<p>
In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply
affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and discharged in
consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by
another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away, in
an insensible condition, to his own residence: of and concerning which, all the
informant knew was, that it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that
word mentioned in the directions to the coachman.
</p>

<p>
In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman
staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run,
returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of, to the
domicile of the Jew.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he
very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, expeditiously
departed: without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company
good-morning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,&rdquo; said the
Jew greatly excited. &ldquo;Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring
home some news of him! Nancy, my dear, I must have him found. I trust to you,
my dear,&mdash;to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,&rdquo; added
the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s money, my
dears. I shall shut up this shop to-night. You&rsquo;ll know where to find me!
Don&rsquo;t stop here a minute. Not an instant, my dears!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully double-locking
and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box
which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver. Then, he hastily proceeded to
dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing.
</p>

<p>
A rap at the door startled him in this occupation. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo; he cried in a shrill tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; cried the Jew impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?&rdquo; inquired the
Dodger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Jew, &ldquo;wherever she lays hands on him. Find
him, find him out, that&rsquo;s all. I shall know what to do next; never
fear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his
companions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has not peached so far,&rdquo; said the Jew as he pursued his
occupation. &ldquo;If he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop
his mouth yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap14"></a> CHAPTER XIV.<br />
COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER&rsquo;S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW&rsquo;S,
WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM,
WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND </h2>

<p>
Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s
abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was carefully
avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that
ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver&rsquo;s history or prospects,
but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him. He was
still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he came down into the
housekeeper&rsquo;s room next day, his first act was to cast an eager glance at
the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady. His
expectations were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the housekeeper, watching the direction of
Oliver&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;It is gone, you see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see it is ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Oliver. &ldquo;Why have they
taken it away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it
seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you
know,&rdquo; rejoined the old lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed. It didn&rsquo;t worry me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Oliver. &ldquo;I liked to see it. I quite loved it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the old lady, good-humouredly; &ldquo;you get
well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There! I
promise you that! Now, let us talk about something else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that
time. As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to
think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great
many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who
was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about
a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such
a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that
it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them. When the old lady had
expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of
her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just
six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea. After tea she began to teach
Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach: and at which
game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the
invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then
to go cosily to bed.
</p>

<p>
They were happy days, those of Oliver&rsquo;s recovery. Everything was so
quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the
noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like
Heaven itself. He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, properly,
than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of
shoes, to be provided for him. As Oliver was told that he might do what he
liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to
him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself. This
she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw
the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think
that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his
ever being able to wear them again. They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and
Oliver had never had a new suit before.
</p>

<p>
One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was sitting
talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if
Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk
to him a little while.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely
for you, child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bedwin. &ldquo;Dear heart alive! If we had
known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and
made you as smart as sixpence!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously,
meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered
his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important
personal advantage, that she went so far as to say: looking at him with great
complacency from head to foot, that she really didn&rsquo;t think it would have
been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for
the better.
</p>

<p>
Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. On Mr. Brownlow calling to
him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books,
with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens. There was a table
drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading. When he
saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come near the
table, and sit down. Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be
found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the
world wiser. Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver
Twist, every day of their lives.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?&rdquo; said Mr.
Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that
reached from the floor to the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A great number, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver. &ldquo;I never saw so
many.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall read them, if you behave well,&rdquo; said the old gentleman
kindly; &ldquo;and you will like that, better than looking at the
outsides,&mdash;that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs
and covers are by far the best parts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver, pointing
to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not always those,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the
head, and smiling as he did so; &ldquo;there are other equally heavy ones,
though of a much smaller size. How should you like to grow up a clever man, and
write books, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I would rather read them, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be a book-writer?&rdquo; said the old
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be
a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed
heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing. Which Oliver felt glad to
have done, though he by no means knew what it was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, composing his features.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid! We won&rsquo;t make an author of you, while
there&rsquo;s an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver. At the earnest manner of his reply,
the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct,
which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at
the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him
assume yet, &ldquo;I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am
going to say. I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you
are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!&rdquo;
exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman&rsquo;s
commencement! &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets
again. Let me stay here, and be a servant. Don&rsquo;t send me back to the
wretched place I came from. Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of
Oliver&rsquo;s sudden appeal; &ldquo;you need not be afraid of my deserting
you, unless you give me cause.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never, never will, sir,&rdquo; interposed Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; rejoined the old gentleman. &ldquo;I do not think you
ever will. I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured
to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am
more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself. The
persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but,
although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not
made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.
Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his
companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat
quite still.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful
tone, &ldquo;I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that
I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not
to wound me again. You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world;
all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement. Let me hear
your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the
company in which I found you. Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless
while I live.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver&rsquo;s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the
point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and
carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little
double-knock was heard at the street-door: and the servant, running upstairs,
announced Mr. Grimwig.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he coming up?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the servant. &ldquo;He asked if there were any
muffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to
tea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old
friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners;
for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I go downstairs, sir?&rdquo; inquired Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;I would rather you remained
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a thick
stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue
coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed
white hat, with the sides turned up with green. A very small-plaited shirt
frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch-chain, with
nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it. The ends of his white
neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety
of shapes into which his countenance was twisted, defy description. He had a
manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of
the corners of his eyes at the same time: which irresistibly reminded the
beholder of a parrot. In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made
his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm&rsquo;s
length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here! do you see this! Isn&rsquo;t it a most wonderful and
extraordinary thing that I can&rsquo;t call at a man&rsquo;s house but I find a
piece of this poor surgeon&rsquo;s friend on the staircase? I&rsquo;ve been
lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or
I&rsquo;ll be content to eat my own head, sir!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly
every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case, because,
even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific
improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat
his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig&rsquo;s head
was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could
hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting&mdash;to
put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat my head, sir,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his
stick upon the ground. &ldquo;Hallo! what&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; looking at
Oliver, and retreating a pace or two.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,&rdquo; said Mr.
Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
Oliver bowed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that&rsquo;s the boy who had the fever, I
hope?&rdquo; said Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more. &ldquo;Wait a minute!
Don&rsquo;t speak! Stop&mdash;&rdquo; continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing
all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
boy who had the orange! If that&rsquo;s not the boy, sir, who had the orange,
and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I&rsquo;ll eat my head, and his
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, he has not had one,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, laughing.
&ldquo;Come! Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I feel strongly on this subject, sir,&rdquo; said the irritable old
gentleman, drawing off his gloves. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always more or less
orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s put
there by the surgeon&rsquo;s boy at the corner. A young woman stumbled over a
bit last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I saw
her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go to him,&rsquo; I called out of the window,
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s an assassin! A man-trap!&rsquo; So he is. If he is
not&mdash;&rdquo; Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the
ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply
the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still
keeping his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass,
which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who,
seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy, is it?&rdquo; said Mr. Grimwig, at length.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How are you, boy?&rdquo; said Mr. Grimwig.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A great deal better, thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say
something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin
they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the visitor&rsquo;s
manner, he was very happy to do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t know. I never see any difference in boys. I only knew
two sort of boys. Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And which is Oliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mealy. I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call
him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a
body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes;
with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf. I know him! The
wretch!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;these are not the characteristics
of young Oliver Twist; so he needn&rsquo;t excite your wrath.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Grimwig. &ldquo;He may have
worse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig
the most exquisite delight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He may have worse, I say,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Grimwig. &ldquo;Where does
he come from! Who is he? What is he? He has had a fever. What of that? Fevers
are not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers sometimes;
haven&rsquo;t they, eh? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his
master. He had had a fever six times; he wasn&rsquo;t recommended to mercy on
that account. Pooh! nonsense!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig
was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver&rsquo;s appearance and manner were
unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction,
sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly
determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or
not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend. When Mr. Brownlow
admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory
answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver&rsquo;s
previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr.
Grimwig chuckled maliciously. And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the
housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she
didn&rsquo;t find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he
would be content to&mdash;and so forth.
</p>

<p>
All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman:
knowing his friend&rsquo;s peculiarities, bore with great good humour; as Mr.
Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the
muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party,
began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old
gentleman&rsquo;s presence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of
the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?&rdquo; asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow,
at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he resumed his
subject.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;I would rather he
was alone with me at the time. Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten
o&rsquo;clock, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver. He answered with some hesitation,
because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig&rsquo;s looking so hard at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; whispered that gentleman to Mr.
Brownlow; &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t come up to you to-morrow morning. I saw him
hesitate. He is deceiving you, my good friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear he is not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he is not,&rdquo; said Mr. Grimwig, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
and down went the stick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for that boy&rsquo;s truth with my life!&rdquo; said
Mr. Brownlow, knocking the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I for his falsehood with my head!&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Grimwig,
knocking the table also.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; &ldquo;we
will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a small
parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical
bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this history; having laid them on
the table, she prepared to leave the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;there is
something to go back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has gone, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bedwin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Call after him,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s particular.
He is a poor man, and they are not paid for. There are some books to be taken
back, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The street-door was opened. Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and
Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in
sight. Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to report that
there were no tidings of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, I am very sorry for that,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Brownlow;
&ldquo;I particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Send Oliver with them,&rdquo; said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile;
&ldquo;he will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run all the way, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any
account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he
should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to
him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <i>shall</i> go, my dear,&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;The
books are on a chair by my table. Fetch them down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great
bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are to say,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig;
&ldquo;you are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have
come to pay the four pound ten I owe him. This is a five-pound note, so you
will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be ten minutes, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver, eagerly. Having
buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully
under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room. Mrs. Bedwin
followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions about the nearest
way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street: all of which
Oliver said he clearly understood. Having superadded many injunctions to be
sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to depart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless his sweet face!&rdquo; said the old lady, looking after him.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the
corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and, closing the door,
went back to her own room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me see; he&rsquo;ll be back in twenty minutes, at the
longest,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the
table. &ldquo;It will be dark by that time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Grimwig.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig&rsquo;s breast, at the
moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend&rsquo;s confident smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, smiting the table with his fist, &ldquo;I do not.
The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under
his arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket. He&rsquo;ll join his old friends
the thieves, and laugh at you. If ever that boy returns to this house, sir,
I&rsquo;ll eat my head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the two
friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.
</p>

<p>
It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own
judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty
conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad-hearted man,
and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend
duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that
moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.
</p>

<p>
It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely discernible;
but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch
between them.

<h2><a name="chap15"></a> CHAPTER XV.<br />
SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE
</h2>

<p>
In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of Little
Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in
the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer: there sat,
brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated
with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots
and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police
would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet, sat a
white-coated, red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at
his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut
on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent
conflict.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Keep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, suddenly
breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by
the dog&rsquo;s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his
reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an
unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration.
Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the
dog simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their
masters; but Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s dog, having faults of temper in common with his
owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of
injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots.
Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just
escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would, would you?&rdquo; said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand,
and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew from
his pocket. &ldquo;Come here, you born devil! Come here! D&rsquo;ye
hear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a
very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to
having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more fiercely than
before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth, and
biting at it like a wild beast.
</p>

<p>
This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his knees,
began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped from right to left,
and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and
swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical
point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out:
leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.
</p>

<p>
There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. Mr. Sikes,
being disappointed of the dog&rsquo;s participation, at once transferred his
share in the quarrel to the new comer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?&rdquo; said
Sikes, with a fierce gesture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, my dear, I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Fagin,
humbly; for the Jew was the new comer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know, you white-livered thief!&rdquo; growled Sikes.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you hear the noise?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a sound of it, as I&rsquo;m a living man, Bill,&rdquo; replied the
Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no! You hear nothing, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Sikes with a
fierce sneer. &ldquo;Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or
go! I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired the Jew with a forced smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as
haven&rsquo;t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he
likes,&rdquo; replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to laugh at
the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill at ease, however.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grin away,&rdquo; said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him
with savage contempt; &ldquo;grin away. You&rsquo;ll never have the laugh at
me, though, unless it&rsquo;s behind a nightcap. I&rsquo;ve got the upper hand
over you, Fagin; and, d&mdash;me, I&rsquo;ll keep it. There! If I go, you go;
so take care of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;I know all that;
we&mdash;we&mdash;have a mutual interest, Bill,&mdash;a mutual interest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more
on the Jew&rsquo;s side than on his. &ldquo;Well, what have you got to say to
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all passed safe through the melting-pot,&rdquo; replied
Fagin, &ldquo;and this is your share. It&rsquo;s rather more than it ought to
be, my dear; but as I know you&rsquo;ll do me a good turn another time,
and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stow that gammon,&rdquo; interposed the robber, impatiently.
&ldquo;Where is it? Hand over!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,&rdquo; replied the Jew,
soothingly. &ldquo;Here it is! All safe!&rdquo; As he spoke, he drew forth an
old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one
corner, produced a small brown-paper packet. Sikes, snatching it from him,
hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is all, is it?&rdquo; inquired Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All,&rdquo; replied the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come
along, have you?&rdquo; inquired Sikes, suspiciously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put on
an injured look at the question; you&rsquo;ve done it many a time. Jerk the
tinkler.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It was
answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive
in appearance.
</p>

<p>
Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly
understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable
look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of
it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been
almost imperceptible to an observant third person. It was lost upon Sikes, who
was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn.
Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have
thought that it boded no good to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is anybody here, Barney?&rdquo; inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that
Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dot a shoul,&rdquo; replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from
the heart or not: made their way through the nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody?&rdquo; inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps
might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dobody but Biss Dadsy,&rdquo; replied Barney.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; exclaimed Sikes. &ldquo;Where? Strike me blind, if I
don&rsquo;t honour that &rsquo;ere girl, for her native talents.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,&rdquo; replied
Barney.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Send her here,&rdquo; said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor.
&ldquo;Send her here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent,
and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned,
ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and
street-door key, complete.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?&rdquo; inquired Sikes, proffering
the glass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I am, Bill,&rdquo; replied the young lady, disposing of its
contents; &ldquo;and tired enough of it I am, too. The young brat&rsquo;s been
ill and confined to the crib; and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Nancy, dear!&rdquo; said Fagin, looking up.
</p>

<p>
Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew&rsquo;s red eye-brows, and a
half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to
be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance. The fact is all we
need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and
with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other
matters. In about ten minutes&rsquo; time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of
coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it
was time to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way
himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together,
followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon
as his master was out of sight.
</p>

<p>
The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked
after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched fist; muttered a
deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table;
where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very short a
distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the book-stall. When he
got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a by-street which was not
exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half-way
down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it
worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the
books under his arm.
</p>

<p>
He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel; and
how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who, starved and
beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he was startled by
a young woman screaming out very loud. &ldquo;Oh, my dear brother!&rdquo; And
he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by
having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Oliver, struggling. &ldquo;Let go of me. Who
is it? What are you stopping me for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young
woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street-door key
in her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh my gracious!&rdquo; said the young woman, &ldquo;I have found him!
Oh! Oliver! Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your
account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I&rsquo;ve found him. Thank gracious
goodness heavins, I&rsquo;ve found him!&rdquo; With these incoherent
exclamations, the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so
dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a
butcher&rsquo;s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also
looking on, whether he didn&rsquo;t think he had better run for the doctor. To
which, the butcher&rsquo;s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent
disposition: replied, that he thought not.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, no, never mind,&rdquo; said the young woman, grasping
Oliver&rsquo;s hand; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better now. Come home directly, you cruel
boy! Come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the young woman, &ldquo;he ran away,
near a month ago, from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable
people; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost
broke his mother&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Young wretch!&rdquo; said one woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go home, do, you little brute,&rdquo; said the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know her. I haven&rsquo;t any sister, or father and mother either. I&rsquo;m an
orphan; I live at Pentonville.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only hear him, how he braves it out!&rdquo; cried the young woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Nancy!&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for
the first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see he knows me!&rdquo; cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders.
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t help himself. Make him come home, there&rsquo;s good
people, or he&rsquo;ll kill his dear mother and father, and break my
heart!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said a man, bursting out of a
beer-shop, with a white dog at his heels; &ldquo;young Oliver! Come home to
your poor mother, you young dog! Come home directly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong to them. I don&rsquo;t know them. Help!
help!&rdquo; cried Oliver, struggling in the man&rsquo;s powerful grasp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; repeated the man. &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll help you, you
young rascal! What books are these? You&rsquo;ve been a stealing &rsquo;em,
have you? Give &rsquo;em here.&rdquo; With these words, the man tore the
volumes from his grasp, and struck him on the head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried a looker-on, from a garret-window.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way of bringing him to his senses!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving
look at the garret-window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do him good!&rdquo; said the two women.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he shall have it, too!&rdquo; rejoined the man, administering
another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. &ldquo;Come on, you young
villain! Here, Bull&rsquo;s-eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the
attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of the
man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the
hardened little wretch he was described to be; what could one poor child do!
Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance
was useless. In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow
courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he
dared to give utterance to, unintelligible. It was of little moment, indeed,
whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them,
had they been ever so plain.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door;
the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces
of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark
parlour, with the watch between them.

<h2><a name="chap16"></a> CHAPTER XVI.<br />
RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY </h2>

<p>
The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space;
scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a
cattle-market. Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot: the girl
being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had
hitherto walked. Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold of
Nancy&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked
round.
</p>

<p>
They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.
</p>

<p>
Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He held out
his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me the other,&rdquo; said Sikes, seizing Oliver&rsquo;s unoccupied
hand. &ldquo;Here, Bull&rsquo;s-Eye!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The dog looked up, and growled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See here, boy!&rdquo; said Sikes, putting his other hand to
Oliver&rsquo;s throat; &ldquo;if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him!
D&rsquo;ye mind!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious
to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he
isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and
ferocious approval. &ldquo;Now, you know what you&rsquo;ve got to expect,
master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.
Get on, young&rsquo;un!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bull&rsquo;s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing
form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of
Oliver, led the way onward.
</p>

<p>
It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been
Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night was dark
and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy
mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in
gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver&rsquo;s eyes; and
making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.
</p>

<p>
They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the hour. With
its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned their heads in the
direction whence the sound proceeded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock, Bill,&rdquo; said Nancy, when the bell ceased.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can&rsquo;t
I!&rdquo; replied Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder whether <i>they</i> can hear it,&rdquo; said Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course they can,&rdquo; replied Sikes. &ldquo;It was Bartlemy time
when I was shopped; and there warn&rsquo;t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I
couldn&rsquo;t hear the squeaking on. Arter I was locked up for the night, the
row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost
have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards
the quarter in which the bell had sounded. &ldquo;Oh, Bill, such fine young
chaps as them!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s all you women think of,&rdquo; answered Sikes.
&ldquo;Fine young chaps! Well, they&rsquo;re as good as dead, so it don&rsquo;t
much matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to
jealousy, and, clasping Oliver&rsquo;s wrist more firmly, told him to step out
again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; said the girl: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hurry by,
if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o&rsquo;clock
struck, Bill. I&rsquo;d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the
snow was on the ground, and I hadn&rsquo;t a shawl to cover me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what good would that do?&rdquo; inquired the unsentimental Mr.
Sikes. &ldquo;Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout
rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for
all the good it would do me. Come on, and don&rsquo;t stand preaching
there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and they
walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as
they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white.
</p>

<p>
They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full half-hour:
meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the
same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. At length they turned into a
very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running
forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on
guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently
untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a
board, intimating that it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for
many years.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.
</p>

<p>
Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell. They
crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a
lamp. A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon
afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by
the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the
house.
</p>

<p>
The passage was perfectly dark. They waited, while the person who had let them
in, chained and barred the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anybody here?&rdquo; inquired Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is the old &rsquo;un here?&rdquo; asked the robber.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the voice, &ldquo;and precious down in the mouth he
has been. Won&rsquo;t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed
familiar to Oliver&rsquo;s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the
form of the speaker in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a glim,&rdquo; said Sikes, &ldquo;or we shall go
breaking our necks, or treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you
do!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand still a moment, and I&rsquo;ll get you one,&rdquo; replied the
voice. The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another
minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. He
bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick.
</p>

<p>
The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon
Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to
follow him down a flight of stairs. They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening
the door of a low earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a
small back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my wig, my wig!&rdquo; cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs
the laughter had proceeded: &ldquo;here he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin,
look at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can&rsquo;t bear it; it is such a jolly
game, I can&rsquo;t bear it. Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on
the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious
joy. Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger;
and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off
his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy. The
Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave
way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver&rsquo;s
pockets with steady assiduity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at his togs, Fagin!&rdquo; said Charley, putting the light so close
to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. &ldquo;Look at his togs!
Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And his
books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew,
bowing with mock humility. &ldquo;The Artful shall give you another suit, my
dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn&rsquo;t you write, my
dear, and say you were coming? We&rsquo;d have got something warm for
supper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed, and
even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound note at
that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his
merriment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hallo, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the
Jew seized the note. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine, Fagin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;Mine, Bill, mine. You shall
have the books.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If that ain&rsquo;t mine!&rdquo; said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat
with a determined air; &ldquo;mine and Nancy&rsquo;s that is; I&rsquo;ll take
the boy back again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he
hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come! Hand over, will you?&rdquo; said Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?&rdquo; inquired
the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fair, or not fair,&rdquo; retorted Sikes, &ldquo;hand over, I tell you!
Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but
to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed
through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the
Jew&rsquo;s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face,
folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for our share of the trouble,&rdquo; said Sikes; &ldquo;and
not half enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you&rsquo;re fond of
reading. If you ain&rsquo;t, sell &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very pretty,&rdquo; said Charley Bates: who, with sundry
grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question;
&ldquo;beautiful writing, isn&rsquo;t is, Oliver?&rdquo; At sight of the
dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was
blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more
boisterous than the first.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They belong to the old gentleman,&rdquo; said Oliver, wringing his
hands; &ldquo;to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and
had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back;
send him back the books and money. Keep me here all my life long; but pray,
pray send them back. He&rsquo;ll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them
who were so kind to me: will think I stole them. Oh, do have mercy upon me, and
send them back!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief,
Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew&rsquo;s feet; and beat his hands
together, in perfect desperation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; remarked Fagin, looking covertly round,
and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,
Oliver, you&rsquo;re right; they <i>will</i> think you have stolen &rsquo;em.
Ha! ha!&rdquo; chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;it couldn&rsquo;t
have happened better, if we had chosen our time!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Sikes; &ldquo;I know&rsquo;d
that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his
arm. It&rsquo;s all right enough. They&rsquo;re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or
they wouldn&rsquo;t have taken him in at all; and they&rsquo;ll ask no
questions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him
lagged. He&rsquo;s safe enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken,
as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what passed; but when
Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the
room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the
roof.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Keep back the dog, Bill!&rdquo; cried Nancy, springing before the door,
and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit.
&ldquo;Keep back the dog; he&rsquo;ll tear the boy to pieces.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Serve him right!&rdquo; cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself
from the girl&rsquo;s grasp. &ldquo;Stand off from me, or I&rsquo;ll split your
head against the wall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that, Bill, I don&rsquo;t care for that,&rdquo;
screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, &ldquo;the child
shan&rsquo;t be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t he!&rdquo; said Sikes, setting his teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
soon do that, if you don&rsquo;t keep off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just
as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here!&rdquo; said Fagin, looking round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s gone mad, I think,&rdquo; replied Sikes, savagely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Nancy, pale and breathless from the
scuffle; &ldquo;no, she hasn&rsquo;t, Fagin; don&rsquo;t think it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then keep quiet, will you?&rdquo; said the Jew, with a threatening look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t do that, neither,&rdquo; replied Nancy, speaking very
loud. &ldquo;Come! What do you think of that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that
particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably
certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her, at
present. With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to
Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?&rdquo; said the Jew, taking
up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace;
&ldquo;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver made no reply. But he watched the Jew&rsquo;s motions, and breathed
quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?&rdquo; sneered
the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cure you of that, my
young master.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver&rsquo;s shoulders with the club; and
was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from
his hand. She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the
glowing coals whirling out into the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand by and see it done, Fagin,&rdquo; cried the girl.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the boy, and what more would you have?&mdash;Let him
be&mdash;let him be&mdash;or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will
bring me to the gallows before my time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and
with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew
and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into
which she had gradually worked herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Nancy!&rdquo; said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause,
during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted
manner; &ldquo;you,&mdash;you&rsquo;re more clever than ever to-night. Ha! ha!
my dear, you are acting beautifully.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I!&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Take care I don&rsquo;t overdo it.
You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to
keep clear of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her other
strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men
like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further
mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy&rsquo;s rage; and, shrinking
involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half
cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the
dialogue.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal pride and
influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave
utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid
production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention.
As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were
discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo; said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a
very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which,
if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is
uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles:
&ldquo;what do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know who you are, and what
you are?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know all about it,&rdquo; replied the girl, laughing
hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of
indifference.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, keep quiet,&rdquo; rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he
was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll quiet you
for a good long time to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a hasty
look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the blood came.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice one,&rdquo; added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a
contemptuous air, &ldquo;to take up the humane and gen&mdash;teel side! A
pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God Almighty help me, I am!&rdquo; cried the girl passionately;
&ldquo;and I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places
with them we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him
here. He&rsquo;s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that&rsquo;s bad, from this
night forth. Isn&rsquo;t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, Sikes,&rdquo; said the Jew appealing to him in a
remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive
to all that passed; &ldquo;we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Civil words!&rdquo; cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.
&ldquo;Civil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve &rsquo;em from me. I thieved
for you when I was a child not half as old as this!&rdquo; pointing to Oliver.
&ldquo;I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years
since. Don&rsquo;t you know it? Speak out! Don&rsquo;t you know it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification;
&ldquo;and, if you have, it&rsquo;s your living!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aye, it is!&rdquo; returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the
words in one continuous and vehement scream. &ldquo;It is my living; and the
cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you&rsquo;re the wretch that drove me
to them long ago, and that&rsquo;ll keep me there, day and night, day and
night, till I die!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall do you a mischief!&rdquo; interposed the Jew, goaded by these
reproaches; &ldquo;a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport of
passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks
of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right
moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; said Sikes, laying her down in a
corner. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s uncommon strong in the arms, when she&rsquo;s up in
this way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the
disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed
to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to
business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst of having to do with women,&rdquo; said the Jew,
replacing his club; &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re clever, and we can&rsquo;t get on,
in our line, without &rsquo;em. Charley, show Oliver to bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin,
had he?&rdquo; inquired Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which
Charley put the question.
</p>

<p>
Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the cleft
stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three
of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable
bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver
had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s; and
the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had
been the very first clue received, of his whereabout.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put off the smart ones,&rdquo; said Charley, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll give
&rsquo;em to Fagin to take care of. What fun it is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under
his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the
door behind him.
</p>

<p>
The noise of Charley&rsquo;s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who
opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other feminine
offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many people awake
under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed. But he
was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep.

<h2><a name="chap17"></a> CHAPTER XVII.<br />
OLIVER&rsquo;S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO
INJURE HIS REPUTATION </h2>

<p>
It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the
tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red
and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero sinks upon his straw bed,
weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but
unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song. We behold, with
throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her
virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the
one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to
the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to
the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny
chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places,
from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling
perpetually.
</p>

<p>
Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at
first sight. The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to
death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less
startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on,
which makes a vast difference. The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are
blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which,
presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as
outrageous and preposterous.
</p>

<p>
As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not
only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great
art of authorship: an author&rsquo;s skill in his craft being, by such critics,
chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his
characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present
one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. If so, let it be considered a delicate
intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in
which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are
good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited
to proceed upon such an expedition.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked with
portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was in the full
bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the
morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and
power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was higher
than usual. There was an abstraction in his eye, an elevation in his air, which
might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the
beadle&rsquo;s mind, too great for utterance.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who
spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along. He merely returned their
salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in his dignified pace,
until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with
parochial care.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drat that beadle!&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking
at the garden-gate. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t him at this time in the morning!
Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it <i>is</i> a
pleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight were
uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden-gate: and showed
him, with great attention and respect, into the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Mann,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself
into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and
slowly down into a chair; &ldquo;Mrs. Mann, ma&rsquo;am, good morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, and good morning to <i>you</i>, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Mann,
with many smiles; &ldquo;and hoping you find yourself well, sir!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So-so, Mrs. Mann,&rdquo; replied the beadle. &ldquo;A porochial life is
not a bed of roses, Mrs. Mann.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, that it isn&rsquo;t indeed, Mr. Bumble,&rdquo; rejoined the lady.
And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great
propriety, if they had heard it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A porochial life, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; continued Mr. Bumble, striking the
table with his cane, &ldquo;is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood;
but all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her hands with a
look of sympathy, and sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!&rdquo; said the beadle.
</p>

<p>
Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the
satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent smile by
looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Mann, I am going to London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lauk, Mr. Bumble!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To London, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; resumed the inflexible beadle, &ldquo;by
coach. I and two paupers, Mrs. Mann! A legal action is a coming on, about a
settlement; and the board has appointed me&mdash;me, Mrs. Mann&mdash;to dispose
to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.
</p>

<p>
And I very much question,&rdquo; added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,
&ldquo;whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong
box before they have done with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! you mustn&rsquo;t be too hard upon them, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann,
coaxingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble; &ldquo;and if the Clerkinwell Sessions
find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell
Sessions have only themselves to thank.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner
in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared
quite awed by them. At length she said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going by coach, sir? I thought it was always usual to send
them paupers in carts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re ill, Mrs. Mann,&rdquo; said the beadle.
&ldquo;We put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent
their taking cold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them
cheap,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;They are both in a very low state, and we
find it would come two pound cheaper to move &rsquo;em than to bury
&rsquo;em&mdash;that is, if we can throw &rsquo;em upon another parish, which I
think we shall be able to do, if they don&rsquo;t die upon the road to spite
us. Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the
cocked hat; and he became grave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are forgetting business, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the beadle;
&ldquo;here is your porochial stipend for the month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his pocket-book;
and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very much blotted, sir,&rdquo; said the farmer of infants;
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s formal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I
am very much obliged to you, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann&rsquo;s curtsey; and
inquired how the children were.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless their dear little hearts!&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann with emotion,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re as well as can be, the dears! Of course, except the two
that died last week. And little Dick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that boy no better?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mann shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child
that,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble angrily. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Mann. &ldquo;Here, you Dick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After some calling, Dick was discovered. Having had his face put under the
pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann&rsquo;s gown, he was led into the awful presence
of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.
</p>

<p>
The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large and
bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his
feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man.
</p>

<p>
Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s
glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear
the beadle&rsquo;s voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?&rdquo; said
Mrs. Mann.
</p>

<p>
The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, porochial Dick?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Bumble, with well-timed jocularity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; replied the child faintly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed
very much at Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s humour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want for nothing, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like&mdash;&rdquo; faltered the child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey-day!&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Mann, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re
going to say that you <i>do</i> want for something, now? Why, you little
wretch&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!&rdquo; said the beadle, raising his hand with a
show of authority. &ldquo;Like what, sir, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; faltered the child, &ldquo;if somebody that can
write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up
and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what does the boy mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the
earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression: accustomed
as he was to such things. &ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;to leave my dear love to
poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried
to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him. And
I should like to tell him,&rdquo; said the child pressing his small hands
together, and speaking with great fervour, &ldquo;that I was glad to die when I
was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my
little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would
be so much happier if we were both children there together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with indescribable
astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in
one story, Mrs. Mann. That out-dacious Oliver had demogalized them all!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have believed it, sir&rdquo; said Mrs Mann, holding up
her hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. &ldquo;I never see such a hardened
little wretch!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take him away, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble imperiously.
&ldquo;This must be stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn&rsquo;t my fault,
sir?&rdquo; said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They shall understand that, ma&rsquo;am; they shall be acquainted with
the true state of the case,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;There; take him
away, I can&rsquo;t bear the sight on him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar. Mr. Bumble
shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.
</p>

<p>
At six o&rsquo;clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his cocked hat
for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it:
took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the criminals whose
settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in
London.
</p>

<p>
He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in the
perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and
complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his
teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable; although
he had a great-coat on.
</p>

<p>
Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble sat
himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate
dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass of hot
gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the fire; and, with
sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of discontent and
complaining, composed himself to read the paper.
</p>

<p>
The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s eye rested, was the
following advertisement.
</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;FIVE GUINEAS REWARD
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on
Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since been
heard of. The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such
information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to
throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many
reasons, warmly interested.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then followed a full description of Oliver&rsquo;s dress, person,
appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at
full length.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three
several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to
Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of hot
gin-and-water, untasted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is Mr. Brownlow at home?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who
opened the door.
</p>

<p>
To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive reply of
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; where do you come from?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver&rsquo;s name, in explanation of his errand,
than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the
passage in a breathless state.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; said the old lady: &ldquo;I knew we should hear
of him. Poor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his heart! I
said so all along.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Having heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and
seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who was not quite so
susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a request that
Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did.
</p>

<p>
He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend
Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them. The latter gentleman at
once burst into the exclamation:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A beadle. A parish beadle, or I&rsquo;ll eat my head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t interrupt just now,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow.
&ldquo;Take a seat, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.
Grimwig&rsquo;s manner. Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an
uninterrupted view of the beadle&rsquo;s countenance; and said, with a little
impatience,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the
advertisement?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you ARE a beadle, are you not?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Grimwig.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, &ldquo;I
knew he was. A beadle all over!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and
resumed:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know where this poor boy is now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more than nobody,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what <i>do</i> you know of him?&rdquo; inquired the old gentleman.
&ldquo;Speak out, my friend, if you have anything to say. What <i>do</i> you
know of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know any good of him, do you?&rdquo; said Mr.
Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s
features.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with
portentous solemnity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s pursed-up countenance;
and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver, in as few words
as possible.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms; inclined his
head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments&rsquo; reflection,
commenced his story.
</p>

<p>
It would be tedious if given in the beadle&rsquo;s words: occupying, as it did,
some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that
Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents. That he had, from his
birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice.
That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making a
sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the
night-time from his master&rsquo;s house. In proof of his really being the
person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had
brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s
observations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I fear it is all too true,&rdquo; said the old gentleman sorrowfully,
after looking over the papers. &ldquo;This is not much for your intelligence;
but I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable
to the boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information
at an earlier period of the interview, he might have imparted a very different
colouring to his little history. It was too late to do it now, however; so he
shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much
disturbed by the beadle&rsquo;s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him
further.
</p>

<p>
At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Bedwin,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared;
&ldquo;that boy, Oliver, is an imposter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be, sir. It cannot be,&rdquo; said the old lady
energetically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you he is,&rdquo; retorted the old gentleman. &ldquo;What do you
mean by can&rsquo;t be? We have just heard a full account of him from his
birth; and he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never will believe it, sir,&rdquo; replied the old lady, firmly.
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying
story-books,&rdquo; growled Mr. Grimwig. &ldquo;I knew it all along. Why
didn&rsquo;t you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn&rsquo;t
had a fever, I suppose, eh? He was interesting, wasn&rsquo;t he? Interesting!
Bah!&rdquo; And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Bedwin,
indignantly. &ldquo;I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty
years; and people who can&rsquo;t say the same, shouldn&rsquo;t say anything
about them. That&rsquo;s my opinion!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor. As it extorted nothing
from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head, and smoothed
down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was stopped by Mr.
Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far
from feeling. &ldquo;Never let me hear the boy&rsquo;s name again. I rang to
tell you that. Never. Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room,
Mrs. Bedwin. Remember! I am in earnest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s that night.
</p>

<p>
Oliver&rsquo;s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it
was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have
broken outright.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap18"></a> CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS
</h2>

<p>
About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue
their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a
long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated
he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from
the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape
from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.
Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and
cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished with
hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in
his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who,
proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with
the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning.
Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented
with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the
young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the
victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true,
was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few select
friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the
discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner,
expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver
Twist to that unpleasant operation.
</p>

<p>
Little Oliver&rsquo;s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew&rsquo;s words,
and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them. That it was
possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when
they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and that deeply-laid
plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over-communicative
persons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions
than one, he thought by no means unlikely, when he recollected the general
nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed
to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind. As he glanced
timidly up, and met the Jew&rsquo;s searching look, he felt that his pale face
and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if he
kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they would be very
good friends yet. Then, taking his hat, and covering himself with an old
patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the room-door behind him.
</p>

<p>
And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many
subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and left
during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts. Which, never failing to
revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of
him, were sad indeed.
</p>

<p>
After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked; and he
was at liberty to wander about the house.
</p>

<p>
It was a very dirty place. The rooms upstairs had great high wooden
chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the
ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented
in various ways. From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time
ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had
perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now.
</p>

<p>
Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and
sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across
the floor, and run back terrified to their holes. With these exceptions, there
was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark,
and he was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in the corner
of the passage by the street-door, to be as near living people as he could; and
would remain there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys
returned.
</p>

<p>
In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which held
them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted,
stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more
gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows. There was a back-garret window
with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often
gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried
from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and
gable-ends. Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the
parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the
window of Oliver&rsquo;s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain
and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the
different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or
heard,&mdash;which he had as much chance of being, as if he had lived inside
the ball of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening, the
first-named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety
regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this was by no means
an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly
commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet, straightway.
</p>

<p>
Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces,
however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he
could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal. So he
at once expressed his readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger
sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps, he applied
himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as &ldquo;japanning his
trotter-cases.&rdquo; The phrase, rendered into plain English, signifieth,
cleaning his boots.
</p>

<p>
Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal
may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a
pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all
the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the
prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections; or whether
it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or
the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently
tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to
his general nature. He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance,
for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said,
half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a pity it is he isn&rsquo;t a prig!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Master Charles Bates; &ldquo;he don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s good for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates. They both
smoked, for some seconds, in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t even know what a prig is?&rdquo; said the
Dodger mournfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I know that,&rdquo; replied Oliver, looking up.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a the&mdash;; you&rsquo;re one, are you not?&rdquo; inquired
Oliver, checking himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied the Dodger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d scorn to be anything
else.&rdquo; Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this
sentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel
obliged by his saying anything to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; repeated the Dodger. &ldquo;So&rsquo;s Charley. So&rsquo;s
Fagin. So&rsquo;s Sikes. So&rsquo;s Nancy. So&rsquo;s Bet. So we all are, down
to the dog. And he&rsquo;s the downiest one of the lot!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the least given to peaching,&rdquo; added Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of
committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there
without wittles for a fortnight,&rdquo; said the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; observed Charley.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rum dog. Don&rsquo;t he look fierce at any strange cove
that laughs or sings when he&rsquo;s in company!&rdquo; pursued the Dodger.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing! And
don&rsquo;t he hate other dogs as ain&rsquo;t of his breed! Oh, no!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an out-and-out Christian,&rdquo; said Charley.
</p>

<p>
This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal&rsquo;s abilities, but it
was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known it;
for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be out-and-out
Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes&rsquo; dog, there exist strong and
singular points of resemblance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which
they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all
his proceedings. &ldquo;This hasn&rsquo;t go anything to do with young Green
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more it has,&rdquo; said Charley. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put
yourself under Fagin, Oliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And make your fortun&rsquo; out of hand?&rdquo; added the Dodger, with a
grin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I
mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the
forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,&rdquo; said Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; rejoined Oliver, timidly; &ldquo;I wish
they would let me go. I&mdash;I&mdash;would rather go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Fagin would <i>rather</i> not!&rdquo; rejoined Charley.
</p>

<p>
Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his
feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot-cleaning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; exclaimed the Dodger. &ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s your
spirit?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t you take any pride out of yourself? Would you go and
be dependent on your friends?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, blow that!&rdquo; said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk
handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s too mean; that is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said the Dodger, with an air of
haughty disgust.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can leave your friends, though,&rdquo; said Oliver with a half
smile; &ldquo;and let them be punished for what you did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, &ldquo;That
was all out of consideration for Fagin, &rsquo;cause the traps know that we
work together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn&rsquo;t made our
lucky; that was the move, wasn&rsquo;t it, Charley?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of
Oliver&rsquo;s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was inhaling
got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his
throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings
and halfpence. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a jolly life! What&rsquo;s the odds where it
comes from? Here, catch hold; there&rsquo;s plenty more where they were took
from. You won&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t you? Oh, you precious flat!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s naughty, ain&rsquo;t it, Oliver?&rdquo; inquired Charley
Bates. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come to be scragged, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that means,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something in this way, old feller,&rdquo; said Charly. As he said it,
Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the
air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through his
teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that
scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it means,&rdquo; said Charley. &ldquo;Look how he
stares, Jack!
</p>

<p>
I never did see such prime company as that &rsquo;ere boy; he&rsquo;ll be the
death of me, I know he will.&rdquo; Master Charley Bates, having laughed
heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been brought up bad,&rdquo; said the Dodger, surveying his
boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. &ldquo;Fagin will
make something of you, though, or you&rsquo;ll be the first he ever had that
turned out unprofitable. You&rsquo;d better begin at once; for you&rsquo;ll
come to the trade long before you think of it; and you&rsquo;re only losing
time, Oliver.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own:
which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing
description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led,
interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do,
would be to secure Fagin&rsquo;s favour without more delay, by the means which
they themselves had employed to gain it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,&rdquo; said the Dodger, as the
Jew was heard unlocking the door above, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t take fogels
and tickers&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of talking in that way?&rdquo; interposed Master
Bates; &ldquo;he don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t take pocket-handkechers and watches,&rdquo; said the
Dodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver&rsquo;s capacity,
&ldquo;some other cove will; so that the coves that lose &rsquo;em will be all
the worse, and you&rsquo;ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a
ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them&mdash;and
you&rsquo;ve just as good a right to them as they have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, to be sure!&rdquo; said the Jew, who had entered unseen by
Oliver. &ldquo;It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the
Dodger&rsquo;s word for it. Ha! ha! ha! He understands the catechism of his
trade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the
Dodger&rsquo;s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his
pupil&rsquo;s proficiency.
</p>

<p>
The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had returned
home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen
before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having
lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now made
his appearance.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered
eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards
that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of
a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements. He had
small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy
jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron. His wardrobe was, in truth,
rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his
&ldquo;time&rdquo; was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of
having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow
any attention on his private clothes. Mr. Chitling added, with strong marks of
irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal
unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against
the County. The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of
cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful. Mr. Chitling wound up
his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for
forty-two moral long hard-working days; and that he &ldquo;wished he might be
busted if he warn&rsquo;t as dry as a lime-basket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?&rdquo; inquired
the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous
look at Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A young friend of mine, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in luck, then,&rdquo; said the young man, with a meaning look
at Fagin. &ldquo;Never mind where I came from, young &rsquo;un; you&rsquo;ll
find your way there, soon enough, I&rsquo;ll bet a crown!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this sally, the boys laughed. After some more jokes on the same subject,
they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs
towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him, led the
conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers. These were,
the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger, the
amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew himself. At length
these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling
did the same: for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or
two. Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.
</p>

<p>
From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant
communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the Jew every
day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver&rsquo;s, Mr. Fagin best knew.
At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had
committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll and
curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was
amused in spite of all his better feelings.
</p>

<p>
In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils. Having prepared his mind,
by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of his own
sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was now slowly instilling into his soul
the poison which he hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever.

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap19"></a> CHAPTER XIX.<br />
IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON </h2>

<p>
It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great-coat tight
round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so as
completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den. He
paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having
listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps
were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he could.
</p>

<p>
The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of
Whitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and,
glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction
of the Spitalfields.
</p>

<p>
The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the
rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch. It
seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. As
he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and
doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in
the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in
search of some rich offal for a meal.
</p>

<p>
He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he reached
Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became involved
in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and
densely-populated quarter.
</p>

<p>
The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all
bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way.
He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one,
lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end. At the door of a house in
this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person
who opened it, he walked upstairs.
</p>

<p>
A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man&rsquo;s voice
demanded who was there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew looking in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring in your body then,&rdquo; said Sikes. &ldquo;Lie down, you stupid
brute! Don&rsquo;t you know the devil when he&rsquo;s got a great-coat
on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin&rsquo;s outer
garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair,
he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail as he went,
to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! Nancy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a
doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met, since
she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. All doubts upon the subject, if he had
any, were speedily removed by the young lady&rsquo;s behaviour. She took her
feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without
saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is cold, Nancy dear,&rdquo; said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny
hands over the fire. &ldquo;It seems to go right through one,&rdquo; added the
old man, touching his side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,&rdquo;
said Mr. Sikes. &ldquo;Give him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make
haste! It&rsquo;s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase
shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many:
which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with
several kinds of liquids. Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew
drink it off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,&rdquo; replied the Jew, putting down
the glass after just setting his lips to it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! You&rsquo;re afraid of our getting the better of you, are
you?&rdquo; inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the
remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling
it again for himself: which he did at once.
</p>

<p>
The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second
glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a restless
and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly furnished apartment,
with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its
occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles
displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner,
and a &ldquo;life-preserver&rdquo; that hung over the chimney-piece.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Sikes, smacking his lips. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m
ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For business?&rdquo; inquired the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For business,&rdquo; replied Sikes; &ldquo;so say what you&rsquo;ve got
to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?&rdquo; said the Jew, drawing his chair
forward, and speaking in a very low voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Wot about it?&rdquo; inquired Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;He knows
what I mean, Nancy; don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; sneered Mr. Sikes. &ldquo;Or he won&rsquo;t,
and that&rsquo;s the same thing. Speak out, and call things by their right
names; don&rsquo;t sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints,
as if you warn&rsquo;t the very first that thought about the robbery. Wot
d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, Bill, hush!&rdquo; said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop
this burst of indignation; &ldquo;somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody will
hear us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em hear!&rdquo; said Sikes; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
But as Mr. Sikes <i>did</i> care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he
said the words, and grew calmer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; said the Jew, coaxingly. &ldquo;It was only my
caution, nothing more. Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to
be done, Bill, eh? When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such
plate!&rdquo; said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a
rapture of anticipation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Sikes coldly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to be done at all!&rdquo; echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; rejoined Sikes. &ldquo;At least it can&rsquo;t be
a put-up job, as we expected.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it hasn&rsquo;t been properly gone about,&rdquo; said the Jew,
turning pale with anger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I will tell you,&rdquo; retorted Sikes. &ldquo;Who are you
that&rsquo;s not to be told? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging
about the place for a fortnight, and he can&rsquo;t get one of the servants in
line.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, Bill,&rdquo; said the Jew: softening as the
other grew heated: &ldquo;that neither of the two men in the house can be got
over?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I do mean to tell you so,&rdquo; replied Sikes. &ldquo;The old lady
has had &rsquo;em these twenty years; and if you were to give &rsquo;em five
hundred pound, they wouldn&rsquo;t be in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But do you mean to say, my dear,&rdquo; remonstrated the Jew,
&ldquo;that the women can&rsquo;t be got over?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; replied Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not by flash Toby Crackit?&rdquo; said the Jew incredulously.
&ldquo;Think what women are, Bill,&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,&rdquo; replied Sikes. &ldquo;He says
he&rsquo;s worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time
he&rsquo;s been loitering down there, and it&rsquo;s all of no use.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my
dear,&rdquo; said the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So he did,&rdquo; rejoined Sikes, &ldquo;and they warn&rsquo;t of no
more use than the other plant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew looked blank at this information. After ruminating for some minutes
with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said, with a deep
sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared the game was up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our
hearts upon it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes. &ldquo;Worse luck!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with
his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal. Sikes
eyed him furtively from time to time. Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating
the housebreaker, sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been
deaf to all that passed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fagin,&rdquo; said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that
prevailed; &ldquo;is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it&rsquo;s safely done
from the outside?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it a bargain?&rdquo; inquired Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my dear, yes,&rdquo; rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and
every muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had
awakened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew&rsquo;s hand, with some
disdain, &ldquo;let it come off as soon as you like. Toby and me were over the
garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters.
The crib&rsquo;s barred up at night like a jail; but there&rsquo;s one part we
can crack, safe and softly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which is that, Bill?&rdquo; asked the Jew eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; whispered Sikes, &ldquo;as you cross the lawn&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost
starting out of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving
her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Never mind which part it is. You can&rsquo;t do it without me, I
know; but it&rsquo;s best to be on the safe side when one deals with
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As you like, my dear, as you like&rdquo; replied the Jew. &ldquo;Is
there no help wanted, but yours and Toby&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Sikes. &ldquo;Cept a centre-bit and a boy. The first
we&rsquo;ve both got; the second you must find us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A boy!&rdquo; exclaimed the Jew. &ldquo;Oh! then it&rsquo;s a panel,
eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind wot it is!&rdquo; replied Sikes. &ldquo;I want a boy, and he
musn&rsquo;t be a big &rsquo;un. Lord!&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, reflectively,
&ldquo;if I&rsquo;d only got that young boy of Ned, the
chimbley-sweeper&rsquo;s! He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the
job. But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society
comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money, teaches
him to read and write, and in time makes a &rsquo;prentice of him. And so they
go on,&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, his wrath rising with the recollection of his
wrongs, &ldquo;so they go on; and, if they&rsquo;d got money enough (which
it&rsquo;s a Providence they haven&rsquo;t,) we shouldn&rsquo;t have half a
dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more we should,&rdquo; acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering
during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. &ldquo;Bill!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; inquired Sikes.
</p>

<p>
The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and
intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room. Sikes
shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the precaution
unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him
a jug of beer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want any beer,&rdquo; said Nancy, folding her arms, and
retaining her seat very composedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you I do!&rdquo; replied Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; rejoined the girl coolly, &ldquo;Go on, Fagin. I know
what he&rsquo;s going to say, Bill; he needn&rsquo;t mind me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew still hesitated. Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?&rdquo; he asked
at length. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known her long enough to trust her, or the
Devil&rsquo;s in it. She ain&rsquo;t one to blab. Are you Nancy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> should think not!&rdquo; replied the young lady: drawing her
chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, my dear, I know you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said the Jew;
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo; and again the old man paused.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But wot?&rdquo; inquired Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know whether she mightn&rsquo;t p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps be
out of sorts, you know, my dear, as she was the other night,&rdquo; replied the
Jew.
</p>

<p>
At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a glass
of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst into sundry
exclamations of &ldquo;Keep the game a-going!&rdquo; &ldquo;Never say
die!&rdquo; and the like. These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both
gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his
seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Fagin,&rdquo; said Nancy with a laugh. &ldquo;Tell Bill at once,
about Oliver!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! you&rsquo;re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever
saw!&rdquo; said the Jew, patting her on the neck. &ldquo;It <i>was</i> about
Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; demanded Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the boy for you, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew in a hoarse
whisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He!&rdquo; exclaimed Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have him, Bill!&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;I would, if I was in your
place. He mayn&rsquo;t be so much up, as any of the others; but that&rsquo;s
not what you want, if he&rsquo;s only to open a door for you. Depend upon it
he&rsquo;s a safe one, Bill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know he is,&rdquo; rejoined Fagin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been in good
training these last few weeks, and it&rsquo;s time he began to work for his
bread. Besides, the others are all too big.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he is just the size I want,&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,&rdquo; interposed the
Jew; &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t help himself. That is, if you frighten him
enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Frighten him!&rdquo; echoed Sikes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be no sham
frightening, mind you. If there&rsquo;s anything queer about him when we once
get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound. You won&rsquo;t see him
alive again, Fagin. Think of that, before you send him. Mark my words!&rdquo;
said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of it all,&rdquo; said the Jew with energy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had my eye upon him, my dears,
close&mdash;close. Once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind
with the idea that he has been a thief; and he&rsquo;s ours! Ours for his life.
Oho! It couldn&rsquo;t have come about better!&rdquo; The old man crossed his
arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap,
literally hugged himself for joy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ours!&rdquo; said Sikes. &ldquo;Yours, you mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps I do, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle.
&ldquo;Mine, if you like, Bill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And wot,&rdquo; said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend,
&ldquo;wot makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you
know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you
might pick and choose from?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re of no use to me, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew,
with some confusion, &ldquo;not worth the taking. Their looks convict &rsquo;em
when they get into trouble, and I lose &rsquo;em all. With this boy, properly
managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn&rsquo;t with twenty of them.
Besides,&rdquo; said the Jew, recovering his self-possession, &ldquo;he has us
now if he could only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat
with us. Never mind how he came there; it&rsquo;s quite enough for my power
over him that he was in a robbery; that&rsquo;s all I want. Now, how much
better this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the
way&mdash;which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When is it to be done?&rdquo; asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent
exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he
received Fagin&rsquo;s affectation of humanity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, to be sure,&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;when is it to be done,
Bill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,&rdquo; rejoined Sikes in
a surly voice, &ldquo;if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no moon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?&rdquo; asked
the Jew.
</p>

<p>
Sikes nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And about&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, ah, it&rsquo;s all planned,&rdquo; rejoined Sikes, interrupting him.
&ldquo;Never mind particulars. You&rsquo;d better bring the boy here to-morrow
night. I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak. Then you hold your
tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ll have
to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided
that Nancy should repair to the Jew&rsquo;s next evening when the night had set
in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing, that, if he
evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more willing to accompany
the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else. It
was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes of the
contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of
Mr. William Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he
thought fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or
evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render
the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by Mr. Sikes on
his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all
important particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit.
</p>

<p>
These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious
rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling forth, at the
same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with wild execrations. At
length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box
of housebreaking tools: which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for
the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements
it contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell
over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-night, Nancy,&rdquo; said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no flinching
about the girl. She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit
himself could be.
</p>

<p>
The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate
form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped downstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Always the way!&rdquo; muttered the Jew to himself as he turned
homeward. &ldquo;The worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves
to call up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never
lasts. Ha! ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his way,
through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger was sitting up,
impatiently awaiting his return.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him,&rdquo; was his first remark as
they descended the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hours ago,&rdquo; replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. &ldquo;Here
he is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with
anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like
death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears
when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an
instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to
breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said the Jew, turning softly away. &ldquo;To-morrow.
To-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap20"></a> CHAPTER XX.<br />
WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES </h2>

<p>
When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find that a
new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his bedside; and
that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was pleased with the
discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release; but such
thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast along with
the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which increased his alarm, that he
was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To&mdash;to&mdash;stop there, sir?&rdquo; asked Oliver, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, my dear. Not to stop there,&rdquo; replied the Jew. &ldquo;We
shouldn&rsquo;t like to lose you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come
back to us again. Ha! ha! ha! We won&rsquo;t be so cruel as to send you away,
my dear. Oh no, no!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked
round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he
would still be very glad to get away if he could.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, &ldquo;you
want to know what you&rsquo;re going to Bill&rsquo;s for&mdash;-eh, my
dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been reading his
thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, do you think?&rdquo; inquired Fagin, parrying the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance
from a close perusal of the boy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Wait till Bill tells you,
then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver&rsquo;s not expressing any greater
curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very
anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin&rsquo;s
looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then. He
had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly and silent till
night: when he prepared to go abroad.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may burn a candle,&rdquo; said the Jew, putting one upon the table.
&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.
Good-night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; replied Oliver, softly.
</p>

<p>
The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went.
Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.
</p>

<p>
Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light it. He
did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was
gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of
the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take heed, Oliver! take heed!&rdquo; said the old man, shaking his right
hand before him in a warning manner. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rough man, and thinks
nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do
what he bids you. Mind!&rdquo; Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he
suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and,
nodding his head, left the room.
</p>

<p>
Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and
pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. The more he
thought of the Jew&rsquo;s admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its
real purpose and meaning.
</p>

<p>
He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes, which
would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin; and after
meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been selected to perform some
ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until another boy, better suited
for his purpose could be engaged. He was too well accustomed to suffering, and
had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very
severely. He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy
sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with
him, began to read.
</p>

<p>
He turned over the leaves. Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage
which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume. It was a
history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled
and thumbed with use. Here, he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run
cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of
bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep
them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many
years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they
had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony. Here,
too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been tempted
(so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful
bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think of. The
terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to
turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if
they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.
</p>

<p>
In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him. Then,
falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds; and
rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so
fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low
and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that
if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the
love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and
deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt.
</p>

<p>
He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in his
hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a
figure standing by the door. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me. Only me,&rdquo; replied a tremulous voice.
</p>

<p>
Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door. It was
Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put down the light,&rdquo; said the girl, turning away her head.
&ldquo;It hurts my eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill. The
girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung her
hands; but made no reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God forgive me!&rdquo; she cried after a while, &ldquo;I never thought
of this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has anything happened?&rdquo; asked Oliver. &ldquo;Can I help you? I
will if I can. I will, indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling
sound, gasped for breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; cried Oliver, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and,
suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold.
</p>

<p>
Oliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a
little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked
round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what comes over me sometimes,&rdquo; said she,
affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s this damp
dirty room, I think. Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I to go with you?&rdquo; asked Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. I have come from Bill,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;You are to
go with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Oliver, recoiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them
again, the moment they encountered the boy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Oh! For no
harm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Oliver: who had watched her
closely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh.
&ldquo;For no good, then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl&rsquo;s better feelings,
and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless
state. But, then, the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven
o&rsquo;clock; and that many people were still in the streets: of whom surely
some might be found to give credence to his tale. As the reflection occured to
him, he stepped forward: and said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready.
</p>

<p>
Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his companion.
She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look of intelligence
which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door
as she looked cautiously round. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help yourself. I have
tried hard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If
ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with great
surprise. She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and
agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do
now,&rdquo; continued the girl aloud; &ldquo;for those who would have fetched
you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me. I have promised for
your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to yourself
and me too, and perhaps be my death. See here! I have borne all this for you
already, as true as God sees me show it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and
continued, with great rapidity:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember this! And don&rsquo;t let me suffer more for you, just now. If
I could help you, I would; but I have not the power. They don&rsquo;t mean to
harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! Every word
from you is a blow for me. Give me your hand. Make haste! Your hand!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out
the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was opened, quickly, by
some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had
passed out. A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which
she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and
drew the curtains close. The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse
into full speed, without the delay of an instant.
</p>

<p>
The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his
ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted. All was so quick and
hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or how he came
there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew&rsquo;s steps
had been directed on the previous evening.
</p>

<p>
For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and
a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl&rsquo;s voice was in his ear,
beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the
heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he was already
in the house, and the door was shut.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time.
&ldquo;Bill!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a
candle. &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s the time of day. Come on!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty welcome,
from a person of Mr. Sikes&rsquo; temperament. Nancy, appearing much gratified
thereby, saluted him cordially.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bull&rsquo;s-eye&rsquo;s gone home with Tom,&rdquo; observed Sikes, as
he lighted them up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have been in the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; rejoined Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got the kid,&rdquo; said Sikes when they had all reached
the room: closing the door as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, here he is,&rdquo; replied Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he come quiet?&rdquo; inquired Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like a lamb,&rdquo; rejoined Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver;
&ldquo;for the sake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for
it. Come here, young &rsquo;un; and let me read you a lectur&rsquo;, which is
as well got over at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver&rsquo;s cap and
threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down
by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, first: do you know wot this is?&rdquo; inquired Sikes, taking up a
pocket-pistol which lay on the table.
</p>

<p>
Oliver replied in the affirmative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, look here,&rdquo; continued Sikes. &ldquo;This is powder;
that &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for
waddin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and Mr.
Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and deliberation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s loaded,&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see it is, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the robber, grasping Oliver&rsquo;s wrist, and putting
the barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy
could not repress a start; &ldquo;if you speak a word when you&rsquo;re out
o&rsquo;doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your
head without notice. So, if you <i>do</i> make up your mind to speak without
leave, say your prayers first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its
effect, Mr. Sikes continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As near as I know, there isn&rsquo;t anybody as would be asking very
partickler arter you, if you <i>was</i> disposed of; so I needn&rsquo;t take
this devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn&rsquo;t for
your own good. D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The short and the long of what you mean,&rdquo; said Nancy: speaking
very emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious
attention to her words: &ldquo;is, that if you&rsquo;re crossed by him in this
job you have on hand, you&rsquo;ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards,
by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for it,
as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every month of
your life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; &ldquo;women
can always put things in fewest words.&mdash;Except when it&rsquo;s blowing up;
and then they lengthens it out. And now that he&rsquo;s thoroughly up to it,
let&rsquo;s have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a
few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of
sheep&rsquo;s heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the
part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of
&ldquo;jemmies&rdquo; being a can name, common to them, and also to an
ingenious implement much used in his profession. Indeed, the worthy gentleman,
stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in
great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that
he humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough
calculation, more than four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.
</p>

<p>
Supper being ended&mdash;it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great
appetite for it&mdash;Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and
water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many imprecations in
case of failure, to call him at five precisely. Oliver stretched himself in his
clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and
the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the
appointed time.
</p>

<p>
For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy might
seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the girl sat
brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim the light.
Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was thrusting
various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which hung over the back
of a chair. Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast. It was not yet
daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside. A
sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the sky looked black
and cloudy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then!&rdquo; growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; &ldquo;half-past
five! Look sharp, or you&rsquo;ll get no breakfast; for it&rsquo;s late as it
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast, he
replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite ready.
</p>

<p>
Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie round his
throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders. Thus
attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him with a
menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his
great-coat, clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy,
led him away.
</p>

<p>
Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of
meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in front of the
fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap21"></a> CHAPTER XXI.<br />
THE EXPEDITION </h2>

<p>
It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining
hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night had been very wet:
large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were
overflowing. There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it
rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the sombre light only
serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without shedding any
warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops, and dreary streets. There
appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the
houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were
noiseless and empty.
</p>

<p>
By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had fairly
begun to break. Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country
waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a stage-coach,
covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he passed, an
admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the wrong side of
the road, had endangered his arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute
after his time. The public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already
open. By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people
were met with. Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work;
then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads; donkey-carts laden with
vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole carcasses of meat;
milk-women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with
various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town. As they approached the
City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets
between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and
bustle. It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and
the busy morning of half the London population had begun.
</p>

<p>
Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr.
Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane,
and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant
sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.
</p>

<p>
It was market-morning. The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with filth
and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the
cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops,
hung heavily above. All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many
temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with
sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen,
three or four deep. Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves,
idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the
whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen,
the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of
hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells
and roar of voices, that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing,
driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that
resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid,
and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the
throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded
the senses.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the thickest of
the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and
sounds, which so astonished the boy. He nodded, twice or thrice, to a passing
friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram, pressed
steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way
through Hosier Lane into Holborn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, young &rsquo;un!&rdquo; said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Church, &ldquo;hard upon seven! you must step out. Come,
don&rsquo;t lag behind already, Lazy-legs!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion&rsquo;s
wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and
a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as he could.
</p>

<p>
They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park corner,
and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his pace, until an
empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up. Seeing
&ldquo;Hounslow&rdquo; written on it, he asked the driver with as much civility
as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jump up,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Is that your boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s my boy,&rdquo; replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver,
and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your father walks rather too quick for you, don&rsquo;t he, my
man?&rdquo; inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; replied Sikes, interposing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
used to it. Here, take hold of my hand, Ned. In with you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver, pointing
to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself.
</p>

<p>
As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where
his companion meant to take him. Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge,
Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had
only just begun their journey. At length, they came to a public-house called
the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run
off. And here, the cart stopped.
</p>

<p>
Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all the
while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look upon him, and
rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye, boy,&rdquo; said the man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sulky,&rdquo; replied Sikes, giving him a shake;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s sulky. A young dog! Don&rsquo;t mind him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; rejoined the other, getting into his cart.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day, after all.&rdquo; And he drove away.
</p>

<p>
Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he might look
about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his journey.
</p>

<p>
They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and then,
taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens
and gentlemen&rsquo;s houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing
but a little beer, until they reached a town. Here against the wall of a house,
Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters, &ldquo;Hampton.&rdquo; They
lingered about, in the fields, for some hours. At length they came back into
the town; and, turning into an old public-house with a defaced sign-board,
ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire.
</p>

<p>
The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the middle of
the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire; on which were
seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking and smoking. They took no
notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little
notice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves, without
being much troubled by their company.
</p>

<p>
They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr. Sikes
indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel quite
certain they were not going any further. Being much tired with the walk, and
getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by
fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing himself
sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in close
fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of ale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?&rdquo; inquired
Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied the man, who seemed a little the
worse&mdash;or better, as the case might be&mdash;for drinking; &ldquo;and not
slow about it neither. My horse hasn&rsquo;t got a load behind him going back,
as he had coming up in the mornin&rsquo;; and he won&rsquo;t be long a-doing of
it. Here&rsquo;s luck to him. Ecod! he&rsquo;s a good &rsquo;un!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?&rdquo; demanded
Sikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going directly, I can,&rdquo; replied the man, looking
out of the pot. &ldquo;Are you going to Halliford?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Going on to Shepperton,&rdquo; replied Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your man, as far as I go,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Is
all paid, Becky?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, the other gentleman&rsquo;s paid,&rdquo; replied the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; said the man, with tipsy gravity; &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t
do, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; rejoined Sikes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a-going to
accommodate us, and wot&rsquo;s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so,
in return?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face; having
done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real good fellow.
To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had been sober, there
would have been strong reason to suppose he was.
</p>

<p>
After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company good-night,
and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and
lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see the party start.
</p>

<p>
The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing outside:
ready harnessed to the cart. Oliver and Sikes got in without any further
ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two
&ldquo;to bear him up,&rdquo; and to defy the hostler and the world to produce
his equal, mounted also. Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his head;
and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant use of it: tossing it
into the air with great disdain, and running into the parlour windows over the
way; after performing those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on
his hind-legs, he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right
gallantly.
</p>

<p>
The night was very dark. A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground
about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was piercing cold, too; all
was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy;
and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation. Oliver sat huddled
together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and
figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and
fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.
</p>

<p>
As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. There was a light in the
ferry-house window opposite: which streamed across the road, and threw into
more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it. There was a dull
sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred
gently in the night wind. It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the
dead.
</p>

<p>
Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road. Two or
three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took Oliver by the
hand, and they once again walked on.
</p>

<p>
They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but
still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold
open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great
distance. On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below
them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge.
</p>

<p>
Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned
suddenly down a bank upon the left.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The water!&rdquo; thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. &ldquo;He has
brought me to this lonely place to murder me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his
young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house: all ruinous
and decayed. There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and
one story above; but no light was visible. The house was dark, dismantled: and
the all appearance, uninhabited.
</p>

<p>
Sikes, with Oliver&rsquo;s hand still in his, softly approached the low porch,
and raised the latch. The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in
together.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap22"></a> CHAPTER XXII.<br />
THE BURGLARY </h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in
the passage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make such a row,&rdquo; said Sikes, bolting the door.
&ldquo;Show a glim, Toby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha! my pal!&rdquo; cried the same voice. &ldquo;A glim, Barney, a glim!
Show the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the person
he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body,
falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man
between sleep and awake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; cried the same voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bill
Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping
there, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you
any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you
thoroughly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the room,
as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand;
first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same individual who has been
heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his
nose, and officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bister Sikes!&rdquo; exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy;
&ldquo;cub id, sir; cub id.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here! you get on first,&rdquo; said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of
him. &ldquo;Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and they
entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table,
and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much higher than his head, a man
was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe. He was dressed in a
smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange
neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches. Mr.
Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his
head or face; but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long
corkscrew curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers,
ornamented with large common rings. He was a trifle above the middle size, and
apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted
from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he contemplated, in their
elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bill, my boy!&rdquo; said this figure, turning his head towards the
door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you&rsquo;d given
it up: in which case I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes rested on
Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded
who that was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy. Only the boy!&rdquo; replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the
fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wud of Bister Fagid&rsquo;s lads,&rdquo; exclaimed Barney, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fagin&rsquo;s, eh!&rdquo; exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. &ldquo;Wot
an inwalable boy that&rsquo;ll make, for the old ladies&rsquo; pockets in
chapels! His mug is a fortin&rsquo; to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&mdash;there&rsquo;s enough of that,&rdquo; interposed Sikes,
impatiently; and stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words
in his ear: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a
long stare of astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
give us something to eat and drink while we&rsquo;re waiting, you&rsquo;ll put
some heart in us; or in me, at all events. Sit down by the fire, younker, and
rest yourself; for you&rsquo;ll have to go out with us again to-night, though
not very far off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the
fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing where he was,
or what was passing around him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food,
and a bottle upon the table, &ldquo;Success to the crack!&rdquo; He rose to
honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner,
advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents.
Mr. Sikes did the same.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A drain for the boy,&rdquo; said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass.
&ldquo;Down with it, innocence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man&rsquo;s
face; &ldquo;indeed, I&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Down with it!&rdquo; echoed Toby. &ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s good for you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He had better!&rdquo; said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket.
&ldquo;Burn my body, if he isn&rsquo;t more trouble than a whole family of
Dodgers. Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed
the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing:
which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the surly
Mr. Sikes.
</p>

<p>
This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat nothing
but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two men laid
themselves down on chairs for a short nap. Oliver retained his stool by the
fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor: close
outside the fender.
</p>

<p>
They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but Barney,
who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell into a heavy
doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the
dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day:
when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past
one.
</p>

<p>
In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged
in busy preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in
large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats; Barney, opening a cupboard,
brought forth several articles, which he hastily crammed into the pockets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Barkers for me, Barney,&rdquo; said Toby Crackit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols.
&ldquo;You loaded them yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; replied Toby, stowing them away. &ldquo;The
persuaders?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies&mdash;nothing forgotten?&rdquo;
inquired Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his
coat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; rejoined his companion. &ldquo;Bring them bits of
timber, Barney. That&rsquo;s the time of day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney&rsquo;s hands, who, having
delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver&rsquo;s cape.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; said Sikes, holding out his hand.
</p>

<p>
Oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and
the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand mechanically into that
which Sikes extended for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take his other hand, Toby,&rdquo; said Sikes. &ldquo;Look out,
Barney.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet. The two
robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having made all fast,
rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.
</p>

<p>
It was now intensely dark. The fog was much heavier than it had been in the
early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain
fell, Oliver&rsquo;s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the
house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about.
They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had seen
before. They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly,
they soon arrived at Chertsey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Slap through the town,&rdquo; whispered Sikes; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be
nobody in the way, to-night, to see us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town,
which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at intervals
from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke
the silence of the night. But there was nobody abroad. They had cleared the
town, as the church-bell struck two.
</p>

<p>
Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After walking
about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a
wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath,
climbed in a twinkling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy next,&rdquo; said Toby. &ldquo;Hoist him up; I&rsquo;ll catch
hold of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and
in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side.
Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously towards the house.
</p>

<p>
And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw
that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the
expedition. He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued
exclamation of horror. A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon
his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the
pistol from his pocket; &ldquo;Get up, or I&rsquo;ll strew your brains upon the
grass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! for God&rsquo;s sake let me go!&rdquo; cried Oliver; &ldquo;let me
run away and die in the fields. I will never come near London; never, never!
Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal. For the love of all the
bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the
pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the
boy&rsquo;s mouth, and dragged him to the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried the man; &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t answer here. Say
another word, and I&rsquo;ll do your business myself with a crack on the head.
That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, Bill,
wrench the shutter open. He&rsquo;s game enough now, I&rsquo;ll engage.
I&rsquo;ve seen older hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two,
on a cold night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin&rsquo;s head for sending
Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise.
After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he had
referred, swung open on its hinges.
</p>

<p>
It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at
the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing-place, at
the end of the passage. The aperture was so small, that the inmates had
probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was
large enough to admit a boy of Oliver&rsquo;s size, nevertheless. A very brief
exercise of Mr. Sike&rsquo;s art, sufficed to overcome the fastening of the
lattice; and it soon stood wide open also.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now listen, you young limb,&rdquo; whispered Sikes, drawing a dark
lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver&rsquo;s face;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a going to put you through there. Take this light; go softly
up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door;
unfasten it, and let us in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bolt at the top, you won&rsquo;t be able to
reach,&rdquo; interposed Toby. &ldquo;Stand upon one of the hall chairs. There
are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on
&rsquo;em: which is the old lady&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Keep quiet, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; replied Sikes, with a threatening
look. &ldquo;The room-door is open, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wide,&rdquo; replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself.
&ldquo;The game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so
that the dog, who&rsquo;s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage
when he feels wakeful. Ha! ha! Barney &rsquo;ticed him away to-night. So
neat!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without
noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to work. Toby
complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by
planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and
his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back. This was no sooner
done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with
his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on
the floor inside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take this lantern,&rdquo; said Sikes, looking into the room. &ldquo;You
see the stairs afore you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Sikes, pointing to
the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that
he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would fall dead
that instant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done in a minute,&rdquo; said Sikes, in the same low whisper.
&ldquo;Directly I leave go of you, do your work. Hark!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; whispered the other man.
</p>

<p>
They listened intently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver.
&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly resolved
that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one effort to dart
upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. Filled with this idea, he
advanced at once, but stealthily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; suddenly cried Sikes aloud. &ldquo;Back! back!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud
cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to
advance or fly.
</p>

<p>
The cry was repeated&mdash;a light appeared&mdash;a vision of two terrified
half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes&mdash;a
flash&mdash;a loud noise&mdash;a smoke&mdash;a crash somewhere, but where he
knew not,&mdash;and he staggered back.
</p>

<p>
Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the
collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own pistol after the
men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Clasp your arm tighter,&rdquo; said Sikes, as he drew him through the
window. &ldquo;Give me a shawl here. They&rsquo;ve hit him. Quick! How the boy
bleeds!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire-arms, and
the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a
rapid pace. And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold
deadly feeling crept over the boy&rsquo;s heart; and he saw or heard no more.

<h2><a name="chap23"></a> CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND
A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS </h2>

<p>
The night was bitter cold. The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick
crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were
affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which, as if expending increased
fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling
it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air. Bleak, dark, and piercing
cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire
and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay
him down and die. Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare
streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may, can
hardly open them in a more bitter world.
</p>

<p>
Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of
the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the
birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own
little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round
table: on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all
necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy. In fact,
Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea. As she glanced from
the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was
singing a small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently
increased,&mdash;so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and
looking reflectively at the fire; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we have all on us a
great deal to be grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental blindness of
those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon (private
property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded to
make the tea.
</p>

<p>
How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! The black
teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was
moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drat the pot!&rdquo; said the worthy matron, setting it down very
hastily on the hob; &ldquo;a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of
cups! What use is it of, to anybody! Except,&rdquo; said Mrs. Corney, pausing,
&ldquo;except to a poor desolate creature like me. Oh dear!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more resting her
elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate. The small teapot, and the
single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney (who had
not been dead more than five-and-twenty years); and she was overpowered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall never get another!&rdquo; said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; &ldquo;I
shall never get another&mdash;like him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is uncertain.
It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke; and
took it up afterwards. She had just tasted her first cup, when she was
disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, come in with you!&rdquo; said Mrs. Corney, sharply. &ldquo;Some of
the old women dying, I suppose. They always die when I&rsquo;m at meals.
Don&rsquo;t stand there, letting the cold air in, don&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s
amiss now, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, ma&rsquo;am, nothing,&rdquo; replied a man&rsquo;s voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, &ldquo;is
that Mr. Bumble?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At your service, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, who had been
stopping outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat;
and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a
bundle in the other. &ldquo;Shall I shut the door, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety in
holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors. Mr. Bumble taking
advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it without
permission.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,&rdquo; said the matron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hard, indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the beadle.
&ldquo;Anti-porochial weather this, ma&rsquo;am. We have given away, Mrs.
Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and
a half, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not
contented.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. When would they be, Mr. Bumble?&rdquo; said the matron,
sipping her tea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When, indeed, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;Why
here&rsquo;s one man that, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a
quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight. Is he grateful,
ma&rsquo;am? Is he grateful? Not a copper farthing&rsquo;s worth of it! What
does he do, ma&rsquo;am, but ask for a few coals; if it&rsquo;s only a pocket
handkerchief full, he says! Coals! What would he do with coals? Toast his
cheese with &rsquo;em and then come back for more. That&rsquo;s the way with
these people, ma&rsquo;am; give &rsquo;em a apron full of coals to-day, and
they&rsquo;ll come back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as
alabaster.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile; and
the beadle went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, &ldquo;see anything like the pitch
it&rsquo;s got to. The day afore yesterday, a man&mdash;you have been a married
woman, ma&rsquo;am, and I may mention it to you&mdash;a man, with hardly a rag
upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our
overseer&rsquo;s door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he
must be relieved, Mrs. Corney. As he wouldn&rsquo;t go away, and shocked the
company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a
pint of oatmeal. &lsquo;My heart!&rsquo; says the ungrateful villain,
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s the use of <i>this</i> to me? You might as well give me a
pair of iron spectacles!&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; says our overseer,
taking &rsquo;em away again, &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t get anything else
here.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll die in the streets!&rsquo; says the
vagrant. &lsquo;Oh no, you won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says our overseer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; interposed the matron. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Bumble?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; rejoined the beadle, &ldquo;he went away; and
he <i>did</i> die in the streets. There&rsquo;s a obstinate pauper for
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It beats anything I could have believed,&rdquo; observed the matron
emphatically. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think out-of-door relief a very bad
thing, any way, Mr. Bumble? You&rsquo;re a gentleman of experience, and ought
to know. Come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Corney,&rdquo; said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are
conscious of superior information, &ldquo;out-of-door relief, properly managed:
properly managed, ma&rsquo;am: is the porochial safeguard. The great principle
of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don&rsquo;t
want; and then they get tired of coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Corney. &ldquo;Well, that is a good one,
too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Betwixt you and me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; returned Mr. Bumble,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the great principle; and that&rsquo;s the reason why, if
you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you&rsquo;ll
always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.
That&rsquo;s the rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But,
however,&rdquo; said the beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, &ldquo;these
are official secrets, ma&rsquo;am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say,
among the porochial officers, such as ourselves. This is the port wine,
ma&rsquo;am, that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine
port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no
sediment!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test its
excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers; folded
the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully in his
pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,&rdquo; said the matron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It blows, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his
coat-collar, &ldquo;enough to cut one&rsquo;s ears off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving
towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her
good-night, bashfully inquired whether&mdash;whether he wouldn&rsquo;t take a
cup of tea?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat and stick
upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. As he slowly seated
himself, he looked at the lady. She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot. Mr.
Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she sat
down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she
coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea. Again Mr. Bumble
coughed&mdash;louder this time than he had coughed yet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sweet? Mr. Bumble?&rdquo; inquired the matron, taking up the
sugar-basin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very sweet, indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble. He fixed his
eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr.
Bumble was that beadle at that moment.
</p>

<p>
The tea was made, and handed in silence. Mr. Bumble, having spread a
handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour
of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements, occasionally,
by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious effect upon his
appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations in
the tea and toast department.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have a cat, ma&rsquo;am, I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, glancing at
one who, in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; &ldquo;and
kittens too, I declare!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; replied
the matron. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re <i>so</i> happy, <i>so</i> frolicsome, and
<i>so</i> cheerful, that they are quite companions for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very nice animals, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly;
&ldquo;so very domestic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; &ldquo;so fond of
their home too, that it&rsquo;s quite a pleasure, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Corney, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking
the time with his teaspoon, &ldquo;I mean to say this, ma&rsquo;am; that any
cat, or kitten, that could live with you, ma&rsquo;am, and <i>not</i> be fond
of its home, must be a ass, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bumble!&rdquo; remonstrated Mrs. Corney.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use disguising facts, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which
made him doubly impressive; &ldquo;I would drown it myself, with
pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a cruel man,&rdquo; said the matron vivaciously, as
she held out her hand for the beadle&rsquo;s cup; &ldquo;and a very
hard-hearted man besides.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hard-hearted, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;Hard?&rdquo;
Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s
little finger as she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his
laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel
farther from the fire.
</p>

<p>
It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting
opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the fire,
it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from the fire, and still keeping
at the table, increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney; which
proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to
consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s part: he being in some
sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft
nothings, which however well they may become the lips of the light and
thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land,
members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public
functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a
beadle: who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most inflexible among
them all.
</p>

<p>
Whatever were Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s intentions, however (and no doubt they were of
the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that
the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little
and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron;
and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his
chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble stopped.
</p>

<p>
Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been
scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen into Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these
consequences at a glance) she remained where she was, and handed Mr. Bumble
another cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and
looking up into the matron&rsquo;s face; &ldquo;are <i>you</i> hard-hearted,
Mrs. Corney?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed the matron, &ldquo;what a very curious
question from a single man. What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked
the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed the matron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Bumble!&rdquo; cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright
was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, &ldquo;Mr. Bumble, I shall
scream!&rdquo; Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner,
put his arm round the matron&rsquo;s waist.
</p>

<p>
As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would have
screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was rendered
unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no sooner heard, than
Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting
them with great violence: while the matron sharply demanded who was there.
</p>

<p>
It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a
sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her voice
had quite recovered all its official asperity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you please, mistress,&rdquo; said a withered old female pauper,
hideously ugly: putting her head in at the door, &ldquo;Old Sally is a-going
fast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that to me?&rdquo; angrily demanded the matron.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep her alive, can I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, mistress,&rdquo; replied the old woman, &ldquo;nobody can;
she&rsquo;s far beyond the reach of help. I&rsquo;ve seen a many people die;
little babes and great strong men; and I know when death&rsquo;s a-coming, well
enough. But she&rsquo;s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on
her,&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not often, for she is dying very hard,&mdash;she
says she has got something to tell, which you must hear. She&rsquo;ll never die
quiet till you come, mistress.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives
against old women who couldn&rsquo;t even die without purposely annoying their
betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up,
briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back, lest anything
particular should occur. Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all night
hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from the room with a very ill grace,
scolding all the way.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.
He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs, closely
inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and,
having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat
corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table.
</p>

<p>
Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off the cocked
hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it,
seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap24"></a> CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF
IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY </h2>

<p>
It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the
matron&rsquo;s room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy;
her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping
of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
Alas! How few of Nature&rsquo;s faces are left alone to gladden us with their
beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them as
they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost
their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave
Heaven&rsquo;s surface clear. It is a common thing for the countenances of the
dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten
expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of early life; so
calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those who knew them in their happy
childhood, kneel by the coffin&rsquo;s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon
earth.
</p>

<p>
The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering some
indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at length compelled
to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and remained behind to
follow as she might: while the more nimble superior made her way to the room
where the sick woman lay.
</p>

<p>
It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end. There
was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary&rsquo;s
apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cold night, Mrs. Corney,&rdquo; said this young gentleman, as the matron
entered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very cold, indeed, sir,&rdquo; replied the mistress, in her most civil
tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should get better coals out of your contractors,&rdquo; said the
apothecary&rsquo;s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the
rusty poker; &ldquo;these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold
night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the board&rsquo;s choosing, sir,&rdquo; returned the
matron. &ldquo;The least they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for
our places are hard enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the young man, turning his face towards the bed, as if
he had previously quite forgotten the patient, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all U.P.
there, Mrs. Corney.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is, is it, sir?&rdquo; asked the matron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,&rdquo; said the
apothecary&rsquo;s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick&rsquo;s point.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a break-up of the system altogether. Is she dozing, old
lady?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the
affirmative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then perhaps she&rsquo;ll go off in that way, if you don&rsquo;t make a
row,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Put the light on the floor. She
won&rsquo;t see it there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that
the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the
side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned. The mistress, with an
expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of
the bed.
</p>

<p>
The apothecary&rsquo;s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the
toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten
minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished Mrs. Corney joy
of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.
</p>

<p>
When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the
bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to catch the
heat. The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their
ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?&rdquo; inquired the
messenger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;She plucked and tore at her
arms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. She
hasn&rsquo;t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet. I ain&rsquo;t so
weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?&rdquo;
demanded the first.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tried to get it down,&rdquo; rejoined the other. &ldquo;But her teeth
were tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could
do to get it back again. So I drank it; and it did me good!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the two
hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mind the time,&rdquo; said the first speaker, &ldquo;when she would
have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, that she would,&rdquo; rejoined the other; &ldquo;she had a merry
heart. &ldquo;A many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as
waxwork. My old eyes have seen them&mdash;ay, and those old hands touched them
too; for I have helped her, scores of times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature shook
them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket, brought out an old
time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook a few grains into the
outstretched palm of her companion, and a few more into her own. While they
were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the
dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply
asked how long she was to wait?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not long, mistress,&rdquo; replied the second woman, looking up into her
face. &ldquo;We have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience!
He&rsquo;ll be here soon enough for us all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!&rdquo; said the matron sternly.
&ldquo;You, Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Often,&rdquo; answered the first woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But will never be again,&rdquo; added the second one; &ldquo;that is,
she&rsquo;ll never wake again but once&mdash;and mind, mistress, that
won&rsquo;t be for long!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Long or short,&rdquo; said the matron, snappishly, &ldquo;she
won&rsquo;t find me here when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you
worry me again for nothing. It&rsquo;s no part of my duty to see all the old
women in the house die, and I won&rsquo;t&mdash;that&rsquo;s more. Mind that,
you impudent old harridans. If you make a fool of me again, I&rsquo;ll soon
cure you, I warrant you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards
the bed, caused her to look round. The patient had raised herself upright, and
was stretching her arms towards them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she cried, in a hollow voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; said one of the women, stooping over her. &ldquo;Lie
down, lie down!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never lie down again alive!&rdquo; said the woman,
struggling. &ldquo;I <i>will</i> tell her! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in
your ear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the
bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the two
old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Turn them away,&rdquo; said the woman, drowsily; &ldquo;make haste! make
haste!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous
lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends; and
were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her, when the
superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the
bedside. On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried
through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely;
since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary,
she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had
been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old
ladies themselves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now listen to me,&rdquo; said the dying woman aloud, as if making a
great effort to revive one latent spark of energy. &ldquo;In this very
room&mdash;in this very bed&mdash;I once nursed a pretty young creetur&rsquo;,
that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and
all soiled with dust and blood. She gave birth to a boy, and died. Let me
think&mdash;what was the year again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind the year,&rdquo; said the impatient auditor; &ldquo;what
about her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy
state, &ldquo;what about her?&mdash;what about&mdash;I know!&rdquo; she cried,
jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her
head&mdash;&ldquo;I robbed her, so I did! She wasn&rsquo;t cold&mdash;I tell
you she wasn&rsquo;t cold, when I stole it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stole what, for God&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo; cried the matron, with a
gesture as if she would call for help.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>It</i>!&rdquo; replied the woman, laying her hand over the
other&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;The only thing she had. She wanted clothes to keep
her warm, and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom.
It was gold, I tell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she
fell back. &ldquo;Go on, go on&mdash;yes&mdash;what of it? Who was the mother?
When was it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She charged me to keep it safe,&rdquo; replied the woman with a groan,
&ldquo;and trusted me as the only woman about her. I stole it in my heart when
she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child&rsquo;s death,
perhaps, is on me besides! They would have treated him better, if they had
known it all!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Known what?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy grew so like his mother,&rdquo; said the woman, rambling on, and
not heeding the question, &ldquo;that I could never forget it when I saw his
face. Poor girl! poor girl! She was so young, too! Such a gentle lamb! Wait;
there&rsquo;s more to tell. I have not told you all, have I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the
words, as they came more faintly from the dying woman. &ldquo;Be quick, or it
may be too late!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mother,&rdquo; said the woman, making a more violent effort than
before; &ldquo;the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her,
whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might
come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother
named. &lsquo;And oh, kind Heaven!&rsquo; she said, folding her thin hands
together, &lsquo;whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in
this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to
its mercy!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; demanded the matron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They <i>called</i> him Oliver,&rdquo; replied the woman, feebly.
&ldquo;The gold I stole was&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;what?&rdquo; cried the other.
</p>

<p>
She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back,
instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a sitting
posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered some indistinct
sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
&ldquo;Stone dead!&rdquo; said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the
door was opened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And nothing to tell, after all,&rdquo; rejoined the matron, walking
carelessly away.
</p>

<p>
The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations for
their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering about the
body.

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap25"></a> CHAPTER XXV.<br />
WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY </h2>

<p>
While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the
old den&mdash;the same from which Oliver had been removed by the
girl&mdash;brooding over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair of bellows upon his
knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more
cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded
on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on
the rusty bars.
</p>

<p>
At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr.
Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against
Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the first-named gentleman,
peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from
his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr.
Chitling&rsquo;s hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he
bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by the
result of his observations upon his neighbour&rsquo;s cards. It being a cold
night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors.
He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a
brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot
upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the
accommodation of the company.
</p>

<p>
Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable
nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more frequently
applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover indulged in many jests and
irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber. Indeed, the
Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to
reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which
remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting
his friend to be &ldquo;blowed,&rdquo; or to insert his head in a sack, or
replying with some other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy
application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr.
Chitling. It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner
invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates,
appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most
uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had never seen
such a jolly game in all his born days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s two doubles and the rub,&rdquo; said Mr. Chitling, with a
very long face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket. &ldquo;I
never see such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything. Even when we&rsquo;ve
good cards, Charley and I can&rsquo;t make nothing of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very ruefully,
delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of laughter roused
the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire what was the matter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Matter, Fagin!&rdquo; cried Charley. &ldquo;I wish you had watched the
play. Tommy Chitling hasn&rsquo;t won a point; and I went partners with him
against the Artfull and dumb.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently
demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason. &ldquo;Try
&rsquo;em again, Tom; try &rsquo;em again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more of it for me, thank &rsquo;ee, Fagin,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Chitling; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough. That &rsquo;ere Dodger has such a run
of luck that there&rsquo;s no standing again&rsquo; him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! ha! my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew, &ldquo;you must get up very
early in the morning, to win against the Dodger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; said Charley Bates; &ldquo;you must put your boots on
over-night, and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your
shoulders, if you want to come over him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and
offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture-card, at a
shilling at a time. Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this
time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of
Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of
counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How precious dull you are, Tommy!&rdquo; said the Dodger, stopping short
when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. &ldquo;What do
you think he&rsquo;s thinking of, Fagin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How should I know, my dear?&rdquo; replied the Jew, looking round as he
plied the bellows. &ldquo;About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in
the country that he&rsquo;s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that it, my dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of
discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> say,
Charley?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> should say,&rdquo; replied Master Bates, with a grin,
&ldquo;that he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy. See how he&rsquo;s a-blushing!
Oh, my eye! here&rsquo;s a merry-go-rounder! Tommy Chitling&rsquo;s in love!
Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a spree!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the
tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such
violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where (the
accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his
laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind him, my dear,&rdquo; said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins,
and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.
&ldquo;Betsy&rsquo;s a fine girl. Stick up to her, Tom. Stick up to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I mean to say, Fagin,&rdquo; replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the
face, &ldquo;is, that that isn&rsquo;t anything to anybody here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more it is,&rdquo; replied the Jew; &ldquo;Charley will talk.
Don&rsquo;t mind him, my dear; don&rsquo;t mind him. Betsy&rsquo;s a fine girl.
Do as she bids you, Tom, and you will make your fortune.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I <i>do</i> do as she bids me,&rdquo; replied Mr. Chitling; &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t have been milled, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for her advice. But
it turned out a good job for you; didn&rsquo;t it, Fagin! And what&rsquo;s six
weeks of it? It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time
when you don&rsquo;t want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, to be sure, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t mind it again, Tom, would you,&rdquo; asked the
Dodger, winking upon Charley and the Jew, &ldquo;if Bet was all right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean to say that I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Tom, angrily.
&ldquo;There, now. Ah! Who&rsquo;ll say as much as that, I should like to know;
eh, Fagin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew; &ldquo;not a soul, Tom. I
don&rsquo;t know one of &rsquo;em that would do it besides you; not one of
&rsquo;em, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I might have got clear off, if I&rsquo;d split upon her; mightn&rsquo;t
I, Fagin?&rdquo; angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. &ldquo;A word from
me would have done it; wouldn&rsquo;t it, Fagin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure it would, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t blab it; did I, Fagin?&rdquo; demanded Tom, pouring
question upon question with great volubility.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, to be sure,&rdquo; replied the Jew; &ldquo;you were too
stout-hearted for that. A deal too stout, my dear!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps I was,&rdquo; rejoined Tom, looking round; &ldquo;and if I was,
what&rsquo;s to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to
assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company,
appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. But, unfortunately, Charley,
in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life, was
unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr.
Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed
a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid
it, and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old
gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for
breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried the Dodger at this moment, &ldquo;I heard the
tinkler.&rdquo; Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.
</p>

<p>
The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in
darkness. After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin
mysteriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Jew, &ldquo;alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle with
his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that he had
better not be funny just then. Having performed this friendly office, he fixed
his eyes on the Jew&rsquo;s face, and awaited his directions.
</p>

<p>
The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his face
working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and feared to
know the worst. At length he raised his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the
room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; &ldquo;bring him
down. Hush! Quiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was softly
and immediately obeyed. There was no sound of their whereabout, when the Dodger
descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand, and followed by a man in a
coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled
off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face, and
disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby
Crackit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How are you, Faguey?&rdquo; said this worthy, nodding to the Jew.
&ldquo;Pop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to
find it when I cut; that&rsquo;s the time of day! You&rsquo;ll be a fine young
cracksman afore the old file now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round his
middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See there, Faguey,&rdquo; he said, pointing disconsolately to his top
boots; &ldquo;not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of
blacking, by Jove! But don&rsquo;t look at me in that way, man. All in good
time. I can&rsquo;t talk about business till I&rsquo;ve eat and drank; so
produce the sustainance, and let&rsquo;s have a quiet fill-out for the first
time these three days!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the
table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his leisure.
</p>

<p>
To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the
conversation. At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his
countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he
brought; but in vain.
</p>

<p>
He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his
features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there
still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit. Then
the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth;
pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement. It was all
of no use. Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he
could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a
glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First and foremost, Faguey,&rdquo; said Toby.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare that
the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece, so as
to bring his boots to about the level of his eye, he quietly resumed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First and foremost, Faguey,&rdquo; said the housebreaker,
&ldquo;how&rsquo;s Bill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&rdquo; began Toby, turning pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mean!&rdquo; cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground.
&ldquo;Where are they? Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been?
Where are they hiding? Why have they not been here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The crack failed,&rdquo; said Toby faintly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket
and pointing to it. &ldquo;What more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with him
between us&mdash;straight as the crow flies&mdash;through hedge and ditch. They
gave chase. Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to take
him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were close upon our
heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows! We parted company, and
left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or dead, that&rsquo;s all I know
about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his
hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap26"></a> CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS,
INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED </h2>

<p>
The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the effect
of Toby Crackit&rsquo;s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing of his unusual
speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and disordered manner,
when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot
passengers, who saw his danger: drove him back upon the pavement. Avoiding, as
much as was possible, all the main streets, and skulking only through the
by-ways and alleys, he at length emerged on Snow Hill. Here he walked even
faster than before; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court;
when, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his
usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.
</p>

<p>
Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the
right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to
Saffron Hill. In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of
second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside the
traders who purchase them from pick-pockets. Hundreds of these handkerchiefs
hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door-posts;
and the shelves, within, are piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field
Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish
warehouse. It is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny:
visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants, who
traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they come. Here, the
clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant, display their goods, as
sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps
of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy
cellars.
</p>

<p>
It was into this place that the Jew turned. He was well known to the sallow
denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out to buy or sell,
nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to their salutations in the
same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end
of the alley; when he stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had
squeezed as much of his person into a child&rsquo;s chair as the chair would
hold, and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!&rdquo; said
this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew&rsquo;s inquiry after his
health.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,&rdquo; said Fagin,
elevating his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice
before,&rdquo; replied the trader; &ldquo;but it soon cools down again;
don&rsquo;t you find it so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he
inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the Cripples?&rdquo; inquired the man.
</p>

<p>
The Jew nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; pursued the merchant, reflecting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s some half-dozen of &rsquo;em gone in, that I knows. I
don&rsquo;t think your friend&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sikes is not, I suppose?&rdquo; inquired the Jew, with a disappointed
countenance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Non istwentus</i>, as the lawyers say,&rdquo; replied the little man,
shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly. &ldquo;Have you got anything in my
line to-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing to-night,&rdquo; said the Jew, turning away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?&rdquo; cried the little man,
calling after him. &ldquo;Stop! I don&rsquo;t mind if I have a drop there with
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred
being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage
himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the
advantage of Mr. Lively&rsquo;s presence. By the time he had got upon his legs,
the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on tiptoe,
in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced himself into the little
chair, and, exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in
which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave
demeanour.
</p>

<p>
The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which the
establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the public-house in
which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured. Merely making a sign to a man
at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and
softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading
his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person.
</p>

<p>
The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was prevented by
the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded red, from being
visible outside. The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its colour from being
injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco
smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more. By
degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through the open door, an
assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises that greeted the ear, might be
made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator
gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company, male and female,
crowded round a long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a
hammer of office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish
nose, and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a
jingling piano in a remote corner.
</p>

<p>
As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys
by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having
subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four
verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through,
as loud as he could. When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after
which, the professional gentleman on the chairman&rsquo;s right and left
volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause.
</p>

<p>
It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the
group. There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the house,) a coarse,
rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his
eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an
eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was
said&mdash;and sharp ones, too. Near him were the singers: receiving, with
professional indifference, the compliments of the company, and applying
themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water,
tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of
almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention,
by their very repulsiveness. Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its
stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last
lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked: others
with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but
one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young
women, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion
of this dreary picture.
</p>

<p>
Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face while
these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting that of
which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye of the man
who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him slightly, and left the room, as
quietly as he had entered it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?&rdquo; inquired the man, as he
followed him out to the landing. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you join us? They&rsquo;ll
be delighted, every one of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, &ldquo;Is <i>he</i>
here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And no news of Barney?&rdquo; inquired Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None,&rdquo; replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he.
&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t stir till it&rsquo;s all safe. Depend on it,
they&rsquo;re on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he&rsquo;d blow
upon the thing at once. He&rsquo;s all right enough, Barney is, else I should
have heard of him. I&rsquo;ll pound it, that Barney&rsquo;s managing properly.
Let him alone for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will <i>he</i> be here to-night?&rdquo; asked the Jew, laying the same
emphasis on the pronoun as before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Monks, do you mean?&rdquo; inquired the landlord, hesitating.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob;
&ldquo;I expected him here before now. If you&rsquo;ll wait ten minutes,
he&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he
might be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his
absence. &ldquo;Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me
to-night. No, say to-morrow. As he is not here, to-morrow will be time
enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Nothing more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a word now,&rdquo; said the Jew, descending the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a
hoarse whisper; &ldquo;what a time this would be for a sell! I&rsquo;ve got
Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! But it&rsquo;s not Phil Barker&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; said the Jew,
looking up. &ldquo;Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part
with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry
lives&mdash;<i>while they last</i>. Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The landlord reciprocated the old man&rsquo;s laugh; and returned to his
guests. The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former
expression of anxiety and thought. After a brief reflection, he called a
hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green. He dismissed him
within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s residence, and performed the
short remainder of the distance, on foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, &ldquo;if there
is any deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you
are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was in her room, the woman said. Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered
it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying with her head upon
the table, and her hair straggling over it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has been drinking,&rdquo; thought the Jew, cooly, &ldquo;or perhaps
she is only miserable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the noise
thus occasioned, roused the girl. She eyed his crafty face narrowly, as she
inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit&rsquo;s story. When it was concluded,
she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a word. She pushed the candle
impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position,
shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all.
</p>

<p>
During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure
himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned.
Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and made
as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if
he had been made of stone. At length he made another attempt; and rubbing his
hands together, said, in his most conciliatory tone,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not tell; and
seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be crying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the boy, too,&rdquo; said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a
glimpse of her face. &ldquo;Poor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only
think!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The child,&rdquo; said the girl, suddenly looking up, &ldquo;is better
where he is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he
lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Jew, in amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, I do,&rdquo; returned the girl, meeting his gaze. &ldquo;I shall be
glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. I
can&rsquo;t bear to have him about me. The sight of him turns me against
myself, and all of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said the Jew, scornfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; cried the girl bitterly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fault of
yours, if I am not! You&rsquo;d never have me anything else, if you had your
will, except now;&mdash;the humour doesn&rsquo;t suit you, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; rejoined the Jew, furiously. &ldquo;It does not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Change it, then!&rdquo; responded the girl, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Change it!&rdquo; exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by
his companion&rsquo;s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night,
&ldquo;I <i>will</i> change it! Listen to me, you drab. Listen to me, who with
six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull&rsquo;s throat
between my fingers now. If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind him; if he
gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to me; murder him
yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch. And do it the moment he sets
foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too late!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; cried the girl involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; pursued Fagin, mad with rage. &ldquo;When the
boy&rsquo;s worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me
in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could
whistle away the lives of! And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants
the will, and has the power to, to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant
checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole demeanour. A moment
before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had dilated; and his
face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering
together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some
hidden villainy. After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his
companion. He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same
listless attitude from which he had first roused her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nancy, dear!&rdquo; croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. &ldquo;Did you
mind me, dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry me now, Fagin!&rdquo; replied the girl, raising her
head languidly. &ldquo;If Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He
has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when
he can&rsquo;t he won&rsquo;t; so no more about that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Regarding this boy, my dear?&rdquo; said the Jew, rubbing the palms of
his hands nervously together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy must take his chance with the rest,&rdquo; interrupted Nancy,
hastily; &ldquo;and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm&rsquo;s
way, and out of yours,&mdash;that is, if Bill comes to no harm. And if Toby got
clear off, Bill&rsquo;s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill&rsquo;s worth two of
Toby any time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And about what I was saying, my dear?&rdquo; observed the Jew, keeping
his glistening eye steadily upon her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must say it all over again, if it&rsquo;s anything you want me to
do,&rdquo; rejoined Nancy; &ldquo;and if it is, you had better wait till
to-morrow. You put me up for a minute; but now I&rsquo;m stupid again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining
whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered them so
readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his
original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed.
Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the
Jew&rsquo;s female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer years, they were
rather encouraged than checked. Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale
perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory
evidence of the justice of the Jew&rsquo;s supposition; and when, after
indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she subsided,
first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the
influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to
various exclamations of &ldquo;Never say die!&rdquo; and divers calculations as
to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was
happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his
time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed.
</p>

<p>
Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his twofold
object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard, and of
ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr. Fagin again
turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon
the table.
</p>

<p>
It was within an hour of midnight. The weather being dark, and piercing cold,
he had no great temptation to loiter. The sharp wind that scoured the streets,
seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and mud, for few people
were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening fast home. It blew from
the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he went:
trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.
</p>

<p>
He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling in his
pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance
which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fagin!&rdquo; whispered a voice close to his ear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Jew, turning quickly round, &ldquo;is
that&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; interrupted the stranger. &ldquo;I have been lingering here
these two hours. Where the devil have you been?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On your business, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at
his companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. &ldquo;On your business all
night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, of course!&rdquo; said the stranger, with a sneer. &ldquo;Well; and
what&rsquo;s come of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing good,&rdquo; said the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing bad, I hope?&rdquo; said the stranger, stopping short, and
turning a startled look on his companion.
</p>

<p>
The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, interrupting
him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this time arrived:
remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say, under cover: for his
blood was chilled with standing about so long, and the wind blew through him.
</p>

<p>
Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a
visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having
no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner, he
unlocked the door, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as dark as the grave,&rdquo; said the man, groping forward a
few steps. &ldquo;Make haste!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shut the door,&rdquo; whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he
spoke, it closed with a loud noise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t my doing,&rdquo; said the other man, feeling his way.
&ldquo;The wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other.
Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in
this confounded hole.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. After a short absence, he
returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was
asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one.
Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way upstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can say the few words we&rsquo;ve got to say in here, my dear,&rdquo;
said the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; &ldquo;and as there are
holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we&rsquo;ll
set the candle on the stairs. There!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight
of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. This done, he led the way into
the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm-chair, and
an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind the door. Upon this
piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and
the Jew, drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face. It was not
quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble
reflection on the opposite wall.
</p>

<p>
They conversed for some time in whispers. Though nothing of the conversation
was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener
might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against
some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of
considerable irritation. They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of
an hour or more, when Monks&mdash;by which name the Jew had designated the
strange man several times in the course of their colloquy&mdash;said, raising
his voice a little,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you again, it was badly planned. Why not have kept him here among
the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only hear him!&rdquo; exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, do you mean to say you couldn&rsquo;t have done it, if you had
chosen?&rdquo; demanded Monks, sternly. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you done it, with
other boys, scores of times? If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at
most, couldn&rsquo;t you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the
kingdom; perhaps for life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whose turn would that have served, my dear?&rdquo; inquired the Jew
humbly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; replied Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But not mine,&rdquo; said the Jew, submissively. &ldquo;He might have
become of use to me. When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only
reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good
friend?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; demanded Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,&rdquo; replied the
Jew; &ldquo;he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curse him, no!&rdquo; muttered the man, &ldquo;or he would have been a
thief, long ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had no hold upon him to make him worse,&rdquo; pursued the Jew,
anxiously watching the countenance of his companion. &ldquo;His hand was not
in. I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the
beginning, or we labour in vain. What could I do? Send him out with the Dodger
and Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us
all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>That</i> was not my doing,&rdquo; observed Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, my dear!&rdquo; renewed the Jew. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t
quarrel with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have
clapped eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was
him you were looking for. Well! I got him back for you by means of the girl;
and then <i>she</i> begins to favour him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Throttle the girl!&rdquo; said Monks, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, we can&rsquo;t afford to do that just now, my dear,&rdquo; replied
the Jew, smiling; &ldquo;and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way;
or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done. I know what these girls
are, Monks, well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she&rsquo;ll care no
more for him, than for a block of wood. You want him made a thief. If he is
alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo; said
the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not likely,
mind,&mdash;but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fault of mine if he is!&rdquo; interposed the other man,
with a look of terror, and clasping the Jew&rsquo;s arm with trembling hands.
&ldquo;Mind that. Fagin! I had no hand in it. Anything but his death, I told
you from the first. I won&rsquo;t shed blood; it&rsquo;s always found out, and
haunts a man besides. If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear
me? Fire this infernal den! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with
both arms, as he sprung to his feet. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. &ldquo;The
shadow! I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the
wainscot like a breath!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room. The
candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed. It showed
them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces. They listened
intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fancy,&rdquo; said the Jew, taking up the light and
turning to his companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I saw it!&rdquo; replied Monks, trembling. &ldquo;It
was bending forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted
away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and, telling
him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs. They looked into all
the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty. They descended into the passage,
and thence into the cellars below. The green damp hung upon the low walls; the
tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was
still as death.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think now?&rdquo; said the Jew, when they had regained the
passage. &ldquo;Besides ourselves, there&rsquo;s not a creature in the house
except Toby and the boys; and they&rsquo;re safe enough. See here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and
explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to
prevent any intrusion on the conference.
</p>

<p>
This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His protestations
had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search
without making any discovery; and, now, he gave vent to several very grim
laughs, and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination. He
declined any renewal of the conversation, however, for that night: suddenly
remembering that it was past one o&rsquo;clock. And so the amiable couple
parted.

<h2><a name="chap27"></a> CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST
UNCEREMONIOUSLY </h2>

<p>
As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a
personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his
coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure
to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry
to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an
eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words,
which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or
matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these
words&mdash;trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming
reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is
delegated&mdash;hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands,
and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and
(by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands. Towards this
end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation
touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a
beadle can do no wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and
profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled,
by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting
opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a
beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a
parochial workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial
church: is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences
and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere
companies&rsquo; beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease
beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the
remotest sustainable claim.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a
closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact
condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs;
and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think
that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking begets thinking; as there
were no sounds of Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that
it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were
further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs.
Corney&rsquo;s chest of drawers.
</p>

<p>
Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching
the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself
acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled
with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between
two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him
exceeding satisfaction. Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand corner
drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box,
which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin,
Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old
attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
it!&rdquo; He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a
waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself
for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile,
with much seeming pleasure and interest.
</p>

<p>
He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying
into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the
fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart,
and gasped for breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Corney,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron,
&ldquo;what is this, ma&rsquo;am? Has anything happened, ma&rsquo;am? Pray
answer me: I&rsquo;m on&mdash;on&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could
not immediately think of the word &ldquo;tenterhooks,&rdquo; so he said
&ldquo;broken bottles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bumble!&rdquo; cried the lady, &ldquo;I have been so dreadfully
put out!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put out, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble; &ldquo;who has dared
to&mdash;? I know!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native
majesty, &ldquo;this is them wicious paupers!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful to think of!&rdquo; said the lady, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then <i>don&rsquo;t</i> think of it, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; rejoined Mr.
Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; whimpered the lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then take something, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble soothingly.
&ldquo;A little of the wine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not for the world!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Corney. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t,&mdash;oh! The top shelf in the right-hand
corner&mdash;oh!&rdquo; Uttering these words, the good lady pointed,
distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms.
Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from
the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and
held it to the lady&rsquo;s lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after
drinking half of it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,
bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Peppermint,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling
gently on the beadle as she spoke. &ldquo;Try it! There&rsquo;s a
little&mdash;a little something else in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips; took
another taste; and put the cup down empty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very comforting,&rdquo; said Mrs. Corney.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very much so indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the beadle. As he spoke,
he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to
distress her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Corney. &ldquo;I am a foolish, excitable,
weak creetur.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not weak, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a
little closer. &ldquo;Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are all weak creeturs,&rdquo; said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general
principle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So we are,&rdquo; said the beadle.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the
expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing
his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s chair, where it had
previously rested, to Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s apron-string, round which it
gradually became entwined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are all weak creeturs,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Corney sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sigh, Mrs. Corney,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Corney. And she sighed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a very comfortable room, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble
looking round. &ldquo;Another room, and this, ma&rsquo;am, would be a complete
thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would be too much for one,&rdquo; murmured the lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But not for two, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft
accents. &ldquo;Eh, Mrs. Corney?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle drooped
his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s face. Mrs. Corney, with great
propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her
pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The board allows you coals, don&rsquo;t they, Mrs. Corney?&rdquo;
inquired the beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And candles,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the
pressure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Coals, candles, and house-rent free,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;Oh,
Mrs. Corney, what an Angel you are!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling. She sank into Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a
passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such porochial perfection!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously.
&ldquo;You know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t live a week, the doctor says,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Bumble.
&ldquo;He is the master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy;
that wacancy must be filled up. Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens!
What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Corney sobbed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The little word?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful
beauty. &ldquo;The one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes!&rdquo; sighed out the matron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One more,&rdquo; pursued the beadle; &ldquo;compose your darling
feelings for only one more. When is it to come off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed. At length summoning up
courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s neck, and said, it might
be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was &ldquo;a irresistible
duck.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was
solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was
rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady&rsquo;s
spirits. While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old
woman&rsquo;s decease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call at Sowerberry&rsquo;s as I go home, and tell him to send
to-morrow morning. Was it that as frightened you, love?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anything particular, dear,&rdquo; said the lady
evasively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must have been something, love,&rdquo; urged Mr. Bumble.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell your own B.?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; rejoined the lady; &ldquo;one of these days. After
we&rsquo;re married, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After we&rsquo;re married!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t any impudence from any of them male paupers as&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, love!&rdquo; interposed the lady, hastily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I thought it was,&rdquo; continued Mr. Bumble; &ldquo;if I thought as
any one of &rsquo;em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely
countenance&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to do it, love,&rdquo; responded the
lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They had better not!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist.
&ldquo;Let me see any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do
it; and I can tell him that he wouldn&rsquo;t do it a second time!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very
high compliment to the lady&rsquo;s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied the
threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this proof of his
devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was indeed a dove.
</p>

<p>
The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having
exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again
braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the
male paupers&rsquo; ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying
himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful
acerbity. Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a
light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion: which served to occupy
his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker.
</p>

<p>
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah
Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount
of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two
functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past
the usual hour of shutting-up. Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter
several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining
through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made
bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going
forward, he was not a little surprised.
</p>

<p>
The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter,
plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the upper end of the
table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair, with his legs
thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of
buttered bread in the other. Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters
from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable
avidity. A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young
gentleman&rsquo;s nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that
he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the
intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong
appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could
have sufficiently accounted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!&rdquo; said Charlotte;
&ldquo;try him, do; only this one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a delicious thing is a oyster!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Claypole, after
he had swallowed it. &ldquo;What a pity it is, a number of &rsquo;em should
ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn&rsquo;t it, Charlotte?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a cruelty,&rdquo; said Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; acquiesced Mr. Claypole. &ldquo;An&rsquo;t yer fond of
oysters?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not overmuch,&rdquo; replied Charlotte. &ldquo;I like to see you eat
&rsquo;em, Noah dear, better than eating &rsquo;em myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lor!&rdquo; said Noah, reflectively; &ldquo;how queer!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have another,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one with such a
beautiful, delicate beard!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t manage any more,&rdquo; said Noah. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
sorry. Come here, Charlotte, and I&rsquo;ll kiss yer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. &ldquo;Say that
again, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron. Mr. Claypole,
without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to
reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
&ldquo;How dare you mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him,
you insolent minx? Kiss her!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong
indignation. &ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it!&rdquo; said Noah, blubbering.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Noah,&rdquo; cried Charlotte, reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yer are; yer know yer are!&rdquo; retorted Noah. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
always a-doin&rsquo; of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin,
please, sir; and makes all manner of love!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. &ldquo;Take yourself
downstairs, ma&rsquo;am. Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your
master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that
Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman&rsquo;s shell after breakfast
to-morrow morning. Do you hear sir? Kissing!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bumble, holding
up his hands. &ldquo;The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this
porochial district is frightful! If Parliament don&rsquo;t take their
abominable courses under consideration, this country&rsquo;s ruined, and the
character of the peasantry gone for ever!&rdquo; With these words, the beadle
strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker&rsquo;s premises.
</p>

<p>
And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all
necessary preparations for the old woman&rsquo;s funeral, let us set on foot a
few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be still lying
in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap28"></a> CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES </h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Wolves tear your throats!&rdquo; muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth.
&ldquo;I wish I was among some of you; you&rsquo;d howl the hoarser for
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that
his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy
across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at
his pursuers.
</p>

<p>
There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud
shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring
dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop, you white-livered hound!&rdquo; cried the robber, shouting after
Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead.
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. For he was not
quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot; and Sikes was in
no mood to be played with.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bear a hand with the boy,&rdquo; cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his
confederate. &ldquo;Come back!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of
breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quicker!&rdquo; cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet,
and drawing a pistol from his pocket. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play booty with
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this moment the noise grew louder. Sikes, again looking round, could discern
that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in
which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up, Bill!&rdquo; cried Toby; &ldquo;drop the kid, and
show &rsquo;em your heels.&rdquo; With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit,
preferring the chance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being
taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed. Sikes
clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of
Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of
the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where
the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right
angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and
was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ho, ho, there!&rdquo; cried a tremulous voice in the rear.
&ldquo;Pincher! Neptune! Come here, come here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular
relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the
command. Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field,
stopped to take counsel together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my <i>orders</i>, is,&rdquo;
said the fattest man of the party, &ldquo;that we &rsquo;mediately go home
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,&rdquo; said
a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in
the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,&rdquo; said
the third, who had called the dogs back, &ldquo;Mr. Giles ought to know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the shorter man; &ldquo;and whatever Mr. Giles
says, it isn&rsquo;t our place to contradict him. No, no, I know my sitiwation!
Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.&rdquo; To tell the truth, the little man
<i>did</i> seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was
by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are afraid, Brittles,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I an&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Brittles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; said Giles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,&rdquo; said Brittles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lie, Brittles,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles.
</p>

<p>
Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles&rsquo;s taunt; and Mr.
Giles&rsquo;s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the
responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a
compliment. The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re all afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speak for yourself, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of
the party.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I do,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural and proper to
be afraid, under such circumstances. I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Brittles; &ldquo;only there&rsquo;s no call to tell
a man he is, so bounceably.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that <i>he</i> was
afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the
completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest wind of the party,
as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping, to
make an apology for his hastiness of speech.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles, when he had explained,
&ldquo;what a man will do, when his blood is up. I should have committed
murder&mdash;I know I should&mdash;if we&rsquo;d caught one of them
rascals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their
blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the
cause of this sudden change in their temperament.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what it was,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles; &ldquo;it was the
gate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was,&rdquo; exclaimed Brittles, catching
at the idea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may depend upon it,&rdquo; said Giles, &ldquo;that that gate stopped
the flow of the excitement. I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was
climbing over it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same
unpleasant sensation at that precise moment. It was quite obvious, therefore,
that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at
which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had
come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance.
</p>

<p>
This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and
a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been
roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit. Mr. Giles
acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the
mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered her service a mere
child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past
thirty.
</p>

<p>
Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close
together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh
gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind
which they had left their lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in
what direction to fire. Catching up the light, they made the best of their way
home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be
discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the
distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which
it was swiftly borne.
</p>

<p>
The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the
ground like a dense cloud of smoke. The grass was wet; the pathways, and low
places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went
languidly by, with a hollow moaning. Still, Oliver lay motionless and
insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him.
</p>

<p>
Morning drew on apace. The air become more sharp and piercing, as its first
dull hue&mdash;the death of night, rather than the birth of day&mdash;glimmered
faintly in the sky. The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the
darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their
familiar shapes. The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among
the leafless bushes. But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he
still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay.
</p>

<p>
At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering
it, the boy awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and
useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood. He was so weak, that
he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he
looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain. Trembling in every joint,
from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering
from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.
</p>

<p>
After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged,
Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him
that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to
walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man. But
he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his breast,
went stumbling onward, he knew not whither.
</p>

<p>
And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind. He
seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily
disputing&mdash;for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he
caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save
himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them. Then, he was alone
with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed
them, he felt the robber&rsquo;s grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started
back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts;
lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand
bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an
undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him
incessantly.
</p>

<p>
Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates,
or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a road. Here
the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him.
</p>

<p>
He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which
perhaps he could reach. Pitying his condition, they might have compassion on
him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human
beings, than in the lonely open fields. He summoned up all his strength for one
last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it.
</p>

<p>
As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it
before. He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the
building seemed familiar to him.
</p>

<p>
That garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night,
and prayed the two men&rsquo;s mercy. It was the very house they had attempted
to rob.
</p>

<p>
Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the
instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight. Flight!
He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full possession of all the best
powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he fly? He pushed
against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges. He
tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and,
his whole strength failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the
little portico.
</p>

<p>
It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker, were
recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea
and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it was Mr. Giles&rsquo;s habit to admit
to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his
wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified,
could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society. But, death,
fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs
stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table,
while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of
the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid, who
were of the party) listened with breathless interest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was about half-past two,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles, &ldquo;or I
wouldn&rsquo;t swear that it mightn&rsquo;t have been a little nearer three,
when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr.
Giles turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over
him to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to
shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to
hear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;Heerd a noise,&rdquo; continued Mr. Giles. &ldquo;I says, at
first, &lsquo;This is illusion&rsquo;; and was composing myself off to sleep,
when I heerd the noise again, distinct.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What sort of a noise?&rdquo; asked the cook.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A kind of a busting noise,&rdquo; replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,&rdquo;
suggested Brittles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was, when <i>you</i> heerd it, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Giles;
&ldquo;but, at this time, it had a busting sound. I turned down the
clothes&rdquo;; continued Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, &ldquo;sat up in
bed; and listened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated &ldquo;Lor!&rdquo; and drew
their chairs closer together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heerd it now, quite apparent,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Giles.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Somebody,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;is forcing of a door, or window;
what&rsquo;s to be done? I&rsquo;ll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save
him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;may be
cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and
stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most
unmitigated horror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tossed off the clothes,&rdquo; said Giles, throwing away the
table-cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, &ldquo;got softly
out of bed; drew on a pair of&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ladies present, Mr. Giles,&rdquo; murmured the tinker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;Of <i>shoes</i>, sir,&rdquo; said Giles, turning upon him, and
laying great emphasis on the word; &ldquo;seized the loaded pistol that always
goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.
&lsquo;Brittles,&rsquo; I says, when I had woke him, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be
frightened!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you did,&rdquo; observed Brittles, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re dead men, I think, Brittles,&rsquo; I says,&rdquo;
continued Giles; &ldquo;&lsquo;but don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Was</i> he frightened?&rdquo; asked the cook.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Giles. &ldquo;He was as
firm&mdash;ah! pretty near as firm as I was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have died at once, I&rsquo;m sure, if it had been me,&rdquo;
observed the housemaid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a woman,&rdquo; retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Brittles is right,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly;
&ldquo;from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a
dark lantern that was standing on Brittle&rsquo;s hob, and groped our way
downstairs in the pitch dark,&mdash;as it might be so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to
accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started violently,
in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair. The cook
and housemaid screamed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a knock,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity.
&ldquo;Open the door, somebody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nobody moved.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the
morning,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him,
and looking very blank himself; &ldquo;but the door must be opened. Do you
hear, somebody?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being naturally
modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could
not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered no reply. Mr. Giles
directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep.
The women were out of the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of
witnesses,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, &ldquo;I am ready to
make one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen
asleep.
</p>

<p>
Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re-assured by
the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day,
took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front. The two women, who were afraid
to stay below, brought up the rear. By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked
very loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in
numbers; and by a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same
ingenious gentleman, the dogs&rsquo; tails were well pinched, in the hall, to
make them bark savagely.
</p>

<p>
These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the
tinker&rsquo;s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and
gave the word of command to open the door. Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping
timorously over each other&rsquo;s shoulders, beheld no more formidable object
than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy
eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into
the background. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
the&mdash;eh?&mdash;Why&mdash;Brittles&mdash;look here&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he
uttered a loud cry. Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm
(fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and
deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement,
up the staircase; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s one of the thieves, ma&rsquo;am!
Here&rsquo;s a thief, miss! Wounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held
the light.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;In a lantern, miss,&rdquo; cried Brittles, applying one hand to
the side of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.
</p>

<p>
The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles
had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore
Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged. In the midst of all this
noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in
an instant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Giles!&rdquo; whispered the voice from the stair-head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, miss,&rdquo; replied Mr. Giles. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
frightened, miss; I ain&rsquo;t much injured. He didn&rsquo;t make a very
desperate resistance, miss! I was soon too many for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied the young lady; &ldquo;you frighten my aunt as much
as the thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wounded desperate, miss,&rdquo; replied Giles, with indescribable
complacency.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He looks as if he was a-going, miss,&rdquo; bawled Brittles, in the same
manner as before. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to come and look at him, miss,
in case he should?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, pray; there&rsquo;s a good man!&rdquo; rejoined the lady.
&ldquo;Wait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away. She
soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried,
carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles&rsquo;s room; and that Brittles was to saddle
the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey: from which place, he was to
despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you take one look at him, first, miss?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Giles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he
had skilfully brought down. &ldquo;Not one little peep, miss?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not now, for the world,&rdquo; replied the young lady. &ldquo;Poor
fellow! Oh! treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as
proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then, bending over Oliver,
he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman.

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap29"></a> CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER
RESORTED </h2>

<p>
In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned
comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well-spread
breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of
black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his station some half-way
between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to
its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one
side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat,
while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who
laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.
</p>

<p>
Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed oaken
chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed with the utmost
nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight
concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style
pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her
hands folded on the table before her. Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little
of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion.
</p>

<p>
The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at that
age, when, if ever angels be for God&rsquo;s good purposes enthroned in mortal
forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers.
</p>

<p>
She was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild
and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its
rough creatures her fit companions. The very intelligence that shone in her
deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age,
or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour,
the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above
all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside
peace and happiness.
</p>

<p>
She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to raise
her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair,
which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such
an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might
have smiled to look upon her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?&rdquo; asked the
old lady, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An hour and twelve minutes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Giles,
referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is always slow,&rdquo; remarked the old lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Brittles always was a slow boy, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the
attendant. And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for
upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being
a fast one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He gets worse instead of better, I think,&rdquo; said the elder lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other
boys,&rdquo; said the young lady, smiling.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful
smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of which there
jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting
quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and
nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never heard of such a thing!&rdquo; exclaimed the fat gentleman.
&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Maylie&mdash;bless my soul&mdash;in the silence of the
night, too&mdash;I <i>never</i> heard of such a thing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both
ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,&rdquo; said the
fat gentleman. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you send? Bless me, my man should have
come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted;
or anybody, I&rsquo;m sure, under such circumstances. Dear, dear! So
unexpected! In the silence of the night, too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been
unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the established
custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and
to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you, Miss Rose,&rdquo; said the doctor, turning to the young lady,
&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! very much so, indeed,&rdquo; said Rose, interrupting him; &ldquo;but
there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! to be sure,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;so there is. That was
your handiwork, Giles, I understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed very
red, and said that he had had that honour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Honour, eh?&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t know;
perhaps it&rsquo;s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit
your man at twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you&rsquo;ve
fought a duel, Giles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at
diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of
him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite
party.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gad, that&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Where is he? Show
me the way. I&rsquo;ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That&rsquo;s
the little window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn&rsquo;t have believed
it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going
upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the
neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as &ldquo;the
doctor,&rdquo; had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living: and
was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be
found in five times that space, by any explorer alive.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had
anticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell
was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from
which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on
above. At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his
patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,&rdquo; said the doctor,
standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is not in danger, I hope?&rdquo; said the old lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, that would <i>not</i> be an extraordinary thing, under the
circumstances,&rdquo; replied the doctor; &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t think he
is. Have you seen the thief?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined the old lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor heard anything about him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am, interposed Mr. Giles; &ldquo;but I was
going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to
the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. Such commendations had been bestowed
upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the
explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the
very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rose wished to see the man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &ldquo;but I
wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; rejoined the doctor. &ldquo;There is nothing very alarming
in his appearance. Have you any objection to see him in my presence?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it be necessary,&rdquo; replied the old lady, &ldquo;certainly
not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I think it is necessary,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;at all
events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you
postponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me&mdash;Miss
Rose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my
honour!&rdquo;
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap30"></a> CHAPTER XXX.<br />
RELATES WHAT OLIVER&rsquo;S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM </h2>

<p>
With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the
aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady&rsquo;s arm through one
of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much
ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the
handle of a bedroom-door, &ldquo;let us hear what you think of him. He has not
been shaved very recently, but he don&rsquo;t look at all ferocious
notwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in visiting
order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stepping before them, he looked into the room. Motioning them to advance, he
closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the
bed. Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to
behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a
deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his
breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long
hair, as it streamed over the pillow.
</p>

<p>
The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute
or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady
glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered
Oliver&rsquo;s hair from his face. As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon
his forehead.
</p>

<p>
The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and
compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had
never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a
silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will
sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this
life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier
existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary
exertion of the mind can ever recall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; exclaimed the elder lady. &ldquo;This poor
child can never have been the pupil of robbers!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Vice,&rdquo; said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, &ldquo;takes up
her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not
enshrine her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But at so early an age!&rdquo; urged Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his
head; &ldquo;crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone.
The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, can you&mdash;oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has
been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?&rdquo; said
Rose.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was
very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way
into an adjoining apartment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But even if he has been wicked,&rdquo; pursued Rose, &ldquo;think how
young he is; think that he may never have known a mother&rsquo;s love, or the
comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have
driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for
mercy&rsquo;s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to
a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment.
Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your
goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been
equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him
before it is too late!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear love,&rdquo; said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl
to her bosom, &ldquo;do you think I would harm a hair of his head?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; replied Rose, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, surely,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;my days are drawing to
their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do
to save him, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me think, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;let me
think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and
down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning
frightfully. After various exclamations of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it now&rdquo;
and &ldquo;no, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and as many renewals of the walking and
frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles,
and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful fellow and
an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and
reward him for being such a good shot besides. You don&rsquo;t object to
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Maylie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no other,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;No other, take my word
for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then my aunt invests you with full power,&rdquo; said Rose, smiling
through her tears; &ldquo;but pray don&rsquo;t be harder upon the poor fellows
than is indispensably necessary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem to think,&rdquo; retorted the doctor, &ldquo;that everybody is
disposed to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope,
for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as
vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who
appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might
avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as
the present.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,&rdquo; returned Rose,
blushing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor, laughing heartily, &ldquo;that is no very
difficult matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement
is yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have
told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn&rsquo;t be
moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him
without danger. Now I make this stipulation&mdash;that I shall examine him in
your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the
satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which
is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther
interference on my part, at all events.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, aunt!&rdquo; entreated Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, aunt!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Is is a bargain?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He cannot be hardened in vice,&rdquo; said Rose; &ldquo;It is
impossible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; retorted the doctor; &ldquo;then so much the more
reason for acceding to my proposition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to
wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.
</p>

<p>
The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr.
Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still
Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted
doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently
restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss
of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that
he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his
remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done.
</p>

<p>
The conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history, and was
often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a solemn thing,
to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a
weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him.
Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one
thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy
clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour
their after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in
imagination, the deep testimony of dead men&rsquo;s voices, which no power can
stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the
suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day&rsquo;s life brings with
it!
</p>

<p>
Oliver&rsquo;s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness
and virtue watched him as he slept. He felt calm and happy, and could have died
without a murmur.
</p>

<p>
The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest
again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being
weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles. And finding
nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate
the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went.
</p>

<p>
There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the
women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had received a special
invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of
his services), and the constable. The latter gentleman had a large staff, a
large head, large features, and large half-boots; and he looked as if he had
been taking a proportionate allowance of ale&mdash;as indeed he had.
</p>

<p>
The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles
was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr.
Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before
his superior said it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit still!&rdquo; said the doctor, waving his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles. &ldquo;Misses wished some ale to
be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir,
and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among &rsquo;em here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were
understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles&rsquo;s
condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say
that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How is the patient to-night, sir?&rdquo; asked Giles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So-so&rdquo;; returned the doctor. &ldquo;I am afraid you have got
yourself into a scrape there, Mr. Giles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to say, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles,
trembling, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s going to die. If I thought it, I should never
be happy again. I wouldn&rsquo;t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not
for all the plate in the county, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; said the doctor, mysteriously.
&ldquo;Mr. Giles, are you a Protestant?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, I hope so,&rdquo; faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very
pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what are <i>you</i>, boy?&rdquo; said the doctor, turning sharply
upon Brittles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord bless me, sir!&rdquo; replied Brittles, starting violently;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the same as Mr. Giles, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then tell me this,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;both of you, both of
you! Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is
the boy that was put through the little window last night? Out with it! Come!
We are prepared for you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures
on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and
Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each
other in a state of stupefaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?&rdquo; said the doctor,
shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge
of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy&rsquo;s utmost
acuteness. &ldquo;Something may come of this before long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office:
which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a simple question of identity, you will observe,&rdquo; said
the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, sir,&rdquo; replied the constable, coughing
with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had
gone the wrong way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the house broken into,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;and a
couple of men catch one moment&rsquo;s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of
gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here&rsquo;s
a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to
have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him&mdash;by doing
which, they place his life in great danger&mdash;and swear he is the thief.
Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in
what situation do they place themselves?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn&rsquo;t law, he would be
glad to know what was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ask you again,&rdquo; thundered the doctor, &ldquo;are you, on your
solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at
Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the
two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly
round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of
wheels.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the runners!&rdquo; cried Brittles, to all appearance much
relieved.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Bow Street officers, sir,&rdquo; replied Brittles, taking up a
candle; &ldquo;me and Mr. Giles sent for &rsquo;em this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Brittles; &ldquo;I sent a message up by the
coachman, and I only wonder they weren&rsquo;t here before, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You did, did you? Then confound your&mdash;slow coaches down here;
that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the doctor, walking away.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap31"></a> CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION </h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Brittles, opening the door a little
way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; replied a man outside; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the
officers from Bow Street, as was sent to to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width,
and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying
anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?&rdquo;
said the officer; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have you
got a coach &rsquo;us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten
minutes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly
man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to put up the
gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration. This done,
they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their
great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were.
</p>

<p>
The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height,
aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half-whiskers, a
round face, and sharp eyes. The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots;
with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?&rdquo; said
the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the
table. &ldquo;Oh! Good-evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you in
private, if you please?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that
gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut
the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the lady of the house,&rdquo; said Mr. Losberne, motioning
towards Mrs. Maylie.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the
floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The latter
gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or
quite so much at his ease in it&mdash;one of the two&mdash;seated himself,
after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his
stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,&rdquo; said Blathers.
&ldquo;What are the circumstances?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great
length, and with much circumlocution. Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very
knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,&rdquo;
said Blathers; &ldquo;but my opinion at once is,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind
committing myself to that extent,&mdash;that this wasn&rsquo;t done by a yokel;
eh, Duff?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Duff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I
apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a
countryman?&rdquo; said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, master,&rdquo; replied Blathers. &ldquo;This is all
about the robbery, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking
on?&rdquo; said Blathers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;One of the frightened
servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this
attempt to break into the house; but it&rsquo;s nonsense: sheer
absurdity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wery easy disposed of, if it is,&rdquo; remarked Duff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What he says is quite correct,&rdquo; observed Blathers, nodding his
head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if
they were a pair of castanets. &ldquo;Who is the boy? What account does he give
of himself? Where did he come from? He didn&rsquo;t drop out of the clouds, did
he, master?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the
two ladies. &ldquo;I know his whole history: but we can talk about that
presently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their
attempt, I suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Blathers. &ldquo;We had better inspect
the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That&rsquo;s the usual
way of doing business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the
native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the
little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and
afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and
after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after
that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to
poke the bushes with. This done, amidst the breathless interest of all
beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a
melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night&rsquo;s
adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other,
in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a
dozen the last. This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared
the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy
and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in
medicine, would be mere child&rsquo;s play.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state;
and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he said, making a halt, after a great number of
very rapid turns, &ldquo;I hardly know what to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;the poor child&rsquo;s story,
faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I doubt it, my dear young lady,&rdquo; said the doctor, shaking his
head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or
with legal functionaries of a higher grade. What is he, after all, they would
say? A runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his
story is a very doubtful one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You believe it, surely?&rdquo; interrupted Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool
for doing so,&rdquo; rejoined the doctor; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think it is
exactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because, my pretty cross-examiner,&rdquo; replied the doctor:
&ldquo;because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he
can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.
Confound the fellows, they <i>will</i> have the why and the wherefore, and will
take nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been the
companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a
police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman&rsquo;s pocket; he has been
taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman&rsquo;s house, to a place which he
cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the
remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a
violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob
a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the
inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there
rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As
if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don&rsquo;t you see
all this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see it, of course,&rdquo; replied Rose, smiling at the doctor&rsquo;s
impetuosity; &ldquo;but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the
poor child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the doctor; &ldquo;of course not! Bless the bright
eyes of your sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side
of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into
his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than
before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The more I think of it,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;the more I see
that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in
possession of the boy&rsquo;s real story. I am certain it will not be believed;
and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it
forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must
interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from
misery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! what is to be done?&rdquo; cried Rose. &ldquo;Dear, dear! why did
they send for these people?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. &ldquo;I would not have had
them here, for the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All I know is,&rdquo; said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a
kind of desperate calmness, &ldquo;that we must try and carry it off with a
bold face. The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. The boy has
strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any
more; that&rsquo;s one comfort. We must make the best of it; and if bad be the
best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, master,&rdquo; said Blathers, entering the room followed by his
colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. &ldquo;This
warn&rsquo;t a put-up thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what the devil&rsquo;s a put-up thing?&rdquo; demanded the doctor,
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,&rdquo; said Blathers, turning to
them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the
doctor&rsquo;s, &ldquo;when the servants is in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody suspected them, in this case,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wery likely not, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Blathers; &ldquo;but they
might have been in it, for all that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More likely on that wery account,&rdquo; said Duff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We find it was a town hand,&rdquo; said Blathers, continuing his report;
&ldquo;for the style of work is first-rate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wery pretty indeed it is,&rdquo; remarked Duff, in an undertone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There was two of &rsquo;em in it,&rdquo; continued Blathers; &ldquo;and
they had a boy with &rsquo;em; that&rsquo;s plain from the size of the window.
That&rsquo;s all to be said at present. We&rsquo;ll see this lad that
you&rsquo;ve got upstairs at once, if you please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?&rdquo;
said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! to be sure!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose, eagerly. &ldquo;You shall have it
immediately, if you will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, thank you, miss!&rdquo; said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve
across his mouth; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink
that&rsquo;s handy, miss; don&rsquo;t put yourself out of the way, on our
accounts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What shall it be?&rdquo; asked the doctor, following the young lady to
the sideboard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little drop of spirits, master, if it&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo;
replied Blathers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cold ride from London, ma&rsquo;am; and I
always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it
very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of
the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem,
but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and
placing it in front of his chest; &ldquo;I have seen a good many pieces of
business like this, in my time, ladies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,&rdquo; said Mr.
Duff, assisting his colleague&rsquo;s memory.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was something in this way, warn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; rejoined Mr.
Blathers; &ldquo;that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You always gave that to him&rdquo; replied Duff. &ldquo;It was the
Family Pet, I tell you. Conkey hadn&rsquo;t any more to do with it than I
had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Blathers; &ldquo;I know better. Do you mind
that time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was!
Better than any novel-book <i>I</i> ever see!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms
of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down
upon,&rdquo; said Blathers. &ldquo;This here Conkey Chickweed&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Conkey means Nosey, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; interposed Duff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course the lady knows that, don&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Blathers. &ldquo;Always interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey
Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a
cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and
badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was
conducted in, for I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em off&rsquo;en. He warn&rsquo;t one
of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and
twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the
dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed
himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of
window: which was only a story high. He was wery quick about it. But Conkey was
quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood.
They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about
&rsquo;em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood,
all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost &rsquo;em.
However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr.
Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts;
and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don&rsquo;t know what all,
was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his
loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his
hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be
going to make away with himself. One day he came up to the office, all in a
hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of
talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and
tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his
house. &lsquo;I see him, Spyers,&rsquo; said Chickweed, &lsquo;pass my house
yesterday morning,&rsquo; &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you up, and collar
him!&rsquo; says Spyers. &lsquo;I was so struck all of a heap, that you might
have fractured my skull with a toothpick,&rsquo; says the poor man; &lsquo;but
we&rsquo;re sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock at night
he passed again.&rsquo; Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean
linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two;
and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows
behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a
moment&rsquo;s notice. He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of
a sudden Chickweed roars out, &lsquo;Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!&rsquo; Jem
Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full
cry. Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody
roars out, &lsquo;Thieves!&rsquo; and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all
the time, like mad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner;
shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; &lsquo;Which is the man?&rsquo;
&lsquo;D&mdash;me!&rsquo; says Chickweed, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost him
again!&rsquo; It was a remarkable occurrence, but he warn&rsquo;t to be seen
nowhere, so they went back to the public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his
old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black
patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again. At last, he
couldn&rsquo;t help shutting &rsquo;em, to ease &rsquo;em a minute; and the
very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a-roaring out, &lsquo;Here he
is!&rsquo; Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down the street
ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday&rsquo;s one, the
man&rsquo;s lost again! This was done, once or twice more, till one-half the
neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was
playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed
had gone mad with grief.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did Jem Spyers say?&rdquo; inquired the doctor; who had returned to
the room shortly after the commencement of the story.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jem Spyers,&rdquo; resumed the officer, &ldquo;for a long time said
nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he
understood his business. But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking
out his snuffbox, says &lsquo;Chickweed, I&rsquo;ve found out who done this
here robbery.&rsquo; &lsquo;Have you?&rsquo; said Chickweed. &lsquo;Oh, my dear
Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear
Spyers, where is the villain!&rsquo; &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said Spyers, offering
him a pinch of snuff, &lsquo;none of that gammon! You did it yourself.&rsquo;
So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would
never have found it out, if he hadn&rsquo;t been so precious anxious to keep up
appearances!&rdquo; said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and
clinking the handcuffs together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very curious, indeed,&rdquo; observed the doctor. &ldquo;Now, if you
please, you can walk upstairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If <i>you</i> please, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr. Blathers. Closely
following Mr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver&rsquo;s bedroom;
Mr. Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle.
</p>

<p>
Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had
appeared yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a
minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was
going forward&mdash;in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what
had been passing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great
vehemence notwithstanding, &ldquo;this is the lad, who, being accidently
wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d&rsquo;
ye-call-him&rsquo;s grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for
assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by
that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his life
in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus recommended to
their notice. The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from
Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to deny that, I suppose?&rdquo; said the doctor,
laying Oliver gently down again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was all done for the&mdash;for the best, sir,&rdquo; answered Giles.
&ldquo;I am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have meddled
with him. I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thought it was what boy?&rdquo; inquired the senior officer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The housebreaker&rsquo;s boy, sir!&rdquo; replied Giles.
&ldquo;They&mdash;they certainly had a boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well? Do you think so now?&rdquo; inquired Blathers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think what, now?&rdquo; replied Giles, looking vacantly at his
questioner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s the same boy, Stupid-head?&rdquo; rejoined Blathers,
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Giles, with a
rueful countenance. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t swear to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; asked Mr. Blathers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; replied poor Giles. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it is the boy; indeed, I&rsquo;m almost certain that it
isn&rsquo;t. You know it can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has this man been a-drinking, sir?&rdquo; inquired Blathers, turning to
the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!&rdquo; said Duff, addressing
Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient&rsquo;s pulse during this short
dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if
the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step
into the next room, and have Brittles before them.
</p>

<p>
Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where
Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in
such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to
throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong
mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn&rsquo;t know
the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken
Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had,
five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much
afraid he had been a little too hasty.
</p>

<p>
Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles
had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which
he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder
and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody
but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one,
however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after
labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a
fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the
utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about
Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for
that night in the town; promising to return the next morning.
</p>

<p>
With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the
cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious
circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly.
The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation,
into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack;
which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in
the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the
King&rsquo;s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all
other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary
accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the
punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they
went.
</p>

<p>
In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a
neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs.
Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver&rsquo;s appearance if he should ever be
called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas,
returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the
latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining
to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet;
and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the
great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs.
Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. If fervent prayers, gushing
from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven&mdash;and if they be
not, what prayers are!&mdash;the blessings which the orphan child called down
upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness.

<h2><a name="chap32"></a> CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS </h2>

<p>
Oliver&rsquo;s ailings were neither slight nor few. In addition to the pain and
delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought
on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and reduced him sadly.
But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say
sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two
sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well
again, he could do something to show his gratitude; only something, which would
let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something,
however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not
been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from
misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly
endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips;
&ldquo;you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. We are
going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us. The
quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will
restore you in a few days. We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can
bear the trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The trouble!&rdquo; cried Oliver. &ldquo;Oh! dear lady, if I could but
work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or
watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you
happy; what would I give to do it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall give nothing at all,&rdquo; said Miss Maylie, smiling;
&ldquo;for, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if
you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will
make me very happy indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Happy, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; cried Oliver; &ldquo;how kind of you to say
so!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will make me happier than I can tell you,&rdquo; replied the young
lady. &ldquo;To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of
rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an
unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and
compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight
me, more than you can well imagine. Do you understand me?&rdquo; she inquired,
watching Oliver&rsquo;s thoughtful face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, ma&rsquo;am, yes!&rdquo; replied Oliver eagerly; &ldquo;but I
was thinking that I am ungrateful now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; inquired the young lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of
me before,&rdquo; rejoined Oliver. &ldquo;If they knew how happy I am, they
would be pleased, I am sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure they would,&rdquo; rejoined Oliver&rsquo;s benefactress;
&ldquo;and Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you
are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; cried Oliver, his face brightening with
pleasure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I shall do for joy when I see their
kind faces once again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of
this expedition. One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out, accordingly, in a
little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. When they came to Chertsey
Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the boy?&rdquo; cried the doctor, as usual,
all in a bustle. &ldquo;Do you see anything&mdash;hear anything&mdash;feel
anything&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That, sir,&rdquo; cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window.
&ldquo;That house!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; well, what of it? Stop coachman. Pull up here,&rdquo; cried the
doctor. &ldquo;What of the house, my man; eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The thieves&mdash;the house they took me to!&rdquo; whispered Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The devil it is!&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;Hallo, there! let me
out!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out of the
coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement,
began kicking at the door like a madman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Halloa?&rdquo; said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so
suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell
forward into the passage. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Matter!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a
moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;A good deal. Robbery is the matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be Murder the matter, too,&rdquo; replied the hump-backed
man, coolly, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t take your hands off. Do you hear
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s&mdash;confound the fellow, what&rsquo;s his rascally
name&mdash;Sikes; that&rsquo;s it. Where&rsquo;s Sikes, you thief?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then,
twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor&rsquo;s grasp, growled forth a
volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house. Before he could shut the
door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of
parley.
</p>

<p>
He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of
anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards;
answered Oliver&rsquo;s description!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly,
&ldquo;what do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you
want to rob me, or to murder me? Which is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair,
you ridiculous old vampire?&rdquo; said the irritable doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want, then?&rdquo; demanded the hunchback. &ldquo;Will you
take yourself off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As soon as I think proper,&rdquo; said Mr. Losberne, looking into the
other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to
Oliver&rsquo;s account of it. &ldquo;I shall find you out, some day, my
friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; sneered the ill-favoured cripple. &ldquo;If you ever
want me, I&rsquo;m here. I haven&rsquo;t lived here mad and all alone, for
five-and-twenty years, to be scared by you. You shall pay for this; you shall
pay for this.&rdquo; And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell,
and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stupid enough, this,&rdquo; muttered the doctor to himself; &ldquo;the
boy must have made a mistake. Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself
up again.&rdquo; With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and
returned to the carriage.
</p>

<p>
The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and
curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver, he
looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp
and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or
sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards. He continued to utter
the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and when
they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind:
beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real
or pretended rage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am an ass!&rdquo; said the doctor, after a long silence. &ldquo;Did
you know that before, Oliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t forget it another time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An ass,&rdquo; said the doctor again, after a further silence of some
minutes. &ldquo;Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had
been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had assistance,
I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and
an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business.
That would have served me right, though. I am always involving myself in some
scrape or other, by acting on impulse. It might have done me good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but
impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the
impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved in any peculiar
troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew
him. If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or
two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of
Oliver&rsquo;s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of
obtaining any. He soon came round again, however; and finding that
Oliver&rsquo;s replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and
consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as
they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from
that time forth.
</p>

<p>
As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided, they were
enabled to drive straight thither. When the coach turned into it, his heart
beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, my boy, which house is it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Losberne.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That! That!&rdquo; replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window.
&ldquo;The white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should
die: it makes me tremble so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder.
&ldquo;You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe
and well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! I hope so!&rdquo; cried Oliver. &ldquo;They were so good to me; so
very, very good to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next door.
It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at the windows,
with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.
</p>

<p>
Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window. &ldquo;To
Let.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Knock at the next door,&rdquo; cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver&rsquo;s
arm in his. &ldquo;What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the
adjoining house, do you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The servant did not know; but would go and inquire. She presently returned, and
said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone to the West Indies,
six weeks before. Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has his housekeeper gone too?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Losberne, after a
moment&rsquo;s pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo;; replied the servant. &ldquo;The old gentleman, the
housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s, all went
together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then turn towards home again,&rdquo; said Mr. Losberne to the driver;
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this
confounded London!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The book-stall keeper, sir?&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;I know the way
there. See him, pray, sir! Do see him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,&rdquo; said the
doctor. &ldquo;Quite enough for both of us. If we go to the book-stall
keeper&rsquo;s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house
on fire, or run away. No; home again straight!&rdquo; And in obedience to the
doctor&rsquo;s impulse, home they went.
</p>

<p>
This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the
midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during his
illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to
him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he
had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his
cruel separation from them. The hope of eventually clearing himself with them,
too, and explaining how he had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and
sustained him, under many of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they
should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he was an
impostor and a robber&mdash;a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his
dying day&mdash;was almost more than he could bear.
</p>

<p>
The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his
benefactors. After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly
begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich
blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some
months.
</p>

<p>
Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin&rsquo;s cupidity, to the
banker&rsquo;s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,
they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver
with them.
</p>

<p>
Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft
tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills
and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of peace and
quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places,
and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts! Men who have lived
in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished
for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have
come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of
their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known
to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature&rsquo;s face; and, carried far
from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once
into a new state of being. Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny
spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the
sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven
itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as
peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber
window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight! The
memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of
its thoughts and hopes. Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh
garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear
down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in
the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held
such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up
solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness
beneath it.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely spot to which they repaired. Oliver, whose days had been spent
among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter
on a new existence there. The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls;
the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed
the air with delicious odours. Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded
with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh
turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest. Oliver
often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother
lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes
to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the
ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but without pain.
</p>

<p>
It was a happy time. The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with
them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating
with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts. Every morning he
went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who
taught him to read better, and to write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such
pains, that Oliver could never try enough to please him. Then, he would walk
with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near
them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he
could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his
own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a
little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the
ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to
all they said: and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to
reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be
quick enough about it. When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the
young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in
a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear. There
would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one
of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture.
</p>

<p>
And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which
he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the other days in that
most happy time! There was the little church, in the morning, with the green
leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the
sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely
building with its fragrance. The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt
so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their
assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real,
and sounded more musical (to Oliver&rsquo;s ears at least) than any he had ever
heard in church before. Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at
the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or
two from the Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the
performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been
the clergyman himself.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o&rsquo;clock, roaming the
fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers,
with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and
consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the
breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie&rsquo;s birds,
with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of
the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste. When
the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some
little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there
was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was
always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who
had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by
trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her
appearance: when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he
had done.
</p>

<p>
So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most
blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and
which, in Oliver&rsquo;s were true felicity. With the purest and most amiable
generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the
other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had
become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the
fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride
in, and attachment to, himself.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap33"></a> CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK
</h2>

<p>
Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been beautiful at
first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness. The great
trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst
into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the
thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a
deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in
sunshine, which lay stretched beyond. The earth had donned her mantle of
brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad. It was the prime and
vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.
</p>

<p>
Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful
serenity prevailed among its inmates. Oliver had long since grown stout and
healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a
great many people. He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate
creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and
when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who
tended him.
</p>

<p>
One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with
them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and
a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing. Rose had been in
high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they
had far exceeded their ordinary bounds. Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they
returned more slowly home. The young lady merely throwing off her simple
bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual. After running abstractedly over the
keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she
played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rose, my dear!&rdquo; said the elder lady.
</p>

<p>
Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused
her from some painful thoughts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rose, my love!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending
over her. &ldquo;What is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, aunt; nothing,&rdquo; replied the young lady. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what it is; I can&rsquo;t describe it; but I
feel&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not ill, my love?&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Maylie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no! Oh, not ill!&rdquo; replied Rose: shuddering as though some
deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; &ldquo;I shall be
better presently. Close the window, pray!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an effort to
recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers
dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with her hands, she sank
upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My child!&rdquo; said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her,
&ldquo;I never saw you so before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,&rdquo; rejoined Rose;
&ldquo;but indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I
<i>am</i> ill, aunt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very
short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her
countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had lost nothing
of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about
the gentle face, which it had never worn before. Another minute, and it was
suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue
eye. Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she
was once more deadly pale.
</p>

<p>
Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed by
these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she affected to
make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded,
that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night, she was in
better spirits; and appeared even in better health: assuring them that she felt
certain she should rise in the morning, quite well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, &ldquo;that
nothing is the matter? She don&rsquo;t look well to-night, but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark
corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length, she said, in a
trembling voice:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope not, Oliver. I have been very happy with her for some years: too
happy, perhaps. It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I
hope it is not this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The heavy blow,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;of losing the dear girl
who has so long been my comfort and happiness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! God forbid!&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver, hastily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Amen to that, my child!&rdquo; said the old lady, wringing her hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?&rdquo; said Oliver.
&ldquo;Two hours ago, she was quite well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is very ill now,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Maylies; &ldquo;and will be
worse, I am sure. My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own emotion,
ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of
the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And consider, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Oliver, as the tears forced
themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. &ldquo;Oh!
consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to
all about her. I am sure&mdash;certain&mdash;quite certain&mdash;that, for your
sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she
makes so happy; she will not die. Heaven will never let her die so
young.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;You think like a child, poor boy. But you teach me my duty,
notwithstanding. I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be
pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the
agony of separation from the objects of our love. I have seen enough, too, to
know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that
love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just;
and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than
this; and that the passage to it is speedy. God&rsquo;s will be done! I love
her; and He knows how well!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she checked
her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke,
became composed and firm. He was still more astonished to find that this
firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs.
Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had
devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.
But he was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under
trying circumstances. How should he, when their possessors so seldom know
themselves?
</p>

<p>
An anxious night ensued. When morning came, Mrs. Maylie&rsquo;s predictions
were but too well verified. Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous
fever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his
face; &ldquo;this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr.
Losberne. It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than four
miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched, by an
express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The people at the inn will
undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here is another letter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect;
&ldquo;but whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I
scarcely know. I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it for Chertsey, too, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; inquired Oliver; impatient
to execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver
glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some
great lord&rsquo;s house in the country; where, he could not make out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall it go, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. &ldquo;I will
wait until to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off, without more
delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes
divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now
emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their
work: nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few seconds, to recover
breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little
market-place of the market-town.
</p>

<p>
Here he paused, and looked about for the inn. There were a white bank, and a
red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large house,
with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign of
&ldquo;The George.&rdquo; To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye.
</p>

<p>
He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing
what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say
again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue
neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning
against a pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick.
</p>

<p>
This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill:
which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid, a horse
had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes
more. Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety,
that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped
away, full tear, to the next stage. At length, all was ready; and the little
parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its
speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven
paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the
turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.
</p>

<p>
As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no
time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat lighter
heart. He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a
tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly
recoiling. &ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver; &ldquo;I was in a great
hurry to get home, and didn&rsquo;t see you were coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Death!&rdquo; muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his
large dark eyes. &ldquo;Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes!
He&rsquo;d start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man&rsquo;s
wild look. &ldquo;I hope I have not hurt you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rot you!&rdquo; murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his
clenched teeth; &ldquo;if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might
have been free of you in a night. Curses on your head, and black death on your
heart, you imp! What are you doing here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He advanced
towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell
violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.
</p>

<p>
Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he
supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help. Having seen him
safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as fast as
he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great deal of
astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom
he had just parted.
</p>

<p>
The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when he
reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive all
considerations of self completely from his memory.
</p>

<p>
Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was delirious. A
medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon
her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and
pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature. &ldquo;In
fact,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would be little short of a miracle, if she
recovered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with
noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the
sick chamber! How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops of terror
start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that
something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred! And what had been
the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he
poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life
and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave&rsquo;s
verge!
</p>

<p>
Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the
life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! Oh! the racking
thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the
breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the
desperate anxiety <i>to be doing something</i> to relieve the pain, or lessen
the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and
spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures
can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever
of the time, allay them!
</p>

<p>
Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke in
whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and
children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for hours after it had
grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every
instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking
as if death lay stretched inside. Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived.
&ldquo;It is hard,&rdquo; said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke;
&ldquo;so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another morning. The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no
misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with
life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on every side:
the fair young creature lay, wasting fast. Oliver crept away to the old
churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for
her, in silence.
</p>

<p>
There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth
in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds;
such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of
life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and
looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that this was not a
time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all
so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for
sunlight and fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and
shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their
ghastly folds.
</p>

<p>
A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts. Another!
Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of humble mourners
entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young. They stood
uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother&mdash;a mother once&mdash;among
the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on.
</p>

<p>
Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from
the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never
cease showing her how grateful and attached he was. He had no cause for
self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been
devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him,
on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and
wished he had been. We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when
every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much
omitted, and so little done&mdash;of so many things forgotten, and so many more
which might have been repaired! There is no remorse so deep as that which is
unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time.
</p>

<p>
When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.
Oliver&rsquo;s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside
of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away.
He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken,
either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die.
</p>

<p>
They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted meal was
removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they
watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and
earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure. Their quick ears caught
the sound of an approaching footstep. They both involuntarily darted to the
door, as Mr. Losberne entered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What of Rose?&rdquo; cried the old lady. &ldquo;Tell me at once! I can
bear it; anything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must compose yourself,&rdquo; said the doctor supporting her.
&ldquo;Be calm, my dear ma&rsquo;am, pray.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me go, in God&rsquo;s name! My dear child! She is dead! She is
dying!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried the doctor, passionately. &ldquo;As He is good and
merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but the
energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her first
thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to
receive her.

<h2><a name="chap34"></a> CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW
ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER </h2>

<p>
It was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by
the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest. He had
scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a
long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and
he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had
occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken
from his breast.
</p>

<p>
The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with flowers
which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber.
As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some
vehicle, approaching at a furious pace. Looking round, he saw that it was a
post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the
road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed
him.
</p>

<p>
As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose
face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not
identify the person. In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of
the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop: which
he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses. Then, the nightcap once again
appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried the voice. &ldquo;Oliver, what&rsquo;s the news? Miss
Rose! Master O-li-ver!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it you, Giles?&rdquo; cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.
</p>

<p>
Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he
was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of
the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In a word!&rdquo; cried the gentleman, &ldquo;Better or worse?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better&mdash;much better!&rdquo; replied Oliver, hastily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed the gentleman. &ldquo;You are
sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver. &ldquo;The change took place only a
few hours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door, leaped out,
and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are quite certain? There is no possibility of any mistake on your
part, my boy, is there?&rdquo; demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.
&ldquo;Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be
fulfilled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would not for the world, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver. &ldquo;Indeed you
may believe me. Mr. Losberne&rsquo;s words were, that she would live to bless
us all for many years to come. I heard him say so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tears stood in Oliver&rsquo;s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the
beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and
remained silent, for some minutes. Oliver thought he heard him sob, more than
once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark&mdash;for he could
well guess what his feelings were&mdash;and so stood apart, feigning to be
occupied with his nosegay.
</p>

<p>
All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the
steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with
a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots. That the honest
fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very
red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and
addressed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you had better go on to my mother&rsquo;s in the chaise,
Giles,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a
little time before I see her. You can say I am coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said Giles: giving a final polish
to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; &ldquo;but if you would leave
the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. It
wouldn&rsquo;t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should
never have any more authority with them if they did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, &ldquo;you can do as you
like. Let him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with
us. Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we
shall be taken for madmen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his
nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he took out of
the chaise. This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver,
followed at their leisure.
</p>

<p>
As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and
curiosity at the new comer. He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age, and
was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his
demeanor easy and prepossessing. Notwithstanding the difference between youth
and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have
had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already
spoken of her as his mother.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the
cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; whispered the young man; &ldquo;why did you not write
before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Maylie; &ldquo;but, on reflection, I
determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne&rsquo;s
opinion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;why run the chance of that
occurring which so nearly happened? If Rose had&mdash;I cannot utter that word
now&mdash;if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have
forgiven yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If that <i>had</i> been the case, Harry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie,
&ldquo;I fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that
your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very
little import.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who can wonder if it be so, mother?&rdquo; rejoined the young man;
&ldquo;or why should I say, <i>if</i>?&mdash;It is&mdash;it is&mdash;you know
it, mother&mdash;you must know it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can
offer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie; &ldquo;I know that the devotion and affection
of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and
lasting. If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in
one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of
performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I
take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is unkind, mother,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Do you still suppose
that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own
soul?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think, my dear son,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon
his shoulder, &ldquo;that youth has many generous impulses which do not last;
and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more
fleeting. Above all, I think&rdquo; said the lady, fixing her eyes on her
son&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man
marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no
fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his
children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in
his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him: he may, no matter how
generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in
early life. And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said the young man, impatiently, &ldquo;he would be a
selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe,
who acted thus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think so now, Harry,&rdquo; replied his mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And ever will!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;The mental agony I have
suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a
passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have
lightly formed. On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever
heart of man was set on woman. I have no thought, no view, no hope in life,
beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and
happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind. Mother, think better of
this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think
so little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &ldquo;it is because I think so much of
warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we
have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let it rest with Rose, then,&rdquo; interposed Harry. &ldquo;You will
not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any
obstacle in my way?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Maylie; &ldquo;but I would have you
consider&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>have</i> considered!&rdquo; was the impatient reply; &ldquo;Mother,
I have considered, years and years. I have considered, ever since I have been
capable of serious reflection. My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will;
and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be
productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She shall,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she
will hear me coldly, mother,&rdquo; said the young man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not coldly,&rdquo; rejoined the old lady; &ldquo;far from it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How then?&rdquo; urged the young man. &ldquo;She has formed no other
attachment?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied his mother; &ldquo;you have, or I mistake,
too strong a hold on her affections already. What I would say,&rdquo; resumed
the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, &ldquo;is this. Before
you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to
the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on
Rose&rsquo;s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful
birth may have on her decision: devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity
of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all
matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I leave you to discover,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Maylie. &ldquo;I must
go back to her. God bless you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall see you again to-night?&rdquo; said the young man, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By and by,&rdquo; replied the lady; &ldquo;when I leave Rose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will tell her I am here?&rdquo; said Harry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Maylie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I
long to see her. You will not refuse to do this, mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;I will tell her all.&rdquo; And
pressing her son&rsquo;s hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this
hurried conversation was proceeding. The former now held out his hand to Harry
Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them. The doctor then
communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a
precise account of his patient&rsquo;s situation; which was quite as
consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver&rsquo;s statement had encouraged him
to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about
the luggage, listened with greedy ears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?&rdquo; inquired the
doctor, when he had concluded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing particular, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?&rdquo;
said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None at all, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I am sorry to hear it, because you
do that sort of thing admirably. Pray, how is Brittles?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy is very well, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual
tone of patronage; &ldquo;and sends his respectful duty, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Seeing you here,
reminds me, Mr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away
so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small
commission in your favour. Just step into this corner a moment, will
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was
honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination
of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual
stateliness. The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the
parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles
walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an
air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress,
in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted
robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty
pounds, for his sole use and benefit. At this, the two women-servants lifted up
their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill,
replied, &ldquo;No, no&rdquo;; and that if they observed that he was at all
haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so. And then he made
a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were
received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as
much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.
</p>

<p>
Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the
doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie
might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman&rsquo;s
good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and
professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck
Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh
proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed
immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very
force of sympathy. So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the
circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired,
with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and
suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.
</p>

<p>
Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual
occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days. The
birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest
wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with
their beauty. The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious
boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was
dispelled by magic. The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green
leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself
to look more blue and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our
own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects. Men who
look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are
in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced
eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision.
</p>

<p>
It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that
his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie, after the very
first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a
passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left
his young companion far behind. If Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he
knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured
the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed. The window
of the young lady&rsquo;s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the
rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always
stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was
made up with great care, every morning. Oliver could not help noticing that the
withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly
replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into
the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and
nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on his morning&rsquo;s walk.
Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly
recovering.
</p>

<p>
Nor did Oliver&rsquo;s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady
had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and
then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself, with
redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman, and
laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself. It was while
he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and distressed by
a most unexpected occurrence.
</p>

<p>
The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books, was
on the ground-floor, at the back of the house. It was quite a cottage-room,
with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle,
that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious
perfume. It looked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate opened into a small
paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land and wood. There was no other dwelling
near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.
</p>

<p>
One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to
settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books. He had
been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly
sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the
authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow
degrees, he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds
the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and
enable it to ramble at its pleasure. So far as an overpowering heaviness, a
prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or
power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a
consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a
time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the
moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until
reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards
almost matter of impossibility to separate the two. Nor is this, the most
striking phenomenon incidental to such a state. It is an undoubted fact, that
although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping
thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and
materially influenced, by the <i>mere silent presence</i> of some external
object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose
vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books
were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the
creeping plants outside. And yet he was asleep. Suddenly, the scene changed;
the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that
he was in the Jew&rsquo;s house again. There sat the hideous old man, in his
accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another man, with his
face averted, who sat beside him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, my dear!&rdquo; he thought he heard the Jew say; &ldquo;it is he,
sure enough. Come away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He!&rdquo; the other man seemed to answer; &ldquo;could I mistake him,
think you? If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape,
and he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point
him out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I
fancy I should know, if there wasn&rsquo;t a mark above it, that he lay buried
there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with
the fear, and started up.
</p>

<p>
Good Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and
deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There&mdash;there&mdash;at the
window&mdash;close before him&mdash;so close, that he could have almost touched
him before he started back: with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting
his: there stood the Jew! And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both,
were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard.
</p>

<p>
It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were gone.
But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as firmly
impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set
before him from his birth. He stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from
the window into the garden, called loudly for help.

<h2><a name="chap35"></a> CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER&rsquo;S ADVENTURE; AND A
CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE </h2>

<p>
When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver&rsquo;s cries, hurried to
the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated, pointing
in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to
articulate the words, &ldquo;The Jew! the Jew!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie,
whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver&rsquo;s
history from his mother, understood it at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What direction did he take?&rdquo; he asked, catching up a heavy stick
which was standing in a corner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken;
&ldquo;I missed them in an instant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, they are in the ditch!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Follow! And keep
as near me, as you can.&rdquo; So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted
off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the
others to keep near him.
</p>

<p>
Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course
of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then
returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more
agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same
course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to
know what was the matter.
</p>

<p>
On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking
off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to search, narrowly,
the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the
party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the
circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit.
</p>

<p>
The search was all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent footsteps,
to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open
fields in every direction for three or four miles. There was the village in the
hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver
had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was
impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood
skirted the meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained
that covert for the same reason.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must have been a dream, Oliver,&rdquo; said Harry Maylie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, indeed, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver, shuddering at the very
recollection of the old wretch&rsquo;s countenance; &ldquo;I saw him too
plainly for that. I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who was the other?&rdquo; inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the
inn,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and
I could swear to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They took this way?&rdquo; demanded Harry: &ldquo;are you sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As I am that the men were at the window,&rdquo; replied Oliver, pointing
down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the
meadow. &ldquo;The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few
paces to the right, crept through that gap.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two gentlemen watched Oliver&rsquo;s earnest face, as he spoke, and looking
from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he
said. Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men
in hurried flight. The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save
where their own feet had crushed it. The sides and brinks of the ditches were
of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men&rsquo;s
shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the
ground for hours before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is strange!&rdquo; said Harry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Strange?&rdquo; echoed the doctor. &ldquo;Blathers and Duff, themselves,
could make nothing of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not
desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless;
and even then, they gave it up with reluctance. Giles was dispatched to the
different ale-houses in the village, furnished with the best description Oliver
could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers. Of these, the Jew was,
at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been
seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence,
calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.
</p>

<p>
On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no
better success. On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the
market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but
this effort was equally fruitless. After a few days, the affair began to be
forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support
it, dies away of itself.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. She had left her room: was able to go
out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all.
</p>

<p>
But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and
although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the
cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there: even upon
Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark. Mrs. Maylie and her son
were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared
with traces of tears upon her face. After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his
departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that
something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of
somebody else besides.
</p>

<p>
At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour, Harry
Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her
for a few moments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A few&mdash;a very few&mdash;will suffice, Rose,&rdquo; said the young
man, drawing his chair towards her. &ldquo;What I shall have to say, has
already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are
not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have
been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and bending over some
plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;ought to have left here, before,&rdquo; said Harry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should, indeed,&rdquo; replied Rose. &ldquo;Forgive me for saying
so, but I wish you had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all
apprehensions,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;the fear of losing the one
dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed. You had been dying;
trembling between earth and heaven. We know that when the young, the beautiful,
and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards
their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and
fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken;
and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly
in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her
fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in
nature.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A creature,&rdquo; continued the young man, passionately, &ldquo;a
creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God&rsquo;s own angels,
fluttered between life and death. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to
which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the
sorrow and calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away
like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have
no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a
reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere
whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and
yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those
who loved you&mdash;these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were
mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears,
and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how
devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course. You
recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back,
and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated
languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide. I have
watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with
their eagerness and deep affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost
this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not mean that,&rdquo; said Rose, weeping; &ldquo;I only wish you
had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to
pursuits well worthy of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature
that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,&rdquo; said the
young man, taking her hand. &ldquo;Rose, my own dear Rose! For years&mdash;for
years&mdash;I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come
proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking,
in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many
silent tokens I had given of a boy&rsquo;s attachment, and claim your hand, as
in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us! That
time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision
realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the
words with which you greet the offer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.&rdquo; said Rose, mastering
the emotions by which she was agitated. &ldquo;As you believe that I am not
insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Rose, &ldquo;that you must endeavour to forget me;
not as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply;
but, as the object of your love. Look into the world; think how many hearts you
would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other passion to me, if you
will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one hand,
gave free vent to her tears. Harry still retained the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your reasons, Rose,&rdquo; he said, at length, in a low voice;
&ldquo;your reasons for this decision?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have a right to know them,&rdquo; rejoined Rose. &ldquo;You can say
nothing to alter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform. I owe it,
alike to others, and to myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Harry. I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl,
with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that
I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on
all your hopes and projects. I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from
opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your
progress in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty&mdash;&rdquo; Harry
began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They do not,&rdquo; replied Rose, colouring deeply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you return my love?&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Say but that, dear
Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard
disappointment!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I
loved,&rdquo; rejoined Rose, &ldquo;I could have&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have received this declaration very differently?&rdquo; said Harry.
&ldquo;Do not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could,&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; she added, disengaging
her hand, &ldquo;why should we prolong this painful interview? Most painful to
me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it
<i>will</i> be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard
which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with
new fortitude and firmness. Farewell, Harry! As we have met to-day, we meet no
more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed
us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the
prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth
and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Another word, Rose,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Your reason in your own
words. From your own lips, let me hear it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The prospect before you,&rdquo; answered Rose, firmly, &ldquo;is a
brilliant one. All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections
can help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections are
proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who
gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well
supplied that mother&rsquo;s place. In a word,&rdquo; said the young lady,
turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, &ldquo;there is a stain
upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads. I will carry it into no
blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One word more, Rose. Dearest Rose! one more!&rdquo; cried Harry,
throwing himself before her. &ldquo;If I had been less&mdash;less fortunate,
the world would call it&mdash;if some obscure and peaceful life had been my
destiny&mdash;if I had been poor, sick, helpless&mdash;would you have turned
from me then? Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this
scruple birth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not press me to reply,&rdquo; answered Rose. &ldquo;The question does
not arise, and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,&rdquo; retorted
Harry, &ldquo;it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light
the path before me. It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of
a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. Oh, Rose: in the name
of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for
you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, if your lot had been differently cast,&rdquo; rejoined Rose;
&ldquo;if you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have
been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and
not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have
been spared this trial. I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but
then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into
the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them,
as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,&rdquo;
said Rose, extending her hand. &ldquo;I must leave you now, indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ask one promise,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Once, and only once
more,&mdash;say within a year, but it may be much sooner,&mdash;I may speak to
you again on this subject, for the last time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to press me to alter my right determination,&rdquo; replied Rose,
with a melancholy smile; &ldquo;it will be useless.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;to hear you repeat it, if you
will&mdash;finally repeat it! I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of
fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will
not seek, by word or act, to change it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then let it be so,&rdquo; rejoined Rose; &ldquo;it is but one pang the
more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She extended her hand again. But the young man caught her to his bosom; and
imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.

<h2><a name="chap36"></a> CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT
SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT
WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES </h2>

<p>
&ldquo;And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning;
eh?&rdquo; said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the
breakfast-table. &ldquo;Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two
half-hours together!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will tell me a different tale one of these days,&rdquo; said Harry,
colouring without any perceptible reason.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope I may have good cause to do so,&rdquo; replied Mr. Losberne;
&ldquo;though I confess I don&rsquo;t think I shall. But yesterday morning you
had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your
mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce that you
are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road
to London. And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the
ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is
pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after
botanical phenomena of all kinds. Too bad, isn&rsquo;t it, Oliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr.
Maylie went away, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine fellow,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;you shall
come and see me when you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any
communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to
be gone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The great nobs,&rdquo; replied Harry, &ldquo;under which designation, I
presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at
all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that
anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you are a queer fellow. But of
course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and
these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life.
There&rsquo;s something in that. Good training is always desirable, whether the
race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one
or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he
contented himself with saying, &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; and pursued the
subject no farther. The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards;
and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it
packed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, &ldquo;let me speak a
word with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him; much
surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole
behaviour displayed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can write well now?&rdquo; said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope so, sir,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would
write to me&mdash;say once a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the General
Post Office in London. Will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver,
greatly delighted with the commission.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like to know how&mdash;how my mother and Miss Maylie
are,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;and you can fill up a sheet by telling
me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she&mdash;they, I
mean&mdash;seem happy and quite well. You understand me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! quite, sir, quite,&rdquo; replied Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would rather you did not mention it to them,&rdquo; said Harry,
hurrying over his words; &ldquo;because it might make my mother anxious to
write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret
between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully
promised to be secret and explicit in his communications. Mr. Maylie took leave
of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left
behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were in the
garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and
jumped into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;hard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short
of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great
hurry, and shouting to the postillion; &ldquo;something very short of flying
will keep pace with <i>me</i>. Do you hear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its
rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the
road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now
becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way,
permitted. It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that
the gazers dispersed.
</p>

<p>
And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where
the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind
the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes
towards the window, sat Rose herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He seems in high spirits and happy,&rdquo; she said, at length. &ldquo;I
feared for a time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very
glad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down
Rose&rsquo;s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same
direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.

<h2><a name="chap37"></a> CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES
</h2>

<p>
Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the
cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded,
than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back
from its cold and shining surface. A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling,
to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the
heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a
deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance. Mr. Bumble
was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful
passage in his own past life.
</p>

<p>
Nor was Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing
melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting other
appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced
that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs. The laced
coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He still wore knee-breeches, and
dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not <i>the</i>
breeches. The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like <i>the</i> coat,
but, oh how different! The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round
one. Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle.
</p>

<p>
There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial
rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and
waistcoats connected with them. A field-marshal has his uniform; a bishop his
silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat. Strip the
bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they? Men.
Mere men. Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat
and waistcoat than some people imagine.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse. Another
beadle had come into power. On him the cocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff,
had all three descended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And to-morrow two months it was done!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, with a
sigh. &ldquo;It seems a age.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of
happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh&mdash;there was a
vast deal of meaning in the sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I sold myself,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of
relection, &ldquo;for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot;
with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money. I
went very reasonable. Cheap, dirt cheap!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cheap!&rdquo; cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;you
would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above
knows that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who,
imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had
hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Bumble, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental
sternness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried the lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have the goodness to look at me,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes
upon her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she stands such a eye as that,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble to himself,
&ldquo;she can stand anything. It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers.
If it fails with her, my power is gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers,
who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs.
Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion.
The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and
even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.
</p>

<p>
On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first incredulous,
and afterwards amazed. He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse
himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
rejoined Mr. Bumble; &ldquo;and although I was <i>not</i> snoring, I shall
snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my
prerogative.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Your</i> prerogative!&rdquo; sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable
contempt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said the word, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;The
prerogative of a man is to command.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of
Goodness?&rdquo; cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To obey, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; thundered Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;Your late
unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have
been alive now. I wish he was, poor man!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and
that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be
final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than
she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a
hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.
</p>

<p>
But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s soul;
his heart was waterproof. Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his
nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which,
being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased
and exalted him. He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and
begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest: the exercise
being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and
softens down the temper,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;So cry away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat from a
peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt
he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his
pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness
depicted in his whole appearance.
</p>

<p>
Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less
troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of
the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering.
</p>

<p>
The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound,
immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end
of the room. This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady,
clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of
blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other. This
done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his
hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed
necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well
situated for the purpose: and defied him to talk about his prerogative again,
if he dared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. &ldquo;And take
yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what something
desperate might be. Picking up his hat, he looked towards the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, my dear, certainly,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a
quicker motion towards the door. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend
to&mdash;I&rsquo;m going, my dear! You are so very violent, that really
I&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet,
which had been kicked up in the scuffle. Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of
the room, without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence: leaving
the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. He had a decided
propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise
of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward. This
is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages,
who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar
infirmities. The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise,
and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his
qualifications for office.
</p>

<p>
But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full. After making a tour of
the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really were too
hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them
chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at
all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; Mr.
Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in
washing the parish linen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now
proceeded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity.
&ldquo;These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo!
hallo there! What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce
and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and
cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know I was here!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Bumble. &ldquo;What
do <i>you</i> do here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work
properly, my dear,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple
of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the
workhouse-master&rsquo;s humility.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> thought they were talking too much?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumble.
&ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, my dear&mdash;&rdquo; urged Mr. Bumble submissively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very true, you&rsquo;re matron here, my dear,&rdquo;
submitted Mr. Bumble; &ldquo;but I thought you mightn&rsquo;t be in the way
just then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,&rdquo; returned his lady.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any of your interference. You&rsquo;re a great deal
too fond of poking your nose into things that don&rsquo;t concern you, making
everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making
yourself look like a fool every hour in the day. Be off; come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old
paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an
instant. Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of
soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart,
on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person.
</p>

<p>
What could Mr. Bumble do? He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as
he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle
of irrepressible delight. It wanted but this. He was degraded in their eyes; he
had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the
height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed
hen-peckery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All in two months!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.
&ldquo;Two months! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master,
but everybody else&rsquo;s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned,
and now!&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for
him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly,
into the street.
</p>

<p>
He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first
passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty. He
passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused before one in a
by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was
deserted, save by one solitary customer. It began to rain, heavily, at the
moment. This determined him. Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to
drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked
from the street.
</p>

<p>
The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak. He had
the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as
well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance. He
eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in
acknowledgment of his salutation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger
had been more familiar: so he drank his gin-and-water in silence, and read the
paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.
</p>

<p>
It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into
company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a
powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the
stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion,
to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him. Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of
the stranger&rsquo;s eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of
distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and
repulsive to behold.
</p>

<p>
When they had encountered each other&rsquo;s glance several times in this way,
the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were you looking for me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you peered in at
the window?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not that I am aware of, unless you&rsquo;re Mr.&mdash;&rdquo; Here Mr.
Bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger&rsquo;s name, and
thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see you were not,&rdquo; said the stranger; an expression of quiet
sarcasm playing about his mouth; &ldquo;or you have known my name. You
don&rsquo;t know it. I would recommend you not to ask for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I meant no harm, young man,&rdquo; observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And have done none,&rdquo; said the stranger.
</p>

<p>
Another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by the
stranger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen you before, I think?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You were
differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I
should know you again. You were beadle here, once; were you not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; &ldquo;porochial
beadle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; rejoined the other, nodding his head. &ldquo;It was in
that character I saw you. What are you now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Master of the workhouse,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and
impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise
assume. &ldquo;Master of the workhouse, young man!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt
not?&rdquo; resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s eyes,
as he raised them in astonishment at the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scruple to answer freely, man. I know you pretty well, you
see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose, a married man,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes
with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident
perplexity, &ldquo;is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can,
than a single one. Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford
to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper
manner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not
mistaken his man; then rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fill this glass again,&rdquo; he said, handing Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s empty
tumbler to the landlord. &ldquo;Let it be strong and hot. You like it so, I
suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not too strong,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You understand what that means, landlord!&rdquo; said the stranger,
drily.
</p>

<p>
The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming
jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now listen to me,&rdquo; said the stranger, after closing the door and
window. &ldquo;I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by one
of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes,
you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my
mind. I want some information from you. I don&rsquo;t ask you to give it for
nothing, slight as it is. Put up that, to begin with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his
companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be
heard without. When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that
they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his
waistcoat-pocket, he went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Carry your memory back&mdash;let me see&mdash;twelve years, last
winter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;Very good.
I&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The scene, the workhouse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the time, night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs
brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves&mdash;gave
birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot
&rsquo;em in the grave!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The lying-in room, I suppose?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, not quite
following the stranger&rsquo;s excited description.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;A boy was born there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A many boys,&rdquo; observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A murrain on the young devils!&rdquo; cried the stranger; &ldquo;I speak
of one; a meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a
coffin-maker&mdash;I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in
it&mdash;and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble; &ldquo;I
remember him, of course. There wasn&rsquo;t a obstinater young
rascal&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not of him I want to hear; I&rsquo;ve heard enough of
him,&rdquo; said the stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on
the subject of poor Oliver&rsquo;s vices. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s of a woman; the hag
that nursed his mother. Where is she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had
rendered facetious. &ldquo;It would be hard to tell. There&rsquo;s no midwifery
there, whichever place she&rsquo;s gone to; so I suppose she&rsquo;s out of
employment, anyway.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the stranger, sternly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That she died last winter,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and although
he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze gradually
became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought. For some time, he
appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the
intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and withdrawing his eyes,
observed that it was no great matter. With that he rose, as if to depart.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was
opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his
better half. He well remembered the night of old Sally&rsquo;s death, which the
occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the occasion
on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never
confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness, he
had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the
old woman&rsquo;s attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of
Oliver Twist. Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the
stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old
harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to
believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I find her?&rdquo; said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and
plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by
the intelligence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only through me,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When?&rdquo; cried the stranger, hastily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; rejoined Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At nine in the evening,&rdquo; said the stranger, producing a scrap of
paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side, in
characters that betrayed his agitation; &ldquo;at nine in the evening, bring
her to me there. I needn&rsquo;t tell you to be secret. It&rsquo;s your
interest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the
liquor that had been drunk. Shortly remarking that their roads were different,
he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of
appointment for the following night.
</p>

<p>
On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it
contained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask
it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble
touched him on the arm. &ldquo;Following me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only to ask a question,&rdquo; said the other, pointing to the scrap of
paper. &ldquo;What name am I to ask for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Monks!&rdquo; rejoined the man; and strode hastily away.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap38"></a> CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR.
MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW </h2>

<p>
It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had been
threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already
yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm,
when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed
their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from
it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome
swamp, bordering upon the river.
</p>

<p>
They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps,
serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and
sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a lantern, from which,
however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as
though&mdash;the way being dirty&mdash;to give his wife the benefit of treading
in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound silence; every now and then,
Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his
helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he
mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed,
towards their place of destination.
</p>

<p>
This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been
known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences
of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime. It was a
collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of
old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or
arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the
river&rsquo;s bank. A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the
dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there an oar or coil of rope:
appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable
cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and
useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by,
without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there,
rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being
actually employed.
</p>

<p>
In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper
stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of
some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants
of the surrounding tenements. But it had long since gone to ruin. The rat, the
worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it
stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into
the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream,
seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and
involving itself in the same fate.
</p>

<p>
It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first
peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring
violently down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The place should be somewhere here,&rdquo; said Bumble, consulting a
scrap of paper he held in his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Halloa there!&rdquo; cried a voice from above.
</p>

<p>
Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out
of a door, breast-high, on the second story.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand still, a minute,&rdquo; cried the voice; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with
you directly.&rdquo; With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that the man?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s good lady.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, mind what I told you,&rdquo; said the matron: &ldquo;and be
careful to say as little as you can, or you&rsquo;ll betray us at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently
about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any
further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance
of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them
inwards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep me here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other
invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed:
obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity
which was usually his chief characteristic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?&rdquo; said
Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door
behind them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&mdash;we were only cooling ourselves,&rdquo; stammered Bumble,
looking apprehensively about him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cooling yourselves!&rdquo; retorted Monks. &ldquo;Not all the rain that
ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell&rsquo;s fire out, as a
man can carry about with him. You won&rsquo;t cool yourself so easily;
don&rsquo;t think it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his
gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw
her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the woman, is it?&rdquo; demanded Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hem! That is the woman,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his
wife&rsquo;s caution.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?&rdquo; said the
matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know they will always keep <i>one</i> till it&rsquo;s found
out,&rdquo; said Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what may that be?&rdquo; asked the matron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The loss of their own good name,&rdquo; replied Monks. &ldquo;So, by the
same rule, if a woman&rsquo;s a party to a secret that might hang or transport
her, I&rsquo;m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you
understand, mistress?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Monks. &ldquo;How should
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two
companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the
apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof. He was
preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another
floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the
aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its
centre.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear it!&rdquo; he cried, shrinking back. &ldquo;Hear it! Rolling and
crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were
hiding from it. I hate the sound!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly
from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it
was much distorted and discoloured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These fits come over me, now and then,&rdquo; said Monks, observing his
alarm; &ldquo;and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don&rsquo;t mind me now;
it&rsquo;s all over for this once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the
window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at
the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the
ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that
were placed beneath it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves,
&ldquo;the sooner we come to our business, the better for all. The woman know
what it is, does she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by
intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died;
and that she told you something&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About the mother of the boy you named,&rdquo; replied the matron
interrupting him. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The first question is, of what nature was her communication?&rdquo; said
Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the second,&rdquo; observed the woman with much
deliberation. &ldquo;The first is, what may the communication be worth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?&rdquo;
asked Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Bumble: who
did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager
inquiry; &ldquo;there may be money&rsquo;s worth to get, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps there may,&rdquo; was the composed reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something that was taken from her,&rdquo; said Monks. &ldquo;Something
that she wore. Something that&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had better bid,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Bumble. &ldquo;I have heard
enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater
share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue
with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed towards his wife
and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when
the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it worth to you?&rdquo; asked the woman, as collectedly as
before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,&rdquo; replied Monks.
&ldquo;Speak out, and let me know which.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty
pounds in gold,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you all I
know. Not before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Five-and-twenty pounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Monks, drawing back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I spoke as plainly as I could,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bumble.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a large sum, either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it&rsquo;s
told!&rdquo; cried Monks impatiently; &ldquo;and which has been lying dead for
twelve years past or more!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in
course of time,&rdquo; answered the matron, still preserving the resolute
indifference she had assumed. &ldquo;As to lying dead, there are those who will
lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you
or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What if I pay it for nothing?&rdquo; asked Monks, hesitating.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can easily take it away again,&rdquo; replied the matron. &ldquo;I
am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,&rdquo; submitted Mr.
Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: &ldquo;<i>I</i> am here, my dear. And
besides,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, &ldquo;Mr.
Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.
Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a
little run to seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr.
Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very
uncommon strength, if I&rsquo;m once roused. I only want a little rousing;
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with
fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every
feature, that he <i>did</i> want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to
making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or
other person or persons trained down for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; &ldquo;and had better
hold your tongue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can&rsquo;t speak
in a lower tone,&rdquo; said Monks, grimly. &ldquo;So! He&rsquo;s your husband,
eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He my husband!&rdquo; tittered the matron, parrying the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought as much, when you came in,&rdquo; rejoined Monks, marking the
angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. &ldquo;So much
the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that
there&rsquo;s only one will between them. I&rsquo;m in earnest. See
here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out
twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;gather them up; and when this cursed peal of
thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone,
let&rsquo;s hear your story.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost
over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent
forward to listen to what the woman should say. The faces of the three nearly
touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear,
and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible. The sickly rays
of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness
and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and
darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,&rdquo; the matron
began, &ldquo;she and I were alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was there no one by?&rdquo; asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper;
&ldquo;No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and
might, by possibility, understand?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a soul,&rdquo; replied the woman; &ldquo;we were alone. <i>I</i>
stood alone beside the body when death came over it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Monks, regarding her attentively. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She spoke of a young creature,&rdquo; resumed the matron, &ldquo;who had
brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room,
but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay?&rdquo; said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his
shoulder, &ldquo;Blood! How things come about!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The child was the one you named to him last night,&rdquo; said the
matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; &ldquo;the mother this nurse
had robbed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In life?&rdquo; asked Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In death,&rdquo; replied the woman, with something like a shudder.
&ldquo;She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which
the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the
infant&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She sold it,&rdquo; cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; &ldquo;did
she sell it? Where? When? To whom? How long before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,&rdquo;
said the matron, &ldquo;she fell back and died.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Without saying more?&rdquo; cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very
suppression, seemed only the more furious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie! I&rsquo;ll
not be played with. She said more. I&rsquo;ll tear the life out of you both,
but I&rsquo;ll know what it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t utter another word,&rdquo; said the woman, to all
appearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange
man&rsquo;s violence; &ldquo;but she clutched my gown, violently, with one
hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed
the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which contained&mdash;&rdquo; interposed Monks, stretching forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied the woman; &ldquo;it was a pawnbroker&rsquo;s
duplicate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; demanded Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In good time I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I judge
that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to
better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money
to pay the pawnbroker&rsquo;s interest year by year, and prevent its running
out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed. Nothing had
come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and
tattered, in her hand. The time was out in two days; I thought something might
one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is it now?&rdquo; asked Monks quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>There</i>,&rdquo; replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved
of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough
for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands.
It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain
gold wedding-ring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It has the word &lsquo;Agnes&rsquo; engraved on the inside,&rdquo; said
the woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which
is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this is all?&rdquo; said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of
the contents of the little packet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All,&rdquo; replied the woman.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was
over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and
now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his
nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,&rdquo; said his
wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; &ldquo;and I want to know
nothing; for it&rsquo;s safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may
I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may ask,&rdquo; said Monks, with some show of surprise; &ldquo;but
whether I answer or not is another question.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;Which makes three,&rdquo; observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke
of facetiousness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that what you expected to get from me?&rdquo; demanded the matron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Monks. &ldquo;The other question?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; rejoined Monks; &ldquo;nor against me either. See here!
But don&rsquo;t move a step forward, or your life is not worth a
bulrush.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring
in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces
backward, with great precipitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look down,&rdquo; said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you
were seated over it, if that had been my game.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble
himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid water,
swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds
were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy
piles. There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing
round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained,
seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which
had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you flung a man&rsquo;s body down there, where would it be to-morrow
morning?&rdquo; said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,&rdquo; replied
Bumble, recoiling at the thought.
</p>

<p>
Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it;
and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and
was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It fell straight, and true
as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone.
</p>

<p>
The three looking into each other&rsquo;s faces, seemed to breathe more freely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back
into its former position. &ldquo;If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books
say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among
it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?&rdquo; said
Monks, with a threatening look. &ldquo;I am not afraid of your wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may depend upon me, young man,&rdquo; answered Mr. Bumble, bowing
himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. &ldquo;On
everybody&rsquo;s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,&rdquo; remarked Monks.
&ldquo;Light your lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble,
who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have
pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his lantern from that which
Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no
effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife.
Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that
there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without,
and the rushing of the water.
</p>

<p>
They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at
every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground,
walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a
gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors. The
gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks;
merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple
emerged into the wet and darkness outside.
</p>

<p>
They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible
repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere
below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he
had just quitted.

<h2><a name="chap39"></a> CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />
INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY
ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER
</h2>

<p>
On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the
last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated,
Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what
time of night it was.
</p>

<p>
The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he
had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same
quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former
lodgings. It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old
quarters: being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size;
lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close
and dirty lane. Nor were there wanting other indications of the good
gentleman&rsquo;s having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity
of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of
all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme
poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would
have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of
corroboration.
</p>

<p>
The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way
of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the
cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff,
black beard of a week&rsquo;s growth. The dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing
his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low
growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted
his attention. Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old
waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber&rsquo;s ordinary dress, was a
female: so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have
been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has
already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr.
Sikes&rsquo;s question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not long gone seven,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;How do you feel
to-night, Bill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As weak as water,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his
eyes and limbs. &ldquo;Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering
bed anyhow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s temper; for, as the girl raised him
up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and
struck her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whining are you?&rdquo; said Sikes. &ldquo;Come! Don&rsquo;t stand
snivelling there. If you can&rsquo;t do anything better than that, cut off
altogether. D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing
a laugh. &ldquo;What fancy have you got in your head now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;ve thought better of it, have you?&rdquo; growled Sikes,
marking the tear which trembled in her eye. &ldquo;All the better for you, you
have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say, you&rsquo;d be hard upon me to-night,
Bill,&rdquo; said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Mr. Sikes. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such a number of nights,&rdquo; said the girl, with a touch of
woman&rsquo;s tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone,
even to her voice: &ldquo;such a number of nights as I&rsquo;ve been patient
with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the
first that I&rsquo;ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn&rsquo;t have served me
as you did just now, if you&rsquo;d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say
you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Sikes, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t. Why,
damme, now, the girls&rsquo;s whining again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said the girl, throwing herself into a chair.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you seem to mind me. It&rsquo;ll soon be over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll be over?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice.
&ldquo;What foolery are you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and
don&rsquo;t come over me with your woman&rsquo;s nonsense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered,
would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and
exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr.
Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar
occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats. Not knowing, very well,
what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy&rsquo;s hysterics were
usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of,
without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that
mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here, my dear?&rdquo; said Fagin, looking in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lend a hand to the girl, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; replied Sikes
impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand chattering and grinning at me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl&rsquo;s assistance,
while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his
venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with
which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles
Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth,
and poured a portion of its contents down the patient&rsquo;s throat:
previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,&rdquo; said Mr.
Dawkins; &ldquo;and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the
petticuts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that
department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the
proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in producing the
desired effect. The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a
chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to
confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?&rdquo; he asked Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and
I&rsquo;ve brought something good with me, that you&rsquo;ll be glad to see.
Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we
spent all our money on, this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In compliance with Mr. Fagin&rsquo;s request, the Artful untied this bundle,
which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the
articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the
table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,&rdquo; exclaimed that young gentleman,
disclosing to view a huge pasty; &ldquo;sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch
tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there&rsquo;s
no occasion to pick &rsquo;em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so
precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it&rsquo;ll go nigh to
blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the
niggers didn&rsquo;t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of
goodness,&mdash;oh no! Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of
double Glo&rsquo;ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever
lushed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his extensive
pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the
same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he
carried: which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, Bill; you&rsquo;ll do now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sikes; &ldquo;I might have been done for,
twenty times over, afore you&rsquo;d have done anything to help me. What do you
mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted
wagabond?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only hear him, boys!&rdquo; said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders.
&ldquo;And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The things is well enough in their way,&rdquo; observed Mr. Sikes: a
little soothed as he glanced over the table; &ldquo;but what have you got to
say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health,
blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal
time, than if I was that &rsquo;ere dog.&mdash;Drive him down, Charley!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never see such a jolly dog as that,&rdquo; cried Master Bates, doing
as he was desired. &ldquo;Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market!
He&rsquo;d make his fortun&rsquo; on the stage that dog would, and rewive the
drayma besides.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your din,&rdquo; cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed:
still growling angrily. &ldquo;What have you got to say for yourself, you
withered old fence, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,&rdquo;
replied the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what about the other fortnight?&rdquo; demanded Sikes. &ldquo;What
about the other fortnight that you&rsquo;ve left me lying here, like a sick rat
in his hole?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, Bill. I can&rsquo;t go into a long explanation
before company; but I couldn&rsquo;t help it, upon my honour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon your what?&rdquo; growled Sikes, with excessive disgust.
&ldquo;Here! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste
of that out of my mouth, or it&rsquo;ll choke me dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be out of temper, my dear,&rdquo; urged Fagin, submissively.
&ldquo;I have never forgot you, Bill; never once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ll pound it that you han&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Sikes, with
a bitter grin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour
that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill
was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well:
and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the girl,
I might have died.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There now, Bill,&rdquo; remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the
word. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was
the means of your having such a handy girl about you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says true enough there!&rdquo; said Nancy, coming hastily forward.
&ldquo;Let him be; let him be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nancy&rsquo;s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,
receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of
which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow
of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to
regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very
heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the
spirit-bottle, he condescended to make.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Sikes; &ldquo;but I must have
some blunt from you to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a piece of coin about me,&rdquo; replied the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got lots at home,&rdquo; retorted Sikes; &ldquo;and I
must have some from there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lots!&rdquo; cried Fagin, holding up is hands. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t so
much as would&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;ve got, and I dare say you hardly
know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,&rdquo; said
Sikes; &ldquo;but I must have some to-night; and that&rsquo;s flat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Fagin, with a sigh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send the
Artful round presently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Sikes.
&ldquo;The Artful&rsquo;s a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose
his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse,
if you put him up to it. Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all
sure; and I&rsquo;ll lie down and have a snooze while she&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of
the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence:
protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him
eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he
couldn&rsquo;t get any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and
Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The Jew then, taking leave of
his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr.
Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep
away the time until the young lady&rsquo;s return.
</p>

<p>
In due course, they arrived at Fagin&rsquo;s abode, where they found Toby
Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it
is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his
fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends. Mr.
Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a
gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and
inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has nobody been, Toby?&rdquo; asked Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a living leg,&rdquo; answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s been as dull as swipes. You ought to stand something
handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I&rsquo;m
as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I
hadn&rsquo;t had the good natur&rsquo; to amuse this youngster. Horrid dull,
I&rsquo;m blessed if I an&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept up
his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as
though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a
man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much
elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances
on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he
considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that
he didn&rsquo;t value his losses the snap of his little finger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!&rdquo; said Master Bates, highly amused by
this declaration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Chitling. &ldquo;Am I, Fagin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A very clever fellow, my dear,&rdquo; said Fagin, patting him on the
shoulder, and winking to his other pupils.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an&rsquo;t he, Fagin?&rdquo; asked
Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No doubt at all of that, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an&rsquo;t it,
Fagin?&rdquo; pursued Tom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very much so, indeed, my dear. They&rsquo;re only jealous, Tom, because
he won&rsquo;t give it to them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Tom, triumphantly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where it is! He
has cleaned me out. But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can&rsquo;t
I, Fagin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up
your loss at once, and don&rsquo;t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley!
It&rsquo;s time you were on the lay. Come! It&rsquo;s near ten, and nothing
done yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and
left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in
many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but
justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as
there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much
higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great
number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established
their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Fagin, when they had left the room, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go and get you that cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard
where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money,
for I&rsquo;ve got none to lock up, my dear&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;none to
lock up. It&rsquo;s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I&rsquo;m fond of
seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.
Hush!&rdquo; he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast;
&ldquo;who&rsquo;s that? Listen!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way
interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came
or went: until the murmur of a man&rsquo;s voice reached her ears. The instant
she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of
lightning, and thrust them under the table. The Jew, turning round immediately
afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that
contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this
action: which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards
her at the time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the man I expected before; he&rsquo;s coming downstairs. Not
a word about the money while he&rsquo;s here, Nance. He won&rsquo;t stop long.
Not ten minutes, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the
door, as a man&rsquo;s step was heard upon the stairs without. He reached it,
at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close
upon the girl before he observed her.
</p>

<p>
It was Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only one of my young people,&rdquo; said Fagin, observing that Monks
drew back, on beholding a stranger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, Nancy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of
careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole
another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had
been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two
looks to have proceeded from the same person.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; inquired Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;good?&rdquo; asked Fagin, hesitating as though he
feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not bad, any way,&rdquo; replied Monks with a smile. &ldquo;I have been
prompt enough this time. Let me have a word with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room,
although she could see that Monks was pointing to her. The Jew: perhaps fearing
she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of
her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not that infernal hole we were in before,&rdquo; she could hear the man
say as they went upstairs. Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not
reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the
second story.
</p>

<p>
Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the
girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and
muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest.
The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with
incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above.
</p>

<p>
The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided
back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men
were heard descending. Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled
upstairs again for the money. When he returned, the girl was adjusting her
shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Nance!&rdquo; exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the
candle, &ldquo;how pale you are!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pale!&rdquo; echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to
look steadily at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I
don&rsquo;t know how long and all,&rdquo; replied the girl carelessly.
&ldquo;Come! Let me get back; that&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand. They
parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a
&ldquo;good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and
seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way.
Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in
which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually
resolved into a violent run. After completely exhausting herself, she stopped
to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her
inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into
tears.
</p>

<p>
It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness
of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great
rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to
keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts: soon reached the
dwelling where she had left the housebreaker.
</p>

<p>
If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did
not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and
receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and
replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had
interrupted.
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much
employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so
beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he
had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and
deportment. That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on
the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common
struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who
would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the
niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings
than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour
towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition,
as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed,
troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more
perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his
suspicions.
</p>

<p>
As that day closed in, the girl&rsquo;s excitement increased; and, when night
came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself
asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that
even Sikes observed with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with
his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy
to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first
struck him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, burn my body!&rdquo; said the man, raising himself on his hands as
he stared the girl in the face. &ldquo;You look like a corpse come to life
again. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Matter!&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;Nothing. What do you look at me
so hard for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What foolery is this?&rdquo; demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm,
and shaking her roughly. &ldquo;What is it? What do you mean? What are you
thinking of?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of many things, Bill,&rdquo; replied the girl, shivering, and as she did
so, pressing her hands upon her eyes. &ldquo;But, Lord! What odds in
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to
produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had
preceded them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you wot it is,&rdquo; said Sikes; &ldquo;if you haven&rsquo;t
caught the fever, and got it comin&rsquo; on, now, there&rsquo;s something more
than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too. You&rsquo;re not a-going
to&mdash;. No, damme! you wouldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and
muttering the words to himself; &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t a stauncher-hearted
gal going, or I&rsquo;d have cut her throat three months ago. She&rsquo;s got
the fever coming on; that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom,
and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The girl jumped up,
with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and
held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the robber, &ldquo;come and sit aside of me, and put on
your own face; or I&rsquo;ll alter it so, that you won&rsquo;t know it agin
when you do want it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow:
turning his eyes upon her face. They closed; opened again; closed once more;
again opened. He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and
again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of
terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while
in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep. The grasp of his
hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one
in a profound trance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The laudanum has taken effect at last,&rdquo; murmured the girl, as she
rose from the bedside. &ldquo;I may be too late, even now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round,
from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every
moment to feel the pressure of Sikes&rsquo;s heavy hand upon her shoulder;
then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber&rsquo;s lips; and
then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the
house.
</p>

<p>
A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which she had
to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has it long gone the half-hour?&rdquo; asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll strike the hour in another quarter,&rdquo; said the man:
raising his lantern to her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,&rdquo; muttered
Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.
</p>

<p>
Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through
which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West-End of
London. The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience. She tore along the
narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost
under the horses&rsquo; heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of
persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The woman is mad!&rdquo; said the people, turning to look after her as
she rushed away.
</p>

<p>
When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were
comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater
curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. Some quickened their pace
behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and
a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed;
but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she
was alone.
</p>

<p>
It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. As the
brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the
spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces as though
irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her,
and she stepped into the hall. The porter&rsquo;s seat was vacant. She looked
round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, young woman!&rdquo; said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from
a door behind her, &ldquo;who do you want here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A lady who is stopping in this house,&rdquo; answered the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A lady!&rdquo; was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look.
&ldquo;What lady?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Maylie,&rdquo; said Nancy.
</p>

<p>
The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a
look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. To him, Nancy
repeated her request.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What name am I to say?&rdquo; asked the waiter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use saying any,&rdquo; replied Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor business?&rdquo; said the man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, nor that neither,&rdquo; rejoined the girl. &ldquo;I must see the
lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said the man, pushing her towards the door. &ldquo;None of
this. Take yourself off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be carried out if I go!&rdquo; said the girl violently;
&ldquo;and I can make that a job that two of you won&rsquo;t like to do.
Isn&rsquo;t there anybody here,&rdquo; she said, looking round, &ldquo;that
will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with some
of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take it up for her, Joe; can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said this person.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good?&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This allusion to Nancy&rsquo;s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of
chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great
fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated
her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do what you like with me,&rdquo; said the girl, turning to the men
again; &ldquo;but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message
for God Almighty&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man
who had first appeared undertook its delivery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to be?&rdquo; said the man, with one foot on the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,&rdquo;
said Nancy; &ldquo;and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has
to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out
of doors as an impostor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re coming it strong!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You give the message,&rdquo; said the girl firmly; &ldquo;and let me
hear the answer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man ran upstairs. Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening
with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the
chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so,
when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good being proper in this world,&rdquo; said the first
housemaid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,&rdquo; said
the second.
</p>

<p>
The third contented herself with wondering &ldquo;what ladies was made
of&rdquo;; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of
&ldquo;Shameful!&rdquo; with which the Dianas concluded.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed
the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from
the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.

<h2><a name="chap40"></a> CHAPTER XL.<br />
A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER </h2>

<p>
The girl&rsquo;s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most
noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the
woman&rsquo;s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light
step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and
thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment
contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as
though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought
this interview.
</p>

<p>
But struggling with these better feelings was pride,&mdash;the vice of the
lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self-assured.
The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low
haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within
the shadow of the gallows itself,&mdash;even this degraded being felt too proud
to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness,
but which alone connected her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had
obliterated so many, many traces when a very child.
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented
itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the
ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard matter to get to see you, lady. If I had taken
offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you&rsquo;d have been sorry
for it one day, and not without reason either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,&rdquo; replied
Rose. &ldquo;Do not think of that. Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the
person you inquired for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence
of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by
surprise, and she burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, lady, lady!&rdquo; she said, clasping her hands passionately before
her face, &ldquo;if there was more like you, there would be fewer like
me,&mdash;there would&mdash;there would!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Rose, earnestly. &ldquo;If you are in poverty or
affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,&mdash;I shall indeed.
Sit down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me stand, lady,&rdquo; said the girl, still weeping, &ldquo;and do
not speak to me so kindly till you know me better. It is growing late.
Is&mdash;is&mdash;that door shut?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer
assistance in case she should require it. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I am about to put my life and the
lives of others in your hands. I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to
old Fagin&rsquo;s on the night he went out from the house in
Pentonville.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Rose Maylie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I, lady!&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I am the infamous creature you
have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first
moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known
any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God! Do
not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you would think, to
look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women fall back, as I make my
way along the crowded pavement.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What dreadful things are these!&rdquo; said Rose, involuntarily falling
from her strange companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,&rdquo; cried the girl,
&ldquo;that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and
that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness,
and&mdash;and&mdash;something worse than all&mdash;as I have been from my
cradle. I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they
will be my deathbed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I pity you!&rdquo; said Rose, in a broken voice. &ldquo;It wrings my
heart to hear you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heaven bless you for your goodness!&rdquo; rejoined the girl. &ldquo;If
you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away
from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell
you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He knows you,&rdquo; replied the girl; &ldquo;and knew you were here,
for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never heard the name,&rdquo; said Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then he goes by some other amongst us,&rdquo; rejoined the girl,
&ldquo;which I more than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver
was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I&mdash;suspecting this
man&mdash;listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark. I
found out, from what I heard, that Monks&mdash;the man I asked you about, you
know&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;That Monks,&rdquo; pursued the girl, &ldquo;had seen him
accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him
directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn&rsquo;t
make out why. A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he
should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief,
which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo; asked Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of
finding out,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;and there are not many people besides
me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery. But I did;
and I saw him no more till last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what occurred then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, lady. Last night he came again. Again they went
upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me,
again listened at the door. The first words I heard Monks say were these:
&lsquo;So the only proofs of the boy&rsquo;s identity lie at the bottom of the
river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her
coffin.&rsquo; They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and
Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had
got the young devil&rsquo;s money safely now, he&rsquo;d rather have had it the
other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast
of the father&rsquo;s will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then
hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after
having made a good profit of him besides.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is all this!&rdquo; said Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,&rdquo; replied the girl.
&ldquo;Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to
yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy&rsquo;s life
without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn&rsquo;t,
he&rsquo;d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took
advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. &lsquo;In short,
Fagin,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as
I&rsquo;ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those were his words,&rdquo; said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she
had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes
haunted her perpetually. &ldquo;And more. When he spoke of you and the other
lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him, that
Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort
in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would
you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged spaniel was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do not mean,&rdquo; said Rose, turning very pale, &ldquo;to tell me
that this was said in earnest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,&rdquo; replied
the girl, shaking her head. &ldquo;He is an earnest man when his hatred is up.
I know many who do worse things; but I&rsquo;d rather listen to them all a
dozen times, than to that Monks once. It is growing late, and I have to reach
home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this. I must get
back quickly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what can I do?&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;To what use can I turn this
communication without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to companions you
paint in such terrible colors? If you repeat this information to a gentleman
whom I can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to
some place of safety without half an hour&rsquo;s delay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish to go back,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I must go back,
because&mdash;how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like
you?&mdash;because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most
desperate among them all; that I can&rsquo;t leave: no, not even to be saved
from the life I am leading now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your having interfered in this dear boy&rsquo;s behalf before,&rdquo;
said Rose; &ldquo;your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you
have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your
evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might
yet be reclaimed. Oh!&rdquo; said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the
tears coursed down her face, &ldquo;do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of
one of your own sex; the first&mdash;the first, I do believe, who ever appealed
to you in the voice of pity and compassion. Do hear my words, and let me save
you yet, for better things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; cried the girl, sinking on her knees, &ldquo;dear, sweet,
angel lady, you <i>are</i> the first that ever blessed me with such words as
these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life
of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is never too late,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;for penitence and
atonement.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; &ldquo;I
cannot leave him now! I could not be his death.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should you be?&rdquo; asked Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing could save him,&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;If I told others
what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He
is the boldest, and has been so cruel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; cried Rose, &ldquo;that for such a man as this,
you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is
madness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; answered the girl; &ldquo;I only
know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad
and wretched as myself. I must go back. Whether it is God&rsquo;s wrath for the
wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every
suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to
die by his hand at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;I should not let you depart
from me thus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should, lady, and I know you will,&rdquo; rejoined the girl, rising.
&ldquo;You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and
forced no promise from you, as I might have done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?&rdquo; said Rose.
&ldquo;This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me,
benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a
secret, and advise you what to do,&rdquo; rejoined the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But where can I find you again when it is necessary?&rdquo; asked Rose.
&ldquo;I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will
you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come
alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be
watched or followed?&rdquo; asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I promise you solemnly,&rdquo; answered Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,&rdquo;
said the girl without hesitation, &ldquo;I will walk on London Bridge if I am
alive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stay another moment,&rdquo; interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly
towards the door. &ldquo;Think once again on your own condition, and the
opportunity you have of escaping from it. You have a claim on me: not only as
the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond
redemption. Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a
word can save you? What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you
cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is there no chord in your heart that I can
touch! Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible
infatuation!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,&rdquo; replied
the girl steadily, &ldquo;give away your hearts, love will carry you all
lengths&mdash;even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers,
everything, to fill them. When such as I, who have no certain roof but the
coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our
rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank
through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us? Pity us,
lady&mdash;pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for
having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new
means of violence and suffering.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; said Rose, after a pause, &ldquo;take some money from
me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty&mdash;at all events until
we meet again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a penny,&rdquo; replied the girl, waving her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,&rdquo; said
Rose, stepping gently forward. &ldquo;I wish to serve you indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would serve me best, lady,&rdquo; replied the girl, wringing her
hands, &ldquo;if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to
think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something
not to die in the hell in which I have lived. God bless you, sweet lady, and
send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while Rose
Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the
semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and
endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap41"></a> CHAPTER XLI.<br />
CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES,
SELDOM COME ALONE </h2>

<p>
Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While she
felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which
Oliver&rsquo;s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the
confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had
reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner had touched
Rose Maylie&rsquo;s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and
scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the
outcast back to repentance and hope.
</p>

<p>
They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some
weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of the first day.
What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in
eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting
suspicion?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was
too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman&rsquo;s impetuosity, and
foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his
indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver&rsquo;s recapture, to
trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl&rsquo;s behalf
could be seconded by no experienced person. These were all reasons for the
greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs.
Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the
worthy doctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she
had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason.
Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this
awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her
to call him back, when&mdash;the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this
train of reflection&mdash;he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and
to be happier away.
</p>

<p>
Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then
to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration
presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night. After
more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion
of consulting Harry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it be painful to him,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;to come back here,
how painful it will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he
may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me&mdash;he did when he
went away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.&rdquo; And
here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was
to be her messenger should not see her weep.
</p>

<p>
She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had
considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the
first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles
for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent
agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What makes you look so flurried?&rdquo; asked Rose, advancing to meet
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,&rdquo; replied the
boy. &ldquo;Oh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be
able to know that I have told you the truth!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,&rdquo; said
Rose, soothing him. &ldquo;But what is this?&mdash;of whom do you speak?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen the gentleman,&rdquo; replied Oliver, scarcely able to
articulate, &ldquo;the gentleman who was so good to me&mdash;Mr. Brownlow, that
we have so often talked about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Getting out of a coach,&rdquo; replied Oliver, shedding tears of
delight, &ldquo;and going into a house. I didn&rsquo;t speak to him&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t speak to him, for he didn&rsquo;t see me, and I trembled so,
that I was not able to go up to him. But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived
there, and they said he did. Look here,&rdquo; said Oliver, opening a scrap of
paper, &ldquo;here it is; here&rsquo;s where he lives&mdash;I&rsquo;m going
there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me! What shall I do when I come to see him
and hear him speak again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other
incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street,
in the Strand. She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and
be ready to go with me. I will take you there directly, without a
minute&rsquo;s loss of time. I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for
an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes
they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived there, Rose left
Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive
him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on
very pressing business. The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk
upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an
elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. At no great
distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and
gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his
hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily
rising with great politeness, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, young lady&mdash;I
imagined it was some importunate person who&mdash;I beg you will excuse me. Be
seated, pray.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?&rdquo; said Rose, glancing from the other
gentleman to the one who had spoken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is my name,&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;This is my
friend, Mr. Grimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; interposed Miss Maylie, &ldquo;that at this period of
our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If I
am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak
to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow inclined his head. Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow,
and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it
again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,&rdquo; said Rose,
naturally embarrassed; &ldquo;but you once showed great benevolence and
goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an
interest in hearing of him again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oliver Twist you knew him as,&rdquo; replied Rose.
</p>

<p>
The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting
to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash,
and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression
but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare;
then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as
it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight
before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be
discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his
stomach.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed
in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie&rsquo;s,
and said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the
question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody
else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence
which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of
that poor child, in Heaven&rsquo;s name put me in possession of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bad one! I&rsquo;ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,&rdquo; growled
Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of
his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,&rdquo; said Rose,
colouring; &ldquo;and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his
years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour
to many who have numbered his days six times over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only sixty-one,&rdquo; said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid
face. &ldquo;And, as the devil&rsquo;s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years
old at least, I don&rsquo;t see the application of that remark.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;he
does not mean what he says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he does,&rdquo; growled Mr. Grimwig.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he does not,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as
he spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll eat his head, if he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; growled Mr.
Grimwig.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,&rdquo; said Mr.
Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he&rsquo;d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,&rdquo;
responded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and
afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Miss Maylie,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;to return to the
subject in which your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what
intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I
exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have
been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me,
and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been
considerably shaken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few
natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s
house; reserving Nancy&rsquo;s information for that gentleman&rsquo;s private
ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months
past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;This is great happiness
to me, great happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie.
You must pardon my finding fault with you,&mdash;but why not have brought
him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is waiting in a coach at the door,&rdquo; replied Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At this door!&rdquo; cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out
of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without
another word.
</p>

<p>
When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head, and
converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three
distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it
all the time. After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he
could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly
before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this
unusual proceeding. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I&rsquo;m old enough to be
your grandfather. You&rsquo;re a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, Mr.
Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very
graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward
for all her anxiety and care in Oliver&rsquo;s behalf, Rose Maylie would have
been well repaid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,&rdquo;
said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. &ldquo;Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you
please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a
curtsey at the door, waited for orders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, rather
testily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, that I do, sir,&rdquo; replied the old lady. &ldquo;People&rsquo;s
eyes, at my time of life, don&rsquo;t improve with age, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could have told you that,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;but put
on your glasses, and see if you can&rsquo;t find out what you were wanted for,
will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But
Oliver&rsquo;s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to
his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God be good to me!&rdquo; cried the old lady, embracing him; &ldquo;it
is my innocent boy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear old nurse!&rdquo; cried Oliver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He would come back&mdash;I knew he would,&rdquo; said the old lady,
holding him in her arms. &ldquo;How well he looks, and how like a
gentleman&rsquo;s son he is dressed again! Where have you been, this long, long
while? Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so
sad. I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every
day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was
a lightsome young creature.&rdquo; Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from
her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers
fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.
</p>

<p>
Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way
into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview
with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity. Rose also
explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first
instance. The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and
readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. To
afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was
arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o&rsquo;clock that evening,
and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that
had occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home.
</p>

<p>
Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor&rsquo;s wrath.
Nancy&rsquo;s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a
shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first
victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put
on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those
worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the
intention into effect without a moment&rsquo;s consideration of the
consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence
on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and
party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to
dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what the devil is to be done?&rdquo; said the impetuous doctor,
when they had rejoined the two ladies. &ldquo;Are we to pass a vote of thanks
to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred
pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight
acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly that,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; &ldquo;but we
must proceed gently and with great care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gentleness and care,&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d send
them one and all to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind where,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;But reflect
whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in
view.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What object?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simply, the discovery of Oliver&rsquo;s parentage, and regaining for him
the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently
deprived.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his
pocket-handkerchief; &ldquo;I almost forgot that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;placing this poor girl
entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these
scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we
bring about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,&rdquo; suggested the
doctor, &ldquo;and transporting the rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; &ldquo;but no doubt
they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we
step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very
Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest&mdash;or at least to
Oliver&rsquo;s, which is the same thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting
to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his
knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not
surrounded by these people. For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof
against him. He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us)
concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged,
it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being
committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his
mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes,
be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the doctor impetuously, &ldquo;I put it to you again,
whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be
considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but
really&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,&rdquo; said Mr.
Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. &ldquo;The promise shall
be kept. I don&rsquo;t think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with
our proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action,
it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will
point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us,
and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her
such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us
to identify him. She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday. I
would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these
matters secret even from Oliver himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay
of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him
just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr.
Brownlow, that gentleman&rsquo;s proposition was carried unanimously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to call in the aid of my friend
Grimwig. He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of
material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted
the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in
twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine
for yourselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in
mine,&rdquo; said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must put it to the vote,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;who may
he be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That lady&rsquo;s son, and this young lady&rsquo;s&mdash;very old
friend,&rdquo; said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding
with an expressive glance at her niece.
</p>

<p>
Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion
(possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig
were accordingly added to the committee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We stay in town, of course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &ldquo;while there
remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of
success. I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in
which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it
be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;And as I see on the faces
about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to
corroborate Oliver&rsquo;s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me
stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it
expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe me, I make this
request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to
be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite
numerous enough. Come! Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all
alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have
wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him
forth upon the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and escorted
her into the supper-room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council
was, for the present, effectually broken up.

<h2><a name="chap42"></a> CHAPTER XLII.<br />
AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER&rsquo;S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,
BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS </h2>

<p>
Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on her
self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by the
Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history
should bestow some attention.
</p>

<p>
They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male
and female: for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed,
shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise
age,&mdash;looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and
when they are almost men, like overgrown boys. The woman was young, but of a
robust and hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy
bundle which was strapped to her back. Her companion was not encumbered with
much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his
shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light
enough. This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of
unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in
advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk
of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater
exertion.
</p>

<p>
Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object
within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the
mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through
Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to
his companion,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, can&rsquo;t yer? What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a heavy load, I can tell you,&rdquo; said the female, coming
up, almost breathless with fatigue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heavy! What are yer talking about? What are yer made for?&rdquo;
rejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the
other shoulder. &ldquo;Oh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer
ain&rsquo;t enough to tire anybody&rsquo;s patience out, I don&rsquo;t know
what is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it much farther?&rdquo; asked the woman, resting herself against a
bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much farther! Yer as good as there,&rdquo; said the long-legged tramper,
pointing out before him. &ldquo;Look there! Those are the lights of
London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a good two mile off, at least,&rdquo; said the woman
despondingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind whether they&rsquo;re two mile off, or twenty,&rdquo; said
Noah Claypole; for he it was; &ldquo;but get up and come on, or I&rsquo;ll kick
yer, and so I give yer notice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Noah&rsquo;s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road
while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the
woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?&rdquo; she asked, after
they had walked a few hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; replied Noah, whose temper had been
considerably impaired by walking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Near, I hope,&rdquo; said Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not near,&rdquo; replied Mr. Claypole. &ldquo;There! Not near; so
don&rsquo;t think it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I tell yer that I don&rsquo;t mean to do a thing, that&rsquo;s
enough, without any why or because either,&rdquo; replied Mr. Claypole with
dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t be so cross,&rdquo; said his companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A pretty thing it would be, wouldn&rsquo;t it to go and stop at the very
first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after
us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs
on,&rdquo; said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. &ldquo;No! I shall go and lose
myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the
very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on. &ldquo;Cod, yer may thanks yer
stars I&rsquo;ve got a head; for if we hadn&rsquo;t gone, at first, the wrong
road a purpose, and come back across country, yer&rsquo;d have been locked up
hard and fast a week ago, my lady. And serve yer right for being a fool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know I ain&rsquo;t as cunning as you are,&rdquo; replied Charlotte;
&ldquo;but don&rsquo;t put all the blame on me, and say I should have been
locked up. You would have been if I had been, any way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,&rdquo; said Mr.
Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I took it for you, Noah, dear,&rdquo; rejoined Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did I keep it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you
are,&rdquo; said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm
through his.
</p>

<p>
This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole&rsquo;s habit to
repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in
justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent, in
order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her: which would
leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would
greatly facilitate his chances of escape. Of course, he entered at this
juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly
together.
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without halting,
until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely judged, from the
crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in earnest. Just
pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently
the most to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John&rsquo;s Road, and was soon
deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between
Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the
lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London.
</p>

<p>
Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him; now
stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of
some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance
induced him to believe it too public for his purpose. At length, he stopped in
front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet
seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement,
graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So give us the bundle,&rdquo; said Noah, unstrapping it from the
woman&rsquo;s shoulders, and slinging it over his own; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t
yer speak, except when yer spoke to. What&rsquo;s the name of the
house&mdash;t-h-r&mdash;three what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cripples,&rdquo; said Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three Cripples,&rdquo; repeated Noah, &ldquo;and a very good sign too.
Now, then! Keep close at my heels, and come along.&rdquo; With these
injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the
house, followed by his companion.
</p>

<p>
There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on the
counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at Noah, and Noah
stared very hard at him.
</p>

<p>
If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy&rsquo;s dress, there might have
been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded
the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his leathers, there
seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a
public-house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this the Three Cripples?&rdquo; asked Noah.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the dabe of this &rsquo;ouse,&rdquo; replied the Jew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended
us here,&rdquo; said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to
this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to
betray no surprise. &ldquo;We want to sleep here to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;b dot certaid you cad,&rdquo; said Barney, who was the attendant
sprite; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll idquire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while
yer inquiring, will yer?&rdquo; said Noah.
</p>

<p>
Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the
required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that
they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their
refreshment.
</p>

<p>
Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so
that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which
concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment,
about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in
the back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a
dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had
to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain
with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation. The landlord of the
house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and
Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when
Fagin, in the course of his evening&rsquo;s business, came into the bar to
inquire after some of his young pupils.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Barney: &ldquo;stradegers id the next roob.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Strangers!&rdquo; repeated the old man in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! Ad rub uds too,&rdquo; added Barney. &ldquo;Frob the cuttry, but
subthig in your way, or I&rsquo;b bistaked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.
</p>

<p>
Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from
which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish, and
porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte,
who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he whispered, looking round to Barney, &ldquo;I like that
fellow&rsquo;s looks. He&rsquo;d be of use to us; he knows how to train the
girl already. Don&rsquo;t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me
hear &rsquo;em talk&mdash;let me hear &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the partition,
listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his face, that might
have appertained to some old goblin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I mean to be a gentleman,&rdquo; said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his
legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had
arrived too late to hear. &ldquo;No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a
gentleman&rsquo;s life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like that well enough, dear,&rdquo; replied Charlotte;
&ldquo;but tills ain&rsquo;t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear
off after it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tills be blowed!&rdquo; said Mr. Claypole; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s more
things besides tills to be emptied.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked his companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pockets, women&rsquo;s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!&rdquo;
said Mr. Claypole, rising with the porter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do all that, dear,&rdquo; said Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall look out to get into company with them as can,&rdquo; replied
Noah. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why,
you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and
deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!&rdquo; exclaimed Charlotte,
imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;ll do: don&rsquo;t yer be too affectionate, in case
I&rsquo;m cross with yer,&rdquo; said Noah, disengaging himself with great
gravity. &ldquo;I should like to be the captain of some band, and have the
whopping of &rsquo;em, and follering &rsquo;em about, unbeknown to themselves.
That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with
some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note
you&rsquo;ve got,&mdash;especially as we don&rsquo;t very well know how to get
rid of it ourselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot with an
aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded
condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly
refreshed. He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and
the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
The stranger was Mr. Fagin. And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow he
made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered
something to drink of the grinning Barney.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,&rdquo; said Fagin,
rubbing his hands. &ldquo;From the country, I see, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do yer see that?&rdquo; asked Noah Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have not so much dust as that in London,&rdquo; replied Fagin,
pointing from Noah&rsquo;s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to
the two bundles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yer a sharp feller,&rdquo; said Noah. &ldquo;Ha! ha! only hear that,
Charlotte!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew,
sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the
truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right
forefinger,&mdash;a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not with
complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the
purpose. However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a
perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which Barney
reappeared with, in a very friendly manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good stuff that,&rdquo; observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;A man need be always emptying a till, or
a pocket, or a woman&rsquo;s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank,
if he drinks it regularly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell
back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of
ashy paleness and excessive terror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, my dear,&rdquo; said Fagin, drawing his chair
closer. &ldquo;Ha! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It
was very lucky it was only me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; stammered Noah, no longer stretching out
his legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could
under his chair; &ldquo;it was all her doing; yer&rsquo;ve got it now,
Charlotte, yer know yer have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No matter who&rsquo;s got it, or who did it, my dear,&rdquo; replied
Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk&rsquo;s eye at the girl and the two
bundles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in that way myself, and I like you for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In that way of business,&rdquo; rejoined Fagin; &ldquo;and so are the
people of the house. You&rsquo;ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as
safe here as you could be. There is not a safer place in all this town than is
the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so. And I have taken a fancy to
you and the young woman; so I&rsquo;ve said the word, and you may make your
minds easy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noah Claypole&rsquo;s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but
his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various
uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and
suspicion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you more,&rdquo; said Fagin, after he had reassured the
girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. &ldquo;I have got a
friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right
way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit
you best at first, and be taught all the others.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,&rdquo; replied Noah.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?&rdquo; inquired
Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;Here! Let me have a word with you
outside.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,&rdquo; said
Noah, getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
take the luggage upstairs the while. Charlotte, see to them bundles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without
the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the
packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s kept tolerably well under, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he asked
as he resumed his seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite perfect,&rdquo; rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a genius, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I suppose if I wasn&rsquo;t, I shouldn&rsquo;t be here,&rdquo;
replied Noah. &ldquo;But, I say, she&rsquo;ll be back if yer lose time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, what do you think?&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;If you was to like my
friend, could you do better than join him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he in a good way of business; that&rsquo;s where it is!&rdquo;
responded Noah, winking one of his little eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society
in the profession.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Regular town-maders?&rdquo; asked Mr. Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a countryman among &rsquo;em; and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d
take you, even on my recommendation, if he didn&rsquo;t run rather short of
assistants just now,&rdquo; replied Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Should I have to hand over?&rdquo; said Noah, slapping his
breeches-pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be done without,&rdquo; replied Fagin, in a
most decided manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twenty pound, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lot of money!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not when it&rsquo;s in a note you can&rsquo;t get rid of,&rdquo;
retorted Fagin. &ldquo;Number and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the
Bank? Ah! It&rsquo;s not worth much to him. It&rsquo;ll have to go abroad, and
he couldn&rsquo;t sell it for a great deal in the market.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When could I see him?&rdquo; asked Noah doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Noah. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the wages?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Live like a gentleman&mdash;board and lodging, pipes and spirits
free&mdash;half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Fagin.
</p>

<p>
Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive,
would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly free
agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of his
refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice
immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he gradually relented,
and said he thought that would suit him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, yer see,&rdquo; observed Noah, &ldquo;as she will be able to do a
good deal, I should like to take something very light.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little fancy work?&rdquo; suggested Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! something of that sort,&rdquo; replied Noah. &ldquo;What do you
think would suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not
very dangerous, you know. That&rsquo;s the sort of thing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my
dear,&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;My friend wants somebody who would do that
well, very much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn&rsquo;t mind turning my hand to
it sometimes,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; &ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t
pay by itself, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to
ruminate. &ldquo;No, it might not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think, then?&rdquo; asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.
&ldquo;Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not
much more risk than being at home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think of the old ladies?&rdquo; asked Fagin.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and
parcels, and running round the corner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?&rdquo;
asked Noah, shaking his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that would answer my
purpose. Ain&rsquo;t there any other line open?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah&rsquo;s knee.
&ldquo;The kinchin lay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The kinchins, my dear,&rdquo; said Fagin, &ldquo;is the young children
that&rsquo;s sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings;
and the lay is just to take their money away&mdash;they&rsquo;ve always got it
ready in their hands,&mdash;then knock &rsquo;em into the kennel, and walk off
very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and
hurt itself. Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.
&ldquo;Lord, that&rsquo;s the very thing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure it is,&rdquo; replied Fagin; &ldquo;and you can have a few
good beats chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods
like that, where they&rsquo;re always going errands; and you can upset as many
kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a burst of
laughter both long and loud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Noah, when he had recovered
himself, and Charlotte had returned. &ldquo;What time to-morrow shall we
say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will ten do?&rdquo; asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent,
&ldquo;What name shall I tell my good friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Bolter,&rdquo; replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such
emergency. &ldquo;Mr. Morris Bolter. This is Mrs. Bolter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Bolter&rsquo;s humble servant,&rdquo; said Fagin, bowing with
grotesque politeness. &ldquo;I hope I shall know her better very
shortly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?&rdquo; thundered Mr. Claypole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Noah, dear!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,&rdquo; said Mr.
Morris Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I understand&mdash;perfectly,&rdquo; replied Fagin, telling the
truth for once. &ldquo;Good-night! Good-night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah Claypole,
bespeaking his good lady&rsquo;s attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative
to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of
superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman
who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in
London and its vicinity.

<h2><a name="chap43"></a> CHAPTER XLIII.<br />
WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE </h2>

<p>
&ldquo;And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into between
them, he had removed next day to Fagin&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Cod, I thought as
much last night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every man&rsquo;s his own friend, my dear,&rdquo; replied Fagin, with
his most insinuating grin. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t as good a one as himself
anywhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Except sometimes,&rdquo; replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a
man of the world. &ldquo;Some people are nobody&rsquo;s enemies but their own,
yer know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s
his own enemy, it&rsquo;s only because he&rsquo;s too much his own friend; not
because he&rsquo;s careful for everybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There
ain&rsquo;t such a thing in nature.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There oughn&rsquo;t to be, if there is,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bolter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That stands to reason. Some conjurers say that number three is the magic
number, and some say number seven. It&rsquo;s neither, my friend, neither.
It&rsquo;s number one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bolter. &ldquo;Number one for ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In a little community like ours, my dear,&rdquo; said Fagin, who felt it
necessary to qualify this position, &ldquo;we have a general number one,
without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the devil!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bolter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption,
&ldquo;we are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it
must be so. For instance, it&rsquo;s your object to take care of number
one&mdash;meaning yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bolter. &ldquo;Yer about right
there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well! You can&rsquo;t take care of yourself, number one, without taking
care of me, number one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Number two, you mean,&rdquo; said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed
with the quality of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; retorted Fagin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of the same
importance to you, as you are to yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Bolter, &ldquo;yer a very nice man, and
I&rsquo;m very fond of yer; but we ain&rsquo;t quite so thick together, as all
that comes to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only think,&rdquo; said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching
out his hands; &ldquo;only consider. You&rsquo;ve done what&rsquo;s a very
pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would
put the cravat round your throat, that&rsquo;s so very easily tied and so very
difficult to unloose&mdash;in plain English, the halter!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently
tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The gallows,&rdquo; continued Fagin, &ldquo;the gallows, my dear, is an
ugly finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has
stopped many a bold fellow&rsquo;s career on the broad highway. To keep in the
easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bolter. &ldquo;What do yer talk
about such things for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only to show you my meaning clearly,&rdquo; said the Jew, raising his
eyebrows. &ldquo;To be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my little
business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number one, the second
my number one. The more you value your number one, the more careful you must be
of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first&mdash;that a regard for
number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to
pieces in company.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Oh!
yer a cunning old codger!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere
compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his
wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset
of their acquaintance. To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he
followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and
extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served
his purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr.
Bolter&rsquo;s respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same
time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me
under heavy losses,&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;My best hand was taken from me,
yesterday morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say he died?&rdquo; cried Mr. Bolter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Fagin, &ldquo;not so bad as that. Not quite so
bad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What, I suppose he was&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wanted,&rdquo; interposed Fagin. &ldquo;Yes, he was wanted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very particular?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bolter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Fagin, &ldquo;not very. He was charged with
attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on
him,&mdash;his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very
fond of it. They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the
owner. Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I&rsquo;d give the price of as many to
have him back. You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known
the Dodger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don&rsquo;t yer think so?&rdquo;
said Mr. Bolter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doubtful about it,&rdquo; replied Fagin, with a sigh.
&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t get any fresh evidence, it&rsquo;ll only be a
summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so;
but, if they do, it&rsquo;s a case of lagging. They know what a clever lad he
is; he&rsquo;ll be a lifer. They&rsquo;ll make the Artful nothing less than a
lifer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Bolter.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of talking in that way to me; why don&rsquo;t yer
speak so as I can understand yer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar
tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been informed that they
represented that combination of words, &ldquo;transportation for life,&rdquo;
when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates, with his hands in
his breeches-pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up, Fagin,&rdquo; said Charley, when he and his new
companion had been made known to each other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three
more&rsquo;s a coming to &rsquo;dentify him; and the Artful&rsquo;s booked for
a passage out,&rdquo; replied Master Bates. &ldquo;I must have a full suit of
mourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his
travels. To think of Jack Dawkins&mdash;lummy Jack&mdash;the Dodger&mdash;the
Artful Dodger&mdash;going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box! I
never thought he&rsquo;d a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the
lowest. Oh, why didn&rsquo;t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his
walables, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no
honour nor glory!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master Bates sat
himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!&rdquo;
exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he
always the top-sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him
or come near him on any scent! Eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by
regret; &ldquo;not one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what do you talk of?&rdquo; replied Fagin angrily; &ldquo;what are
you blubbering for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause it isn&rsquo;t on the rec-ord, is it?&rdquo; said Charley,
chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his
regrets; &ldquo;&rsquo;cause it can&rsquo;t come out in the &rsquo;dictment;
&rsquo;cause nobody will never know half of what he was. How will he stand in
the Newgate Calendar? P&rsquo;raps not be there at all. Oh, my eye, my eye, wot
a blow it is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr.
Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy;
&ldquo;see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear. Ain&rsquo;t it
beautiful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of Charley
Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to that young
gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, Charley,&rdquo; said Fagin soothingly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll
come out, it&rsquo;ll be sure to come out. They&rsquo;ll all know what a clever
fellow he was; he&rsquo;ll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and
teachers. Think how young he is too! What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged
at his time of life!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it is a honour that is!&rdquo; said Charley, a little consoled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He shall have all he wants,&rdquo; continued the Jew. &ldquo;He shall be
kept in the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman. Like a gentleman! With his
beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he
can&rsquo;t spend it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, shall he though?&rdquo; cried Charley Bates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, that he shall,&rdquo; replied Fagin, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll have a
big-wig, Charley: one that&rsquo;s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry
on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and
we&rsquo;ll read it all in the papers&mdash;&lsquo;Artful Dodger&mdash;shrieks
of laughter&mdash;here the court was convulsed&rsquo;&mdash;eh, Charley,
eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Master Bates, &ldquo;what a lark that would be,
wouldn&rsquo;t it, Fagin? I say, how the Artful would bother &rsquo;em
wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would!&rdquo; cried Fagin. &ldquo;He shall&mdash;he will!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, to be sure, so he will,&rdquo; repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I see him now,&rdquo; cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his
pupil.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; cried Charley Bates. &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! so do I. I see
it all afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin. What a game! What a regular game!
All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of
&rsquo;em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge&rsquo;s own son
making a speech arter dinner&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend&rsquo;s eccentric
disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider the
imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him as the
chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite
impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so
favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,&rdquo;
said Fagin. &ldquo;Let me think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I go?&rdquo; asked Charley.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not for the world,&rdquo; replied Fagin. &ldquo;Are you mad, my dear,
stark mad, that you&rsquo;d walk into the very place where&mdash;No, Charley,
no. One is enough to lose at a time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to go yourself, I suppose?&rdquo; said Charley with
a humorous leer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t quite fit,&rdquo; replied Fagin shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you send this new cove?&rdquo; asked Master Bates,
laying his hand on Noah&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Nobody knows him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, if he didn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;&rdquo; observed Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; interposed Charley. &ldquo;What should he have to
mind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really nothing, my dear,&rdquo; said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter,
&ldquo;really nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,&rdquo; observed Noah, backing
towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. &ldquo;No,
no&mdash;none of that. It&rsquo;s not in my department, that
ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot department has he got, Fagin?&rdquo; inquired Master Bates,
surveying Noah&rsquo;s lank form with much disgust. &ldquo;The cutting away
when there&rsquo;s anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when
there&rsquo;s everything right; is that his branch?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Bolter; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t yer take
liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer&rsquo;ll find yerself in the
wrong shop.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some
time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred
no possible danger in visiting the police-office; that, inasmuch as no account
of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his
person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he
was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he
were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in
London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he
could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.
</p>

<p>
Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater
degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with a very bad
grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin&rsquo;s directions, he immediately
substituted for his own attire, a waggoner&rsquo;s frock, velveteen breeches,
and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand. He was
likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a
carter&rsquo;s whip. Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some
country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the
gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and
raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the
part to perfection.
</p>

<p>
These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens
by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master Bates
through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street.
Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with
copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got
into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates
bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their
parting.
</p>

<p>
Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the
directions he had received, which&mdash;Master Bates being pretty well
acquainted with the locality&mdash;were so exact that he was enabled to gain
the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any
interruption by the way.
</p>

<p>
He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were
huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised
platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left
hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for
the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off
by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the
vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice.
</p>

<p>
There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their
admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of
policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table. A jailer stood
reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key,
except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by
proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman &ldquo;Take that
baby out,&rdquo; when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries,
half-smothered in the mother&rsquo;s shawl, from some meagre infant. The room
smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling
blackened. There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock
above the dock&mdash;the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought;
for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a
taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy
scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.
</p>

<p>
Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several
women who would have done very well for that distinguished character&rsquo;s
mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong
resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of
Mr. Dawkins was to be seen. He waited in a state of much suspense and
uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and
then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at
once could be no other than the object of his visit.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat
sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his
right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable,
and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what
he was placed in that &rsquo;ere disgraceful sitivation for.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue, will you?&rdquo; said the jailer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Englishman, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; rejoined the Dodger.
&ldquo;Where are my priwileges?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get your privileges soon enough,&rdquo; retorted the
jailer, &ldquo;and pepper with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got
to say to the beaks, if I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dawkins. &ldquo;Now
then! Wot is this here business? I shall thank the madg&rsquo;strates to
dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the
paper, for I&rsquo;ve got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I
am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he&rsquo;ll go away
if I ain&rsquo;t there to my time, and then pr&rsquo;aps ther won&rsquo;t be an
action for damage against them as kep me away. Oh no, certainly not!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to
proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate &ldquo;the
names of them two files as was on the bench.&rdquo; Which so tickled the
spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have
done if he had heard the request.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Silence there!&rdquo; cried the jailer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; inquired one of the magistrates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A pick-pocketing case, your worship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has the boy ever been here before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He ought to have been, a many times,&rdquo; replied the jailer.
&ldquo;He has been pretty well everywhere else. <i>I</i> know him well, your
worship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! you know me, do you?&rdquo; cried the Artful, making a note of the
statement. &ldquo;Wery good. That&rsquo;s a case of deformation of character,
any way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now then, where are the witnesses?&rdquo; said the clerk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added the Dodger. &ldquo;Where are they?
I should like to see &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had
seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and
indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he
deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance. For this
reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and
the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff-box, with
the owner&rsquo;s name engraved upon the lid. This gentleman had been
discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present,
swore that the snuff-box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous
day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to. He
had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in
making his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?&rdquo; said the magistrate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with
him,&rdquo; replied the Dodger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you anything to say at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear his worship ask if you&rsquo;ve anything to say?&rdquo;
inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the Dodger, looking up with an air of
abstraction. &ldquo;Did you redress yourself to me, my man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,&rdquo;
observed the officer with a grin. &ldquo;Do you mean to say anything, you young
shaver?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Dodger, &ldquo;not here, for this ain&rsquo;t the
shop for justice: besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning
with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something to
say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and &rsquo;spectable
circle of acquaintance as&rsquo;ll make them beaks wish they&rsquo;d never been
born, or that they&rsquo;d got their footmen to hang &rsquo;em up to their own
hat-pegs, afore they let &rsquo;em come out this morning to try it on upon me.
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There! He&rsquo;s fully committed!&rdquo; interposed the clerk.
&ldquo;Take him away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said the jailer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh ah! I&rsquo;ll come on,&rdquo; replied the Dodger, brushing his hat
with the palm of his hand. &ldquo;Ah! (to the Bench) it&rsquo;s no use your
looking frightened; I won&rsquo;t show you no mercy, not a ha&rsquo;porth of
it. <i>You&rsquo;ll</i> pay for this, my fine fellers. I wouldn&rsquo;t be you
for something! I wouldn&rsquo;t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your
knees and ask me. Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar;
threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it;
and then grinning in the officer&rsquo;s face, with great glee and
self-approval.
</p>

<p>
Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best of
his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting here some time,
he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing
himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and
ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent
person.
</p>

<p>
The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that
the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and establishing for
himself a glorious reputation.

<h2><a name="chap44"></a> CHAPTER XLIV.<br />
THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE FAILS.
</h2>

<p>
Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy
could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had
taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the
brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all
others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of
their suspicion. Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their
originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her,
step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence
was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some
relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so
long eluded, and he should fall at last&mdash;richly as he merited such a
fate&mdash;by her hand.
</p>

<p>
But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself
from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on
one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration. Her fears
for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was
yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she
had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even
for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses
her&mdash;and what more could she do! She was resolved.
</p>

<p>
Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced
themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too. She grew pale
and thin, even within a few days. At times, she took no heed of what was
passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been
the loudest. At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy
without a moment afterwards&mdash;she sat silent and dejected, brooding with
her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself,
told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and
that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from
those in the course of discussion by her companions.
</p>

<p>
It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour. Sikes
and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The girl looked up from
the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. Eleven.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An hour this side of midnight,&rdquo; said Sikes, raising the blind to
look out and returning to his seat. &ldquo;Dark and heavy it is too. A good
night for business this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied Fagin. &ldquo;What a pity, Bill, my dear, that
there&rsquo;s none quite ready to be done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right for once,&rdquo; replied Sikes gruffly. &ldquo;It is
a pity, for I&rsquo;m in the humour too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must make up for lost time when we&rsquo;ve got things into a good
train. That&rsquo;s all I know,&rdquo; said Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk, my dear,&rdquo; replied Fagin, venturing
to pat him on the shoulder. &ldquo;It does me good to hear you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does you good, does it!&rdquo; cried Sikes. &ldquo;Well, so be
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this
concession. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like yourself to-night, Bill. Quite like
yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my
shoulder, so take it away,&rdquo; said Sikes, casting off the Jew&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It make you nervous, Bill,&mdash;reminds you of being nabbed, does
it?&rdquo; said Fagin, determined not to be offended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,&rdquo; returned Sikes.
&ldquo;There never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was
your father, and I suppose <i>he</i> is singeing his grizzled red beard by this
time, unless you came straight from the old &rsquo;un without any father at all
betwixt you; which I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder at, a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the sleeve,
pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing
conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried Sikes. &ldquo;Nance. Where&rsquo;s the gal going to
at this time of night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What answer&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; retorted Sikes. &ldquo;Do you hear
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where,&rdquo; replied the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I do,&rdquo; said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than
because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.
&ldquo;Nowhere. Sit down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not well. I told you that before,&rdquo; rejoined the girl.
&ldquo;I want a breath of air.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put your head out of the winder,&rdquo; replied Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not enough there,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I want it
in the street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; replied Sikes. With which assurance
he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her
head, flung it up to the top of an old press. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the
robber. &ldquo;Now stop quietly where you are, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,&rdquo; said the
girl turning very pale. &ldquo;What do you mean, Bill? Do you know what
you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Know what I&rsquo;m&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; cried Sikes, turning to Fagin,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s out of her senses, you know, or she daren&rsquo;t talk to me
in that way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drive me on the something desperate,&rdquo; muttered the
girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some
violent outbreak. &ldquo;Let me go, will you,&mdash;this minute&mdash;this
instant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell him to let me go, Fagin. He had better. It&rsquo;ll be better for
him. Do you hear me?&rdquo; cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear you!&rdquo; repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront
her. &ldquo;Aye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have
such a grip on your throat as&rsquo;ll tear some of that screaming voice out.
Wot has come over you, you jade! Wot is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting
herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, &ldquo;Bill, let me go;
you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing. You don&rsquo;t, indeed. For only one
hour&mdash;do&mdash;do!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cut my limbs off one by one!&rdquo; cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by
the arm, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t think the gal&rsquo;s stark raving mad. Get
up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not till you let me go&mdash;not till you let me
go&mdash;Never&mdash;never!&rdquo; screamed the girl. Sikes looked on, for a
minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her,
struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining,
where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down
by force. She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o&rsquo;clock had
struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any
further. With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go
out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his
face. &ldquo;Wot a precious strange gal that is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may say that, Bill,&rdquo; replied Fagin thoughtfully. &ldquo;You
may say that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you
think?&rdquo; asked Sikes. &ldquo;Come; you should know her better than me. Wot
does it mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Obstinacy; woman&rsquo;s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I suppose it is,&rdquo; growled Sikes. &ldquo;I thought I had
tamed her, but she&rsquo;s as bad as ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; said Fagin thoughtfully. &ldquo;I never knew her like
this, for such a little cause.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Sikes. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s got a touch of that
fever in her blood yet, and it won&rsquo;t come out&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if
she&rsquo;s took that way again,&rdquo; said Sikes.
</p>

<p>
Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on
my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself
aloof,&rdquo; said Sikes. &ldquo;We was poor too, all the time, and I think,
one way or other, it&rsquo;s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up
here so long has made her restless&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Jew in a whisper.
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former
seat. Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her
head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, now she&rsquo;s on the other tack!&rdquo; exclaimed Sikes, turning
a look of excessive surprise on his companion.
</p>

<p>
Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes,
the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering Sikes that there
was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and bade him good-night. He
paused when he reached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody
would light him down the dark stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Light him down,&rdquo; said Sikes, who was filling his pipe.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the
sight-seers. Show him a light.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached the
passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in
a whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it, Nancy, dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; replied the girl, in the same tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The reason of all this,&rdquo; replied Fagin. &ldquo;If
<i>he</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed with his skinny fore-finger up the
stairs&mdash;&ldquo;is so hard with you (he&rsquo;s a brute, Nance, a
brute-beast), why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost
touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No matter just now. We&rsquo;ll talk of this again. You have a friend in
me, Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If you
want revenge on those that treat you like a dog&mdash;like a dog! worse than
his dog, for he humours him sometimes&mdash;come to me. I say, come to me. He
is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know you well,&rdquo; replied the girl, without manifesting the least
emotion. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good-night
again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of
intelligence, closed the door between them.
</p>

<p>
Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working
within his brain. He had conceived the idea&mdash;not from what had just passed
though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees&mdash;that
Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker&rsquo;s brutality, had conceived an
attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her repeated absences from
home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which
she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to
leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and
rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty. The object of this
new liking was not among his myrmidons. He would be a valuable acquisition with
such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without
delay.
</p>

<p>
There was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too much, and
his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were
hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be
safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked&mdash;to the maiming of
limbs, or perhaps the loss of life&mdash;on the object of her more recent
fancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With a little persuasion,&rdquo; thought Fagin, &ldquo;what more likely
than that she would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and
worse, to secure the same object before now. There would be the dangerous
villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place; and my influence
over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat
alone, in the housebreaker&rsquo;s room; and with them uppermost in his
thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the
girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There was no expression of
surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning. The girl
clearly comprehended it. Her glance at parting showed <i>that</i>.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that
was one of the chief ends to be attained. &ldquo;How,&rdquo; thought Fagin, as
he crept homeward, &ldquo;can I increase my influence with her? What new power
can I acquire?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Such brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a confession from
herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and
threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common
fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Fagin, almost aloud. &ldquo;She durst not refuse me
then. Not for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready,
and shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the
spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his
bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in
his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his
fingers.

<h2><a name="chap45"></a> CHAPTER XLV.<br />
NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION </h2>

<p>
The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the
appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at
length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bolter,&rdquo; said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself
opposite Morris Bolter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, here I am,&rdquo; returned Noah. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?
Don&rsquo;t yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating. That&rsquo;s a
great fault in this place. Yer never get time enough over yer meals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can talk as you eat, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Fagin, cursing his
dear young friend&rsquo;s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I can talk. I get on better when I talk,&rdquo; said Noah,
cutting a monstrous slice of bread. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Charlotte?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out,&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;I sent her out this morning with the
other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Noah. &ldquo;I wish yer&rsquo;d ordered her to make some
buttered toast first. Well. Talk away. Yer won&rsquo;t interrupt me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had
evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You did well yesterday, my dear,&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;Beautiful!
Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! The kinchin lay
will be a fortune to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,&rdquo;
said Mr. Bolter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, my dear. The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the
milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Bolter
complacently. &ldquo;The pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was
standing by itself outside a public-house. I thought it might get rusty with
the rain, or catch cold, yer know. Eh? Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out,
took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and
butter, and assisted himself to a second.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you, Bolter,&rdquo; said Fagin, leaning over the table, &ldquo;to
do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; rejoined Bolter, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t yer go shoving me into
danger, or sending me any more o&rsquo; yer police-offices. That don&rsquo;t
suit me, that don&rsquo;t; and so I tell yer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the smallest danger in it&mdash;not the very
smallest,&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only to dodge a woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An old woman?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Bolter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A young one,&rdquo; replied Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can do that pretty well, I know,&rdquo; said Bolter. &ldquo;I was a
regular cunning sneak when I was at school. What am I to dodge her for? Not
to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if
possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the
house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you
can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll yer give me?&rdquo; asked Noah, setting down his cup, and
looking his employer, eagerly, in the face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you do it well, a pound, my dear. One pound,&rdquo; said Fagin,
wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible. &ldquo;And
that&rsquo;s what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there
wasn&rsquo;t valuable consideration to be gained.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; inquired Noah.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh Lor!&rdquo; cried Noah, curling up his nose. &ldquo;Yer doubtful of
her, are yer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they
are,&rdquo; replied Fagin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Noah. &ldquo;Just to have the pleasure of knowing
them, if they&rsquo;re respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I&rsquo;m your
man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew you would be,&rdquo; cried Fagin, elated by the success of his
proposal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; replied Noah. &ldquo;Where is she? Where am
I to wait for her? Where am I to go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All that, my dear, you shall hear from me. I&rsquo;ll point her out at
the proper time,&rdquo; said Fagin. &ldquo;You keep ready, and leave the rest
to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped
in his carter&rsquo;s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin. Six nights
passed&mdash;six long weary nights&mdash;and on each, Fagin came home with a
disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time. On the
seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal. It
was Sunday.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She goes abroad to-night,&rdquo; said Fagin, &ldquo;and on the right
errand, I&rsquo;m sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is
afraid of will not be back much before daybreak. Come with me. Quick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such
intense excitement that it infected him. They left the house stealthily, and
hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a
public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the
night of his arrival in London.
</p>

<p>
It was past eleven o&rsquo;clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly on
its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and the
door was closed behind them.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and
the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and
signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that the woman?&rdquo; he asked, scarcely above his breath.
</p>

<p>
Fagin nodded yes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see her face well,&rdquo; whispered Noah. &ldquo;She is
looking down, and the candle is behind her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stay there,&rdquo; whispered Fagin. He signed to Barney, who withdrew.
In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of
snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the
girl, caused her to raise her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see her now,&rdquo; cried the spy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Plainly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should know her among a thousand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out. Fagin
drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their
breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and
emerged by the door at which they had entered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; cried the lad who held the door. &ldquo;Dow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To the left,&rdquo; whispered the lad; &ldquo;take the left had, and
keep od the other side.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl&rsquo;s retreating
figure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he
considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to
observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once
stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on. She seemed
to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step.
The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed: with
his eye upon her.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap46"></a> CHAPTER XLVI.<br />
THE APPOINTMENT KEPT </h2>

<p>
The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on
London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a
woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object;
the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he
could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers: stopping when
she stopped: and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing
himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. Thus, they
crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman,
apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned
back. The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his
guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers
of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure,
he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same
distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and
followed her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. The man
stopped too.
</p>

<p>
It was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and
place there were few people stirring. Such as there were, hurried quickly past:
very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman,
or the man who kept her in view. Their appearance was not calculated to attract
the importunate regards of such of London&rsquo;s destitute population, as
chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold
arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence:
neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.
</p>

<p>
A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt
upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and
more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks. The old smoke-stained
storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs
and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their
lumbering shapes. The tower of old Saint Saviour&rsquo;s Church, and the spire
of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible
in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly
scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.
</p>

<p>
The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro&mdash;closely watched
meanwhile by her hidden observer&mdash;when the heavy bell of St. Paul&rsquo;s
tolled for the death of another day. Midnight had come upon the crowded city.
The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and
death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep
of the child: midnight was upon them all.
</p>

<p>
The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a
grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance
of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it.
They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and
immediately made towards them.
</p>

<p>
They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained
some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when
they were suddenly joined by this new associate. They halted with an
exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the
garments of a countryman came close up&mdash;brushed against them,
indeed&mdash;at that precise moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; said Nancy hurriedly, &ldquo;I am afraid to speak to
you here. Come away&mdash;out of the public road&mdash;down the steps
yonder!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in
which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly
asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.
</p>

<p>
The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey bank,
and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour&rsquo;s Church, form a
landing-stairs from the river. To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of
a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment&rsquo;s survey of the
place, he began to descend.
</p>

<p>
These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. Just
below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates
in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. At this point the lower
steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily
unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step.
The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there
seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was
plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there
waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could
not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.
</p>

<p>
So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to
penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to
expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded
himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some
entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation. He was on the
point of emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he
heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at
his ear.
</p>

<p>
He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing,
listened attentively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is far enough,&rdquo; said a voice, which was evidently that of the
gentleman. &ldquo;I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther. Many
people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see
I am willing to humour you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To humour me!&rdquo; cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re considerate, indeed, sir. To humour me! Well, well,
it&rsquo;s no matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, for what,&rdquo; said the gentleman in a kinder tone, &ldquo;for
what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place? Why not have let me
speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring,
instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you before,&rdquo; replied Nancy, &ldquo;that I was afraid to
speak to you there. I don&rsquo;t know why it is,&rdquo; said the girl,
shuddering, &ldquo;but I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can
hardly stand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fear of what?&rdquo; asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely know of what,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I wish I did.
Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that
has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. I was reading
a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the
print.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Imagination,&rdquo; said the gentleman, soothing her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No imagination,&rdquo; replied the girl in a hoarse voice.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I saw &lsquo;coffin&rsquo; written in every page of the
book in large black letters,&mdash;aye, and they carried one close to me, in
the streets to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing unusual in that,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;They
have passed me often.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Real ones</i>,&rdquo; rejoined the girl. &ldquo;This was not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed
listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled
within him. He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet
voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow herself to
become the prey of such fearful fancies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speak to her kindly,&rdquo; said the young lady to her companion.
&ldquo;Poor creature! She seems to need it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me
as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,&rdquo; cried the girl.
&ldquo;Oh, dear lady, why ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t those who claim to be God&rsquo;s
own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth,
and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so
much humbler?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;A Turk turns his face, after
washing it well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people,
after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles
off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven. Between the
Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps
uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself. The
gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were not here last Sunday night,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; replied Nancy; &ldquo;I was kept by
force.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Him that I told the young lady of before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the
subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?&rdquo; asked the old
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the girl, shaking her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn&rsquo;t give him a
drink of laudanum before I came away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he awake before you returned?&rdquo; inquired the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;Now listen to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This young lady,&rdquo; the gentleman began, &ldquo;has communicated to
me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her
nearly a fortnight since. I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether
you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the girl earnestly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I repeat that I firmly believe it. To prove to you that I am disposed to
trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret,
whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks. But
if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;he cannot be secured, or,
if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the
Jew.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fagin,&rdquo; cried the girl, recoiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That man must be delivered up by you,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will not do it! I will never do it!&rdquo; replied the girl.
&ldquo;Devil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will
never do that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will not?&rdquo; said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for
this answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; returned the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For one reason,&rdquo; rejoined the girl firmly, &ldquo;for one reason,
that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her
promise: and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I
have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses
together, and I&rsquo;ll not turn upon them, who might&mdash;any of
them&mdash;have turned upon me, but didn&rsquo;t, bad as they are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point
he had been aiming to attain; &ldquo;put Monks into my hands, and leave him to
me to deal with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What if he turns against the others?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there
the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver&rsquo;s little
history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the
truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if it is not?&rdquo; suggested the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; pursued the gentleman, &ldquo;this Fagin shall not be
brought to justice without your consent. In such a case I could show you
reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have I the lady&rsquo;s promise for that?&rdquo; asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; replied Rose. &ldquo;My true and faithful
pledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?&rdquo; said the girl,
after a short pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied the gentleman. &ldquo;The intelligence should be
brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,&rdquo; said the
girl after another interval of silence, &ldquo;but I will take your
words.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she
proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to
discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation,
the public-house whence she had been followed that night. From the manner in
which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some
hasty notes of the information she communicated. When she had thoroughly
explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it
without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in
the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the
purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her
recollection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is tall,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and a strongly made man, but
not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his
shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don&rsquo;t forget that,
for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man&rsquo;s,
that you might almost tell him by that alone. His face is dark, like his hair
and eyes; and, although he can&rsquo;t be more than six or eight and twenty,
withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the
marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands
and covers them with wounds&mdash;why did you start?&rdquo; said the girl,
stopping suddenly.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of having
done so, and begged her to proceed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Part of this,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I have drawn out from other
people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both
times he was covered up in a large cloak. I think that&rsquo;s all I can give
you to know him by. Stay though,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Upon his throat: so
high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his
face: there is&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?&rdquo; cried the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;You know him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so
still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; said the gentleman, breaking silence. &ldquo;I
should by your description. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each
other. It may not be the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a
step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the
distinctness with which he heard him mutter, &ldquo;It must be he!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot
where he had stood before, &ldquo;you have given us most valuable assistance,
young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to serve
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Nancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will not persist in saying that,&rdquo; rejoined the gentleman, with
a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more
obdurate heart. &ldquo;Think now. Tell me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the girl, weeping. &ldquo;You can do
nothing to help me. I am past all hope, indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You put yourself beyond its pale,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;The
past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such
priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never grants
again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it is in our power
to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a
quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some
foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most
anxious wish to secure you. Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes
to the first glimpse of day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the
reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace
behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment. Come! I
would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take
one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and
death to you. Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She will be persuaded now,&rdquo; cried the young lady. &ldquo;She
hesitates, I am sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I fear not, my dear,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No sir, I do not,&rdquo; replied the girl, after a short struggle.
&ldquo;I am chained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot
leave it. I must have gone too far to turn back,&mdash;and yet I don&rsquo;t
know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it
off. But,&rdquo; she said, looking hastily round, &ldquo;this fear comes over
me again. I must go home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Home, lady,&rdquo; rejoined the girl. &ldquo;To such a home as I have
raised for myself with the work of my whole life. Let us part. I shall be
watched or seen. Go! Go! If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you
leave me, and let me go my way alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; said the gentleman, with a sigh. &ldquo;We
compromise her safety, perhaps, by staying here. We may have detained her
longer than she expected already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; urged the girl. &ldquo;You have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried the young lady, &ldquo;can be the end of this poor
creature&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; repeated the girl. &ldquo;Look before you, lady. Look at
that dark water. How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the
tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them. It may be years
hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not speak thus, pray,&rdquo; returned the young lady, sobbing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors
should!&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;Good-night, good-night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The gentleman turned away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This purse,&rdquo; cried the young lady. &ldquo;Take it for my sake,
that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I have not done this for money. Let
me have that to think of. And yet&mdash;give me something that you have worn: I
should like to have something&mdash;no, no, not a ring&mdash;your gloves or
handkerchief&mdash;anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet
lady. There. Bless you! God bless you. Good-night, good-night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which
would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman
to leave her, as she requested.
</p>

<p>
The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.
</p>

<p>
The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared
upon the bridge. They stopped at the summit of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried the young lady, listening. &ldquo;Did she call! I
thought I heard her voice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, my love,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. &ldquo;She
has not moved, and will not till we are gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led
her, with gentle force, away. As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at
her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her
heart in bitter tears.
</p>

<p>
After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the
street. The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some
minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round
him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding-place, and returned,
stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had
descended.
</p>

<p>
Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was
unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made for the
Jew&rsquo;s house as fast as his legs would carry him.

<h2><a name="chap47"></a> CHAPTER XLVII.<br />
FATAL CONSEQUENCES </h2>

<p>
It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn of the
year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and
deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have
staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat
watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and
blood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom,
moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit.
</p>

<p>
He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his
face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side. His
right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he hit his long
black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should
have been a dog&rsquo;s or rat&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep. Towards
him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and then brought
them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost
double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed
that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Indeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred
of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the
sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of
his revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce
and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which,
following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through
the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at
his heart.
</p>

<p>
He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take the
smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep
in the street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. &ldquo;At
last!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and presently
returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under
one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the
burly frame of Sikes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, laying the bundle on the table. &ldquo;Take care
of that, and do the most you can with it. It&rsquo;s been trouble enough to
get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down
again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an
instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other,
face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently,
and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the
housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of
real affright.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot now?&rdquo; cried Sikes. &ldquo;Wot do you look at a man so
for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but
his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damme!&rdquo; said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone mad. I must look to myself here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; rejoined Fagin, finding his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not&mdash;you&rsquo;re not the person, Bill. I&rsquo;ve no&mdash;no fault to
find with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Sikes, looking
sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient
pocket. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky&mdash;for one of us. Which one that is,
don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that to tell you, Bill,&rdquo; said Fagin, drawing his
chair nearer, &ldquo;will make you worse than me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aye?&rdquo; returned the robber with an incredulous air. &ldquo;Tell
away! Look sharp, or Nance will think I&rsquo;m lost.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; cried Fagin. &ldquo;She has pretty well settled that, in
her own mind, already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew&rsquo;s face, and
reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat
collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speak, will you!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;or if you don&rsquo;t, it shall
be for want of breath. Open your mouth and say wot you&rsquo;ve got to say in
plain words. Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose that lad that&rsquo;s laying there&mdash;&rdquo; Fagin began.
</p>

<p>
Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously
observed him. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, resuming his former position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose that lad,&rdquo; pursued Fagin, &ldquo;was to peach&mdash;to
blow upon us all&mdash;first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and
then having a meeting with &rsquo;em in the street to paint our likenesses,
describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be
most easily taken. Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a
plant we&rsquo;ve all been in, more or less&mdash;of his own fancy; not
grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and
water,&mdash;but of his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at
nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them. Do you
hear me?&rdquo; cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage. &ldquo;Suppose he
did all this, what then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What then!&rdquo; replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath. &ldquo;If he
was left alive till I came, I&rsquo;d grind his skull under the iron heel of my
boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What if I did it!&rdquo; cried Fagin almost in a yell. &ldquo;I, that
knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and
turning white at the mere suggestion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do something in the jail
that &rsquo;ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you,
I&rsquo;d fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out
afore the people. I should have such strength,&rdquo; muttered the robber,
poising his brawny arm, &ldquo;that I could smash your head as if a loaded
waggon had gone over it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would I!&rdquo; said the housebreaker. &ldquo;Try me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who,&rdquo; replied Sikes impatiently. &ldquo;Whoever
it was, I&rsquo;d serve them the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over
the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him. Sikes leant forward
in his chair: looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if wondering much
what all this questioning and preparation was to end in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bolter, Bolter! Poor lad!&rdquo; said Fagin, looking up with an
expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked
emphasis. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s tired&mdash;tired with watching for her so
long,&mdash;watching for <i>her</i>, Bill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; asked Sikes, drawing back.
</p>

<p>
Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into a
sitting posture. When his assumed name had been repeated several times, Noah
rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me that again&mdash;once again, just for him to hear,&rdquo; said
the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell yer what?&rdquo; asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That about&mdash; <i>Nancy</i>,&rdquo; said Fagin, clutching Sikes by
the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough.
&ldquo;You followed her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To London Bridge?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where she met two people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So she did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before,
who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did&mdash;and
to describe him, which she did&mdash;and to tell her what house it was that we
meet at, and go to, which she did&mdash;and where it could be best watched
from, which she did&mdash;and what time the people went there, which she did.
She did all this. She told it all every word without a threat, without a
murmur&mdash;she did&mdash;did she not?&rdquo; cried Fagin, half mad with fury.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Noah, scratching his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
just what it was!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did they say, about last Sunday?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About last Sunday!&rdquo; replied Noah, considering. &ldquo;Why I told
yer that before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Again. Tell it again!&rdquo; cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes,
and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They asked her,&rdquo; said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed
to have a dawning perception who Sikes was, &ldquo;they asked her why she
didn&rsquo;t come, last Sunday, as she promised. She said she
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why&mdash;why? Tell him that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them
of before,&rdquo; replied Noah.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What more of him?&rdquo; cried Fagin. &ldquo;What more of the man she
had told them of before? Tell him that, tell him that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, that she couldn&rsquo;t very easily get out of doors unless he knew
where she was going to,&rdquo; said Noah; &ldquo;and so the first time she went
to see the lady, she&mdash;ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that
it did&mdash;she gave him a drink of laudanum.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s fire!&rdquo; cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.
&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and
furiously, up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bill, Bill!&rdquo; cried Fagin, following him hastily. &ldquo;A word.
Only a word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to
open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the
Jew came panting up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me out,&rdquo; said Sikes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me;
it&rsquo;s not safe. Let me out, I say!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear me speak a word,&rdquo; rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the
lock. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be&mdash;too&mdash;violent, Bill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each
other&rsquo;s faces. They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the
eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now
useless, &ldquo;not too violent for safety. Be crafty, Bill, and not too
bold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the
lock, dashed into the silent streets.
</p>

<p>
Without one pause, or moment&rsquo;s consideration; without once turning his
head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering them to
the ground, but looking straight before him with savage resolution: his teeth
so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin;
the robber held on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a
muscle, until he reached his own door. He opened it, softly, with a key; strode
lightly up the stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and
lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.
</p>

<p>
The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it. He had roused her from her sleep,
for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; said the man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is you, Bill!&rdquo; said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at
his return.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Get up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick,
and hurled it under the grate. Seeing the faint light of early day without, the
girl rose to undraw the curtain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let it be,&rdquo; said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough light for wot I&rsquo;ve got to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, &ldquo;why do you
look like that at me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and
heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her into
the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy
hand upon her mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bill, Bill!&rdquo; gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of
mortal fear,&mdash;&ldquo;I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t scream or cry&mdash;not
once&mdash;hear me&mdash;speak to me&mdash;tell me what I have done!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, you she devil!&rdquo; returned the robber, suppressing his
breath. &ldquo;You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,&rdquo;
rejoined the girl, clinging to him. &ldquo;Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have the
heart to kill me. Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for
you. You <i>shall</i> have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will
not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off. Bill, Bill, for dear God&rsquo;s
sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood! I have been true
to you, upon my guilty soul I have!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl were
clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast,
&ldquo;the gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some
foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. Let me see
them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to
you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better
lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each
other more. It is never too late to repent. They told me so&mdash;I feel it
now&mdash;but we must have time&mdash;a little, little time!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty of
immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst of
his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the
upturned face that almost touched his own.
</p>

<p>
She staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a
deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees,
drew from her bosom a white handkerchief&mdash;Rose Maylie&rsquo;s
own&mdash;and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her
feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker.
</p>

<p>
It was a ghastly figure to look upon. The murderer staggering backward to the
wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club and struck
her down.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap48"></a> CHAPTER XLVIII.<br />
THE FLIGHT OF SIKES </h2>

<p>
Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within
wide London&rsquo;s bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst. Of all
the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the
foulest and most cruel.
</p>

<p>
The sun&mdash;the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life,
and hope, and freshness to man&mdash;burst upon the crowded city in clear and
radiant glory. Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window, through
cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray. It lighted up the
room where the murdered woman lay. It did. He tried to shut it out, but it
would stream in. If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what
was it, now, in all that brilliant light!
</p>

<p>
He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. There had been a moan and motion
of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again.
Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine
them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the
reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the
ceiling. He had plucked it off again. And there was the body&mdash;mere flesh
and blood, no more&mdash;but such flesh, and so much blood!
</p>

<p>
He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There was hair
upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the
air, whirled up the chimney. Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he
held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and
smoulder into ashes. He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were
spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. How
those stains were dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were
bloody.
</p>

<p>
All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for
a moment. Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door:
dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new
evidence of the crime into the streets. He shut the door softly, locked it,
took the key, and left the house.
</p>

<p>
He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was
visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which she would
have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay nearly under there.
<i>He</i> knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot!
</p>

<p>
The glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the room. He
whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.
</p>

<p>
He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the
stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of
purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as
soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields,
skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath. Traversing the hollow by the
Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins
the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the
heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a
hedge, and slept.
</p>

<p>
Soon he was up again, and away,&mdash;not far into the country, but back
towards London by the high-road&mdash;then back again&mdash;then over another
part of the same ground as he already traversed&mdash;then wandering up and
down in fields, and lying on ditches&rsquo; brinks to rest, and starting up to
make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.
</p>

<p>
Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and
drink? Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most
people&rsquo;s way. Thither he directed his steps,&mdash;running sometimes, and
sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail&rsquo;s pace, or
stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. But when he got
there, all the people he met&mdash;the very children at the doors&mdash;seemed
to view him with suspicion. Back he turned again, without the courage to
purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once
more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go.
</p>

<p>
He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old
place. Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he
rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered
about the same spot. At last he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield.
</p>

<p>
It was nine o&rsquo;clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog,
limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the
church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a
small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot. There was a
fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it.
</p>

<p>
They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and
ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel of food
from time to time.
</p>

<p>
The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land,
and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man
who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering
him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite
young&mdash;not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he
was&mdash;with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least&mdash;if he had
taken care; if he had taken care.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The robber,
after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had
almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new
comer.
</p>

<p>
This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about
the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness-paste,
medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares,
which he carried in a case slung to his back. His entrance was the signal for
various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made
his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to
unite business with amusement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?&rdquo; asked a grinning
countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the fellow, producing one, &ldquo;this is the
infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust,
dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric,
cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff.
Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains,
pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and
invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to
swallow one cake and she&rsquo;s cured at once&mdash;for it&rsquo;s poison. If
a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square,
and he has put it beyond question&mdash;for it&rsquo;s quite as satisfactory as
a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more
credit in taking it. One penny a square. With all these virtues, one penny a
square!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated.
The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all bought up as fast as it can be made,&rdquo; said the
fellow. &ldquo;There are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a
galvanic battery, always a-working upon it, and they can&rsquo;t make it fast
enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is
pensioned directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a
premium of fifty for twins. One penny a square! Two half-pence is all the same,
and four farthings is received with joy. One penny a square! Wine-stains,
fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains,
mud-stains, blood-stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in
company, that I&rsquo;ll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of
ale.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; cried Sikes starting up. &ldquo;Give that back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it clean out, sir,&rdquo; replied the man, winking to
the company, &ldquo;before you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen
all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman&rsquo;s hat, no wider than a
shilling, but thicker than a half-crown. Whether it is a wine-stain,
fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or
blood-stain&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the
table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.
</p>

<p>
With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon
him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed,
and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned
back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach
that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail
from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post-office. He almost
knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened.
</p>

<p>
The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man, dressed
like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay
ready on the pavement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for your people,&rdquo; said the guard. &ldquo;Now, look
alive in there, will you. Damn that &rsquo;ere bag, it warn&rsquo;t ready night
afore last; this won&rsquo;t do, you know!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything new up in town, Ben?&rdquo; asked the game-keeper, drawing back
to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, nothing that I knows on,&rdquo; replied the man, pulling on his
gloves. &ldquo;Corn&rsquo;s up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down
Spitalfields way, but I don&rsquo;t reckon much upon it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; said a gentleman inside, who was
looking out of the window. &ldquo;And a dreadful murder it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was it, sir?&rdquo; rejoined the guard, touching his hat. &ldquo;Man or
woman, pray, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; replied the gentleman. &ldquo;It is
supposed&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Ben,&rdquo; replied the coachman impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn that &rsquo;ere bag,&rdquo; said the guard; &ldquo;are you gone to
sleep in there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; cried the office keeper, running out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; growled the guard. &ldquo;Ah, and so&rsquo;s the young
&rsquo;ooman of property that&rsquo;s going to take a fancy to me, but I
don&rsquo;t know when. Here, give hold. All ri&mdash;ight!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.
</p>

<p>
Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just
heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go. At length
he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans.
</p>

<p>
He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the
solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him
which shook him to the core. Every object before him, substance or shadow,
still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were
nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning&rsquo;s ghastly
figure following at his heels. He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply
the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to
stalk along. He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every
breath of wind came laden with that last low cry. If he stopped it did the
same. If he ran, it followed&mdash;not running too: that would have been a
relief: but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on
one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.
</p>

<p>
At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this
phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and
his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then. He
had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now&mdash;always. He
leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out
against the cold night-sky. He threw himself upon the road&mdash;on his back
upon the road. At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still&mdash;a living
grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood.
</p>

<p>
Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must
sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that
agony of fear.
</p>

<p>
There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night.
Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within;
and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. He <i>could not</i> walk
on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the
wall&mdash;to undergo new torture.
</p>

<p>
For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from
which he had escaped. Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy,
that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the
midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing. There
were but two, but they were everywhere. If he shut out the sight, there came
the room with every well-known object&mdash;some, indeed, that he would have
forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory&mdash;each in its
accustomed place. The body was in <i>its</i> place, and its eyes were as he saw
them when he stole away. He got up, and rushed into the field without. The
figure was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more. The
eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.
</p>

<p>
And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every
limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose
upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices
mingled in alarm and wonder. Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though
it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him. He regained his
strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his
feet, rushed into the open air.
</p>

<p>
The broad sky seemed on fire. Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and
rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for
miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood. The
shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of
Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and
the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft
as though refreshed by food. The noise increased as he looked. There were
people there&mdash;men and women&mdash;light, bustle. It was like new life to
him. He darted onward&mdash;straight, headlong&mdash;dashing through brier and
brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud
and sounding bark before him.
</p>

<p>
He came upon the spot. There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some
endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the
cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning
pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot
beams. The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a
mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the
molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground. Women and
children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.
The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as
it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar. He shouted, too,
till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the
thickest of the throng. Hither and thither he dived that night: now working at
the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to
engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest. Up and down the ladders,
upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his
weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great
fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise,
nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and
blackened ruins remained.
</p>

<p>
This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the dreadful
consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were
conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk. The dog
obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily,
together. He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called
to him to share in their refreshment. He took some bread and meat; and as he
drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about
the murder. &ldquo;He has gone to Birmingham, they say,&rdquo; said one:
&ldquo;but they&rsquo;ll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow
night there&rsquo;ll be a cry all through the country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay
down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. He wandered on
again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another
solitary night.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody to speak to there, at all event,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;A good hiding-place, too. They&rsquo;ll never expect to nab me
there, after this country scent. Why can&rsquo;t I lie by for a week or so,
and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I&rsquo;ll risk
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented
roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance
of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed
straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination.
</p>

<p>
The dog, though. If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten
that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him. This might lead to
his apprehension as he passed along the streets. He resolved to drown him, and
walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to
his handkerchief as he went.
</p>

<p>
The animal looked up into his master&rsquo;s face while these preparations were
making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the
robber&rsquo;s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a
little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly
along. When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call
him, he stopped outright.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear me call? Come here!&rdquo; cried Sikes.
</p>

<p>
The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach
the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; said the robber.
</p>

<p>
The dog wagged his tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and called
him again.
</p>

<p>
The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest
speed.
</p>

<p>
The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation
that he would return. But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his
journey.

<h2><a name="chap49"></a> CHAPTER XLIX.<br />
MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE
THAT INTERRUPTS IT </h2>

<p>
The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a
hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly. The door being opened, a
sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps,
while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood
upon the other side. At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man,
and taking him between them, hurried him into the house. This man was Monks.
</p>

<p>
They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.
Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of this
apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped. The two
men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He knows the alternative,&rdquo; said Mr. Browlow. &ldquo;If he
hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call
for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How dare you say this of me?&rdquo; asked Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How dare you urge me to it, young man?&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow,
confronting him with a steady look. &ldquo;Are you mad enough to leave this
house? Unhand him. There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow. But I warn
you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you
apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery. I am resolute and immoveable. If
you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by
these dogs?&rdquo; asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who
stood beside him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By mine,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;Those persons are
indemnified by me. If you complain of being deprived of your liberty&mdash;you
had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it
advisable to remain quiet&mdash;I say again, throw yourself for protection on
the law. I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to
recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into
other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed,
yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will decide quickly,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness
and composure. &ldquo;If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign
you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder,
foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way. If not, and
you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured,
seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. It has waited for you two whole
days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will be prompt,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;A word from me, and
the alternative has gone for ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Still the man hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have not the inclination to parley,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow,
&ldquo;and, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there&mdash;&rdquo; demanded Monks with a faltering
tongue,&mdash;&ldquo;is there&mdash;no middle course?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his
countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and,
shrugging his shoulders, sat down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lock the door on the outside,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow to the
attendants, &ldquo;and come when I ring.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is pretty treatment, sir,&rdquo; said Monks, throwing down his hat
and cloak, &ldquo;from my father&rsquo;s oldest friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is because I was your father&rsquo;s oldest friend, young man,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;it is because the hopes and wishes of young and
happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and
kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man:
it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters&rsquo;s death-bed when
he was yet a boy, on the morning that would&mdash;but Heaven willed
otherwise&mdash;have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart
clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he
died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and
even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all
these things that I am moved to treat you gently now&mdash;yes, Edward Leeford,
even now&mdash;and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What has the name to do with it?&rdquo; asked the other, after
contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his
companion. &ldquo;What is the name to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;nothing to you. But it was
<i>hers</i>, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man,
the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger.
I am very glad you have changed it&mdash;very&mdash;very.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is all mighty fine,&rdquo; said Monks (to retain his assumed
designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen
defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his face with his hand.
&ldquo;But what do you want with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have a brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: &ldquo;a
brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the
street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in
wonder and alarm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no brother,&rdquo; replied Monks. &ldquo;You know I was an only
child. Why do you talk to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Attend to what I do know, and you may not,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow.
&ldquo;I shall interest you by and by. I know that of the wretched marriage,
into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition,
forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most
unnatural issue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for hard names,&rdquo; interrupted Monks with a
jeering laugh. &ldquo;You know the fact, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I also know,&rdquo; pursued the old gentleman, &ldquo;the misery,
the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how
listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain
through a world that was poisoned to them both. I know how cold formalities
were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike
to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond
asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of
which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society
beneath the gayest looks they could assume. Your mother succeeded; she forgot
it soon. But it rusted and cankered at your father&rsquo;s heart for
years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, they were separated,&rdquo; said Monks, &ldquo;and what of
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When they had been separated for some time,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Brownlow, &ldquo;and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities,
had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with
prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends. This
circumstance, at least, you know already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot
upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. &ldquo;Not
I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never
forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Brownlow. &ldquo;I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than
eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty&mdash;for he was, I
repeat, a boy, when <i>his</i> father ordered him to marry. Must I go back to
events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it,
and disclose to me the truth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have nothing to disclose,&rdquo; rejoined Monks. &ldquo;You must talk
on if you will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These new friends, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;were a naval
officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year
before, and left him with two children&mdash;there had been more, but, of all
their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters; one a
beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three
years old.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this to me?&rdquo; asked Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They resided,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the
interruption, &ldquo;in a part of the country to which your father in his
wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode. Acquaintance,
intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your father was gifted as
few men are. He had his sister&rsquo;s soul and person. As the old officer knew
him more and more, he grew to love him. I would that it had ended there. His
daughter did the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed upon
the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that
daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless
girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your tale is of the longest,&rdquo; observed Monks, moving restlessly in
his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;and such tales usually are; if it were one of
unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief. At length one of those rich
relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been
sacrificed, as others are often&mdash;it is no uncommon case&mdash;died, and to
repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea
for all griefs&mdash;Money. It was necessary that he should immediately repair
to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he had died, leaving
his affairs in great confusion. He went; was seized with mortal illness there;
was followed, the moment the intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who
carried you with her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no
will&mdash;<i>no will</i>&mdash;so that the whole property fell to her and
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of
intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker. As
Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has
experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his
way,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the
other&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;he came to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never heard of that,&rdquo; interrupted Monks in a tone intended to
appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a
picture&mdash;a portrait painted by himself&mdash;a likeness of this poor
girl&mdash;which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward
on his hasty journey. He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow;
talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself;
confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into
money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent
acquisition, to fly the country&mdash;I guessed too well he would not fly
alone&mdash;and never see it more. Even from me, his old and early friend,
whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear
to both&mdash;even from me he withheld any more particular confession,
promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for
the last time on earth. Alas! <i>That</i> was the last time. I had no letter,
and I never saw him more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I went,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, &ldquo;I went,
when all was over, to the scene of his&mdash;I will use the term the world
would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him&mdash;of
his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child
should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her. The family had
left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were
outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night. Why, or whither,
none can tell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of
triumph.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When your brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the
other&rsquo;s chair, &ldquo;When your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected
child: was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me
from a life of vice and infamy&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By me,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;I told you I should interest you
before long. I say by me&mdash;I see that your cunning associate suppressed my
name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears. When
he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his
strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with
astonishment. Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a
lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old
friend flashing on one in a vivid dream. I need not tell you he was snared away
before I knew his history&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Monks hastily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because you know it well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Denial to me is vain,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;I shall show
you that I know more than that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;can&rsquo;t prove anything against me,&rdquo;
stammered Monks. &ldquo;I defy you to do it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; returned the old gentleman with a searching glance.
&ldquo;I lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him. Your mother
being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and
as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West
Indies&mdash;whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother&rsquo;s
death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here&mdash;I made the
voyage. You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but
no one could tell where. I returned. Your agents had no clue to your residence.
You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done: sometimes for
days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to all appearance the same
low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your
associates when a fierce ungovernable boy. I wearied them with new
applications. I paced the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago,
all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now you do see me,&rdquo; said Monks, rising boldly, &ldquo;what
then? Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words&mdash;justified, you think, by
a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man&rsquo;s
Brother! You don&rsquo;t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair;
you don&rsquo;t even know that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>did not</i>,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; &ldquo;but
within the last fortnight I have learnt it all. You have a brother; you know
it, and him. There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret
and the gain to you at her own death. It contained a reference to some child
likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and
accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by
his resemblance to your father. You repaired to the place of his birth. There
existed proofs&mdash;proofs long suppressed&mdash;of his birth and parentage.
Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your
accomplice the Jew, &lsquo;<i>the only proofs of the boy&rsquo;s identity lie
at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother
is rotting in her coffin</i>.&rsquo; Unworthy son, coward, liar,&mdash;you, who
hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at
night,&mdash;you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the
head of one worth millions such as you,&mdash;you, who from your cradle were
gall and bitterness to your own father&rsquo;s heart, and in whom all evil
passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous
disease which had made your face an index even to your mind&mdash;you, Edward
Leeford, do you still brave me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated
charges.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every word!&rdquo; cried the gentleman, &ldquo;every word that has
passed between you and this detested villain, is known to me. Shadows on the
wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the
persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost
the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you were morally if
not really a party.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interposed Monks. &ldquo;I&mdash;I knew nothing of that;
I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me. I
didn&rsquo;t know the cause. I thought it was a common quarrel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Brownlow. &ldquo;Will you disclose the whole?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before
witnesses?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I promise too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with
me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you insist upon that, I&rsquo;ll do that also,&rdquo; replied Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must do more than that,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;Make
restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the
offspring of a guilty and most miserable love. You have not forgotten the
provisions of the will. Carry them into execution so far as your brother is
concerned, and then go where you please. In this world you need meet no
more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on this
proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears on the one hand
and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman
(Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent agitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man will be taken,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He will be taken
to-night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The murderer?&rdquo; asked Mr. Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;His dog has been seen lurking
about some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is,
or will be, there, under cover of the darkness. Spies are hovering about in
every direction. I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and
they tell me he cannot escape. A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by
Government to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will give fifty more,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;and proclaim it
with my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it. Where is Mr. Maylie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Harry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with
you, he hurried off to where he heard this,&rdquo; replied the doctor,
&ldquo;and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some
place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fagin,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;what of him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this
time. They&rsquo;re sure of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you made up your mind?&rdquo; asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice,
of Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;will be secret with
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will. Remain here till I return. It is your only hope of
safety.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They left the room, and the door was again locked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; asked the doctor in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All that I could hope to do, and even more. Coupling the poor
girl&rsquo;s intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our
good friend&rsquo;s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape,
and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day.
Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the meeting. We
shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest: especially the
young lady, who <i>may</i> have greater need of firmness than either you or I
can quite foresee just now. But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered
creature. Which way have they taken?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Losberne. &ldquo;I will remain here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly
uncontrollable.

<h2><a name="chap50"></a> CHAPTER L.<br />
THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE </h2>

<p>
Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where
the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest
with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses, there
exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many
localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the
great mass of its inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close,
narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside
people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion. The
cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest
and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman&rsquo;s door,
and stream from the house-parapet and windows. Jostling with unemployed
labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women,
ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with
difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow
alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of
ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of
warehouses that rise from every corner. Arriving, at length, in streets remoter
and less-frequented than those through which he has passed, he walks beneath
tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem
to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows
guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every
imaginable sign of desolation and neglect.
</p>

<p>
In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark, stands
Jacob&rsquo;s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and
fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in
the days of this story as Folly Ditch. It is a creek or inlet from the Thames,
and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills
from which it took its old name. At such times, a stranger, looking from one of
the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of
the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets,
pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when
his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost
astonishment will be excited by the scene before him. Crazy wooden galleries
common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon
the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which
to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined,
that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they
shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and
threatening to fall into it&mdash;as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and
decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome
indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of Folly
Ditch.
</p>

<p>
In Jacob&rsquo;s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are
crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the
streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke. Thirty or forty
years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving
place; but now it is a desolate island indeed. The houses have no owners; they
are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they
live, and there they die. They must have powerful motives for a secret
residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in
Jacob&rsquo;s Island.
</p>

<p>
In an upper room of one of these houses&mdash;a detached house of fair size,
ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which
house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described&mdash;there were
assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks
expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and
gloomy silence. One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the
third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some
old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be
traced to the same occasion. This man was a returned transport, and his name
was Kags.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, &ldquo;that you had
picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come
here, my fine feller.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you, blunder-head!&rdquo; said Kags.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I thought you&rsquo;d have been a little more glad to see me than
this,&rdquo; replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, look&rsquo;e, young gentleman,&rdquo; said Toby, &ldquo;when a man
keeps himself so very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug
house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it&rsquo;s
rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman
(however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at
conweniency) circumstanced as you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with
him, that&rsquo;s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is
too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,&rdquo; added
Mr. Kags.
</p>

<p>
There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as
hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care swagger,
turned to Chitling and said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When was Fagin took then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just at dinner-time&mdash;two o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. Charley and
I made our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty
water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck
out at the top, and so they took him too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Bet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Bet! She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,&rdquo;
replied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, &ldquo;and went off
mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put
a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital&mdash;and there she
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s come of young Bates?&rdquo; demanded Kags.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he&rsquo;ll be here
soon,&rdquo; replied Chitling. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nowhere else to go to now,
for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the
ken&mdash;I went up there and see it with my own eyes&mdash;is filled with
traps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a smash,&rdquo; observed Toby, biting his lips.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than one will go with this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The sessions are on,&rdquo; said Kags: &ldquo;if they get the inquest
over, and Bolter turns King&rsquo;s evidence: as of course he will, from what
he&rsquo;s said already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and
get the trial on on Friday, and he&rsquo;ll swing in six days from this, by
G&mdash;!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should have heard the people groan,&rdquo; said Chitling; &ldquo;the
officers fought like devils, or they&rsquo;d have torn him away. He was down
once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should
have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as
if they were his dearest friends. I can see &rsquo;em now, not able to stand
upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst &rsquo;em;
I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their
teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear
the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd
at the street corner, and swore they&rsquo;d tear his heart out!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and
with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one
distracted.
</p>

<p>
While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes
fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and
Sikes&rsquo;s dog bounded into the room. They ran to the window, downstairs,
and into the street. The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no
attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo; said Toby when they had
returned. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be coming here. I&mdash;I&mdash;hope
not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he was coming here, he&rsquo;d have come with the dog,&rdquo; said
Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.
&ldquo;Here! Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s drunk it all up, every drop,&rdquo; said Chitling after
watching the dog some time in silence. &ldquo;Covered with
mud&mdash;lame&mdash;half blind&mdash;he must have come a long way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where can he have come from!&rdquo; exclaimed Toby. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come
on here, where he&rsquo;s been many a time and often. But where can he have
come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rdquo;&mdash;(none of them called the murderer by his old
name)&mdash;&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t have made away with himself. What do you
think?&rdquo; said Chitling.
</p>

<p>
Toby shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he had,&rdquo; said Kags, &ldquo;the dog &rsquo;ud want to lead us
away to where he did it. No. I think he&rsquo;s got out of the country, and
left the dog behind. He must have given him the slip somehow, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t be so easy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the
dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice
from anybody.
</p>

<p>
It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon
the table. The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression
on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position.
They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound. They spoke
little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the
remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room.
</p>

<p>
They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the
door below.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Young Bates,&rdquo; said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear
he felt himself.
</p>

<p>
The knocking came again. No, it wasn&rsquo;t he. He never knocked like that.
</p>

<p>
Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. There was
no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough. The dog too was on
the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must let him in,&rdquo; he said, taking up the candle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any help for it?&rdquo; asked the other man in a
hoarse voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None. He <i>must</i> come in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave us in the dark,&rdquo; said Kags, taking down a candle
from the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the
knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.
</p>

<p>
Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower
part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his head under
his hat. He drew them slowly off. Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks,
beard of three days&rsquo; growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the
very ghost of Sikes.
</p>

<p>
He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but
shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his
shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall&mdash;as close as it would
go&mdash;and ground it against it&mdash;and sat down.
</p>

<p>
Not a word had been exchanged. He looked from one to another in silence. If an
eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted. When his
hollow voice broke silence, they all three started. They seemed never to have
heard its tones before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How came that dog here?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alone. Three hours ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-night&rsquo;s paper says that Fagin&rsquo;s took. Is it true, or a
lie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were silent again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn you all!&rdquo; said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead.
&ldquo;Have you nothing to say to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You that keep this house,&rdquo; said Sikes, turning his face to
Crackit, &ldquo;do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is
over?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may stop here, if you think it safe,&rdquo; returned the person
addressed, after some hesitation.
</p>

<p>
Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to turn his
head than actually doing it: and said, &ldquo;Is&mdash;it&mdash;the
body&mdash;is it buried?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They shook their heads.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; he retorted with the same glance behind him.
&ldquo;Wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground
for?&mdash;Who&rsquo;s that knocking?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there was
nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him. Sikes
sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he
encountered his figure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Toby,&rdquo; said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards
him, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this, downstairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that
the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad. Accordingly he
nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me go into some other room,&rdquo; said the boy, retreating still
farther.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Charley!&rdquo; said Sikes, stepping forward. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come nearer me,&rdquo; answered the boy, still retreating,
and looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;You monster!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes&rsquo;s eyes
sunk gradually to the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Witness you three,&rdquo; cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and
becoming more and more excited as he spoke. &ldquo;Witness you
three&mdash;I&rsquo;m not afraid of him&mdash;if they come here after him,
I&rsquo;ll give him up; I will. I tell you out at once. He may kill me for it
if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I&rsquo;ll give him up. I&rsquo;d
give him up if he was to be boiled alive. Murder! Help! If there&rsquo;s the
pluck of a man among you three, you&rsquo;ll help me. Murder! Help! Down with
him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the
boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in the
intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
The three spectators seemed quite stupefied. They offered no interference, and
the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the
blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the
garments about the murderer&rsquo;s breast, and never ceasing to call for help
with all his might.
</p>

<p>
The contest, however, was too unequal to last long. Sikes had him down, and his
knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and
pointed to the window. There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and
earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps&mdash;endless they seemed
in number&mdash;crossing the nearest wooden bridge. One man on horseback seemed
to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven
pavement. The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and
noisily on. Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur
from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here! Break down the door!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; cried the voices without; and the
hoarse cry arose again, but louder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Break down the door!&rdquo; screamed the boy. &ldquo;I tell you
they&rsquo;ll never open it. Run straight to the room where the light is. Break
down the door!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he
ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener,
for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching
Hell-babe,&rdquo; cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the
boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. &ldquo;That door.
Quick!&rdquo; He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. &ldquo;Is the
downstairs door fast?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Double-locked and chained,&rdquo; replied Crackit, who, with the other
two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The panels&mdash;are they strong?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lined with sheet-iron.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the windows too?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and the windows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and
menacing the crowd. &ldquo;Do your worst! I&rsquo;ll cheat you yet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the
cry of the infuriated throng. Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the
house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead. Among them all,
none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the
saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried,
beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, &ldquo;Twenty
guineas to the man who brings a ladder!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. Some called for
ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to
seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in
impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of
madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest
attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all
waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an
angry wind: and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The tide,&rdquo; cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room,
and shut the faces out, &ldquo;the tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a
long rope. They&rsquo;re all in front. I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and
clear off that way. Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill
myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer,
hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house-top.
</p>

<p>
All the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except
one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small
even for the passage of his body. But, from this aperture, he had never ceased
to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer
emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof, a loud shout
proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round,
pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream.
</p>

<p>
He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly
against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the
inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet.
</p>

<p>
The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.
</p>

<p>
The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions and
doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was
defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their
previous shouting had been whispers. Again and again it rose. Those who were at
too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and
re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to
curse him.
</p>

<p>
On pressed the people from the front&mdash;on, on, on, in a strong struggling
current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up,
and show them out in all their wrath and passion. The houses on the opposite
side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn
bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon
cluster of people clinging to every house-top. Each little bridge (and there
were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it. Still the
current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts,
and only for an instant see the wretch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They have him now,&rdquo; cried a man on the nearest bridge.
&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will give fifty pounds,&rdquo; cried an old gentleman from the same
quarter, &ldquo;to the man who takes him alive. I will remain here, till he
come to ask me for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was another roar. At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that
the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ladder
had mounted into the room. The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran
from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the
bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street,
joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left:
each man crushing and striving with his neighbor, and all panting with
impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers
brought him out. The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to
suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were
dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time, between
the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing
struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate
attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness
for his capture was, if possible, increased.
</p>

<p>
The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and
the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less
rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to make one
last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being
stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion.
</p>

<p>
Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the
house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his
foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and
firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of
his hands and teeth almost in a second. He could let himself down by the cord
to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife
ready in his hand to cut it then and drop.
</p>

<p>
At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping
it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman before-mentioned (who had
clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the
crowd, and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man
was about to lower himself down&mdash;at that very instant the murderer,
looking behind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a
yell of terror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The eyes again!&rdquo; he cried in an unearthly screech.
</p>

<p>
Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over the
parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight, tight as a
bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. He fell for five-and-thirty feet.
There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung,
with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand.
</p>

<p>
The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The murderer
swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body
which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for
God&rsquo;s sake.
</p>

<p>
A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the
parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the
dead man&rsquo;s shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning
completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out
his brains.

<h2><a name="chap51"></a> CHAPTER LI.<br />
AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A
PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY </h2>

<p>
The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver
found himself, at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, in a
travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town. Mrs. Maylie, and
Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr. Brownlow
followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not
been mentioned.
</p>

<p>
They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation
and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and
almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions,
who shared it, in at least an equal degree. He and the two ladies had been very
carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions
which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of
their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun,
still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave
them in endurance of the most intense suspense.
</p>

<p>
The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne&rsquo;s assistance, cautiously
stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive
intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.
&ldquo;It was quite true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that they must know them
before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could
not be at a worse.&rdquo; So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with
reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed
to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.
</p>

<p>
But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed
towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the whole current of
his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were
wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on
foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him, or a roof
to shelter his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See there, there!&rdquo; cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of
Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the stile I
came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should
overtake me and force me back! Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to
the old house where I was a little child! Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if
I could only see you now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will see him soon,&rdquo; replied Rose, gently taking his folded
hands between her own. &ldquo;You shall tell him how happy you are, and how
rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as
the coming back to make him happy too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Oliver, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
take him away from here, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some
quiet country place where he may grow strong and well,&mdash;shall we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rose nodded &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; for the boy was smiling through such happy tears
that she could not speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,&rdquo; said
Oliver. &ldquo;It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but
never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again&mdash;I
know that too&mdash;to think how changed he is; you did the same with me. He
said &lsquo;God bless you&rsquo; to me when I ran away,&rdquo; cried the boy
with a burst of affectionate emotion; &ldquo;and I will say &lsquo;God bless
you&rsquo; now, and show him how I love him for it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it
became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable
bounds. There was Sowerberry&rsquo;s the undertaker&rsquo;s just as it used to
be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered
it&mdash;there were all the well-known shops and houses, with almost every one
of which he had some slight incident connected&mdash;there was Gamfield&rsquo;s
cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old public-house
door&mdash;there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his youthful days,
with its dismal windows frowning on the street&mdash;there was the same lean
porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back,
and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed
again&mdash;there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew
quite well&mdash;there was nearly everything as if he had left it but
yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy dream.
</p>

<p>
But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. They drove straight to the door of
the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty
palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size); and here was
Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one
too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole
party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head&mdash;no, not
once; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road
to London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way
once, and that time fast asleep. There was dinner prepared, and there were
bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was over, the
same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down. Mr.
Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room. The two
other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short
intervals when they were present, conversed apart. Once, Mrs. Maylie was called
away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen
with weeping. All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new
secrets, nervous and uncomfortable. They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they
exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the
sound of their own voices.
</p>

<p>
At length, when nine o&rsquo;clock had come, and they began to think they were
to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room,
followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to
see; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same man he had met
at the market-town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little
room. Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at
the astonished boy, and sat down near the door. Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in
his hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a painful task,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but these declarations,
which have been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance
repeated here. I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them
from your own lips before we part, and you know why.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the person addressed, turning away his face.
&ldquo;Quick. I have almost done enough, I think. Don&rsquo;t keep me
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This child,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying
his hand upon his head, &ldquo;is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of
your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who
died in giving him birth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of
whose heart he might have heard. &ldquo;That is the bastard child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The term you use,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, &ldquo;is a
reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It
reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass. He
was born in this town.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the workhouse of this town,&rdquo; was the sullen reply. &ldquo;You
have the story there.&rdquo; He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must have it here, too,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon
the listeners.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Listen then! You!&rdquo; returned Monks. &ldquo;His father being taken
ill at Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long
separated, who went from Paris and took me with her&mdash;to look after his
property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for
her. He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till
next day, when he died. Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the
night his illness first came on, directed to yourself&rdquo;; he addressed
himself to Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;and enclosed in a few short lines to you, with
an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till
after he was dead. One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the
other a will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What of the letter?&rdquo; asked Mr. Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The letter?&mdash;A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a
penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her. He had palmed a tale on
the girl that some secret mystery&mdash;to be explained one day&mdash;prevented
his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him,
until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back. She
was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement. He told her all he
had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he
died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be
visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his. He reminded her
of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian
name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have
bestowed upon her&mdash;prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart,
as she had done before&mdash;and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over
and over again, as if he had gone distracted. I believe he had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The will,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver&rsquo;s tears fell fast.
</p>

<p>
Monks was silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The will,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, &ldquo;was in the
same spirit as the letter. He talked of miseries which his wife had brought
upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad
passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you,
and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The bulk of his
property he divided into two equal portions&mdash;one for Agnes Fleming, and
the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age. If
it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only
on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name
with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong. He did this,
he said, to mark his confidence in the mother, and his conviction&mdash;only
strengthened by approaching death&mdash;that the child would share her gentle
heart, and noble nature. If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the
money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both children were
equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon
his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and
aversion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; said Monks, in a louder tone, &ldquo;did what a woman
should have done. She burnt this will. The letter never reached its
destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to
lie away the blot. The girl&rsquo;s father had the truth from her with every
aggravation that her violent hate&mdash;I love her for it now&mdash;could add.
Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of
Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat;
and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed. The girl had
left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot,
in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home,
assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old
heart broke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the
narrative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Years after this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this man&rsquo;s&mdash;Edward
Leeford&rsquo;s&mdash;mother came to me. He had left her, when only eighteen;
robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to
London: where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts. She was
sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before
she died. Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were
unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with
her to France.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There she died,&rdquo; said Monks, &ldquo;after a lingering illness;
and, on her death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her
unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved&mdash;though she need
not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before. She would not
believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled
with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive. I swore to
her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to
pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it
the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that
insulting will by draggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot. She was
right. He came in my way at last. I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I
would have finished as I began!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself
in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group
beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and
confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared: of which some part
was to be given up, in the event of his being rescued: and that a dispute on
this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of
identifying him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The locket and ring?&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from
the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,&rdquo; answered Monks without
raising his eyes. &ldquo;You know what became of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great
alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her unwilling
consort after him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do my hi&rsquo;s deceive me!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned
enthusiasm, &ldquo;or is that little Oliver? Oh O-li-ver, if you know&rsquo;d
how I&rsquo;ve been a-grieving for you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue, fool,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?&rdquo; remonstrated the workhouse
master. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I be supposed to feel&mdash;<i>I</i> as brought him
up porochially&mdash;when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen
of the very affablest description! I always loved that boy as if he&rsquo;d
been my&mdash;my&mdash;my own grandfather,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, halting for
an appropriate comparison. &ldquo;Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the
blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat? Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a
oak coffin with plated handles, Oliver.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; &ldquo;suppress your
feelings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will do my endeavours, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bumble. &ldquo;How do
you do, sir? I hope you are very well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to within a
short distance of the respectable couple. He inquired, as he pointed to Monks,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know that person?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her
spouse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never saw him in all my life,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor sold him anything, perhaps?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bumble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?&rdquo; said Mr.
Brownlow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the matron. &ldquo;Why are we brought here
to answer to such nonsense as this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman limped away
with extraordinary readiness. But not again did he return with a stout man and
wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as
they walked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shut the door the night old Sally died,&rdquo; said the foremost
one, raising her shrivelled hand, &ldquo;but you couldn&rsquo;t shut out the
sound, nor stop the chinks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the other, looking round her and wagging her
toothless jaws. &ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We heard her try to tell you what she&rsquo;d done, and saw you take a
paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s
shop,&rdquo; said the first.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the second, &ldquo;and it was a &lsquo;locket and gold
ring.&rsquo; We found out that, and saw it given you. We were by. Oh! we were
by.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And we know more than that,&rdquo; resumed the first, &ldquo;for she
told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she
should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken
ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?&rdquo; asked Mr. Grimwig
with a motion towards the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the woman; &ldquo;if he&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed to
Monks&mdash;&ldquo;has been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you
have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing
more to say. I <i>did</i> sell them, and they&rsquo;re where you&rsquo;ll never
get them. What then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, &ldquo;except that it remains for
us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again.
You may leave the room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness,
as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: &ldquo;I hope that this
unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial
office?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed it will,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;You may make up your
mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was all Mrs. Bumble. She <i>would</i> do it,&rdquo; urged Mr. Bumble;
first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is no excuse,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;You were present
on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more
guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife
acts under your direction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If the law supposes that,&rdquo; said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat
emphatically in both hands, &ldquo;the law is a ass&mdash;a idiot. If
that&rsquo;s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish
the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience&mdash;by
experience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble fixed his
hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his helpmate
downstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, &ldquo;give me
your hand. Do not tremble. You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we
have to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If they have&mdash;I do not know how they can, but if they
have&mdash;any reference to me,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;pray let me hear them
at some other time. I have not strength or spirits now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his;
&ldquo;you have more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know this young
lady, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never saw you before,&rdquo; said Rose faintly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen you often,&rdquo; returned Monks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The father of the unhappy Agnes had <i>two</i> daughters,&rdquo; said
Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;What was the fate of the other&mdash;the child?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The child,&rdquo; replied Monks, &ldquo;when her father died in a
strange place, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper
that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be
traced&mdash;the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as
their own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach.
&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t find the spot to which these people had
repaired,&rdquo; said Monks, &ldquo;but where friendship fails, hatred will
often force a way. My mother found it, after a year of cunning search&mdash;ay,
and found the child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She took it, did she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. The people were poor and began to sicken&mdash;at least the man
did&mdash;of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small
present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never
meant to send. She didn&rsquo;t quite rely, however, on their discontent and
poverty for the child&rsquo;s unhappiness, but told the history of the
sister&rsquo;s shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good
heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was
illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other. The circumstances
countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on
an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady,
residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took her
home. There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our
efforts she remained there and was happy. I lost sight of her, two or three
years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you see her now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Leaning on your arm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But not the less my niece,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the
fainting girl in her arms; &ldquo;not the less my dearest child. I would not
lose her now, for all the treasures of the world. My sweet companion, my own
dear girl!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only friend I ever had,&rdquo; cried Rose, clinging to her.
&ldquo;The kindest, best of friends. My heart will burst. I cannot bear all
this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest
creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Maylie, embracing her tenderly. &ldquo;Come, come, my love, remember who this
is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here&mdash;look, look,
my dear!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not aunt,&rdquo; cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never call her aunt&mdash;sister, my own dear sister, that
something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling
Rose!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long
close embrace between the orphans, be sacred. A father, sister, and mother,
were gained, and lost, in that one moment. Joy and grief were mingled in the
cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even grief itself arose so softened,
and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn
pleasure, and lost all character of pain.
</p>

<p>
They were a long, long time alone. A soft tap at the door, at length announced
that some one was without. Oliver opened it, glided away, and gave place to
Harry Maylie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know it all,&rdquo; he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl.
&ldquo;Dear Rose, I know it all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not here by accident,&rdquo; he added after a lengthened silence;
&ldquo;nor have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday&mdash;only
yesterday. Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;You <i>do</i> know all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All. You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject
of our last discourse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to press you to alter your determination,&rdquo; pursued the young
man, &ldquo;but to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of
station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to
your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to
change it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,&rdquo;
said Rose firmly. &ldquo;If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose
goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever
feel it, as I should to-night? It is a struggle,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;but
one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The disclosure of to-night,&rdquo;&mdash;Harry began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The disclosure of to-night,&rdquo; replied Rose softly, &ldquo;leaves me
in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood
before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You harden your heart against me, Rose,&rdquo; urged her lover.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh Harry, Harry,&rdquo; said the young lady, bursting into tears;
&ldquo;I wish I could, and spare myself this pain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why inflict it on yourself?&rdquo; said Harry, taking her hand.
&ldquo;Think, dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what have I heard! What have I heard!&rdquo; cried Rose. &ldquo;That
a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned
all&mdash;there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not yet, not yet,&rdquo; said the young man, detaining her as she rose.
&ldquo;My hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my
love for you: have undergone a change. I offer you, now, no distinction among a
bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the
blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a
home&mdash;a heart and home&mdash;yes, dearest Rose, and those, and those
alone, are all I have to offer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean!&rdquo; she faltered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean but this&mdash;that when I left you last, I left you with a firm
determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved
that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of
birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it. This I have done.
Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved
you so far right. Such power and patronage: such relatives of influence and
rank: as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and
waving trees in England&rsquo;s richest county; and by one village
church&mdash;mine, Rose, my own!&mdash;there stands a rustic dwelling which you
can make me prouder of, than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a
thousandfold. This is my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,&rdquo; said Mr.
Grimwig, waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head.
</p>

<p>
Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time. Neither
Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could offer a word
in extenuation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,&rdquo; said Mr.
Grimwig, &ldquo;for I began to think I should get nothing else. I&rsquo;ll take
the liberty, if you&rsquo;ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to
be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing
girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the doctor and
Mr. Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it,
originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this
downright scandal: he being young and a clergyman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oliver, my child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &ldquo;where have you been,
and why do you look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this
moment. What is the matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes
that do our nature the greatest honour.
</p>

<p>
Poor Dick was dead!

<h2><a name="chap52"></a> CHAPTER LII.<br />
FAGIN&rsquo;S LAST NIGHT ALIVE </h2>

<p>
The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive and
eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before the dock, away
into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were
fixed upon one man&mdash;Fagin. Before him and behind: above, below, on the
right and on the left: he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright
with gleaming eyes.
</p>

<p>
He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the
wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward
to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the
presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury. At times, he turned
his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight
in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible
distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even
then, urge something in his behalf. Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he
stirred not hand or foot. He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now
that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude
of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still.
</p>

<p>
A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking round, he saw
that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict. As his eyes
wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see
his face: some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes: and others
whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence. A few there
were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient
wonder how they could delay. But in no one face&mdash;not even among the women,
of whom there were many there&mdash;could he read the faintest sympathy with
himself, or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be
condemned.
</p>

<p>
As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came
again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge.
Hush!
</p>

<p>
They only sought permission to retire.
</p>

<p>
He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as
though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless. The
jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed mechanically to the end of the
dock, and sat down on a chair. The man pointed it out, or he would not have
seen it.
</p>

<p>
He looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating, and some
fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot.
There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book. He wondered
whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point, and
made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done.
</p>

<p>
In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to
busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it
on. There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some
half an hour before, and now come back. He wondered within himself whether this
man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and
pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and
roused another.
</p>

<p>
Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive
overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to
him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it.
Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy
death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the
head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as
it was. Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the
scaffold&mdash;and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool
it&mdash;and then went on to think again.
</p>

<p>
At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards
the door. The jury returned, and passed him close. He could glean nothing from
their faces; they might as well have been of stone. Perfect stillness
ensued&mdash;not a rustle&mdash;not a breath&mdash;Guilty.
</p>

<p>
The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then
it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry
thunder. It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that
he would die on Monday.
</p>

<p>
The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of
death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his listening attitude, and
looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice
repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an
old man&mdash;an old man&mdash;and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent
again.
</p>

<p>
The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air
and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by
this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and
bent forward yet more attentively. The address was solemn and impressive; the
sentence fearful to hear. But he stood, like a marble figure, without the
motion of a nerve. His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw
hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand
upon his arm, and beckoned him away. He gazed stupidly about him for an
instant, and obeyed.
</p>

<p>
They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were
waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who
crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard. There was nobody there
to speak to <i>him</i>; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render
him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars: and they assailed
him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed. He shook his fist, and
would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy
passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.
</p>

<p>
Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of
anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the
condemned cells, and left him there&mdash;alone.
</p>

<p>
He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and
bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his
thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what
the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not
hear a word. These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees
suggested more: so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was
delivered. To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead&mdash;that was the end.
To be hanged by the neck till he was dead.
</p>

<p>
As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had
died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. They rose up, in such
quick succession, that he could hardly count them. He had seen some of them
die,&mdash;and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips.
With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed,
from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes!
</p>

<p>
Some of them might have inhabited that very cell&mdash;sat upon that very spot.
It was very dark; why didn&rsquo;t they bring a light? The cell had been built
for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last hours there. It was
like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies&mdash;the cap, the noose, the
pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous
veil.&mdash;Light, light!
</p>

<p>
At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and
walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron
candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which
to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more.
</p>

<p>
Then came the night&mdash;dark, dismal, silent night. Other watchers are glad
to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day. To him
they brought despair. The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one,
deep, hollow sound&mdash;Death. What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful
morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was another form of knell,
with mockery added to the warning.
</p>

<p>
The day passed off. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as
come&mdash;and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in
its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours. At one time he raved and
blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair. Venerable men of his own
persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with
curses. They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off.
</p>

<p>
Saturday night. He had only one night more to live. And as he thought of this,
the day broke&mdash;Sunday.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of
his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted
soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that
he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so
soon. He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in
their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse
his attention. He had sat there, awake, but dreaming. Now, he started up, every
minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a
paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they&mdash;used to such
sights&mdash;recoiled from him with horror. He grew so terrible, at last, in
all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit
there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.
</p>

<p>
He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had been
wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his
head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair hung down upon his bloodless
face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a
terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up.
Eight&mdash;nine&mdash;then. If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those
were the real hours treading on each other&rsquo;s heels, where would he be,
when they came round again! Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the
previous hour had ceased to vibrate. At eight, he would be the only mourner in
his own funeral train; at eleven&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such
unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from
the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that. The few who
lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be
hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen
him.
</p>

<p>
From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three
presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious faces,
whether any reprieve had been received. These being answered in the negative,
communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed
out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the
scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to
conjure up the scene. By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour,
in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.
</p>

<p>
The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted
black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the
expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and
presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs.
They were immediately admitted into the lodge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?&rdquo; said the man whose duty
it was to conduct them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a sight for children, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not indeed, my friend,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Brownlow; &ldquo;but my
business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has
seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as
well&mdash;even at the cost of some pain and fear&mdash;that he should see him
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver. The man
touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another
gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark
and winding ways, towards the cells.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple
of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence&mdash;&ldquo;this
is the place he passes through. If you step this way, you can see the door he
goes out at.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison
food, and pointed to a door. There was an open grating above it, through which
came the sound of men&rsquo;s voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and
the throwing down of boards. They were putting up the scaffold.
</p>

<p>
From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other
turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a
flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on
the left hand. Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at
one of these with his bunch of keys. The two attendants, after a little
whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the
temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell.
They did so.
</p>

<p>
The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to
side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a
man. His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to
mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part
of his vision.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good boy, Charley&mdash;well done&mdash;&rdquo; he mumbled.
&ldquo;Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha! Oliver too&mdash;quite the gentleman
now&mdash;quite the&mdash;take that boy away to bed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to be
alarmed, looked on without speaking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take him away to bed!&rdquo; cried Fagin. &ldquo;Do you hear me, some of
you? He has been the&mdash;the&mdash;somehow the cause of all this. It&rsquo;s
worth the money to bring him up to it&mdash;Bolter&rsquo;s throat, Bill; never
mind the girl&mdash;Bolter&rsquo;s throat as deep as you can cut. Saw his head
off!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fagin,&rdquo; said the jailer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the
attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial. &ldquo;An old man, my
Lord; a very old, old man!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep
him down. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some
questions, I suppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be one long,&rdquo; he replied, looking up with a face
retaining no human expression but rage and terror. &ldquo;Strike them all dead!
What right have they to butcher me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to the
furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Steady,&rdquo; said the turnkey, still holding him down. &ldquo;Now,
sir, tell him what you want. Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the
time gets on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have some papers,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow advancing, &ldquo;which
were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a lie together,&rdquo; replied Fagin. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t one&mdash;not one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the love of God,&rdquo; said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, &ldquo;do not
say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. You
know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any
further gain. Where are those papers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; cried Fagin, beckoning to him. &ldquo;Here, here! Let me
whisper to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished
Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The papers,&rdquo; said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, &ldquo;are in
a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I
want to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; returned Oliver. &ldquo;Let me say a prayer. Do! Let me
say one prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till
morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Outside, outside,&rdquo; replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him
towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head. &ldquo;Say I&rsquo;ve
gone to sleep&mdash;they&rsquo;ll believe you. You can get me out, if you take
me so. Now then, now then!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! God forgive this wretched man!&rdquo; cried the boy with a burst of
tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Fagin.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll help us on. This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we
pass the gallows, don&rsquo;t you mind, but hurry on. Now, now, now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?&rdquo; inquired the turnkey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No other question,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &ldquo;If I hoped we
could recall him to a sense of his position&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing will do that, sir,&rdquo; replied the man, shaking his head.
&ldquo;You had better leave him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Press on, press on,&rdquo; cried Fagin. &ldquo;Softly, but not so slow.
Faster, faster!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held him
back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent
up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their
ears until they reached the open yard.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before they left the prison. Oliver nearly swooned after this
frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the
strength to walk.
</p>

<p>
Day was dawning when they again emerged. A great multitude had already
assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to
beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking. Everything told
of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of
all&mdash;the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous
apparatus of death.

<h2><a name="chap53"></a> CHAPTER LIII.<br />
AND LAST </h2>

<p>
The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed. The
little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple
words.
</p>

<p>
Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in
the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young
clergyman&rsquo;s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of
their new and happy home.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy,
during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and
worth can know&mdash;the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the
warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been
unceasingly bestowed.
</p>

<p>
It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property
remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his
hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and
Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds. By the
provisions of his father&rsquo;s will, Oliver would have been entitled to the
whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity
of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this
mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded.
</p>

<p>
Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant
part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell
into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh
act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder,
and died in prison. As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his
friend Fagin&rsquo;s gang.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old
housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear friends
resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver&rsquo;s warm and
earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition
approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this
changing world.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to
Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been
discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have
turned quite peevish if he had known how. For two or three months, he contented
himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then,
finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he
settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor&rsquo;s cottage outside
the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously
recovered. Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and
various other pursuits of a similar kind: all undertaken with his
characteristic impetuosity. In each and all he has since become famous
throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority.
</p>

<p>
Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr.
Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He is
accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the
year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with
great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but
always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right
one. On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young
clergyman&rsquo;s face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence
afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well
not to say so. It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to
rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night
on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but Mr.
Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks
that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on
his side, and increases his good humour.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of
being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his profession not
altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss
for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work. After some
consideration, he went into business as an informer, in which calling he
realises a genteel subsistence. His plan is, to walk out once a week during
church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire. The lady faints away
at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with
three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and
pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result
is the same.
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to
great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same
workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others. Mr. Bumble has been
heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to
be thankful for being separated from his wife.
</p>

<p>
As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although
the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. They sleep at the
parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver
and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never
been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong.
</p>

<p>
Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes&rsquo;s crime, fell into a train of
reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving at the
conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the
past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action. He struggled hard, and
suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good
purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer&rsquo;s drudge, and a
carrier&rsquo;s lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all
Northamptonshire.
</p>

<p>
And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the
conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread
of these adventures.
</p>

<p>
I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved,
and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would show Rose
Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded
path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and
shone into their hearts. I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side
circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry
fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit
evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the
smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and
her dead sister&rsquo;s child happy in their love for one another, and passing
whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I
would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered
round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of
that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the
soft blue eye. These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and
speech&mdash;I would fain recall them every one.
</p>

<p>
How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted
child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as
his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him
to become&mdash;how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that
awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and
soothing&mdash;how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons
in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had
protected and preserved them&mdash;these are all matters which need not to be
told. I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and
humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose
great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never
be attained.
</p>

<p>
Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet,
which bears as yet but one word: &ldquo;AGNES.&rdquo; There is no coffin in
that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above
it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots
hallowed by the love&mdash;the love beyond the grave&mdash;of those whom they
knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that
solemn nook. I believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and
she was weak and erring.

1.F.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
