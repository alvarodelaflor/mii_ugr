Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project develops and tests a theory of relational                    
              cohesion that indicates how and when power in negotiations affects             
              the development of commitment among parties to an exchange.  It                
              does so through three laboratory experiments, one on each of three             
              commitment behaviors: (1) staying in the relationship even if                  
              better ones become available; (2) giving each other gifts that do              
              not require immediate reciprocity; (3) contributing to a joint fund            
              with the other.  Each experiment will assign 80 same-sex dyads to              
              one of four experimental conditions in a standard two-party                    
              explicit bargaining setting.  The theory and experimental test will            
              suggest how an exchange relationship having an instrumental                    
              foundation becomes more expressive if exchanges are successfully               
              negotiated over time.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to our understanding of the                  
              emergence of commitment in human interactions, illuminating how                
              people come to have positive emotions toward each other quite                  
              beyond the satisfaction of self-interested needs.  It provides an              
              important link between laboratory social psychology studies of                 
              exchange and the sociology of emotions, a field that has grown                 
              substantially in very recent years.
