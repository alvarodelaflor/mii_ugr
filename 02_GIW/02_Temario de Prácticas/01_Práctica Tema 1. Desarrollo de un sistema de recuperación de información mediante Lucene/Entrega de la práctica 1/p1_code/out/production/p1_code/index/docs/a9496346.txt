Abstract    :
              This research will be supported by field, geologic and scientific              
              advice from Dr. G. V. Nesterenko of the Vernadsky Institute of                 
              Geochemistry in Moscow, who has already provided approximately 50              
              samples of Siberian Flood Basalt Province (SFBP) which are fresh,              
              and well-controlled in terms of their volcano-stratigraphic                    
              positions.  The plan of this initial study is to characterize the              
              overall temporal and spatial variations in the SFBP by analyzing               
              the rest of the samples for Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr, and U-Th-Pb systematics.             
              Some of these samples are also selected for grain-picking to do a              
              laser-heating 40Ar/39Ar age determinations, to be done at the                  
              Institute for Human Origins.  The proposed research on the SFBP                
              will provide new information through which to study and interpret              
              the origin of other flood basalt provinces.
