Abstract    :
                   Phenotypic plasticity permits individuals to express                      
              different, functionally adaptive phenotypes in response to                     
              different environmental circumstances.  It has long been speculated            
              that such plasticity increases the range of habitats that a species            
              may occupy.  I propose to determine whether phenotypic plasticity              
              enhances ecological breadth by comparing two weedy, ecologically               
              broad species with two ecologically restricted species in the genus            
              Polygonum.  The comparative study will consist primarily of                    
              greenhouse experiments with field-collected material, supplemented             
              with field work to quantify the habitat differences among the                  
              species and their populations.  The major experiment will be a                 
              growth study of several populations of each species in a                       
              multifactorial set of light, moisture, and nutrient treatments,                
              designed to determine whether the four species differ in the range             
              of environments in which they can successfully survive and                     
              reproduce.  By evaluating the mechanisms of morphological and                  
              physiological response to the treatments, I can determine whether              
              differences in environmental tolerance among the species are                   
              associated with differences in the amounts or patterns of                      
              functionally adaptive phenotypic plasticity.  Finally, I will                  
              compare the environmental tolerance of populations within species              
              to determine whether the degree of plasticity influences the degree            
              to which conspecific populations in different habitats                         
              differentiate genetically.  A second, smaller greenhouse experiment            
              will examine in detail the specific aspects of root system                     
              plasticity that contribute to species tolerance or intolerance of              
              variation in soil nutrients and moisture.//
