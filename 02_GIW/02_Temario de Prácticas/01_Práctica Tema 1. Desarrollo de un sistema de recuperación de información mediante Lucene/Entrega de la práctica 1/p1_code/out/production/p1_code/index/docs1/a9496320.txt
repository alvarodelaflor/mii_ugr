Abstract    :
              Yew         Sophisticated performance measurement and simulation tools 
              developed on the Cedar multiprocessor system during the last four  years are
              being used to study  several key architectural and  compiler issues that can
              enhance the performance of scalable  shared memory multiprocessors. These
              issues include memory  latency reduction and hiding strategies,  data
              synchronization  requirements for loop-level parallelism, and hierarchical
              network  design.  The study of these issues involves the hardware-assisted 
              collection of empirical data on  Cedar and the use of simulation.  The
              information thus obtained could lead to the  design of next-  generation
              systems that, compared to present-day systems, provide  higher sustained 
              performance across a broader range of  applications.
