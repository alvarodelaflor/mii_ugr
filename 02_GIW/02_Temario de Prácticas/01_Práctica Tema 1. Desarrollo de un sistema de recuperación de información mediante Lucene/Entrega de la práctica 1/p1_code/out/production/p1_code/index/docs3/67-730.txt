The fact is, that there was considerable\r\ndifficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of\r\nrespiration,\xe2\x80\x94a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered\r\nnecessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a\r\nlittle flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and\r\nthe next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if,\r\nduring this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful\r\ngrandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of\r\nprofound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been\r\nkilled in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old\r\nwoman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;\r\nand a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and\r\nNature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a\r\nfew struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to\r\nthe inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been\r\nimposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could\r\nreasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been\r\npossessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer\r\nspace of time than three minutes and a quarter.\r\n\r\nAs Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his\r\nlungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron\r\nbedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly\r\nfrom the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see the child, and die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire:\r\ngiving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the\r\nyoung woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed\xe2\x80\x99s head, said, with\r\nmore kindness than might have been expected of him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you must not talk about dying yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor bless her dear heart, no!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the nurse, hastily\r\ndepositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which\r\nshe had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir,\r\nand had thirteen children of her own, and all on \xe2\x80\x99em dead except two,\r\nand them in the wurkus with me, she\xe2\x80\x99ll know better than to take on in\r\nthat way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a dear young lamb do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently this consolatory perspective of a mother\xe2\x80\x99s prospects failed\r\nin producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched\r\nout her hand towards the child.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips\r\npassionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed\r\nwildly round; shuddered; fell back\xe2\x80\x94and died. They chafed her breast,\r\nhands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of\r\nhope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor dear, so it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse, picking up the cork of the\r\ngreen bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to\r\ntake up the child. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nlikely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nput on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door,\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cShe was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was brought here last night,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cby the\r\noverseer\xe2\x80\x99s order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked\r\nsome distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came\r\nfrom, or where she was going to, nobody knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old\r\nstory,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shaking his head: \xe2\x80\x9cno wedding-ring, I see. Ah!\r\nGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once\r\nmore applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair\r\nbefore the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.\r\n\r\nWhat an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist\r\nwas! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only\r\ncovering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it\r\nwould have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him\r\nhis proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old\r\ncalico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged\r\nand ticketed, and fell into his place at once\xe2\x80\x94a parish child\xe2\x80\x94the orphan\r\nof a workhouse\xe2\x80\x94the humble, half-starved drudge\xe2\x80\x94to be cuffed and\r\nbuffeted through the world\xe2\x80\x94despised by all, and pitied by none.\r\n\r\nOliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan,\r\nleft to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he\r\nwould have cried the louder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.\r\nTREATS OF OLIVER TWIST\xe2\x80\x99S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic\r\ncourse of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The\r\nhungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported\r\nby the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish\r\nauthorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether\r\nthere was no female then domiciled in \xe2\x80\x9cthe house\xe2\x80\x9d who was in a\r\nsituation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of\r\nwhich he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with\r\nhumility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities\r\nmagnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be \xe2\x80\x9cfarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse\r\nsome three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders\r\nagainst the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the\r\ninconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental\r\nsuperintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and\r\nfor the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.\r\nSevenpence-halfpenny\xe2\x80\x99s worth per week is a good round diet for a child;\r\na great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to\r\noverload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was\r\na woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children;\r\nand she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.\r\nSo, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own\r\nuse, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter\r\nallowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the\r\nlowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great\r\nexperimental philosopher.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a\r\ngreat theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who\r\ndemonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw\r\na day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and\r\nrampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died,\r\nfour-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable\r\nbait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the\r\nfemale to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a\r\nsimilar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at\r\nthe very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest\r\npossible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen\r\nin eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want\r\nand cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by\r\naccident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was\r\nusually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers\r\nit had never known in this.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest\r\nupon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,\r\nor inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a\r\nwashing\xe2\x80\x94though the latter accident was very scarce, anything\r\napproaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm\xe2\x80\x94the jury\r\nwould take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the\r\nparishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a\r\nremonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by the\r\nevidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of\r\nwhom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was\r\nvery probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever\r\nthe parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board\r\nmade periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the\r\nday before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to\r\nbehold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!\r\n\r\nIt cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any\r\nvery extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist\xe2\x80\x99s ninth birthday\r\nfound him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and\r\ndecidedly small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had\r\nimplanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s breast. It had had plenty of\r\nroom to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and\r\nperhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth\r\nbirth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth\r\nbirthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party\r\nof two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a\r\nsound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be\r\nhungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly\r\nstartled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo\r\nthe wicket of the garden-gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann,\r\nthrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ndirectly.)\xe2\x80\x94My heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you,\r\nsure-ly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of\r\nresponding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave\r\nthe little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick\r\nwhich could have emanated from no leg but a beadle\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, only think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann, running out,\xe2\x80\x94for the three boys had\r\nbeen removed by this time,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly think of that! That I should have\r\nforgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them\r\ndear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have\r\nsoftened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the\r\nbeadle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nMr. Bumble, grasping his cane, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep the parish officers a waiting\r\nat your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with\r\nthe porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may\r\nsay, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear\r\nchildren as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs.\r\nMann with great humility.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his\r\nimportance. He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He\r\nrelaxed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, Mrs. Mann,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in a calmer tone; \xe2\x80\x9cit may be as you\r\nsay; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and\r\nhave something to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor;\r\nplaced a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and\r\ncane on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the\r\nperspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the\r\ncocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr.\r\nBumble smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t you be offended at what I\xe2\x80\x99m a going to say,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs.\r\nMann, with captivating sweetness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had a long walk, you know, or\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of somethink,\r\nMr. Bumble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a drop. Nor a drop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a\r\ndignified, but placid manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the\r\nrefusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. \xe2\x80\x9cJust a leetle drop,\r\nwith a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble coughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, just a leetle drop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann persuasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the beadle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put\r\ninto the blessed infants\xe2\x80\x99 Daffy, when they ain\xe2\x80\x99t well, Mr. Bumble,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a\r\nbottle and glass. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gin. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not deceive you, Mr. B. It\xe2\x80\x99s gin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Bumble, following\r\nwith his eyes the interesting process of mixing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, bless \xe2\x80\x99em, that I do, dear as it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see \xe2\x80\x99em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; \xe2\x80\x9cno, you could not. You are a humane\r\nwoman, Mrs. Mann.\xe2\x80\x9d (Here she set down the glass.) \xe2\x80\x9cI shall take a early\r\nopportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.\xe2\x80\x9d (He drew it\r\ntowards him.) \xe2\x80\x9cYou feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.\xe2\x80\x9d (He stirred the\r\ngin-and-water.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand he swallowed half of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now about business,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, taking out a leathern\r\npocket-book. \xe2\x80\x9cThe child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine\r\nyear old to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless him!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the\r\ncorner of her apron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was\r\nafterwards increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most\r\nsuperlative, and, I may say, supernat\xe2\x80\x99ral exertions on the part of this\r\nparish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bumble, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have never been able to discover who is his\r\nfather, or what was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s settlement, name, or condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreflection, \xe2\x80\x9cHow comes he to have any name at all, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI inwented it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Mr. Bumble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last\r\nwas a S,\xe2\x80\x94Swubble, I named him. This was a T,\xe2\x80\x94Twist, I named _him_. The\r\nnext one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names\r\nready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it\r\nagain, when we come to Z.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re quite a literary character, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.\xe2\x80\x9d He finished the\r\ngin-and-water, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cOliver being now too old to remain here, the\r\nboard have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out\r\nmyself to take him there. So let me see him at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch him directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that\r\npurpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of\r\ndirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed\r\noff in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent\r\nprotectress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\nOliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,\r\nand the cocked hat on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go along with me, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nOliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great\r\nreadiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had\r\ngot behind the beadle\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a\r\nfurious countenance. He took the hint at once, for the fist had been\r\ntoo often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill she go with me?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired poor Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99ll come and see you\r\nsometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was,\r\nhowever, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at\r\ngoing away. It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears\r\ninto his eyes. Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you\r\nwant to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him\r\na thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece\r\nof bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the\r\nworkhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little\r\nbrown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.\r\nBumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never\r\nlighted the gloom of his infant years. And yet he burst into an agony\r\nof childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him. Wretched as\r\nwere the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were\r\nthe only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in\r\nthe great wide world, sank into the child\xe2\x80\x99s heart for the first time.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping\r\nhis gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every\r\nquarter of a mile whether they were \xe2\x80\x9cnearly there.\xe2\x80\x9d To these\r\ninterrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for\r\nthe temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had\r\nby this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.\r\n\r\nOliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an\r\nhour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of\r\nbread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old\r\nwoman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him\r\nthat the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.\r\n\r\nNot having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,\r\nOliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite\r\ncertain whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about\r\nthe matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with\r\nhis cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively:\r\nand bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed\r\nroom, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. At\r\nthe top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the\r\nrest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBow to the board,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears\r\nthat were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table,\r\nfortunately bowed to that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the high chair.\r\n\r\nOliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him\r\ntremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him\r\ncry. These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating\r\nvoice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.\r\nWhich was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite\r\nat his ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the high chair, \xe2\x80\x9clisten to me. You know\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re an orphan, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired poor Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy _is_ a fool\xe2\x80\x94I thought he was,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the white\r\nwaistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman who had spoken first. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nno father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you crying for?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the gentleman in the white\r\nwaistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What _could_ the\r\nboy be crying for?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you say your prayers every night,\xe2\x80\x9d said another gentleman in a\r\ngruff voice; \xe2\x80\x9cand pray for the people who feed you, and take care of\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94like a Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was\r\nunconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a\r\nmarvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people\r\nwho fed and took care of _him_. But he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, because nobody had\r\ntaught him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nthe surly one in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\nFor the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process\r\nof picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and\r\nwas then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he\r\nsobbed himself to sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws\r\nof England! They let the paupers go to sleep!\r\n\r\nPoor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy\r\nunconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day\r\narrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence\r\nover all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it:\r\n\r\nThe members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and\r\nwhen they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out\r\nat once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered\xe2\x80\x94the poor\r\npeople liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the\r\npoorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public\r\nbreakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and\r\nmortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. \xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nboard, looking very knowing; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are the fellows to set this to rights;\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll stop it all, in no time.\xe2\x80\x9d So, they established the rule, that all\r\npoor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody,\r\nnot they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a\r\nquick one out of it. With this view, they contracted with the\r\nwater-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a\r\ncorn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and\r\nissued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and\r\nhalf a roll of Sundays. They made a great many other wise and humane\r\nregulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary\r\nto repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in\r\nconsequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons; and,\r\ninstead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had\r\ntheretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a\r\nbachelor! There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under\r\nthese last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society,\r\nif it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were\r\nlong-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty. The relief was\r\ninseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFor the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was\r\nin full operation. It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of\r\nthe increase in the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s bill, and the necessity of taking in\r\nthe clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their\r\nwasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two\xe2\x80\x99s gruel. But the number of\r\nworkhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were\r\nin ecstasies.\r\n\r\nThe room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a\r\ncopper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the\r\npurpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at\r\nmealtimes. Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and\r\nno more\xe2\x80\x94except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two\r\nounces and a quarter of bread besides.\r\n\r\nThe bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their\r\nspoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this\r\noperation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large\r\nas the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager\r\neyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was\r\ncomposed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers\r\nmost assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of\r\ngruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally excellent\r\nappetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of\r\nslow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and\r\nwild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small\r\ncook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another\r\nbasin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to\r\neat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of\r\ntender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed\r\nhim. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the\r\nmaster after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to\r\nOliver Twist.\r\n\r\nThe evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master, in his\r\ncook\xe2\x80\x99s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants\r\nranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long\r\ngrace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared; the boys\r\nwhispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors\r\nnudged him. Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless\r\nwith misery. He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin\r\nand spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, I want some more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in\r\nstupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then\r\nclung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with\r\nwonder; the boys with fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the master at length, in a faint voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, \xe2\x80\x9cI want some more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe master aimed a blow at Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s head with the ladle; pinioned him\r\nin his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.\r\n\r\nThe board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into\r\nthe room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high\r\nchair, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for\r\nmore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor _more_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Limbkins. \xe2\x80\x9cCompose yourself, Bumble, and answer\r\nme distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had\r\neaten the supper allotted by the dietary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat boy will be hung,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow that boy will be hung.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody controverted the prophetic gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. An animated\r\ndiscussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and\r\na bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a\r\nreward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the\r\nhands of the parish. In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were\r\noffered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade,\r\nbusiness, or calling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was more convinced of anything in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman\r\nin the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill\r\nnext morning: \xe2\x80\x9cI never was more convinced of anything in my life, than\r\nI am that that boy will come to be hung.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated\r\ngentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this\r\nnarrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint\r\njust yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination\r\nor no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.\r\nRELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT\r\nHAVE BEEN A SINECURE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of\r\nasking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and\r\nsolitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of\r\nthe board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose,\r\nthat, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the\r\nprediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have\r\nestablished that sage individual\xe2\x80\x99s prophetic character, once and for\r\never, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the\r\nwall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of this\r\nfeat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that\r\npocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for\r\nall future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the\r\nexpress order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and\r\npronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater\r\nobstacle in Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all\r\nday; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands\r\nbefore his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner,\r\ntried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and\r\ndrawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its\r\ncold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which\r\nsurrounded him.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed by the enemies of \xe2\x80\x9cthe system,\xe2\x80\x9d that, during the\r\nperiod of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of\r\nexercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious\r\nconsolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was\r\nallowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a\r\nstone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching\r\ncold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated\r\napplications of the cane. As for society, he was carried every other\r\nday into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a\r\npublic warning and example. And so far from being denied the advantages\r\nof religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every\r\nevening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console\r\nhis mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special\r\nclause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they\r\nentreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be\r\nguarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication\r\ndistinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection\r\nof the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory\r\nof the very Devil himself.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one morning, while Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s affairs were in this auspicious\r\nand comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way\r\ndown the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means\r\nof paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become\r\nrather pressing. Mr. Gamfield\xe2\x80\x99s most sanguine estimate of his finances\r\ncould not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;\r\nand, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately\r\ncudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his\r\neyes encountered the bill on the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWo\xe2\x80\x94o!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.\r\n\r\nThe donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,\r\nwhether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when\r\nhe had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was\r\nladen; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but\r\nmore particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow\r\non his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a\r\ndonkey\xe2\x80\x99s. Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp\r\nwrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and\r\nby these means turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the\r\nhead, just to stun him till he came back again. Having completed these\r\narrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with\r\nhis hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound\r\nsentiments in the board-room. Having witnessed the little dispute\r\nbetween Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that\r\nperson came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield\r\nwas exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield\r\nsmiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the\r\nsum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was\r\nencumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse\r\nwas, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing\r\nfor register stoves. So, he spelt the bill through again, from\r\nbeginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility,\r\naccosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to \xe2\x80\x99prentis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nGamfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, my man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a\r\ncondescending smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a\r\ngood \xe2\x80\x99spectable chimbley-sweepin\xe2\x80\x99 bisness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Gamfield, \xe2\x80\x9cI wants\r\na \xe2\x80\x99prentis, and I am ready to take him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield\r\nhaving lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,\r\nand another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his\r\nabsence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room\r\nwhere Oliver had first seen him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nasty trade,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated\r\nhis wish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,\xe2\x80\x9d said another\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley\r\nto make \xe2\x80\x99em come down again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gamfield; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all smoke, and no\r\nblaze; vereas smoke ain\xe2\x80\x99t o\xe2\x80\x99 no use at all in making a boy come down,\r\nfor it only sinds him to sleep, and that\xe2\x80\x99s wot he likes. Boys is wery\r\nobstinit, and wery lazy, Gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothink like a good hot\r\nblaze to make \xe2\x80\x99em come down vith a run. It\xe2\x80\x99s humane too, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men,\r\nacause, even if they\xe2\x80\x99ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet\r\nmakes \xe2\x80\x99em struggle to hextricate theirselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this\r\nexplanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.\r\nLimbkins. The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a\r\nfew minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words \xe2\x80\x9csaving of\r\nexpenditure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clooked well in the accounts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chave a printed report\r\npublished,\xe2\x80\x9d were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed,\r\nor account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.\r\n\r\nAt length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having\r\nresumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have considered your proposition, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly not,\xe2\x80\x9d added the other members.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of\r\nhaving bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him\r\nthat the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into\r\ntheir heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their\r\nproceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business,\r\nif they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the\r\nrumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you won\xe2\x80\x99t let me have him, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Gamfield, pausing\r\nnear the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Limbkins; \xe2\x80\x9cat least, as it\xe2\x80\x99s a nasty business, we\r\nthink you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield\xe2\x80\x99s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he\r\nreturned to the table, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you give, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men? Come! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard on a poor man.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you give?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say, three pound ten was plenty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Limbkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen shillings too much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gamfield; \xe2\x80\x9csay four pound, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men. Say four pound, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got rid of him for good and all. There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree pound ten,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! I\xe2\x80\x99ll split the diff\xe2\x80\x99erence, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Gamfield. \xe2\x80\x9cThree\r\npound fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a farthing more,\xe2\x80\x9d was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re desperate hard upon me, gen\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gamfield, wavering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh! nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly\r\nfellow! He\xe2\x80\x99s just the boy for you. He wants the stick, now and then:\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll do him good; and his board needn\xe2\x80\x99t come very expensive, for he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t been overfed since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,\r\nobserving a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.\r\nThe bargain was made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver\r\nTwist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for\r\nsignature and approval, that very afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive\r\nastonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself\r\ninto a clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic\r\nperformance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin\r\nof gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of\r\nbread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:\r\nthinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill\r\nhim for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten\r\nhim up in that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a going to\r\nbe made a \xe2\x80\x99prentice of, Oliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA prentice, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Oliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kind and blessed gentleman which\r\nis so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are\r\na going to \xe2\x80\x9cprentice\xe2\x80\x9d you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of\r\nyou: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!\xe2\x80\x94three pound\r\nten, Oliver!\xe2\x80\x94seventy shillins\xe2\x80\x94one hundred and forty sixpences!\xe2\x80\x94and all\r\nfor a naughty orphan which nobody can\xe2\x80\x99t love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in\r\nan awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s face, and he\r\nsobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying\r\nto his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncry into your gruel; that\xe2\x80\x99s a very foolish action, Oliver.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\ncertainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.\r\n\r\nOn their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all\r\nhe would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the\r\ngentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like\r\nit very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey:\r\nthe rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in\r\neither particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When\r\nthey arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself,\r\nand admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. At\r\nthe expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned\r\nwith the cocked hat, and said aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d As Mr. Bumble said this,\r\nhe put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMind\r\nwhat I told you, you young rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s face at this somewhat\r\ncontradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his\r\noffering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining\r\nroom: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great\r\nwindow. Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one\r\nof whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with\r\nthe aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of\r\nparchment which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of\r\nthe desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face,\r\non the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were\r\nlounging about.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the\r\nlittle bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had\r\nbeen stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the boy, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a\r\nmoment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon,\r\nthe last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is this the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cBow to the magistrate, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been\r\nwondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates\xe2\x80\x99 powder, whether all\r\nboards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards\r\nfrom thenceforth on that account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s fond of\r\nchimney-sweeping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doats on it, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly\r\npinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he _will_ be a sweep, will he?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he\xe2\x80\x99d run away\r\nsimultaneous, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this man that\xe2\x80\x99s to be his master\xe2\x80\x94you, sir\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll treat him well,\r\nand feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I says I will, I means I will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,\r\nopen-hearted man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in\r\nthe direction of the candidate for Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s premium, whose villainous\r\ncountenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the\r\nmagistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reasonably\r\nbe expected to discern what other people did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I am, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you are, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old gentleman: fixing\r\nhis spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the\r\ninkstand.\r\n\r\nIt was the critical moment of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s fate. If the inkstand had been\r\nwhere the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen\r\ninto it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been\r\nstraightway hurried off. But, as it chanced to be immediately under his\r\nnose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his\r\ndesk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his\r\nsearch to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and\r\nterrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks\r\nand pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his\r\nfuture master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too\r\npalpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to\r\nMr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and\r\nunconcerned aspect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look pale and alarmed. What is\r\nthe matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand a little away from him, Beadle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other magistrate:\r\nlaying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of\r\ninterest. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, boy, tell us what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter: don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that\r\nthey would order him back to the dark room\xe2\x80\x94that they would starve\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94beat him\xe2\x80\x94kill him if they pleased\xe2\x80\x94rather than send him away with\r\nthat dreadful man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most\r\nimpressive solemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cWell! of all the artful and designing orphans\r\nthat ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, Beadle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the second old gentleman, when Mr.\r\nBumble had given vent to this compound adjective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your worship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having\r\nheard aright. \xe2\x80\x9cDid your worship speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Hold your tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold\r\nhis tongue! A moral revolution!\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his\r\ncompanion, he nodded significantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe refuse to sanction these indentures,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman:\r\ntossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Mr. Limbkins: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope the magistrates will not form\r\nthe opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper\r\nconduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the\r\nmatter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the second old gentleman sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cTake the boy back to\r\nthe workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively\r\nand decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he\r\nwould be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his\r\nhead with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good;\r\nwhereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him;\r\nwhich, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem\r\nto be a wish of a totally opposite description.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was\r\nagain To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would\r\ntake possession of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.\r\nOLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC\r\nLIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained,\r\neither in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the\r\nyoung man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to\r\nsea. The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took\r\ncounsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in\r\nsome small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port. This\r\nsuggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done\r\nwith him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to\r\ndeath, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his\r\nbrains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty\r\ngenerally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman\r\nof that class. The more the case presented itself to the board, in this\r\npoint of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared;\r\nso, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for\r\nOliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries,\r\nwith the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a\r\ncabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to\r\ncommunicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate,\r\nno less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit\r\nof threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour,\r\nand shoes to answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a\r\nsmiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional\r\njocosity. His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward\r\npleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.\r\nBumble,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, as he\r\nthrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the\r\nundertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsay you\xe2\x80\x99ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Bumble,\r\ntapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his\r\ncane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink so?\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half\r\ndisputed the probability of the event. \xe2\x80\x9cThe prices allowed by the board\r\nare very small, Mr. Bumble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo are the coffins,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle: with precisely as near an\r\napproach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be;\r\nand laughed a long time without cessation. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, Mr. Bumble,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid at length, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that, since the new system of\r\nfeeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more\r\nshallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble.\r\nWell-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron\r\nhandles come, by canal, from Birmingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, \xe2\x80\x9cevery trade has its drawbacks. A fair\r\nprofit is, of course, allowable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the undertaker; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get a\r\nprofit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the\r\nlong-run, you see\xe2\x80\x94he! he! he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough I must say,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the undertaker, resuming the current of\r\nobservations which the beadle had interrupted: \xe2\x80\x9cthough I must say, Mr.\r\nBumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage:\r\nwhich is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who\r\nhave been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first\r\nto sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble,\r\nthat three or four inches over one\xe2\x80\x99s calculation makes a great hole in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an\r\nill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a\r\nreflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it\r\nadvisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his\r\nmind, he made him his theme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody who wants a boy,\r\ndo you? A porochial \xe2\x80\x99prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a\r\nmillstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr.\r\nSowerberry, liberal terms?\xe2\x80\x9d As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to\r\nthe bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words \xe2\x80\x9cfive\r\npounds\xe2\x80\x9d: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGadso!\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged\r\nlappel of his official coat; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just the very thing I wanted to\r\nspeak to you about. You know\xe2\x80\x94dear me, what a very elegant button this\r\nis, Mr. Bumble! I never noticed it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think it rather pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, glancing proudly\r\ndownwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ndie is the same as the porochial seal\xe2\x80\x94the Good Samaritan healing the\r\nsick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmorning, Mr. Sowerberry. I put it on, I remember, for the first time,\r\nto attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway\r\nat midnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recollect,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker. \xe2\x80\x9cThe jury brought it in, \xe2\x80\x98Died from\r\nexposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they made it a special verdict, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker, \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nadding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush! Foolery!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the beadle. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the board attended to all\r\nthe nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they\xe2\x80\x99d have enough to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker; \xe2\x80\x9cthey would indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuries,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont\r\nwhen working into a passion: \xe2\x80\x9cjuries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling\r\nwretches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t no more philosophy nor political economy about \xe2\x80\x99em than\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more they have,\xe2\x80\x9d acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI despise \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, growing very red in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I only wish we\xe2\x80\x99d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for\r\na week or two,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle; \xe2\x80\x9cthe rules and regulations of the\r\nboard would soon bring their spirit down for \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x99em alone for that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the undertaker. So saying, he smiled,\r\napprovingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.\r\n\r\nMr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the\r\ninside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his\r\nrage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the\r\nundertaker, said in a calmer voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; what about the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the undertaker; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good\r\ndeal towards the poor\xe2\x80\x99s rates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHem!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the undertaker, \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking that if I pay so much\r\ntowards \xe2\x80\x99em, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to get as much out of \xe2\x80\x99em as I can, Mr.\r\nBumble; and so\xe2\x80\x94I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the boy myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the\r\nbuilding. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes;\r\nand it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening \xe2\x80\x9cupon\r\nliking\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that\r\nif the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out\r\nof a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for\r\na term of years, to do what he likes with.\r\n\r\nWhen little Oliver was taken before \xe2\x80\x9cthe gentlemen\xe2\x80\x9d that evening; and\r\ninformed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a\r\ncoffin-maker\xe2\x80\x99s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever\r\ncame back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be\r\ndrowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so\r\nlittle emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened\r\nyoung rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.\r\n\r\nNow, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the\r\nworld, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror\r\nat the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they\r\nwere rather out, in this particular instance. The simple fact was, that\r\nOliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too\r\nmuch; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of\r\nbrutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He\r\nheard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had\r\nhis luggage put into his hand\xe2\x80\x94which was not very difficult to carry,\r\ninasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper\r\nparcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep\xe2\x80\x94he pulled his cap\r\nover his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s coat\r\ncuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.\r\n\r\nFor some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark;\r\nfor the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should:\r\nand, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by\r\nthe skirts of Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to\r\ngreat advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. As\r\nthey drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it\r\nexpedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for\r\ninspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and\r\nbecoming air of gracious patronage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOliver!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of\r\nhis unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them\r\nwhen he looked up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon\r\nhim, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another.\r\nThe child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.\r\nWithdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s he covered his face with\r\nboth; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and\r\nbony fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little\r\ncharge a look of intense malignity. \xe2\x80\x9cWell! Of _all_ the ungratefullest,\r\nand worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the\r\nwell-known cane; \xe2\x80\x9cno, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I\r\nwill, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo what?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo lonely, sir! So very lonely!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the child. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody hates me.\r\nOh! sir, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t pray be cross to me!\xe2\x80\x9d The child beat his hand\r\nupon his heart; and looked in his companion\xe2\x80\x99s face, with tears of real\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble regarded Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s piteous and helpless look, with some\r\nastonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky\r\nmanner; and after muttering something about \xe2\x80\x9cthat troublesome cough,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his\r\nhand, he walked on with him in silence.\r\n\r\nThe undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was\r\nmaking some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate\r\ndismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in\r\nthe middle of a word; \xe2\x80\x9cis that you, Bumble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one else, Mr. Sowerberry,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle. \xe2\x80\x9cHere! I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought\r\nthe boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver made a bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that\xe2\x80\x99s the boy, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker: raising the candle\r\nabove his head, to get a better view of Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Sowerberry, will\r\nyou have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and\r\npresented the form of a short, thin, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the boy from\r\nthe workhouse that I told you of.\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver bowed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s wife, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s very small.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he _is_ rather small,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as\r\nif it were his fault that he was no bigger; \xe2\x80\x9che is small. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndenying it. But he\xe2\x80\x99ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll grow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I dare say he will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady pettishly, \xe2\x80\x9con our victuals\r\nand our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they\r\nalways cost more to keep, than they\xe2\x80\x99re worth. However, men always think\r\nthey know best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o\xe2\x80\x99 bones.\xe2\x80\x9d With this,\r\nthe undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a\r\nsteep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the\r\nante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated \xe2\x80\x9ckitchen\xe2\x80\x9d; wherein sat a\r\nslatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very\r\nmuch out of repair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgive this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t come home since the morning, so he may go without \xe2\x80\x99em. I dare\r\nsay the boy isn\xe2\x80\x99t too dainty to eat \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94are you, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was\r\ntrembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a\r\nplateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.\r\n\r\nI wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall\r\nwithin him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen\r\nOliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.\r\nI wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver\r\ntore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only\r\none thing I should like better; and that would be to see the\r\nPhilosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s wife, when Oliver had finished his\r\nsupper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful\r\nauguries of his future appetite: \xe2\x80\x9chave you done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen come with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty\r\nlamp, and leading the way upstairs; \xe2\x80\x9cyour bed\xe2\x80\x99s under the counter. You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nmatter whether you do or don\xe2\x80\x99t, for you can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep anywhere else.\r\nCome; don\xe2\x80\x99t keep me here all night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V.\r\nOLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST\r\nTIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER\xe2\x80\x99S BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver, being left to himself in the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s shop, set the lamp\r\ndown on a workman\xe2\x80\x99s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling\r\nof awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be\r\nat no loss to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which\r\nstood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a\r\ncold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the\r\ndirection of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see\r\nsome frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror.\r\nAgainst the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm\r\nboards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like\r\nhigh-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.\r\nCoffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black\r\ncloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was\r\nornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff\r\nneckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by\r\nfour black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and\r\nhot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The\r\nrecess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust,\r\nlooked like a grave.\r\n\r\nNor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was\r\nalone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the\r\nbest of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no\r\nfriends to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no recent\r\nseparation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and\r\nwell-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.\r\n\r\nBut his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept\r\ninto his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be\r\nlain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the\r\ntall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep\r\nbell to soothe him in his sleep.\r\n\r\nOliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of\r\nthe shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was\r\nrepeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.\r\nWhen he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door, will yer?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the voice which belonged to the legs\r\nwhich had kicked at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, directly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning\r\nthe key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose yer the new boy, ain\xe2\x80\x99t yer?\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice through the\r\nkey-hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are yer?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll whop yer when I get in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice; \xe2\x80\x9cyou just see if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, my work\xe2\x80\x99us brat!\xe2\x80\x9d and having made this obliging\r\npromise, the voice began to whistle.\r\n\r\nOliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very\r\nexpressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the\r\nsmallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would\r\nredeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a\r\ntrembling hand, and opened the door.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street,\r\nand over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had\r\naddressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm\r\nhimself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post\r\nin front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut\r\ninto wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then\r\nconsumed with great dexterity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver at length: seeing that no other\r\nvisitor made his appearance; \xe2\x80\x9cdid you knock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kicked,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the charity-boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you want a coffin, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver, innocently.\r\n\r\nAt this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver\r\nwould want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer don\xe2\x80\x99t know who I am, I suppose, Work\xe2\x80\x99us?\xe2\x80\x9d said the charity-boy, in\r\ncontinuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with\r\nedifying gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Mister Noah Claypole,\xe2\x80\x9d said the charity-boy, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99re under me.\r\nTake down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!\xe2\x80\x9d With this, Mr.\r\nClaypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a\r\ndignified air, which did him great credit. It is difficult for a\r\nlarge-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy\r\ncountenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more\r\nespecially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red\r\nnose and yellow smalls.\r\n\r\nOliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in\r\nhis effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a\r\nsmall court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the\r\nday, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the\r\nassurance that \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d catch it,\xe2\x80\x9d condescended to help him. Mr.\r\nSowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry\r\nappeared. Oliver having \xe2\x80\x9ccaught it,\xe2\x80\x9d in fulfilment of Noah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome near the fire, Noah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x9cI saved a nice little bit\r\nof bacon for you from master\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast. Oliver, shut that door at\r\nMister Noah\xe2\x80\x99s back, and take them bits that I\xe2\x80\x99ve put out on the cover\r\nof the bread-pan. There\xe2\x80\x99s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink\r\nit there, and make haste, for they\xe2\x80\x99ll want you to mind the shop. D\xe2\x80\x99ye\r\nhear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye hear, Work\xe2\x80\x99us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah Claypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, Noah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a rum creature you are! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou let the boy alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him alone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy everybody lets him alone enough, for\r\nthe matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever\r\ninterfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty\r\nwell. Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you queer soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in\r\nwhich she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully\r\nat poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest\r\ncorner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially\r\nreserved for him.\r\n\r\nNoah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance-child was\r\nhe, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents,\r\nwho lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a\r\ndrunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of\r\ntwopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the\r\nneighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public\r\nstreets, with the ignominious epithets of \xe2\x80\x9cleathers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccharity,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune\r\nhad cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could\r\npoint the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This\r\naffords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful\r\nthing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same\r\namiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest\r\ncharity-boy.\r\n\r\nOliver had been sojourning at the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s some three weeks or a\r\nmonth. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry\xe2\x80\x94the shop being shut up\xe2\x80\x94were taking their\r\nsupper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several\r\ndeferential glances at his wife, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up,\r\nwith a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, my dear, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh, you brute!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what you were going to say,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs.\r\nSowerberry. \xe2\x80\x9cI am nobody; don\xe2\x80\x99t consult me, pray. _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nintrude upon your secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an\r\nhysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sowerberry, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask mine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting\r\nmanner: \xe2\x80\x9cask somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d Here, there was another hysterical\r\nlaugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common\r\nand much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very\r\neffective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special\r\nfavour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to\r\nhear. After a short duration, the permission was most graciously\r\nconceded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only about young Twist, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sowerberry. \xe2\x80\x9cA very\r\ngood-looking boy, that, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe need be, for he eats enough,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr.\r\nSowerberry, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is very interesting. He would make a delightful\r\nmute, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable\r\nwonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for\r\nany observation on the good lady\xe2\x80\x99s part, proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but\r\nonly for children\xe2\x80\x99s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in\r\nproportion, my dear. You may depend upon it, it would have a superb\r\neffect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way,\r\nwas much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been\r\ncompromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances,\r\nshe merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious\r\nsuggestion had not presented itself to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mind before? Mr.\r\nSowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his\r\nproposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should\r\nbe at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this\r\nview, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of\r\nhis services being required.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next\r\nmorning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against\r\nthe counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he\r\nselected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can order for a coffin, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr.\r\nBumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like\r\nhimself, was very corpulent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBayton,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.\r\nBumble. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard the name before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBumble shook his head, as he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cObstinate people, Mr.\r\nSowerberry; very obstinate. Proud, too, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, that\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s sickening,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle. \xe2\x80\x9cAntimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe only heard of the family the night before last,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known anything about them, then, only a woman\r\nwho lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial\r\ncommittee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was\r\nvery bad. He had gone out to dinner; but his \xe2\x80\x99prentice (which is a very\r\nclever lad) sent \xe2\x80\x99em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s promptness,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromptness, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the consequence;\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband\r\nsends back word that the medicine won\xe2\x80\x99t suit his wife\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, and\r\nso she shan\xe2\x80\x99t take it\xe2\x80\x94says she shan\xe2\x80\x99t take it, sir! Good, strong,\r\nwholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish\r\nlabourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before\xe2\x80\x94sent \xe2\x80\x99em for nothing,\r\nwith a blackin\xe2\x80\x99-bottle in,\xe2\x80\x94and he sends back word that she shan\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nit, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s mind in full force, he\r\nstruck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker, \xe2\x80\x9cI ne\xe2\x80\x94ver\xe2\x80\x94did\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever did, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated the beadle. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, nor nobody never did; but\r\nnow she\xe2\x80\x99s dead, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to bury her; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the direction; and\r\nthe sooner it\xe2\x80\x99s done, the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a\r\nfever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of\r\nsight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at\r\nthe mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\nHe needn\xe2\x80\x99t haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s glance,\r\nhowever; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman\r\nin the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that\r\nnow the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better\r\navoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years,\r\nand all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish\r\nshould be thus effectually and legally overcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sooner this job is\r\ndone, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap,\r\nand come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his\r\nprofessional mission.\r\n\r\nThey walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely\r\ninhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street\r\nmore dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused\r\nto look for the house which was the object of their search. The houses\r\non either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by\r\npeople of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have\r\nsufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the\r\nsqualid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies\r\nhalf doubled, occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements\r\nhad shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only\r\nthe upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure\r\nfrom age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by\r\nhuge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the\r\nroad; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the\r\nnightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards\r\nwhich supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their\r\npositions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human\r\nbody. The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The very rats, which here and\r\nthere lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine.\r\n\r\nThere was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver\r\nand his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark\r\npassage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the\r\nundertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling\r\nagainst a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.\r\n\r\nIt was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker\r\nat once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the\r\napartment to which he had been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically,\r\nover the empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the\r\ncold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged\r\nchildren in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door,\r\nthere lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.\r\nOliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept\r\ninvoluntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the\r\nboy felt that it was a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly;\r\nhis eyes were bloodshot. The old woman\xe2\x80\x99s face was wrinkled; her two\r\nremaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright\r\nand piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They\r\nseemed so like the rats he had seen outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody shall go near her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, starting fiercely up, as the\r\nundertaker approached the recess. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep back! Damn you, keep back, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve a life to lose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, my good man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker, who was pretty well used\r\nto misery in all its shapes. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously\r\non the floor,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I won\xe2\x80\x99t have her put into the ground. She\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest there. The worms would worry her\xe2\x80\x94not eat her\xe2\x80\x94she is so\r\nworn away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape\r\nfrom his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at\r\nthe feet of the dead woman; \xe2\x80\x9ckneel down, kneel down\xe2\x80\x94kneel round her,\r\nevery one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death. I\r\nnever knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her\r\nbones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor\r\ncandle; she died in the dark\xe2\x80\x94in the dark! She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even see her\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged\r\nfor her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back,\r\nshe was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they\r\nstarved her to death. I swear it before the God that saw it! They\r\nstarved her!\xe2\x80\x9d He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream,\r\nrolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\nThe terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had\r\nhitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that\r\npassed, menaced them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the\r\nman who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the\r\nundertaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, nodding her head in the\r\ndirection of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more\r\nghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. \xe2\x80\x9cLord, Lord!\r\nWell, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman\r\nthen, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and\r\nstiff! Lord, Lord!\xe2\x80\x94to think of it; it\xe2\x80\x99s as good as a play\xe2\x80\x94as good as a\r\nplay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment,\r\nthe undertaker turned to go away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman in a loud whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cWill she be buried\r\nto-morrow, or next day, or to-night? I laid her out; and I must walk,\r\nyou know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter\r\ncold. We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send\r\nsome bread\xe2\x80\x94only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some\r\nbread, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s coat, as\r\nhe once more moved towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undertaker,\xe2\x80\x9dof course. Anything you like!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndisengaged himself from the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s grasp; and, drawing Oliver\r\nafter him, hurried away.\r\n\r\nThe next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a\r\nhalf-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble\r\nhimself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where\r\nMr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the\r\nworkhouse, who were to act as bearers. An old black cloak had been\r\nthrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin\r\nhaving been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers,\r\nand carried into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\r\nSowerberry in the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s ear; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are rather late; and it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo, to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,\xe2\x80\x94as quick as you\r\nlike!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the\r\ntwo mourners kept as near them, as they could. Mr. Bumble and\r\nSowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs\r\nwere not so long as his master\xe2\x80\x99s, ran by the side.\r\n\r\nThere was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had\r\nanticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the\r\nchurchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were\r\nmade, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by\r\nthe vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it\r\nmight be an hour or so, before he came. So, they put the bier on the\r\nbrink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp\r\nclay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the\r\nspectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at\r\nhide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by\r\njumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and\r\nBumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him,\r\nand read the paper.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,\r\nand Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.\r\nImmediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice\r\nas he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up\r\nappearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the\r\nburial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his\r\nsurplice to the clerk, and walked away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. \xe2\x80\x9cFill up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the\r\nuppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The grave-digger\r\nshovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet:\r\nshouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who\r\nmurmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my good fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nwant to shut up the yard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the\r\ngrave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had\r\naddressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a\r\nswoon. The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss\r\nof her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any\r\nattention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came\r\nto, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed\r\non their different ways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Oliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sowerberry, as they walked home, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you like\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, thank you, sir\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, with considerable\r\nhesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cNot very much, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to it in time, Oliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sowerberry. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\r\nwhen you _are_ used to it, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time\r\nto get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask\r\nthe question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had\r\nseen and heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI.\r\nOLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND\r\nRATHER ASTONISHES HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month\xe2\x80\x99s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice\r\nsickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were\r\nlooking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great\r\ndeal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberry\xe2\x80\x99s ingenious\r\nspeculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest\r\ninhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so\r\nprevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful\r\nprocessions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to\r\nhis knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the\r\nmothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his\r\nadult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity\r\nof demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a\r\nfinished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the\r\nbeautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded\r\npeople bear their trials and losses.\r\n\r\nFor instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich\r\nold lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews\r\nand nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous\r\nillness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most\r\npublic occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94quite cheerful and contented\xe2\x80\x94conversing together with as much\r\nfreedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb\r\nthem. Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic\r\ncalmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far\r\nfrom grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to\r\nrender it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable,\r\ntoo, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during\r\nthe ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached\r\nhome, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. All\r\nthis was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with\r\ngreat admiration.\r\n\r\nThat Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good\r\npeople, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm\r\nwith any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for\r\nmany months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and\r\nill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now\r\nthat his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the\r\nblack stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in\r\nthe muffin-cap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah\r\ndid; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry\r\nwas disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and\r\na glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as\r\ncomfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in\r\nthe grain department of a brewery.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s history; for I\r\nhave to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,\r\nbut which indirectly produced a material change in all his future\r\nprospects and proceedings.\r\n\r\nOne day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual\r\ndinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton\xe2\x80\x94a pound and a half\r\nof the worst end of the neck\xe2\x80\x94when Charlotte being called out of the\r\nway, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being\r\nhungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a\r\nworthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.\r\n\r\nIntent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the\r\ntable-cloth; and pulled Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s hair; and twitched his ears; and\r\nexpressed his opinion that he was a \xe2\x80\x9csneak\xe2\x80\x9d; and furthermore announced\r\nhis intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable\r\nevent should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty\r\nannoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.\r\nBut, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and\r\nin his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want\r\nto be funny. He got rather personal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork\xe2\x80\x99us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x99s your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s dead,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything about her to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there\r\nwas a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole\r\nthought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.\r\nUnder this impression he returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she die of, Work\xe2\x80\x99us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver:\r\nmore as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\r\nknow what it must be to die of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work\xe2\x80\x99us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, as a tear\r\nrolled down Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s set you a snivelling now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cThere; that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanything more to me about her; you\xe2\x80\x99d better not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter not!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cWell! Better not! Work\xe2\x80\x99us, don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nimpudent. _Your_ mother, too! She was a nice \xe2\x80\x99un she was. Oh, Lor!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhere, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his\r\nsmall red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer know, Work\xe2\x80\x99us,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s silence,\r\nand speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most\r\nannoying: \xe2\x80\x9cYer know, Work\xe2\x80\x99us, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped now; and of course yer\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we all\r\nare, and pity yer very much. But yer must know, Work\xe2\x80\x99us, yer mother was\r\na regular right-down bad \xe2\x80\x99un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA regular right-down bad \xe2\x80\x99un, Work\xe2\x80\x99us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah, coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal better, Work\xe2\x80\x99us, that she died when she did, or else\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung;\r\nwhich is more likely than either, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table;\r\nseized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till\r\nhis teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into\r\none heavy blow, felled him to the ground.\r\n\r\nA minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected\r\ncreature that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused\r\nat last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.\r\nHis breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid;\r\nhis whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly\r\ntormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an\r\nenergy he had never known before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll murder me!\xe2\x80\x9d blubbered Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cCharlotte! missis! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the new\r\nboy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s gone mad! Char\xe2\x80\x94lotte!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoah\xe2\x80\x99s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a\r\nlouder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen\r\nby a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was\r\nquite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human\r\nlife, to come further down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you little wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her\r\nutmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man\r\nin particularly good training. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you little un-grate-ful,\r\nmur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!\xe2\x80\x9d And between every syllable, Charlotte\r\ngave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream,\r\nfor the benefit of society.\r\n\r\nCharlotte\xe2\x80\x99s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not\r\nbe effectual in calming Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into\r\nthe kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she\r\nscratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of\r\naffairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.\r\n\r\nThis was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all\r\nwearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,\r\nstruggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and\r\nthere locked him up. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a\r\nchair, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless her, she\xe2\x80\x99s going off!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x9cA glass of water, Noah,\r\ndear. Make haste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she could,\r\nthrough a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which\r\nNoah had poured over her head and shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlotte, what a\r\nmercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! mercy indeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. I only hope this\xe2\x80\x99ll teach\r\nmaster not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born\r\nto be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He was\r\nall but killed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, when I come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the\r\ncharity-boy.\r\n\r\nNoah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level\r\nwith the crown of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his\r\nwrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed\r\nsome affecting tears and sniffs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. \xe2\x80\x9cYour master\xe2\x80\x99s not at\r\nhome; there\xe2\x80\x99s not a man in the house, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll kick that door down in\r\nten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in\r\nquestion, rendered this occurance highly probable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x9cunless we send for\r\nthe police-officers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the millingtary,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cRun to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,\r\nand not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold\r\na knife to that black eye, as you run along. It\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the swelling\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed;\r\nand very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a\r\ncharity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his\r\nhead, and a clasp-knife at his eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII.\r\nOLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused\r\nnot once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested\r\nhere, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an\r\nimposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and\r\npresented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that\r\neven he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of\r\ntimes, started back in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old pauper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in\r\ntones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.\r\nBumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much\r\nthat he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,\xe2\x80\x94which is a very\r\ncurious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle,\r\nacted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a\r\nmomentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of\r\npersonal dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Bumble, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah: \xe2\x80\x9cOliver, sir,\xe2\x80\x94Oliver has\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his\r\nmetallic eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cNot run away; he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t run away, has he, Noah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he\xe2\x80\x99s turned wicious,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nNoah. \xe2\x80\x9cHe tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder\r\nCharlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony,\r\nplease, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an\r\nextensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to\r\nunderstand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist,\r\nhe had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was\r\nat that moment suffering the acutest torture.\r\n\r\nWhen Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed\r\nMr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his\r\ndreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a\r\ngentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in\r\nhis lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to\r\nattract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked\r\nthree paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young\r\ncur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with\r\nsomething which would render the series of vocular exclamations so\r\ndesignated, an involuntary process?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\r\nhas been nearly murdered\xe2\x80\x94all but murdered, sir,\xe2\x80\x94by young Twist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping\r\nshort. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,\r\nthat that audacious young savage would come to be hung!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his missis,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his master, too, I think you said, Noah?\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! he\xe2\x80\x99s out, or he would have murdered him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said\r\nhe wanted to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the gentleman in the\r\nwhite waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd please, sir, missis wants to know\r\nwhether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99cause master\xe2\x80\x99s out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my boy; certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in the white\r\nwaistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah\xe2\x80\x99s head, which was about\r\nthree inches higher than his own. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good boy\xe2\x80\x94a very good boy.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry\xe2\x80\x99s with your\r\ncane, and see what\xe2\x80\x99s best to be done. Don\xe2\x80\x99t spare him, Bumble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane\r\nhaving been, by this time, adjusted to their owner\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction, Mr.\r\nBumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the\r\nundertaker\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\r\nHere the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had\r\nnot yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished\r\nvigour, at the cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by\r\nMrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr.\r\nBumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. With this\r\nview he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then,\r\napplying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOliver!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome; you let me out!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, from the inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know this here voice, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid of it, sir? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you a-trembling while I speak,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, boldly.\r\n\r\nAn answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was\r\nin the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He\r\nstepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and\r\nlooked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not Madness, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of\r\ndeep meditation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Meat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeat, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, meat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nover-fed him, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. You\xe2\x80\x99ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs.\r\nSowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have\r\npaupers to do with soul or spirit? It\xe2\x80\x99s quite enough that we let \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nhave live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, this would\r\nnever have happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to\r\nthe kitchen ceiling: \xe2\x80\x9cthis comes of being liberal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse\r\nbestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else\r\nwould eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in\r\nher voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s heavy accusation. Of\r\nwhich, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or\r\ndeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth\r\nagain; \xe2\x80\x9cthe only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to\r\nleave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he\xe2\x80\x99s a little starved\r\ndown; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the\r\napprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs.\r\nSowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his\r\nmade her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed\r\nany well-disposed woman, weeks before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point of Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to\r\nknow that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced\r\nkicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.\r\nSowerberry returned at this juncture. Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s offence having been\r\nexplained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best\r\ncalculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a\r\ntwinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.\r\n\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face\r\nwas bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.\r\nThe angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled\r\nout of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite\r\nundismayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you are a nice young fellow, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sowerberry; giving\r\nOliver a shake, and a box on the ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe called my mother names,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nSowerberry. \xe2\x80\x9cShe deserved what he said, and worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nThis flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had\r\nhesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be\r\nquite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been,\r\naccording to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a\r\nbrute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of\r\na man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital\r\nwithin the limits of this chapter. To do him justice, he was, as far as\r\nhis power went\xe2\x80\x94it was not very extensive\xe2\x80\x94kindly disposed towards the\r\nboy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because\r\nhis wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no\r\nresource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.\r\nSowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent application of\r\nthe parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was\r\nshut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of\r\nbread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks\r\noutside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his\r\nmother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of\r\nNoah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the\r\ngloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings\r\nwhich the day\xe2\x80\x99s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a\r\nmere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he\r\nhad borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in\r\nhis heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they\r\nhad roasted him alive. But now, when there were none to see or hear\r\nhim, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his\r\nhands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few\r\nso young may ever have cause to pour out before him!\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The\r\ncandle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having\r\ngazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the\r\nfastenings of the door, and looked abroad.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, farther\r\nfrom the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind;\r\nand the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked\r\nsepulchral and death-like, from being so still. He softly reclosed the\r\ndoor. Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie\r\nup in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat\r\nhimself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.\r\n\r\nWith the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the\r\nshutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look\r\naround\xe2\x80\x94one moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause of hesitation\xe2\x80\x94he had closed it behind him,\r\nand was in the open street.\r\n\r\nHe looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.\r\n\r\nHe remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up\r\nthe hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the\r\nfields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the\r\nroad; struck into it, and walked quickly on.\r\n\r\nAlong this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside\r\nMr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.\r\nHis way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly\r\nwhen he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back.\r\nHe had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by\r\ndoing so. Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of\r\nhis being seen; so he walked on.\r\n\r\nHe reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring\r\nat that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child\r\nwas weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale\r\nface and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver\r\nfelt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself,\r\nhe had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and\r\nstarved, and shut up together, many and many a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Dick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his\r\nthin arm between the rails to greet him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs any one up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody but me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou musn\xe2\x80\x99t say you saw me, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI am running away.\r\nThey beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some\r\nlong way off. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where. How pale you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard the doctor tell them I was dying,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the child with a\r\nfaint smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to see you, dear; but don\xe2\x80\x99t stop, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I will, to say good-b\xe2\x80\x99ye to you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nsee you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the child. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter I am dead, but not before. I\r\nknow the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of\r\nHeaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.\r\nKiss me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his\r\nlittle arms round Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s neck. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-b\xe2\x80\x99ye, dear! God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blessing was from a young child\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but it was the first that\r\nOliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles\r\nand sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never\r\nonce forgot it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VIII.\r\nOLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF\r\nYOUNG GENTLEMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more\r\ngained the high-road. It was eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock now. Though he was nearly\r\nfive miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by\r\nturns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then\r\nhe sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think,\r\nfor the first time, where he had better go and try to live.\r\n\r\nThe stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an\r\nintimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The\r\nname awakened a new train of ideas in the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nLondon!\xe2\x80\x94that great place!\xe2\x80\x94nobody\xe2\x80\x94not even Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x94could ever find\r\nhim there! He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say\r\nthat no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of\r\nliving in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country\r\nparts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who\r\nmust die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things\r\npassed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nHe had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four\r\nmiles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could\r\nhope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced\r\nitself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his\r\nmeans of getting there. He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and\r\ntwo pairs of stockings, in his bundle. He had a penny too\xe2\x80\x94a gift of\r\nSowerberry\xe2\x80\x99s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more\r\nthan ordinarily well\xe2\x80\x94in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cA clean shirt,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Oliver,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings;\r\nand so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles\xe2\x80\x99 walk\r\nin winter time.\xe2\x80\x9d But Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, like those of most other\r\npeople, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his\r\ndifficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of\r\nsurmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular\r\npurpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and\r\ntrudged on.\r\n\r\nOliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing\r\nbut the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he\r\nbegged at the cottage-doors by the road-side. When the night came, he\r\nturned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined\r\nto lie there, till morning. He felt frightened at first, for the wind\r\nmoaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and\r\nmore alone than he had ever felt before. Being very tired with his\r\nwalk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.\r\n\r\nHe felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that\r\nhe was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very\r\nfirst village through which he passed. He had walked no more than\r\ntwelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his\r\nlegs so weak that they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in\r\nthe bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey\r\nnext morning he could hardly crawl along.\r\n\r\nHe waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and\r\nthen begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took\r\nany notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the\r\ntop of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a\r\nhalfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way,\r\nbut was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When\r\nthe outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets\r\nagain, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve\r\nanything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nIn some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all\r\npersons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to\r\njail. This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of\r\nthose villages with all possible expedition. In others, he would stand\r\nabout the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a\r\nproceeding which generally terminated in the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s ordering one of\r\nthe post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of\r\nthe place, for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he\r\nbegged at a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the\r\ndog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about\r\nthe beadle\xe2\x80\x94which brought Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s heart into his mouth,\xe2\x80\x94very often the\r\nonly thing he had there, for many hours together.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a\r\nbenevolent old lady, Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s troubles would have been shortened by the\r\nvery same process which had put an end to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s; in other words,\r\nhe would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king\xe2\x80\x99s highway. But\r\nthe turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady,\r\nwho had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part\r\nof the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little\r\nshe could afford\xe2\x80\x94and more\xe2\x80\x94with such kind and gentle words, and such\r\ntears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.\r\n\r\nEarly on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver\r\nlimped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were\r\nclosed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business\r\nof the day. The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the\r\nlight only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation,\r\nas he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up;\r\nand people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver\r\nfor a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried\r\nby; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he\r\ncame there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.\r\n\r\nHe had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great\r\nnumber of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern,\r\nlarge or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed\r\nthrough, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with\r\nease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and\r\ndetermination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by\r\nobserving that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes\r\nbefore, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the\r\nopposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at first; but the\r\nboy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that\r\nOliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon this, the\r\nboy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, my covey! What\xe2\x80\x99s the row?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his\r\nown age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even\r\nseen. He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as\r\ndirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the\r\nairs and manners of a man. He was short of his age: with rather\r\nbow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of\r\nhis head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwould have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of\r\nevery now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it\r\nback to its old place again. He wore a man\xe2\x80\x99s coat, which reached nearly\r\nto his heels. He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get\r\nhis hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of\r\nthrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he\r\nkept them. He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young\r\ngentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the\r\nbluchers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, my covey! What\xe2\x80\x99s the row?\xe2\x80\x9d said this strange young gentleman to\r\nOliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very hungry and tired,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver: the tears standing in his\r\neyes as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI have walked a long way. I have been walking these\r\nseven days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalking for sivin days!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see. Beak\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norder, eh? But,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, noticing Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s look of surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird\xe2\x80\x99s mouth\r\ndescribed by the term in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes, how green!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a beak\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmadgst\xe2\x80\x99rate; and when you walk by a beak\xe2\x80\x99s order, it\xe2\x80\x99s not straight\r\nforerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. Was you\r\nnever on the mill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mill?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mill! Why, _the_ mill\xe2\x80\x94the mill as takes up so little room that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlow with people, than when it\xe2\x80\x99s high; acos then they can\xe2\x80\x99t get workmen.\r\nBut come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cyou want grub, and you shall have\r\nit. I\xe2\x80\x99m at low-water-mark myself\xe2\x80\x94only one bob and a magpie; but, as far\r\nas it goes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There!\r\nNow then! \xe2\x80\x9cMorrice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAssisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent\r\nchandler\xe2\x80\x99s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham\r\nand a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, \xe2\x80\x9ca fourpenny\r\nbran!\xe2\x80\x9d the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the\r\ningenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a\r\nportion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under\r\nhis arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led\r\nthe way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer\r\nwas brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver,\r\nfalling to, at his new friend\xe2\x80\x99s bidding, made a long and hearty meal,\r\nduring the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time\r\nwith great attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to London?\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot any lodgings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as\r\nthe big coat-sleeves would let them go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you live in London?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I do, when I\xe2\x80\x99m at home,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you want\r\nsome place to sleep in to-night, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not slept under a roof since I\r\nleft the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fret your eyelids on that score,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young gentleman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a \xe2\x80\x99spectable old\r\ngentleman as lives there, wot\xe2\x80\x99ll give you lodgings for nothink, and\r\nnever ask for the change\xe2\x80\x94that is, if any genelman he knows interduces\r\nyou. And don\xe2\x80\x99t he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means.\r\nCertainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments\r\nof discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;\r\nespecially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the\r\nold gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a\r\ncomfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly\r\nand confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and\r\nprotege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkin\xe2\x80\x99s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the\r\ncomforts which his patron\xe2\x80\x99s interest obtained for those whom he took\r\nunder his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute\r\nmode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate\r\nfriends he was better known by the sobriquet of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Artful Dodger,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the\r\nmoral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon\r\nhim. Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good\r\nopinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found\r\nthe Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to\r\ndecline the honour of his farther acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAs John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it\r\nwas nearly eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.\r\nThey crossed from the Angel into St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Road; struck down the small\r\nstreet which terminates at Sadler\xe2\x80\x99s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth\r\nStreet and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the\r\nworkhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of\r\nHockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into\r\nSaffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace,\r\ndirecting Oliver to follow close at his heels.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of\r\nhis leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either\r\nside of the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place\r\nhe had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air\r\nwas impregnated with filthy odours.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade\r\nappeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were\r\ncrawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The\r\nsole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the\r\nplace, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish\r\nwere wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here\r\nand there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of\r\nhouses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth;\r\nand from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were\r\ncautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed\r\nor harmless errands.\r\n\r\nOliver was just considering whether he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t better run away, when\r\nthey reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor, catching him by the\r\narm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him\r\ninto the passage, closed it behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the\r\nDodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlummy and slam!\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the\r\nlight of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the\r\npassage; and a man\xe2\x80\x99s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the\r\nold kitchen staircase had been broken away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s two on you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, thrusting the candle farther out,\r\nand shielding his eyes with his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s the t\xe2\x80\x99other one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA new pal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did he come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreenland. Is Fagin upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a sortin\xe2\x80\x99 the wipes. Up with you!\xe2\x80\x9d The candle was drawn\r\nback, and the face disappeared.\r\n\r\nOliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly\r\ngrasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and\r\nbroken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition\r\nthat showed he was well acquainted with them.\r\n\r\nHe threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.\r\n\r\nThe walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and\r\ndirt. There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle,\r\nstuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and\r\nbutter, and a plate. In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which\r\nwas secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking;\r\nand standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very\r\nold shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was\r\nobscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy\r\nflannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his\r\nattention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a\r\ngreat number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. Several rough beds\r\nmade of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round\r\nthe table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking\r\nlong clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.\r\nThese all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to\r\nthe Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew\r\nhimself, toasting-fork in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is him, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack Dawkins; \xe2\x80\x9cmy friend Oliver Twist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the\r\nhand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.\r\nUpon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook\r\nboth his hands very hard\xe2\x80\x94especially the one in which he held his little\r\nbundle. One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for\r\nhim; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in\r\norder that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of\r\nemptying them, himself, when he went to bed. These civilities would\r\nprobably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the\r\nJew\xe2\x80\x99s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate\r\nyouths who offered them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cDodger,\r\ntake off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a\r\ngood many of \xe2\x80\x99em, ain\xe2\x80\x99t there? We\xe2\x80\x99ve just looked \xe2\x80\x99em out, ready for the\r\nwash; that\xe2\x80\x99s all, Oliver; that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from\r\nall the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of\r\nwhich they went to supper.\r\n\r\nOliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot\r\ngin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because\r\nanother gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired.\r\nImmediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the\r\nsacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IX.\r\nCONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN,\r\nAND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.\r\nThere was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling\r\nsome coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to\r\nhimself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would\r\nstop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below:\r\nand when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and\r\nstirring again, as before.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly\r\nawake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you\r\ndream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half\r\nconscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in\r\nfive nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in\r\nperfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of\r\nwhat his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its\r\nmighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space,\r\nwhen freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.\r\n\r\nOliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his\r\nhalf-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of\r\nthe spoon grating against the saucepan\xe2\x80\x99s sides: and yet the self-same\r\nsenses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with\r\nalmost everybody he had ever known.\r\n\r\nWhen the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.\r\nStanding, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he\r\ndid not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at\r\nOliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all\r\nappearances asleep.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the\r\ndoor: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,\r\nfrom some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on\r\nthe table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.\r\nDragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a\r\nmagnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every\r\nfeature with a hideous grin. \xe2\x80\x9cClever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the\r\nlast! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old\r\nFagin! And why should they? It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have loosened the knot, or kept\r\nthe drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew\r\nonce more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a\r\ndozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed\r\nwith equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other\r\narticles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly\r\nworkmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.\r\n\r\nHaving replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that\r\nit lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute\r\ninscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading\r\nit with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put\r\nit down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair,\r\nmuttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead\r\nmen never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing for the\r\ntrade! Five of \xe2\x80\x99em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or\r\nturn white-livered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been\r\nstaring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s face; the boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were\r\nfixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only\r\nfor an instant\xe2\x80\x94for the briefest space of time that can possibly be\r\nconceived\xe2\x80\x94it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.\r\n\r\nHe closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on\r\na bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled\r\nvery much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the\r\nknife quivered in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you watch me for? Why are you\r\nawake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick\xe2\x80\x94quick! for your life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to sleep any longer, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, meekly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nvery sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not awake an hour ago?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, scowling fiercely on\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:\r\nand a threatening attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word I was not, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not,\r\nindeed, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush, tush, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner,\r\nand playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to\r\ninduce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\r\nknow that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a brave boy.\r\nHa! ha! you\xe2\x80\x99re a brave boy, Oliver.\xe2\x80\x9d The Jew rubbed his hands with a\r\nchuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see any of these pretty things, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, laying\r\nhis hand upon it after a short pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, turning rather pale. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re mine, Oliver; my\r\nlittle property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call\r\nme a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in\r\nsuch a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps\r\nhis fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of\r\nmoney, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he\r\nmight get up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cStay.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here;\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to\r\nraise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying\r\nthe basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s directions, when\r\nthe Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom\r\nOliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally\r\nintroduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on\r\nthe coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought\r\nhome in the crown of his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself\r\nto the Dodger, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve been at work this morning, my dears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs nails,\xe2\x80\x9d added Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood boys, good boys!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got, Dodger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA couple of pocket-books,\xe2\x80\x9d replied that young gentlman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLined?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Jew, with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one\r\ngreen, and the other red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so heavy as they might be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, after looking at the\r\ninsides carefully; \xe2\x80\x9cbut very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t he, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed\r\nuproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to\r\nlaugh at, in anything that had passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you got, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin to Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWipes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four\r\npocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, inspecting them closely; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re very good ones,\r\nvery. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall\r\nbe picked out with a needle, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall\r\nus, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley\r\nBates, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much, indeed, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll teach me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that\r\nhe burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was\r\ndrinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly\r\nterminated in his premature suffocation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is so jolly green!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley when he recovered, as an apology\r\nto the company for his unpolite behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s hair over his eyes,\r\nand said he\xe2\x80\x99d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman,\r\nobserving Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking\r\nwhether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?\r\nThis made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies\r\nof the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally\r\nwondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very\r\nindustrious.\r\n\r\nWhen the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two\r\nboys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in\r\nthis way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of\r\nhis trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat\r\npocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond\r\npin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his\r\nspectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the\r\nroom with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen\r\nwalk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the\r\nfire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was\r\nstaring with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would\r\nlook constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping\r\nall his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t lost anything, in such a\r\nvery funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran\r\ndown his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about:\r\ngetting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that\r\nit was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod\r\nupon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates\r\nstumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from\r\nhim, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case,\r\nwatch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the\r\nspectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his\r\npockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhen this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young\r\nladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet,\r\nand the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly\r\nturned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.\r\nThey were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of\r\ncolour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being\r\nremarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them\r\nvery nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.\r\n\r\nThe visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence\r\nof one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and\r\nthe conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length,\r\nCharley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.\r\nThis, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly\r\nafterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went\r\naway together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with\r\nmoney to spend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasant life, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? They\r\nhave gone out for the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they done work, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is, unless they should unexpectedly come\r\nacross any, when they are out; and they won\xe2\x80\x99t neglect it, if they do,\r\nmy dear, depend upon it. Make \xe2\x80\x99em your models, my dear. Make \xe2\x80\x99em your\r\nmodels,\xe2\x80\x9d tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his\r\nwords; \xe2\x80\x9cdo everything they bid you, and take their advice in all\r\nmatters\xe2\x80\x94especially the Dodger\xe2\x80\x99s, my dear. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be a great man himself,\r\nand will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.\xe2\x80\x94Is my\r\nhandkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, stopping\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do,\r\nwhen we were at play this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen\r\nthe Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it gone?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, showing it in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a clever boy, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the playful old gentleman, patting\r\nOliver on the head approvingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw a sharper lad. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nshilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be the greatest man\r\nof the time. And now come here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you how to take the marks\r\nout of the handkerchiefs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver wondered what picking the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s pocket in play, had to\r\ndo with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew,\r\nbeing so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to\r\nthe table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER X.\r\nOLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW\r\nASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT,\r\nBUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many days, Oliver remained in the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s room, picking the marks out\r\nof the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought\r\nhome,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which\r\nthe two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length,\r\nhe began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of\r\nearnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work\r\nwith his two companions.\r\n\r\nOliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what\r\nhe had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s character.\r\nWhenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed,\r\nhe would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy\r\nhabits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by\r\nsending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went\r\nso far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was\r\ncarrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.\r\n\r\nAt length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so\r\neagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two\r\nor three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these\r\nwere reasons for the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s giving his assent; but, whether\r\nthey were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the\r\njoint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.\r\n\r\nThe three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,\r\nand his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his\r\nhands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they\r\nwere going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in,\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter,\r\nthat Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive\r\nthe old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a\r\nvicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small\r\nboys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some\r\nvery loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering\r\ndivers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and\r\nthrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that\r\nthey seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.\r\nThese things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring\r\nhis intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when\r\nhis thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very\r\nmysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.\r\n\r\nThey were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open\r\nsquare in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion\r\nof terms, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Green\xe2\x80\x9d: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying\r\nhis finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the\r\ngreatest caution and circumspection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that old cove at the\r\nbook-stall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old gentleman over the way?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA prime plant,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Master Charley Bates.\r\n\r\nOliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he\r\nwas not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked\r\nstealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman\r\ntowards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces\r\nafter them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood\r\nlooking on in silent amazement.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a\r\npowdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green\r\ncoat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a\r\nsmart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall,\r\nand there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his\r\nelbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied\r\nhimself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he\r\nsaw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short,\r\nanything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through:\r\nturning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at\r\nthe top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest\r\ninterest and eagerness.\r\n\r\nWhat was Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking\r\non with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the\r\nDodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, and draw from\r\nthence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and\r\nfinally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full\r\nspeed!\r\n\r\nIn an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches,\r\nand the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nHe stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his\r\nveins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then,\r\nconfused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he\r\ndid, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.\r\n\r\nThis was all done in a minute\xe2\x80\x99s space. In the very instant when Oliver\r\nbegan to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and\r\nmissing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding\r\naway at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the\r\ndepredator; and shouting \xe2\x80\x9cStop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d with all his might, made off\r\nafter him, book in hand.\r\n\r\nBut the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the\r\nhue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public\r\nattention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the\r\nvery first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and\r\nsaw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they\r\nissued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting \xe2\x80\x9cStop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d too,\r\njoined in the pursuit like good citizens.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not\r\ntheoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that\r\nself-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps\r\nhe would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it\r\nalarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old\r\ngentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop thief! Stop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman\r\nleaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down\r\nhis tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy\r\nhis parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the\r\nchild his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter,\r\nslap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as\r\nthey turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls:\r\nand streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop thief! Stop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and\r\nthe crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through\r\nthe mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run\r\nthe people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the\r\nvery thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the\r\nshout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, \xe2\x80\x9cStop thief! Stop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop thief! Stop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d There is a passion FOR _hunting_ _something_\r\ndeeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child,\r\npanting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large\r\ndrops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to\r\nmake head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain\r\nupon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d Ay, stop him for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, were it only in mercy!\r\n\r\nStopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the\r\ncrowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling\r\nwith the others to catch a glimpse. \xe2\x80\x9cStand aside!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGive him a little\r\nair!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! he don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHere\r\nhis is, coming down the street.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMake room there for the gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the boy, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,\r\nlooking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when\r\nthe old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by\r\nthe foremost of the pursuers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it is the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good \xe2\x80\x99un!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9che has hurt himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ did that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand preciously I cut my knuckle agin\xe2\x80\x99 his mouth. I stopped him, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his\r\npains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of\r\ndislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away\r\nhimself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and\r\nthus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is\r\ngenerally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made\r\nhis way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, get up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, roughly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nOliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are\r\nhere somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, they ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer. He meant this to be ironical,\r\nbut it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off\r\ndown the first convenient court they came to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, get up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, compassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer, tearing his jacket half\r\noff his back, in proof thereof. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, I know you; it won\xe2\x80\x99t do. Will\r\nyou stand upon your legs, you young devil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his\r\nfeet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at\r\na rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officer\xe2\x80\x99s side;\r\nand as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead,\r\nand stared back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in\r\ntriumph; and on they went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI.\r\nTREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT\r\nSPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.\r\nThe crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two\r\nor three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led\r\nbeneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of\r\nsummary justice, by the back way. It was a small paved yard into which\r\nthey turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of\r\nwhiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young fogle-hunter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man who had Oliver in charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the party that\xe2\x80\x99s been robbed, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the man with the\r\nkeys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not sure that this\r\nboy actually took the handkerchief. I\xe2\x80\x94I would rather not press the\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust go before the magistrate now, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man. \xe2\x80\x9cHis worship\r\nwill be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young gallows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he\r\nunlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was\r\nsearched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.\r\n\r\nThis cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not\r\nso light. It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and\r\nit had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up,\r\nelsewhere, since Saturday night. But this is little. In our\r\nstation-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most\r\ntrivial charges\xe2\x80\x94the word is worth noting\xe2\x80\x94in dungeons, compared with\r\nwhich, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried,\r\nfound guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who\r\ndoubts this, compare the two.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated\r\nin the lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the\r\ninnocent cause of all this disturbance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something in that boy\xe2\x80\x99s face,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman to\r\nhimself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of\r\nthe book, in a thoughtful manner; \xe2\x80\x9csomething that touches and interests\r\nme. _Can_ he be innocent? He looked like\xe2\x80\x94Bye the bye,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nold gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul!\xe2\x80\x94where have I seen something like that look before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same\r\nmeditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there,\r\nretiring into a corner, called up before his mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye a vast\r\namphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many\r\nyears. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, shaking his head; \xe2\x80\x9cit must be\r\nimagination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was\r\nnot easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There\r\nwere the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost\r\nstrangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of\r\nyoung and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that\r\nthe grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to\r\nits power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling\r\nback the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming\r\nof the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond\r\nthe tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be\r\nset up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\nBut the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeatures bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he\r\nawakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman,\r\nburied them again in the pages of the musty book.\r\n\r\nHe was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man\r\nwith the keys to follow him into the office. He closed his book\r\nhastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the\r\nrenowned Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\nThe office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. Mr. Fang sat\r\nbehind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of\r\nwooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling\r\nvery much at the awfulness of the scene.\r\n\r\nMr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with\r\nno great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and\r\nsides of his head. His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were\r\nreally not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good\r\nfor him, he might have brought action against his countenance for\r\nlibel, and have recovered heavy damages.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesk, said, suiting the action to the word, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is my name and\r\naddress, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite\r\nand gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading\r\narticle in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent\r\ndecision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth\r\ntime, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State\r\nfor the Home Department. He was out of temper; and he looked up with an\r\nangry scowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOfficer!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the\r\nnewspaper. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is this fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy name, sir, is Brownlow. Permit me to inquire the name of the\r\nmagistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a\r\nrespectable person, under the protection of the bench.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying this,\r\nMr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person\r\nwho would afford him the required information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOfficer!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s this\r\nfellow charged with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not charged at all, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nappears against this boy, your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and\r\na safe one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAppears against the boy, does he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr.\r\nBrownlow contemptuously from head to foot. \xe2\x80\x9cSwear him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could\r\nhave believed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue this instant, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you turned out of the\r\noffice!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re an insolent impertinent fellow. How\r\ndare you bully a magistrate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear this person!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fang to the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not hear another\r\nword. Swear him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow\xe2\x80\x99s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps,\r\nthat he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed\r\nhis feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fang, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the charge against this boy? What have you\r\ngot to say, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was standing at a bookstall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brownlow began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang. \xe2\x80\x9cPoliceman! Where\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npoliceman? Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the\r\ncharge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person;\r\nand how that was all he knew about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there any witnesses?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the policeman.\r\n\r\nMr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the\r\nprosecutor, said in a towering passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or\r\ndo you not? You have been sworn. Now, if you stand there, refusing to\r\ngive evidence, I\xe2\x80\x99ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will,\r\nby\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed\r\nvery loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy\r\nbook upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being\r\nheard\xe2\x80\x94accidently, of course.\r\n\r\nWith many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived\r\nto state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he\r\nhad run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and\r\nexpressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him,\r\nalthough not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he\r\nwould deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been hurt already,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman in conclusion. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nreally fear that he is ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, I dare say!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, none of your\r\ntricks here, you young vagabond; they won\xe2\x80\x99t do. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him. He was deadly pale;\r\nand the whole place seemed turning round and round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name, you hardened scoundrel?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Fang.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOfficer, what\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who\r\nwas standing by the bar. He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry;\r\nbut finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and\r\nknowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the\r\nmore, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says his name\xe2\x80\x99s Tom White, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d said the kind-hearted\r\nthief-taker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he won\xe2\x80\x99t speak out, won\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fang. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, very well.\r\nWhere does he live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere he can, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer; again pretending to\r\nreceive Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he any parents?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says they died in his infancy, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer:\r\nhazarding the usual reply.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking\r\nround with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang: \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t try to make a fool of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he really is ill, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care of him, officer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, raising his hands\r\ninstinctively; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll fall down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand away, officer,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fang; \xe2\x80\x9clet him, if he likes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in\r\na fainting fit. The men in the office looked at each other, but no one\r\ndared to stir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew he was shamming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fang, as if this were incontestable\r\nproof of the fact. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him lie there; he\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be tired of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you propose to deal with the case, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the clerk in\r\na low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSummarily,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Fang. \xe2\x80\x9cHe stands committed for three\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x94hard labour of course. Clear the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were\r\npreparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man\r\nof decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed\r\nhastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop! don\xe2\x80\x99t take him away! For Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake stop a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried the new comer, breathless with haste.\r\n\r\nAlthough the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a\r\nsummary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the\r\ncharacter, almost the lives, of Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s subjects, especially of\r\nthe poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic\r\ntricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are\r\nclosed to the public, save through the medium of the daily\r\npress.[Footnote: Or were virtually, then.] Mr. Fang was consequently\r\nnot a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such\r\nirreverent disorder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the office!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nMr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ speak,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the man; \xe2\x80\x9cI will not be turned out. I saw it\r\nall. I keep the book-stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be put\r\ndown. Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You must not refuse, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was right. His manner was determined; and the matter was\r\ngrowing rather too serious to be hushed up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear the man,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, man,\r\nwhat have you got to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man: \xe2\x80\x9cI saw three boys: two others and the prisoner\r\nhere: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman\r\nwas reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done;\r\nand I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHaving by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall\r\nkeeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact\r\ncircumstances of the robbery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come here before?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fang, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul to mind the shop,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody who\r\ncould have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody\r\ntill five minutes ago; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve run here all the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prosecutor was reading, was he?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Fang, after another\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe very book he has in his hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that book, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fang. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it paid for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, I forgot all about it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the absent old gentleman,\r\ninnocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fang, with\r\na comical effort to look humane. \xe2\x80\x9cI consider, sir, that you have\r\nobtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and\r\ndisreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate\r\nthat the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a\r\nlesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet. The boy is\r\ndischarged. Clear the office!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x94n me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had\r\nkept down so long, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x94n me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear the office!\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers, do you hear? Clear\r\nthe office!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed\r\nout, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a\r\nperfect phrenzy of rage and defiance. He reached the yard; and his\r\npassion vanished in a moment. Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on\r\nthe pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with\r\nwater; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor boy, poor boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. \xe2\x80\x9cCall a\r\ncoach, somebody, pray. Directly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the\r\nseat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I accompany you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the book-stall keeper, looking in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me, yes, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot you.\r\nDear, dear! I have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor fellow!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no time to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XII.\r\nIN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN\r\nWHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL\r\nFRIENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which\r\nOliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the\r\nDodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at\r\nIslington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady\r\nstreet near Pentonville. Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of\r\ntime, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and\r\ncomfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and\r\nsolicitude that knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nBut, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of\r\nhis new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and\r\nmany times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy\r\nbed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever. The worm\r\ndoes not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow\r\ncreeping fire upon the living frame.\r\n\r\nWeak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have\r\nbeen a long and troubled dream. Feebly raising himself in the bed, with\r\nhis head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat room is this? Where have I been brought to?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nis not the place I went to sleep in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak;\r\nbut they were overheard at once. The curtain at the bed\xe2\x80\x99s head was\r\nhastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely\r\ndressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which\r\nshe had been sitting at needle-work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady softly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be very quiet, or\r\nyou will be ill again; and you have been very bad,\xe2\x80\x94as bad as bad could\r\nbe, pretty nigh. Lie down again; there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear!\xe2\x80\x9d With those words, the\r\nold lady very gently placed Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s head upon the pillow; and,\r\nsmoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving\r\nin his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in\r\nhers, and drawing it round his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave us!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, with tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a grateful\r\nlittle dear it is. Pretty creetur! What would his mother feel if she\r\nhad sat by him as I have, and could see him now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she does see me,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Oliver, folding his hands\r\ntogether; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps she has sat by me. I almost feel as if she had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the fever, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it was,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause heaven is a long way off;\r\nand they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor\r\nboy. But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there;\r\nfor she was very ill herself before she died. She can\xe2\x80\x99t know anything\r\nabout me though,\xe2\x80\x9d added Oliver after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she had\r\nseen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always\r\nlooked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her\r\nspectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were\r\npart and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver\r\nto drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very\r\nquiet, or he would be ill again.\r\n\r\nSo, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the\r\nkind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he\r\nwas completely exhausted with what he had already said. He soon fell\r\ninto a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a\r\ncandle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with\r\na very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his\r\npulse, and said he was a great deal better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re hungry too, an\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHem!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not. He is not hungry,\r\nMrs. Bedwin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman: looking very wise.\r\n\r\nThe old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to\r\nsay that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor\r\nappeared much of the same opinion himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou feel sleepy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot sleepy. Nor thirsty. Are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, rather thirsty,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very natural\r\nthat he should be thirsty. You may give him a little tea, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and\r\nsome dry toast without any butter. Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep him too warm, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; but\r\nbe careful that you don\xe2\x80\x99t let him be too cold; will you have the\r\ngoodness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady dropped a curtsey. The doctor, after tasting the cool\r\nstuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his\r\nboots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\nOliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly\r\nafterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just\r\ncome: bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a\r\nlarge nightcap. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the\r\ntable, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up\r\nwith him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series\r\nof short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings\r\nforward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse\r\neffect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the night crept slowly on. Oliver lay awake for some time,\r\ncounting the little circles of light which the reflection of the\r\nrushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid\r\neyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and\r\nthe deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many\r\ndays and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his\r\nawful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently\r\nprayed to Heaven.\r\n\r\nGradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent\r\nsuffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain\r\nto wake from. Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the\r\nstruggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its\r\nanxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the\r\npast!\r\n\r\nIt had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt\r\ncheerful and happy. The crisis of the disease was safely past. He\r\nbelonged to the world again.\r\n\r\nIn three days\xe2\x80\x99 time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped\r\nup with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had\r\nhim carried downstairs into the little housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room, which\r\nbelonged to her. Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old\r\nlady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable\r\ndelight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only having a regular\r\ngood cry. There; it\xe2\x80\x99s all over now; and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very, very kind to me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never you mind that, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nnothing to do with your broth; and it\xe2\x80\x99s full time you had it; for the\r\ndoctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we\r\nmust get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up,\r\nin a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver\r\nthought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation\r\nstrength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you fond of pictures, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the old lady, seeing that\r\nOliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung\r\nagainst the wall; just opposite his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, without taking his eyes from\r\nthe canvas; \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen so few that I hardly know. What a beautiful,\r\nmild face that lady\xe2\x80\x99s is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, \xe2\x80\x9cpainters always make ladies out prettier than\r\nthey are, or they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any custom, child. The man that invented\r\nthe machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never\r\nsucceed; it\xe2\x80\x99s a deal too honest. A deal,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, laughing\r\nvery heartily at her own acuteness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs\xe2\x80\x94is that a likeness, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a portrait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, really, my dear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old lady in a\r\ngood-humoured manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a likeness of anybody that you or I\r\nknow, I expect. It seems to strike your fancy, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady: observing in\r\ngreat surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the\r\npainting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Oliver quickly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the eyes look so sorrowful;\r\nand where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. It makes my heart beat,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Oliver in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cas if it was alive, and wanted to speak\r\nto me, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord save us!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old lady, starting; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t talk in that\r\nway, child. You\xe2\x80\x99re weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel\r\nyour chair round to the other side; and then you won\xe2\x80\x99t see it. There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the old lady, suiting the action to the word; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t see it\r\nnow, at all events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver _did_ see it in his mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye as distinctly as if he had not\r\naltered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind\r\nold lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin,\r\nsatisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of\r\ntoasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a\r\npreparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition. He\r\nhad scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at\r\nthe door. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nNow, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no\r\nsooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands\r\nbehind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at\r\nOliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd\r\ncontortions. Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and\r\nmade an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his\r\nbenefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again;\r\nand the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nbeing large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane\r\ndisposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic\r\nprocess which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a\r\ncondition to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor boy, poor boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nrather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I have caught\r\ncold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bedwin. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything you have had, has been\r\nwell aired, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Bedwin. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cI rather\r\nthink I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind\r\nthat. How do you feel, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery happy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd very grateful indeed, sir, for\r\nyour goodness to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you given him any\r\nnourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs.\r\nBedwin: drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the\r\nlast word: to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded,\r\nthere existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; \xe2\x80\x9ca couple of glasses\r\nof port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they,\r\nTom White, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Oliver, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the little invalid: with a look of\r\ngreat astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cOliver what? Oliver White, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQueer name!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you tell the\r\nmagistrate your name was White?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never told him so, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Oliver in amazement.\r\n\r\nThis sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked\r\nsomewhat sternly in Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s face. It was impossible to doubt him;\r\nthere was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow. But, although his motive for looking\r\nsteadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance\r\nbetween his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly,\r\nthat he could not withdraw his gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you are not angry with me, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, raising his eyes\r\nbeseechingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy! what\xe2\x80\x99s this? Bedwin, look\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s head, and\r\nthen to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face. There was its living copy. The eyes, the head,\r\nthe mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the\r\ninstant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with\r\nstartling accuracy!\r\n\r\nOliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being\r\nstrong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away. A\r\nweakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of\r\nrelieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils\r\nof the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThat when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined\r\nin the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s heels, in consequence\r\nof their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow\xe2\x80\x99s personal\r\nproperty, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very\r\nlaudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the\r\nfreedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the\r\nfirst and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need\r\nhardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt\r\nthem in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great\r\na degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own\r\npreservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code\r\nof laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid\r\ndown as the main-springs of all Nature\xe2\x80\x99s deeds and actions: the said\r\nphilosophers very wisely reducing the good lady\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings to\r\nmatters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment\r\nto her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight\r\nany considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For,\r\nthese are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by\r\nuniversal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and\r\nweaknesses of her sex.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of\r\nthe conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate\r\npredicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a\r\nforegoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when\r\nthe general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for\r\ntheir home by the shortest possible cut. Although I do not mean to\r\nassert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages,\r\nto shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being\r\nrather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and\r\ndiscursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the\r\npressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I\r\ndo mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable\r\npractice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories,\r\nto evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every\r\npossible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect\r\nthemselves. Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and\r\nyou may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the\r\namount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the\r\ndistinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher\r\nconcerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive,\r\nand impartial view of his own particular case.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through\r\na most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured\r\nto halt beneath a low and dark archway. Having remained silent here,\r\njust long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an\r\nexclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an\r\nuncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and\r\nrolled thereon in a transport of mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your noise,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to be grabbed, stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it! To see him splitting\r\naway at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x99 the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as\r\nwell as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94oh, my eye!\xe2\x80\x9d The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the\r\nscene before him in too strong colours. As he arrived at this\r\napostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll Fagin say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next\r\ninterval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what should he say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly\r\nin his merriment; for the Dodger\xe2\x80\x99s manner was impressive. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should\r\nhe say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat,\r\nscratched his head, and nodded thrice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and high\r\ncockolorum,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nThis was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so;\r\nand again said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering\r\nthe skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue\r\ninto his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in\r\na familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down\r\nthe court. Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.\r\n\r\nThe noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the\r\noccurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he\r\nsat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a\r\npocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a\r\nrascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking\r\nsharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the\r\ndoor, and listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Jew: changing countenance; \xe2\x80\x9conly two of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the third? They can\xe2\x80\x99t have got into trouble. Hark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was\r\nslowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIII.\r\nSOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER,\r\nCONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING\r\nTO THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his\r\nviolence; and looked uneasily at each other. But they made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s become of the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by\r\nthe collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak out,\r\nor I\xe2\x80\x99ll throttle you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who\r\ndeemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who\r\nconceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be\r\nthrottled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud,\r\nwell-sustained, and continuous roar\xe2\x80\x94something between a mad bull and a\r\nspeaking trumpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that\r\nhis keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the traps have got him, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nDodger, sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, let go o\xe2\x80\x99 me, will you!\xe2\x80\x9d And, swinging\r\nhimself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the\r\nJew\xe2\x80\x99s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass\r\nat the merry old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect,\r\nwould have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily\r\nreplaced.\r\n\r\nThe Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could\r\nhave been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and,\r\nseizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant\xe2\x80\x99s head. But\r\nCharley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly\r\nterrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full\r\nat that young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what the blazes is in the wind now!\xe2\x80\x9d growled a deep voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\npitched that \xe2\x80\x99ere at me? It\xe2\x80\x99s well it\xe2\x80\x99s the beer, and not the pot, as\r\nhit me, or I\xe2\x80\x99d have settled somebody. I might have know\xe2\x80\x99d, as nobody\r\nbut an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to\r\nthrow away any drink but water\xe2\x80\x94and not that, unless he done the River\r\nCompany every quarter. Wot\xe2\x80\x99s it all about, Fagin? D\xe2\x80\x94me, if my\r\nneck-handkercher an\xe2\x80\x99t lined with beer! Come in, you sneaking warmint;\r\nwot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master!\r\nCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of\r\nabout five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab\r\nbreeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed\r\na bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;\xe2\x80\x94the kind of legs,\r\nwhich in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete\r\nstate without a set of fetters to garnish them. He had a brown hat on\r\nhis head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the\r\nlong frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he\r\nspoke. He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance\r\nwith a beard of three days\xe2\x80\x99 growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which\r\ndisplayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently\r\ndamaged by a blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x9d growled this engaging ruffian.\r\n\r\nA white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty\r\ndifferent places, skulked into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come in afore?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting too proud\r\nto own me afore company, are you? Lie down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the\r\nother end of the room. He appeared well used to it, however; for he\r\ncoiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound,\r\nand winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute,\r\nappeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you up to? Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious,\r\nin-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, seating himself deliberately.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder they don\xe2\x80\x99t murder you! I would if I was them. If I\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nyour \xe2\x80\x99prentice, I\xe2\x80\x99d have done it long ago, and\xe2\x80\x94no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sold\r\nyou afterwards, for you\xe2\x80\x99re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity\r\nof ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don\xe2\x80\x99t blow glass\r\nbottles large enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush! Mr. Sikes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, trembling; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t speak so\r\nloud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of your mistering,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the ruffian; \xe2\x80\x9cyou always mean\r\nmischief when you come that. You know my name: out with it! I shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndisgrace it when the time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, then\xe2\x80\x94Bill Sikes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, with abject humility. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nseem out of humour, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cI should think you was rather out of\r\nsorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots\r\nabout, as you do when you blab and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and\r\npointing towards the boys.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left\r\near, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb\r\nshow which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly. He then, in cant\r\nterms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled,\r\nbut which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here,\r\ndemanded a glass of liquor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t poison it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThis was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer\r\nwith which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard,\r\nhe might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish\r\n(at all events) to improve upon the distiller\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity not very far\r\nfrom the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s merry heart.\r\n\r\nAfter swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes\r\ncondescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious\r\nact led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncapture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and\r\nimprovements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he may say something which will get\r\nus into trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very likely,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sikes with a malicious grin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nblowed upon, Fagin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Jew, speaking as if he had not\r\nnoticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a\r\ngood many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it\r\nwould for me, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man started, and turned round upon the Jew. But the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly\r\nstaring on the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie\r\nappeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by\r\na certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an\r\nattack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter\r\nin the streets when he went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody must find out wot\xe2\x80\x99s been done at the office,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes\r\nin a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t peached, and is committed, there\xe2\x80\x99s no fear till he comes\r\nout again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, \xe2\x80\x9cand then he must be taken care on. You\r\nmust get hold of him somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the Jew nodded.\r\n\r\nThe prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but,\r\nunfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being\r\nadopted. This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and\r\nMr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and\r\ndeeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or\r\npretext whatever.\r\n\r\nHow long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of\r\nuncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to\r\nguess. It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however;\r\nfor the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on\r\na former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cBet will go; won\xe2\x80\x99t you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWheres?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly just up to the office, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew coaxingly.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm\r\nthat she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and\r\nearnest desire to be \xe2\x80\x9cblessed\xe2\x80\x9d if she would; a polite and delicate\r\nevasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been\r\npossessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict\r\nupon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.\r\n\r\nThe Jew\xe2\x80\x99s countenance fell. He turned from this young lady, who was\r\ngaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and\r\nyellow curl-papers, to the other female.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew in a soothing manner, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do _you_\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it won\xe2\x80\x99t do; so it\xe2\x80\x99s no use a-trying it on, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nNancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I say, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady collectedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re just the very person for it,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoned Mr. Sikes: \xe2\x80\x9cnobody\r\nabout here knows anything of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as I don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x99em to, neither,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nancy in the same\r\ncomposed manner, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll go, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she won\xe2\x80\x99t, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she will, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises, and\r\nbribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake\r\nthe commission. She was not, indeed, withheld by the same\r\nconsiderations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed\r\ninto the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb\r\nof Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being\r\nrecognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her\r\ncurl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,\xe2\x80\x94both articles of dress\r\nbeing provided from the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s inexhaustible stock,\xe2\x80\x94Miss Nancy prepared\r\nto issue forth on her errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a minute, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, producing, a little covered\r\nbasket. \xe2\x80\x9cCarry that in one hand. It looks more respectable, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive her a door-key to carry in her t\xe2\x80\x99other one, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit looks real and genivine like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, my dear, so it does,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, hanging a large\r\nstreet-door key on the forefinger of the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s right hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere; very good! Very good indeed, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, rubbing\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket\r\nand the street-door key in an agony of distress. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of\r\nhim! Where have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please,\r\ngentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone:\r\nto the immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked\r\nto the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she\xe2\x80\x99s a clever girl, my dears,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, turning round to his\r\nyoung friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition\r\nto them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a honour to her sex,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and\r\nsmiting the table with his enormous fist. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s her health, and\r\nwishing they was all like her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the\r\naccomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the\r\npolice-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity\r\nconsequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she\r\narrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nEntering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the\r\ncell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and\r\nlistened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNolly, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; \xe2\x80\x9cNolly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been\r\ntaken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society\r\nhaving been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr.\r\nFang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and\r\namusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be\r\nmore wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical\r\ninstrument. He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the\r\nloss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the\r\ncounty: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a faint and feeble voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a little boy here?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice; \xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for _not_\r\nplaying the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and\r\ndoing nothing for his livelihood. In the next cell was another man, who\r\nwas going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license;\r\nthereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the\r\nStamp-office.\r\n\r\nBut, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or\r\nknew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in\r\nthe striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and\r\nlamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of\r\nthe street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got him, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s got him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nNancy.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the\r\ndeeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office,\r\nand discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to\r\nhave been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the\r\nprosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own\r\nresidence: of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it\r\nwas somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in\r\nthe directions to the coachman.\r\n\r\nIn a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman\r\nstaggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a\r\nswift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could\r\nthink of, to the domicile of the Jew.\r\n\r\nMr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered,\r\nthan he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat,\r\nexpeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of\r\nwishing the company good-morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew\r\ngreatly excited. \xe2\x80\x9cCharley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring\r\nhome some news of him! Nancy, my dear, I must have him found. I trust\r\nto you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x94to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s money,\r\nmy dears. I shall shut up this shop to-night. You\xe2\x80\x99ll know where to find\r\nme! Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop here a minute. Not an instant, my dears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully\r\ndouble-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of\r\nconcealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.\r\nThen, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath\r\nhis clothing.\r\n\r\nA rap at the door startled him in this occupation. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried in a shrill tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\nDodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cwherever she lays hands on him. Find him, find\r\nhim out, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I shall know what to do next; never fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after\r\nhis companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not peached so far,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIV.\r\nCOMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER\xe2\x80\x99S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW\xe2\x80\x99S, WITH\r\nTHE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM,\r\nWHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was\r\ncarefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the\r\nconversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse\r\nwithout exciting him. He was still too weak to get up to breakfast;\r\nbut, when he came down into the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room next day, his first\r\nact was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again\r\nlooking on the face of the beautiful lady. His expectations were\r\ndisappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is gone, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it is ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have they taken it away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it\r\nseemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, indeed. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t worry me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI liked to\r\nsee it. I quite loved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, good-humouredly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou get well as fast\r\nas ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There! I promise\r\nyou that! Now, let us talk about something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at\r\nthat time. As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he\r\nendeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened\r\nattentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and\r\nhandsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome\r\nman, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a\r\nmerchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man,\r\nand wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought\r\nthe tears into her eyes to talk about them. When the old lady had\r\nexpatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the\r\nmerits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone,\r\npoor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.\r\nAfter tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as\r\nquickly as she could teach: and at which game they played, with great\r\ninterest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some\r\nwarm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nThey were happy days, those of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s recovery. Everything was so\r\nquiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after\r\nthe noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it\r\nseemed like Heaven itself. He was no sooner strong enough to put his\r\nclothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and\r\na new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him. As Oliver\r\nwas told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave\r\nthem to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell\r\nthem to a Jew, and keep the money for herself. This she very readily\r\ndid; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew\r\nroll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think\r\nthat they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger\r\nof his ever being able to wear them again. They were sad rags, to tell\r\nthe truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was\r\nsitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.\r\nBrownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see\r\nhim in his study, and talk to him a little while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair\r\nnicely for you, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bedwin. \xe2\x80\x9cDear heart alive! If we had\r\nknown he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar\r\non, and made you as smart as sixpence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented\r\ngrievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little\r\nfrill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and\r\nhandsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so\r\nfar as to say: looking at him with great complacency from head to foot,\r\nthat she really didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it would have been possible, on the\r\nlongest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. On Mr. Brownlow\r\ncalling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room,\r\nquite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little\r\ngardens. There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr.\r\nBrownlow was seated reading. When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book\r\naway from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.\r\nOliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read\r\nsuch a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world\r\nwiser. Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver\r\nTwist, every day of their lives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a good many books, are there not, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the\r\nshelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great number, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw so many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall read them, if you behave well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman\r\nkindly; \xe2\x80\x9cand you will like that, better than looking at the\r\noutsides,\xe2\x80\x94that is, some cases; because there are books of which the\r\nbacks and covers are by far the best parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, pointing to\r\nsome large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot always those,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head,\r\nand smiling as he did so; \xe2\x80\x9cthere are other equally heavy ones, though\r\nof a much smaller size. How should you like to grow up a clever man,\r\nand write books, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I would rather read them, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to be a book-writer?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nOliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it\r\nwould be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old\r\ngentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.\r\nWhich Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, composing his features. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid! We won\xe2\x80\x99t make an author of you, while there\xe2\x80\x99s an honest trade\r\nto be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. At the earnest manner of his reply, the\r\nold gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious\r\ninstinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the\r\nsame time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him\r\nassume yet, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am\r\ngoing to say. I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am\r\nsure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nOliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommencement! \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets\r\nagain. Let me stay here, and be a servant. Don\xe2\x80\x99t send me back to the\r\nwretched place I came from. Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s sudden appeal; \xe2\x80\x9cyou need not be afraid of my deserting you,\r\nunless you give me cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never, never will, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think you ever\r\nwill. I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have\r\nendeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you,\r\nnevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well\r\naccount for, even to myself. The persons on whom I have bestowed my\r\ndearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and\r\ndelight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my\r\nheart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections. Deep\r\naffliction has but strengthened and refined them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to\r\nhis companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards:\r\nOliver sat quite still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cI only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing\r\nthat I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful,\r\nperhaps, not to wound me again. You say you are an orphan, without a\r\nfriend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make,\r\nconfirm the statement. Let me hear your story; where you come from; who\r\nbrought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you.\r\nSpeak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on\r\nthe point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the\r\nfarm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly\r\nimpatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door: and the\r\nservant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he coming up?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the servant. \xe2\x80\x9cHe asked if there were any muffins in\r\nthe house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was\r\nan old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in\r\nhis manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason\r\nto know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go downstairs, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather you remained here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a\r\nthick stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was\r\ndressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and\r\ngaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with\r\ngreen. A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat;\r\nand a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end,\r\ndangled loosely below it. The ends of his white neckerchief were\r\ntwisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes\r\ninto which his countenance was twisted, defy description. He had a\r\nmanner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking\r\nout of the corners of his eyes at the same time: which irresistibly\r\nreminded the beholder of a parrot. In this attitude, he fixed himself,\r\nthe moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of\r\norange-peel at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here! do you see this! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a most wonderful and\r\nextraordinary thing that I can\xe2\x80\x99t call at a man\xe2\x80\x99s house but I find a\r\npiece of this poor surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s friend on the staircase? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been lamed\r\nwith orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe content to eat my own head, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed\r\nnearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his\r\ncase, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility\r\nof scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable\r\na gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,\r\nMr. Grimwig\xe2\x80\x99s head was such a particularly large one, that the most\r\nsanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get\r\nthrough it at a sitting\xe2\x80\x94to put entirely out of the question, a very\r\nthick coating of powder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my head, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon\r\nthe ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHallo! what\xe2\x80\x99s that!\xe2\x80\x9d looking at Oliver, and retreating a\r\npace or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrownlow.\r\n\r\nOliver bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that\xe2\x80\x99s the boy who had the fever, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute! Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak!\r\nStop\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever\r\nin his triumph at the discovery; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the boy who had the orange! If\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel\r\nupon the staircase, I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my head, and his too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, he has not had one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! Put\r\ndown your hat; and speak to my young friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel strongly on this subject, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the irritable old\r\ngentleman, drawing off his gloves. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always more or less\r\norange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it\xe2\x80\x99s put there\r\nby the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s boy at the corner. A young woman stumbled over a bit\r\nlast night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I\r\nsaw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go to him,\xe2\x80\x99 I called out of the window, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s an assassin! A\r\nman-trap!\xe2\x80\x99 So he is. If he is not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here the irascible old gentleman\r\ngave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always\r\nunderstood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it\r\nwas not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick in his hand,\r\nhe sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached to\r\na broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing that he was\r\nthe object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the boy, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig, at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal better, thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about\r\nto say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell\r\nMrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s manner, he was very happy to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a nice-looking boy, is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I never see any difference in boys. I only knew two\r\nsort of boys. Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd which is Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMealy. I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call\r\nhim; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy;\r\nwith a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of\r\nhis blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a\r\nwolf. I know him! The wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are not the characteristics of young\r\nOliver Twist; so he needn\xe2\x80\x99t excite your wrath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Grimwig. \xe2\x80\x9cHe may have worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.\r\nGrimwig the most exquisite delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have worse, I say,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Grimwig. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere does he come\r\nfrom! Who is he? What is he? He has had a fever. What of that? Fevers\r\nare not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers\r\nsometimes; haven\xe2\x80\x99t they, eh? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for\r\nmurdering his master. He had had a fever six times; he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrecommended to mercy on that account. Pooh! nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.\r\nGrimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s appearance and\r\nmanner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for\r\ncontradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the\r\norange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to\r\nhim whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the\r\nfirst, to oppose his friend. When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one\r\npoint of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he\r\nhad postponed any investigation into Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s previous history until he\r\nthought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled\r\nmaliciously. And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was\r\nin the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t find\r\na table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be\r\ncontent to\xe2\x80\x94and so forth.\r\n\r\nAll this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous\r\ngentleman: knowing his friend\xe2\x80\x99s peculiarities, bore with great good\r\nhumour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his\r\nentire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and\r\nOliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than\r\nhe had yet done in the fierce old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of\r\nthe life and adventures of Oliver Twist?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Grimwig of Mr.\r\nBrownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as\r\nhe resumed his subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather he was alone\r\nwith me at the time. Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver. He answered with some hesitation, because\r\nhe was confused by Mr. Grimwig\xe2\x80\x99s looking so hard at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t come up to you to-morrow morning. I saw him hesitate. He is\r\ndeceiving you, my good friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll swear he is not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and down went the stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for that boy\xe2\x80\x99s truth with my life!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow,\r\nknocking the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I for his falsehood with my head!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking\r\nthe table also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment,\r\na small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased\r\nof the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this\r\nhistory; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something to\r\ngo back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Bedwin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall after him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s particular. He is a poor\r\nman, and they are not paid for. There are some books to be taken back,\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe street-door was opened. Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran\r\nanother; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy;\r\nbut there was no boy in sight. Oliver and the girl returned, in a\r\nbreathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, I am very sorry for that,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nparticularly wished those books to be returned to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend Oliver with them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nwill be sure to deliver them safely, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run\r\nall the way, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out\r\non any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined\r\nhim that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the\r\ncommission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on\r\nthis head at least: at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _shall_ go, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe books are on a\r\nchair by my table. Fetch them down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in\r\na great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to\r\ntake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nare to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have\r\ncome to pay the four pound ten I owe him. This is a five-pound note, so\r\nyou will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be ten minutes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, eagerly. Having buttoned up\r\nthe bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully\r\nunder his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room. Mrs. Bedwin\r\nfollowed him to the street-door, giving him many directions about the\r\nnearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the\r\nstreet: all of which Oliver said he clearly understood. Having\r\nsuperadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady\r\nat length permitted him to depart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless his sweet face!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, looking after him. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned\r\nthe corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and,\r\nclosing the door, went back to her own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see; he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will\r\nbe dark by that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you really expect him to come back, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig\xe2\x80\x99s breast, at the\r\nmoment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend\xe2\x80\x99s confident smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiting the table with his fist, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not. The boy has\r\na new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his\r\narm, and a five-pound note in his pocket. He\xe2\x80\x99ll join his old friends\r\nthe thieves, and laugh at you. If ever that boy returns to this house,\r\nsir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the\r\ntwo friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our\r\nown judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and\r\nhasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a\r\nbad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see\r\nhis respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly\r\nand strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIt grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely\r\ndiscernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in\r\nsilence, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XV.\r\nSHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY\r\nWERE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of\r\nLittle Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light\r\nburnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in\r\nthe summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a\r\nsmall glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a\r\nvelveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by\r\nthat dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated\r\nto recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet, sat a white-coated,\r\nred-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his\r\nmaster with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh\r\ncut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some\r\nrecent conflict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, suddenly\r\nbreaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be\r\ndisturbed by the dog\xe2\x80\x99s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought\r\nupon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable\r\nfrom kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for\r\nargument and consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a\r\nkick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.\r\n\r\nDogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by\r\ntheir masters; but Mr. Sikes\xe2\x80\x99s dog, having faults of temper in common\r\nwith his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a\r\npowerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth\r\nin one of the half-boots. Having given in a hearty shake, he retired,\r\ngrowling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr.\r\nSikes levelled at his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and\r\ndeliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew\r\nfrom his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, you born devil! Come here! D\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest\r\nkey of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some\r\nunaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he\r\nwas, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping\r\nthe end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nThis resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on\r\nhis knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped\r\nfrom right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and\r\nbarking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the\r\nstruggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the\r\ndoor suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the\r\npoker and the clasp-knife in his hands.\r\n\r\nThere must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. Mr.\r\nSikes, being disappointed of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s participation, at once\r\ntransferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes,\r\nwith a fierce gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, my dear, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, humbly; for the\r\nJew was the new comer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t know, you white-livered thief!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nhear the noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a sound of it, as I\xe2\x80\x99m a living man, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! You hear nothing, you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sikes with a fierce\r\nsneer. \xe2\x80\x9cSneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I\r\nwish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Jew with a forced smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to\r\nlaugh at the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill at\r\nease, however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrin away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with\r\nsavage contempt; \xe2\x80\x9cgrin away. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never have the laugh at me, though,\r\nunless it\xe2\x80\x99s behind a nightcap. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the upper hand over you, Fagin;\r\nand, d\xe2\x80\x94me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it. There! If I go, you go; so take care of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cI know all that; we\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x94have a\r\nmutual interest, Bill,\xe2\x80\x94a mutual interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on\r\nthe Jew\xe2\x80\x99s side than on his. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what have you got to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all passed safe through the melting-pot,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthis is your share. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but\r\nas I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll do me a good turn another time, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStow that gammon,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the robber, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?\r\nHand over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew,\r\nsoothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere it is! All safe!\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke, he drew forth an old\r\ncotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one\r\ncorner, produced a small brown-paper packet. Sikes, snatching it from\r\nhim, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come\r\nalong, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes, suspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put on an\r\ninjured look at the question; you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it many a time. Jerk the\r\ntinkler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.\r\nIt was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile\r\nand repulsive in appearance.\r\n\r\nBill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly\r\nunderstanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a\r\nremarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if\r\nin expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the\r\naction would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third\r\nperson. It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie\r\nthe boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the\r\nbrief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no\r\ngood to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs anybody here, Barney?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that\r\nSikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDot a shoul,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the\r\nheart or not: made their way through the nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might\r\nmean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDobody but Biss Dadsy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Barney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Strike me blind, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t honour\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x99ere girl, for her native talents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Barney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend her here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. \xe2\x80\x9cSend her\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining\r\nsilent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and\r\npresently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the\r\nbonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are on the scent, are you, Nancy?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes, proffering the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young lady, disposing of its contents;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand tired enough of it I am, too. The young brat\xe2\x80\x99s been ill and\r\nconfined to the crib; and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Nancy, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, looking up.\r\n\r\nNow, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s red eye-brows, and a\r\nhalf closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was\r\ndisposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.\r\nThe fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she\r\nsuddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr.\r\nSikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy\r\npulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.\r\nMr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself,\r\nexpressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together,\r\nfollowed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard\r\nas soon as his master was out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;\r\nlooked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched\r\nfist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated\r\nhimself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the\r\ninteresting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very\r\nshort a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the\r\nbook-stall. When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a\r\nby-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his\r\nmistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in\r\nthe right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and\r\nso marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.\r\n\r\nHe was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to\r\nfeel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick,\r\nwho, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment;\r\nwhen he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my\r\ndear brother!\xe2\x80\x9d And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was,\r\nwhen he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver, struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cLet go of me. Who is it? What are\r\nyou stopping me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from\r\nthe young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a\r\nstreet-door key in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my gracious!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, \xe2\x80\x9cI have found him! Oh! Oliver!\r\nOliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your\r\naccount! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found him. Thank gracious\r\ngoodness heavins, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found him!\xe2\x80\x9d With these incoherent exclamations,\r\nthe young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully\r\nhysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a\r\nbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was\r\nalso looking on, whether he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he had better run for the\r\ndoctor. To which, the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to\r\nsay indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, grasping Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s hand;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m better now. Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young woman, \xe2\x80\x9che ran away, near a month ago,\r\nfrom his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went\r\nand joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d said one woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo home, do, you little brute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know her. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t any sister, or father and mother either. I\xe2\x80\x99m an orphan; I live\r\nat Pentonville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly hear him, how he braves it out!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s Nancy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first\r\ntime; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see he knows me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help himself. Make him come home, there\xe2\x80\x99s good people, or he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nkill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with\r\na white dog at his heels; \xe2\x80\x9cyoung Oliver! Come home to your poor mother,\r\nyou young dog! Come home directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know them. Help! help!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver,\r\nstruggling in the man\xe2\x80\x99s powerful grasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the man. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you, you young rascal! What\r\nbooks are these? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been a stealing \xe2\x80\x99em, have you? Give \xe2\x80\x99em here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWith these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck\r\nhim on the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nonly way of bringing him to his senses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look\r\nat the garret-window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do him good!\xe2\x80\x9d said the two women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he shall have it, too!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the man, administering another\r\nblow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, you young villain!\r\nHere, Bull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of\r\nthe attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the\r\nbrutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders\r\nthat he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be;\r\nwhat could one poor child do! Darkness had set in; it was a low\r\nneighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless. In another\r\nmoment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was\r\nforced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to\r\ngive utterance to, unintelligible. It was of little moment, indeed,\r\nwhether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for\r\nthem, had they been ever so plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the\r\nopen door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if\r\nthere were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat,\r\nperseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVI.\r\nRELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open\r\nspace; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other\r\nindications of a cattle-market. Sikes slackened his pace when they\r\nreached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer,\r\nthe rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked. Turning to Oliver, he\r\nroughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.\r\n\r\nThey were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.\r\n\r\nOliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He\r\nheld out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the other,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, seizing Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s unoccupied hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Bull\xe2\x80\x99s-Eye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dog looked up, and growled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s throat;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! D\xe2\x80\x99ye mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were\r\nanxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick\r\nas you like; the dog will soon stop that game. Get on, young\xe2\x80\x99un!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually\r\nendearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl\r\nfor the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.\r\n\r\nIt was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been\r\nGrosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night\r\nwas dark and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle\r\nthrough the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the\r\nstreets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger\r\nin Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and\r\ndepressing.\r\n\r\nThey had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the\r\nhour. With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned\r\ntheir heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, when the bell ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can\xe2\x80\x99t I!\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nSikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether _they_ can hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they can,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was Bartlemy time when I was\r\nshopped; and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear the squeaking on. Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and\r\ndin outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost\r\nhave beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the\r\nquarter in which the bell had sounded. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bill, such fine young chaps\r\nas them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that\xe2\x80\x99s all you women think of,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cFine young\r\nchaps! Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re as good as dead, so it don\xe2\x80\x99t much matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency\r\nto jealousy, and, clasping Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s wrist more firmly, told him to step\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl: \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurry by, if it was you\r\nthat was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck,\r\nBill. I\xe2\x80\x99d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow\r\nwas on the ground, and I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a shawl to cover me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what good would that do?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout\r\nrope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at\r\nall, for all the good it would do me. Come on, and don\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\npreaching there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and\r\nthey walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in\r\nher face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThey walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full\r\nhalf-hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from their\r\nlooks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.\r\nAt length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of\r\nold-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there\r\nwas no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the\r\ndoor of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was\r\nin a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating\r\nthat it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.\r\n\r\nNancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.\r\nThey crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few\r\nmoments under a lamp. A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised,\r\nwas heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then\r\nseized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and\r\nall three were quickly inside the house.\r\n\r\nThe passage was perfectly dark. They waited, while the person who had\r\nlet them in, chained and barred the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody here?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the old \xe2\x80\x99un here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the robber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cand precious down in the mouth he has been.\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,\r\nseemed familiar to Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish\r\neven the form of the speaker in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a glim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, \xe2\x80\x9cor we shall go breaking our necks, or\r\ntreading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand still a moment, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice. The\r\nreceding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute,\r\nthe form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. He\r\nbore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft\r\nstick.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of\r\nrecognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away,\r\nbeckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They\r\ncrossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low\r\nearthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small\r\nback-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my wig, my wig!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the\r\nlaughter had proceeded: \xe2\x80\x9chere he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin,\r\nlook at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it; it is such a jolly\r\ngame, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself\r\nflat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an\r\nectasy of facetious joy. Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the\r\ncleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round\r\nand round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number\r\nof low bows to the bewildered boy. The Artful, meantime, who was of a\r\nrather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it\r\ninterfered with business, rifled Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s pockets with steady\r\nassiduity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at his togs, Fagin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, putting the light so close to\r\nhis new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at his togs!\r\nSuperfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And\r\nhis books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelighted to see you looking so well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, bowing\r\nwith mock humility. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Artful shall give you another suit, my dear,\r\nfor fear you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you write, my\r\ndear, and say you were coming? We\xe2\x80\x99d have got something warm for\r\nsupper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,\r\nand even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound\r\nnote at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery\r\nawakened his merriment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew\r\nseized the note. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s mine, Fagin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cMine, Bill, mine. You shall have the\r\nbooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that ain\xe2\x80\x99t mine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a\r\ndetermined air; \xe2\x80\x9cmine and Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s that is; I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the boy back\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different\r\ncause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being\r\ntaken back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Hand over, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\nJew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair, or not fair,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sikes, \xe2\x80\x9chand over, I tell you! Do you\r\nthink Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time\r\nbut to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as\r\ngets grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton,\r\ngive it here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between\r\nthe Jew\xe2\x80\x99s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face,\r\nfolded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for our share of the trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cand not half\r\nenough, neither. You may keep the books, if you\xe2\x80\x99re fond of reading. If\r\nyou ain\xe2\x80\x99t, sell \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces,\r\nhad been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\r\nwriting, isn\xe2\x80\x99t is, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d At sight of the dismayed look with which\r\nOliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a\r\nlively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more\r\nboisterous than the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey belong to the old gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, wringing his hands;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had\r\nme nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back;\r\nsend him back the books and money. Keep me here all my life long; but\r\npray, pray send them back. He\xe2\x80\x99ll think I stole them; the old lady: all\r\nof them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them. Oh, do have\r\nmercy upon me, and send them back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate\r\ngrief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s feet; and beat his hands\r\ntogether, in perfect desperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting\r\nhis shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, Oliver, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nright; they _will_ think you have stolen \xe2\x80\x99em. Ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the\r\nJew, rubbing his hands, \xe2\x80\x9cit couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened better, if we had\r\nchosen our time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x99d that, directly I see\r\nhim coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm. It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright enough. They\xe2\x80\x99re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ntaken him in at all; and they\xe2\x80\x99ll ask no questions after him, fear they\r\nshould be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged. He\xe2\x80\x99s safe\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being\r\nspoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what\r\npassed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet,\r\nand tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made\r\nthe bare old house echo to the roof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep back the dog, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nancy, springing before the door, and\r\nclosing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep\r\nback the dog; he\xe2\x80\x99ll tear the boy to pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServe him right!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from\r\nthe girl\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. \xe2\x80\x9cStand off from me, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll split your head against\r\nthe wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that, Bill, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the\r\ngirl, struggling violently with the man, \xe2\x80\x9cthe child shan\xe2\x80\x99t be torn down\r\nby the dog, unless you kill me first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShan\xe2\x80\x99t he!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, setting his teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll soon do that, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t keep off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the\r\nroom, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, looking round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s gone mad, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes, savagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno, she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, Fagin; don\xe2\x80\x99t think it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen keep quiet, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, with a threatening look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do that, neither,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nancy, speaking very loud.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! What do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs\r\nof that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel\r\ntolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any\r\nconversation with her, at present. With the view of diverting the\r\nattention of the company, he turned to Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, taking up\r\na jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; \xe2\x80\x9ceh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver made no reply. But he watched the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s motions, and breathed\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?\xe2\x80\x9d sneered the\r\nJew, catching the boy by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll cure you of that, my young\r\nmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders with the club; and\r\nwas raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it\r\nfrom his hand. She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought\r\nsome of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t stand by and see it done, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nthe boy, and what more would you have?\xe2\x80\x94Let him be\xe2\x80\x94let him be\xe2\x80\x94or I shall\r\nput that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before\r\nmy time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this\r\nthreat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked\r\nalternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless\r\nfrom the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Nancy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during\r\nwhich he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted\r\nmanner; \xe2\x80\x9cyou,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re more clever than ever to-night. Ha! ha! my dear,\r\nyou are acting beautifully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care I don\xe2\x80\x99t overdo it. You will be the\r\nworse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep\r\nclear of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all\r\nher other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and\r\ndespair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be\r\nhopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss\r\nNancy\xe2\x80\x99s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a\r\nglance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that\r\nhe was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal\r\npride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy\r\nto reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and\r\nthreats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the\r\nfertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the\r\nobject against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more\r\ntangible arguments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very\r\ncommon imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features:\r\nwhich, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand\r\ntimes that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a\r\ndisorder as measles: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know\r\nwho you are, and what you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I know all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, laughing\r\nhysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor\r\nassumption of indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, keep quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was\r\naccustomed to use when addressing his dog, \xe2\x80\x9cor I\xe2\x80\x99ll quiet you for a\r\ngood long time to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting\r\na hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the\r\nblood came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a nice one,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a\r\ncontemptuous air, \xe2\x80\x9cto take up the humane and gen\xe2\x80\x94teel side! A pretty\r\nsubject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty help me, I am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl passionately; \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish\r\nI had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them\r\nwe passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him\r\nhere. He\xe2\x80\x99s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that\xe2\x80\x99s bad, from this night\r\nforth. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Sikes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory\r\ntone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all\r\nthat passed; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must have civil words; civil words, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCivil words!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCivil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve \xe2\x80\x99em from me. I thieved for\r\nyou when I was a child not half as old as this!\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years\r\nsince. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it? Speak out! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; \xe2\x80\x9cand,\r\nif you have, it\xe2\x80\x99s your living!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, it is!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the\r\nwords in one continuous and vehement scream. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my living; and the\r\ncold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you\xe2\x80\x99re the wretch that drove\r\nme to them long ago, and that\xe2\x80\x99ll keep me there, day and night, day and\r\nnight, till I die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do you a mischief!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Jew, goaded by these\r\nreproaches; \xe2\x80\x9ca mischief worse than that, if you say much more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a\r\ntransport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably\r\nhave left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been\r\nseized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few\r\nineffectual struggles, and fainted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuncommon strong in the arms, when she\xe2\x80\x99s up in this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have\r\nthe disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the\r\nboys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance\r\nincidental to business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of having to do with women,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, replacing\r\nhis club; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\xe2\x80\x99re clever, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t get on, in our line,\r\nwithout \xe2\x80\x99em. Charley, show Oliver to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he\xe2\x80\x99d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had\r\nhe?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which\r\nCharley put the question.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the\r\ncleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were\r\ntwo or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with\r\nmany uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old\r\nsuit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon\r\nleaving off at Mr. Brownlow\xe2\x80\x99s; and the accidental display of which, to\r\nFagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue\r\nreceived, of his whereabout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut off the smart ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll give \xe2\x80\x99em to Fagin to\r\ntake care of. What fun it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new\r\nclothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the\r\ndark, and locking the door behind him.\r\n\r\nThe noise of Charley\xe2\x80\x99s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who\r\nopportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other\r\nfeminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept\r\nmany people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which\r\nOliver was placed. But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVII.\r\nOLIVER\xe2\x80\x99S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON\r\nTO INJURE HIS REPUTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to\r\npresent the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as\r\nthe layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero sinks\r\nupon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the\r\nnext scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience\r\nwith a comic song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the\r\ngrasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in\r\ndanger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the\r\nother; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest\r\npitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the\r\ngreat hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny\r\nchorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of\r\nplaces, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company,\r\ncarolling perpetually.\r\n\r\nSuch changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would\r\nseem at first sight. The transitions in real life from well-spread\r\nboards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are\r\nnot a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of\r\npassive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference. The actors in the\r\nmimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt\r\nimpulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of\r\nmere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.\r\n\r\nAs sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place,\r\nare not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many\r\nconsidered as the great art of authorship: an author\xe2\x80\x99s skill in his\r\ncraft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the\r\ndilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter:\r\nthis brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed\r\nunnecessary. If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the\r\npart of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver\r\nTwist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good\r\nand substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be\r\ninvited to proceed upon such an expedition.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked\r\nwith portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was\r\nin the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were\r\ndazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous\r\ntenacity of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high;\r\nbut this morning it was higher than usual. There was an abstraction in\r\nhis eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant\r\nstranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle\xe2\x80\x99s mind, too great for\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and\r\nothers who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along. He merely\r\nreturned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in\r\nhis dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended\r\nthe infant paupers with parochial care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrat that beadle!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at\r\nthe garden-gate. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it isn\xe2\x80\x99t him at this time in the morning! Lauk,\r\nMr. Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it _is_ a\r\npleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of\r\ndelight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the\r\ngarden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Mann,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself\r\ninto a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself\r\ngradually and slowly down into a chair; \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Mann, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, good\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and good morning to _you_, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Mann, with many\r\nsmiles; \xe2\x80\x9cand hoping you find yourself well, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo-so, Mrs. Mann,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle. \xe2\x80\x9cA porochial life is not a bed\r\nof roses, Mrs. Mann.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t indeed, Mr. Bumble,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the lady. And all the\r\ninfant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety,\r\nif they had heard it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA porochial life, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table\r\nwith his cane, \xe2\x80\x9cis a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but\r\nall public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her\r\nhands with a look of sympathy, and sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle.\r\n\r\nFinding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the\r\nsatisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent\r\nsmile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Mann, I am going to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLauk, Mr. Bumble!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the inflexible beadle, \xe2\x80\x9cby coach. I and two\r\npaupers, Mrs. Mann! A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement;\r\nand the board has appointed me\xe2\x80\x94me, Mrs. Mann\xe2\x80\x94to dispose to the matter\r\nbefore the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.\r\n\r\nAnd I very much question,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong\r\nbox before they have done with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard upon them, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann,\r\ncoaxingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Mr. Bumble; \xe2\x80\x9cand if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they\r\ncome off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have\r\nonly themselves to thank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing\r\nmanner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.\r\nMann appeared quite awed by them. At length she said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going by coach, sir? I thought it was always usual to send them\r\npaupers in carts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s when they\xe2\x80\x99re ill, Mrs. Mann,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle. \xe2\x80\x9cWe put the sick\r\npaupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking\r\ncold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are both in a very low state, and we find it\r\nwould come two pound cheaper to move \xe2\x80\x99em than to bury \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94that is, if\r\nwe can throw \xe2\x80\x99em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to\r\ndo, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t die upon the road to spite us. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered\r\nthe cocked hat; and he became grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are forgetting business, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle; \xe2\x80\x9chere is your\r\nporochial stipend for the month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his\r\npocket-book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very much blotted, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer of infants; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nformal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much\r\nobliged to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann\xe2\x80\x99s curtsey;\r\nand inquired how the children were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless their dear little hearts!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann with emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nas well as can be, the dears! Of course, except the two that died last\r\nweek. And little Dick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that boy no better?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Mann. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\r\nyou Dick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some calling, Dick was discovered. Having had his face put under\r\nthe pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann\xe2\x80\x99s gown, he was led into the awful\r\npresence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.\r\n\r\nThe child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large\r\nand bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung\r\nloosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like\r\nthose of an old man.\r\n\r\nSuch was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even\r\nto hear the beadle\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\nThe child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you, porochial Dick?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Bumble, with\r\nwell-timed jocularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the child faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very\r\nmuch at Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want for nothing, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey-day!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Mann, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say that\r\nyou _do_ want for something, now? Why, you little wretch\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Mrs. Mann, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, raising his hand with a show\r\nof authority. \xe2\x80\x9cLike what, sir, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the child, \xe2\x80\x9cif somebody that can write, would\r\nput a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and\r\nseal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what does the boy mean?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the\r\nearnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression:\r\naccustomed as he was to such things. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, \xe2\x80\x9cto leave my dear love to poor Oliver\r\nTwist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to\r\nthink of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help\r\nhim. And I should like to tell him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child pressing his small\r\nhands together, and speaking with great fervour, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was glad to\r\ndie when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man,\r\nand had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me,\r\nor be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both\r\nchildren there together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with\r\nindescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all in one story, Mrs. Mann. That out-dacious Oliver had\r\ndemogalized them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed it, sir\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands,\r\nand looking malignantly at Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cI never see such a hardened little\r\nwretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him away, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble imperiously. \xe2\x80\x9cThis must be\r\nstated to the board, Mrs. Mann.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the gentleman will understand that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shall understand that, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; they shall be acquainted with the\r\ntrue state of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cThere; take him away, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear the sight on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar. Mr.\r\nBumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his cocked\r\nhat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a\r\ncape to it: took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by\r\nthe criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course\r\nof time, he arrived in London.\r\n\r\nHe experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated\r\nin the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in\r\nshivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble\r\ndeclared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel\r\nquite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble\r\nsat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a\r\ntemperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass\r\nof hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the\r\nfire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of\r\ndiscontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.\r\n\r\nThe very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s eye rested, was the\r\nfollowing advertisement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFIVE GUINEAS REWARD\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on\r\nThursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since\r\nbeen heard of. The above reward will be paid to any person who will\r\ngive such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver\r\nTwist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which\r\nthe advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then followed a full description of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s dress, person,\r\nappearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr.\r\nBrownlow at full length.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and\r\ncarefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes\r\nwas on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left\r\nthe glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Brownlow at home?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nTo this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive\r\nreply of \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; where do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s name, in explanation of his\r\nerrand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door,\r\nhastened into the passage in a breathless state.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady: \xe2\x80\x9cI knew we should hear of him.\r\nPoor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his heart! I\r\nsaid so all along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour\r\nagain; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who\r\nwas not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now\r\nreturned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately:\r\nwhich he did.\r\n\r\nHe was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his\r\nfriend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them. The latter\r\ngentleman at once burst into the exclamation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beadle. A parish beadle, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cTake a seat, will\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.\r\nGrimwig\xe2\x80\x99s manner. Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an\r\nuninterrupted view of the beadle\xe2\x80\x99s countenance; and said, with a little\r\nimpatience,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you ARE a beadle, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew he was.\r\nA beadle all over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where this poor boy is now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more than nobody,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what _do_ you know of him?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak\r\nout, my friend, if you have anything to say. What _do_ you know of\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to know any good of him, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig,\r\ncaustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s features.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with\r\nportentous solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s pursed-up\r\ncountenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding\r\nOliver, in as few words as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms;\r\ninclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreflection, commenced his story.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious if given in the beadle\xe2\x80\x99s words: occupying, as it\r\ndid, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of\r\nit was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.\r\nThat he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than\r\ntreachery, ingratitude, and malice. That he had terminated his brief\r\ncareer in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly\r\nattack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s house. In proof of his really being the person he\r\nrepresented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had\r\nbrought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear it is all too true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after\r\nlooking over the papers. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not much for your intelligence; but I\r\nwould gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable\r\nto the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this\r\ninformation at an earlier period of the interview, he might have\r\nimparted a very different colouring to his little history. It was too\r\nlate to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and,\r\npocketing the five guineas, withdrew.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so\r\nmuch disturbed by the beadle\xe2\x80\x99s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to\r\nvex him further.\r\n\r\nAt length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bedwin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nboy, Oliver, is an imposter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be, sir. It cannot be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady energetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you he is,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be? We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and\r\nhe has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never will believe it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old lady, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying\r\nstory-books,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mr. Grimwig. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it all along. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ntake my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a fever, I\r\nsuppose, eh? He was interesting, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Interesting! Bah!\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr.\r\nGrimwig poked the fire with a flourish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs. Bedwin,\r\nindignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what children are, sir; and have done these forty\r\nyears; and people who can\xe2\x80\x99t say the same, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about\r\nthem. That\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor. As it extorted\r\nnothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head,\r\nand smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was\r\nstopped by Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from\r\nfeeling. \xe2\x80\x9cNever let me hear the boy\xe2\x80\x99s name again. I rang to tell you\r\nthat. Never. Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room, Mrs.\r\nBedwin. Remember! I am in earnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow\xe2\x80\x99s that night.\r\n\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it\r\nwas well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it\r\nmight have broken outright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVIII.\r\nHOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE\r\nFRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to\r\npursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of\r\nreading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of\r\nwhich he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary\r\nextent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious\r\nfriends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so\r\nmuch trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin\r\nlaid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and\r\ncherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished\r\nwith hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young\r\nlad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel\r\ncircumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing\r\na desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be\r\nhanged at the Old Bailey one morning. Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal\r\nhis share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that\r\nthe wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in\r\nquestion, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of\r\ncertain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true,\r\nwas indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few\r\nselect friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable\r\npicture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and\r\npoliteness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never\r\nbe obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation.\r\n\r\nLittle Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s words, and\r\nimperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them. That it was\r\npossible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the\r\nguilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and\r\nthat deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or\r\nover-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by\r\nthe Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely,\r\nwhen he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that\r\ngentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some\r\nforegone conspiracy of the kind. As he glanced timidly up, and met the\r\nJew\xe2\x80\x99s searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs\r\nwere neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that\r\nif he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they\r\nwould be very good friends yet. Then, taking his hat, and covering\r\nhimself with an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the\r\nroom-door behind him.\r\n\r\nAnd so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many\r\nsubsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and\r\nleft during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts. Which,\r\nnever failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must\r\nlong ago have formed of him, were sad indeed.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked;\r\nand he was at liberty to wander about the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dirty place. The rooms upstairs had great high wooden\r\nchimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the\r\nceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were\r\nornamented in various ways. From all of these tokens Oliver concluded\r\nthat a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to\r\nbetter people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and\r\ndreary as it looked now.\r\n\r\nSpiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings;\r\nand sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would\r\nscamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes. With\r\nthese exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living\r\nthing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from\r\nroom to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the\r\nstreet-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain\r\nthere, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nIn all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars\r\nwhich held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which\r\nwas admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which\r\nmade the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows. There\r\nwas a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter;\r\nand out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours\r\ntogether; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and\r\ncrowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.\r\nSometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the\r\nparapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again;\r\nand as the window of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed\r\nwith the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make\r\nout the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any\r\nattempt to be seen or heard,\xe2\x80\x94which he had as much chance of being, as\r\nif he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that\r\nevening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to\r\nevince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him\r\njustice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with\r\nthis end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in\r\nhis toilet, straightway.\r\n\r\nOliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some\r\nfaces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those\r\nabout him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the\r\nway of this proposal. So he at once expressed his readiness; and,\r\nkneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he\r\ncould take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which\r\nMr. Dawkins designated as \xe2\x80\x9cjapanning his trotter-cases.\xe2\x80\x9d The phrase,\r\nrendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational\r\nanimal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy\r\nattitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and\r\nhaving his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of\r\nhaving taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to\r\ndisturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco\r\nthat soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer\r\nthat mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce,\r\nwith a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature.\r\nHe looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief\r\nspace; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said,\r\nhalf in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity it is he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a prig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Charles Bates; \xe2\x80\x9che don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates.\r\nThey both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what a prig is?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger\r\nmournfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a the\xe2\x80\x94; you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\none, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver, checking himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d scorn to be anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nDawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment,\r\nand looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged\r\nby his saying anything to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Dodger. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x99s Charley. So\xe2\x80\x99s Fagin. So\xe2\x80\x99s Sikes.\r\nSo\xe2\x80\x99s Nancy. So\xe2\x80\x99s Bet. So we all are, down to the dog. And he\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndowniest one of the lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the least given to peaching,\xe2\x80\x9d added Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing\r\nhimself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without\r\nwittles for a fortnight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Charley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a rum dog. Don\xe2\x80\x99t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs\r\nor sings when he\xe2\x80\x99s in company!\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Dodger. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t he growl at\r\nall, when he hears a fiddle playing! And don\xe2\x80\x99t he hate other dogs as\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t of his breed! Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an out-and-out Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley.\r\n\r\nThis was merely intended as a tribute to the animal\xe2\x80\x99s abilities, but it\r\nwas an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only\r\nknown it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to\r\nbe out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes\xe2\x80\x99 dog, there\r\nexist strong and singular points of resemblance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they\r\nhad strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced\r\nall his proceedings. \xe2\x80\x9cThis hasn\xe2\x80\x99t go anything to do with young Green\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more it has,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you put yourself under\r\nFagin, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd make your fortun\xe2\x80\x99 out of hand?\xe2\x80\x9d added the Dodger, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I\r\nmean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the\r\nforty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Oliver, timidly; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish they would let me\r\ngo. I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94would rather go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Fagin would _rather_ not!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Charley.\r\n\r\nOliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to\r\nexpress his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his\r\nboot-cleaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Dodger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where\xe2\x80\x99s your spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d Don\xe2\x80\x99t you take\r\nany pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your\r\nfriends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, blow that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk\r\nhandkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s too mean; that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can leave your friends, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver with a half smile;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand let them be punished for what you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was all out\r\nof consideration for Fagin, \xe2\x80\x99cause the traps know that we work\r\ntogether, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made our\r\nlucky; that was the move, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Charley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection\r\nof Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was\r\ninhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and\r\ndown into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping,\r\nabout five minutes long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and\r\nhalfpence. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly life! What\xe2\x80\x99s the odds where it comes from?\r\nHere, catch hold; there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty more where they were took from. You\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Oh, you precious flat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s naughty, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Charley Bates. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nto be scragged, won\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething in this way, old feller,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charly. As he said it, Master\r\nBates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the\r\nair, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound\r\nthrough his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic\r\nrepresentation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley. \xe2\x80\x9cLook how he stares, Jack!\r\n\r\nI never did see such prime company as that \xe2\x80\x99ere boy; he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the death\r\nof me, I know he will.\xe2\x80\x9d Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily\r\nagain, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been brought up bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger, surveying his boots with\r\nmuch satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. \xe2\x80\x9cFagin will make\r\nsomething of you, though, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first he ever had that\r\nturned out unprofitable. You\xe2\x80\x99d better begin at once; for you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to\r\nthe trade long before you think of it; and you\xe2\x80\x99re only losing time,\r\nOliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his\r\nown: which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched\r\ninto a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the\r\nlife they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the\r\nbest thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s favour without more\r\ndelay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd always put this in your pipe, Nolly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger, as the Jew\r\nwas heard unlocking the door above, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t take fogels and\r\ntickers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of talking in that way?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Master Bates; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t take pocket-handkechers and watches,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger,\r\nreducing his conversation to the level of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s capacity, \xe2\x80\x9csome\r\nother cove will; so that the coves that lose \xe2\x80\x99em will be all the worse,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha\xe2\x80\x99p\xe2\x80\x99orth the\r\nbetter, except the chaps wot gets them\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ve just as good a right\r\nto them as they have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, who had entered unseen by\r\nOliver. \xe2\x80\x9cIt all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the\r\nDodger\xe2\x80\x99s word for it. Ha! ha! ha! He understands the catechism of his\r\ntrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the\r\nDodger\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his\r\npupil\xe2\x80\x99s proficiency.\r\n\r\nThe conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had\r\nreturned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver\r\nhad never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom\r\nChitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few\r\ngallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.\r\n\r\nMr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps\r\nnumbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his\r\ndeportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that\r\nhe felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius\r\nand professional aquirements. He had small twinkling eyes, and a\r\npock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy\r\nfustian trousers, and an apron. His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out\r\nof repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctime\xe2\x80\x9d was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having\r\nworn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow\r\nany attention on his private clothes. Mr. Chitling added, with strong\r\nmarks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder\r\nwas infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there\r\nwas no remedy against the County. The same remark he considered to\r\napply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be\r\ndecidedly unlawful. Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating\r\nthat he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long\r\nhard-working days; and that he \xe2\x80\x9cwished he might be busted if he warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nas dry as a lime-basket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\nJew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at\r\nOliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young friend of mine, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in luck, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind where I came from, young \xe2\x80\x99un; you\xe2\x80\x99ll find your way there,\r\nsoon enough, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet a crown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this sally, the boys laughed. After some more jokes on the same\r\nsubject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.\r\n\r\nAfter some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew\r\ntheir chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and\r\nsit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to\r\ninterest his hearers. These were, the great advantages of the trade,\r\nthe proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the\r\nliberality of the Jew himself. At length these subjects displayed signs\r\nof being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the\r\nhouse of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two. Miss Betsy\r\naccordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.\r\n\r\nFrom this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost\r\nconstant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with\r\nthe Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr.\r\nFagin best knew. At other times the old man would tell them stories of\r\nrobberies he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much\r\nthat was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing\r\nheartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nIn short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils. Having prepared\r\nhis mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the\r\ncompanionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was\r\nnow slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would\r\nblacken it, and change its hue for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIX.\r\nIN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his\r\ngreat-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up\r\nover his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face:\r\nemerged from his den. He paused on the step as the door was locked and\r\nchained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure,\r\nand until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down\r\nthe street as quickly as he could.\r\n\r\nThe house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of\r\nWhitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the\r\nstreet; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck\r\noff in the direction of the Spitalfields.\r\n\r\nThe mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the\r\nstreets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and\r\nclammy to the touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a\r\nbeing as the Jew to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping\r\nbeneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man\r\nseemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and\r\ndarkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of\r\nsome rich offal for a meal.\r\n\r\nHe kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he\r\nreached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon\r\nbecame involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in\r\nthat close and densely-populated quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be\r\nat all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the\r\nintricacies of the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets,\r\nand at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the\r\nfarther end. At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having\r\nexchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nA dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice demanded who was there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly me, Bill; only me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew looking in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring in your body then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cLie down, you stupid brute!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know the devil when he\xe2\x80\x99s got a great-coat on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s outer\r\ngarment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a\r\nchair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his\r\ntail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his\r\nnature to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Nancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to\r\nimply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had\r\nnot met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. All doubts upon\r\nthe subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehaviour. She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and\r\nbade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold\r\nnight, and no mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is cold, Nancy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands\r\nover the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to go right through one,\xe2\x80\x9d added the old man,\r\ntouching his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cGive him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make\r\nhaste! It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase\r\nshivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were\r\nmany: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were\r\nfilled with several kinds of liquids. Sikes pouring out a glass of\r\nbrandy, bade the Jew drink it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, putting down the\r\nglass after just setting his lips to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cUgh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw\r\nthe remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony\r\nto filling it again for himself: which he did at once.\r\n\r\nThe Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second\r\nglassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a\r\nrestless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly\r\nfurnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to\r\ninduce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and\r\nwith no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three\r\nheavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a \xe2\x80\x9clife-preserver\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nhung over the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, smacking his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor business?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor business,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cso say what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the crib at Chertsey, Bill?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, drawing his chair\r\nforward, and speaking in a very low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Wot about it?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you know what I mean, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows what I\r\nmean, Nancy; don\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered Mr. Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cOr he won\xe2\x80\x99t, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the same\r\nthing. Speak out, and call things by their right names; don\xe2\x80\x99t sit\r\nthere, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t the very first that thought about the robbery. Wot d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Bill, hush!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop\r\nthis burst of indignation; \xe2\x80\x9csomebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody\r\nwill hear us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x99em hear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d But as Mr. Sikes _did_\r\ncare, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and\r\ngrew calmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, coaxingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was only my caution,\r\nnothing more. Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to\r\nbe done, Bill, eh? When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such\r\nplate!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in\r\na rapture of anticipation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to be done at all!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least it can\xe2\x80\x99t be a put-up job,\r\nas we expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been properly gone about,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, turning pale\r\nwith anger. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I will tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you that\xe2\x80\x99s not to be\r\ntold? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for\r\na fortnight, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t get one of the servants in line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew: softening as the other\r\ngrew heated: \xe2\x80\x9cthat neither of the two men in the house can be got\r\nover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do mean to tell you so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old lady has had\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em these twenty years; and if you were to give \xe2\x80\x99em five hundred pound,\r\nthey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you mean to say, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\nwomen can\xe2\x80\x99t be got over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by flash Toby Crackit?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew incredulously. \xe2\x80\x9cThink what\r\nwomen are, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not even by flash Toby Crackit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says he\xe2\x80\x99s worn\r\nsham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nloitering down there, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all of no use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he did,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sikes, \xe2\x80\x9cand they warn\xe2\x80\x99t of no more use than the\r\nother plant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew looked blank at this information. After ruminating for some\r\nminutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said,\r\nwith a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared\r\nthe game was up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWorse luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep\r\nthought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy\r\nperfectly demoniacal. Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time.\r\nNancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her\r\neyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis it worth fifty shiners extra, if it\xe2\x80\x99s safely done from the\r\noutside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every\r\nmuscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had\r\nawakened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s hand, with some disdain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet it come off as soon as you like. Toby and me were over the\r\ngarden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and\r\nshutters. The crib\xe2\x80\x99s barred up at night like a jail; but there\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\npart we can crack, safe and softly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is that, Bill?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Jew eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Sikes, \xe2\x80\x9cas you cross the lawn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost\r\nstarting out of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her\r\nhead, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind which part it is. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do it without me, I know;\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like, my dear, as you like\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there no help\r\nwanted, but yours and Toby\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cCept a centre-bit and a boy. The first we\xe2\x80\x99ve both\r\ngot; the second you must find us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! then it\xe2\x80\x99s a panel, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind wot it is!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cI want a boy, and he musn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\na big \xe2\x80\x99un. Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99d only got that\r\nyoung boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper\xe2\x80\x99s! He kept him small on purpose,\r\nand let him out by the job. But the father gets lagged; and then the\r\nJuvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade\r\nwhere he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time\r\nmakes a \xe2\x80\x99prentice of him. And so they go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, his wrath\r\nrising with the recollection of his wrongs, \xe2\x80\x9cso they go on; and, if\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d got money enough (which it\xe2\x80\x99s a Providence they haven\xe2\x80\x99t,) we\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more we should,\xe2\x80\x9d acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering\r\nduring this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. \xe2\x80\x9cBill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the\r\nfire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave\r\nthe room. Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought\r\nthe precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting\r\nMiss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want any beer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining\r\nher seat very composedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I do!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Fagin. I know what he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to say, Bill; he needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew still hesitated. Sikes looked from one to the other in some\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at length.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil\xe2\x80\x99s in it. She\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t one to blab. Are you Nancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ should think not!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young lady: drawing her chair up to\r\nthe table, and putting her elbows upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my dear, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and again\r\nthe old man paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wot?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t p\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99aps be out of sorts, you know,\r\nmy dear, as she was the other night,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\nAt this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing\r\na glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst\r\ninto sundry exclamations of \xe2\x80\x9cKeep the game a-going!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNever say die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the like. These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both\r\ngentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and\r\nresumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cTell Bill at once, about\r\nOliver!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! you\xe2\x80\x99re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Jew, patting her on the neck. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_ about Oliver I was going to\r\nspeak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about him?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the boy for you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper;\r\nlaying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave him, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy. \xe2\x80\x9cI would, if I was in your place. He\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t be so much up, as any of the others; but that\xe2\x80\x99s not what you\r\nwant, if he\xe2\x80\x99s only to open a door for you. Depend upon it he\xe2\x80\x99s a safe\r\none, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he is,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been in good training these last\r\nfew weeks, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time he began to work for his bread. Besides, the\r\nothers are all too big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is just the size I want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Jew;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che can\xe2\x80\x99t help himself. That is, if you frighten him enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrighten him!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be no sham frightening, mind you.\r\nIf there\xe2\x80\x99s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in\r\nfor a penny, in for a pound. You won\xe2\x80\x99t see him alive again, Fagin.\r\nThink of that, before you send him. Mark my words!\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber,\r\npoising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew with energy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my\r\neye upon him, my dears, close\xe2\x80\x94close. Once let him feel that he is one\r\nof us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s ours! Ours for his life. Oho! It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come about better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and\r\nshoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOurs!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cYours, you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I do, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. \xe2\x80\x9cMine, if\r\nyou like, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, \xe2\x80\x9cwot\r\nmakes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know\r\nthere are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you\r\nmight pick and choose from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they\xe2\x80\x99re of no use to me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, with some\r\nconfusion, \xe2\x80\x9cnot worth the taking. Their looks convict \xe2\x80\x99em when they get\r\ninto trouble, and I lose \xe2\x80\x99em all. With this boy, properly managed, my\r\ndears, I could do what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t with twenty of them. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Jew, recovering his self-possession, \xe2\x80\x9che has us now if he could\r\nonly give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us.\r\nNever mind how he came there; it\xe2\x80\x99s quite enough for my power over him\r\nthat he was in a robbery; that\xe2\x80\x99s all I want. Now, how much better this\r\nis, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwould be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is it to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent\r\nexclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with\r\nwhich he received Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s affectation of humanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen is it to be done, Bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sikes in a\r\nsurly voice, \xe2\x80\x9cif he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Jew.\r\n\r\nSikes nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd about\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s all planned,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nmind particulars. You\xe2\x80\x99d better bring the boy here to-morrow night. I\r\nshall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak. Then you hold your\r\ntongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was\r\ndecided that Nancy should repair to the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s next evening when the\r\nnight had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily\r\nobserving, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would\r\nbe more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in\r\nhis behalf, than anybody else. It was also solemnly arranged that poor\r\nOliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be\r\nunreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;\r\nand further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought\r\nfit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or\r\nevil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to\r\nrender the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by\r\nMr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and\r\ncorroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash\r\nToby Crackit.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a\r\nfurious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner;\r\nyelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song,\r\nmingled with wild execrations. At length, in a fit of professional\r\nenthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools:\r\nwhich he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of\r\nexplaining the nature and properties of the various implements it\r\ncontained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he\r\nfell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no\r\nflinching about the girl. She was as true and earnest in the matter as\r\nToby Crackit himself could be.\r\n\r\nThe Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the\r\nprostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the way!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call\r\nup some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never\r\nlasts. Ha! ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended\r\nhis way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger\r\nwas sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him,\xe2\x80\x9d was his first remark as they\r\ndescended the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHours ago,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. \xe2\x80\x9cHere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale\r\nwith anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he\r\nlooked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in\r\nthe guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle\r\nspirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the\r\nworld has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, turning softly away. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow. To-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XX.\r\nWHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find\r\nthat a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at\r\nhis bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was\r\npleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of\r\nhis release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting\r\ndown to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and\r\nmanner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the\r\nresidence of Bill Sikes that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94stop there, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oliver, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my dear. Not to stop there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to lose you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us\r\nagain. Ha! ha! ha! We won\xe2\x80\x99t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.\r\nOh no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread,\r\nlooked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show\r\nthat he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, \xe2\x80\x9cyou want to know\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99re going to Bill\xe2\x80\x99s for\xe2\x80\x94-eh, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been\r\nreading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Fagin, parrying the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from\r\na close perusal of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till Bill tells you, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s not expressing any greater\r\ncuriosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt\r\nvery anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of\r\nFagin\xe2\x80\x99s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries\r\njust then. He had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly\r\nand silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may burn a candle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, putting one upon the table. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.\r\nGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, softly.\r\n\r\nThe Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he\r\nwent. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.\r\n\r\nOliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to\r\nlight it. He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table,\r\nsaw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and\r\ncontracted brows, from the dark end of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake heed, Oliver! take heed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, shaking his right\r\nhand before him in a warning manner. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a rough man, and thinks\r\nnothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing;\r\nand do what he bids you. Mind!\xe2\x80\x9d Placing a strong emphasis on the last\r\nword, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a\r\nghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room.\r\n\r\nOliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and\r\npondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. The\r\nmore he thought of the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s admonition, the more he was at a loss to\r\ndivine its real purpose and meaning.\r\n\r\nHe could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes,\r\nwhich would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin;\r\nand after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been\r\nselected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker,\r\nuntil another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged. He\r\nwas too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where\r\nhe was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely. He remained\r\nlost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed\r\nthe candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him,\r\nbegan to read.\r\n\r\nHe turned over the leaves. Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a\r\npassage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the\r\nvolume. It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals;\r\nand the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of\r\ndreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that\r\nhad been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye\r\nof man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as\r\nthey were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so\r\nmaddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had\r\nconfessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.\r\nHere, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night,\r\nhad been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts,\r\nto such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs\r\nquail, to think of. The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid,\r\nthat the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon\r\nthem, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow\r\nmurmurs, by the spirits of the dead.\r\n\r\nIn a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him.\r\nThen, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such\r\ndeeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved\r\nfor crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm,\r\nand besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from\r\nhis present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a\r\npoor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it\r\nmight come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in\r\nthe midst of wickedness and guilt.\r\n\r\nHe had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in\r\nhis hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure\r\nstanding by the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe. Only me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\nOliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door.\r\nIt was Nancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut down the light,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, turning away her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts\r\nmy eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill.\r\nThe girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and\r\nwrung her hands; but made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried after a while, \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you? I will if I\r\ncan. I will, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a\r\ngurgling sound, gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground;\r\nand, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered\r\nwith cold.\r\n\r\nOliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there,\r\nfor a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head,\r\nand looked round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what comes over me sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, affecting to\r\nbusy herself in arranging her dress; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s this damp dirty room, I\r\nthink. Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to go with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have come from Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to go with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oliver, recoiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again,\r\nthe moment they encountered the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! For no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver: who had watched her closely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave it your own way,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cFor no\r\ngood, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver could see that he had some power over the girl\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\nfeelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion\r\nfor his helpless state. But, then, the thought darted across his mind\r\nthat it was barely eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and that many people were still in\r\nthe streets: of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his\r\ntale. As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward: and said,\r\nsomewhat hastily, that he was ready.\r\n\r\nNeither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his\r\ncompanion. She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a\r\nlook of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what\r\nhad been passing in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as\r\nshe looked cautiously round. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t help yourself. I have tried\r\nhard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If\r\never you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStruck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with\r\ngreat surprise. She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was\r\nwhite and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the girl aloud; \xe2\x80\x9cfor those who would have fetched you,\r\nif I had not, would have been far more rough than me. I have promised\r\nfor your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm\r\nto yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death. See here! I have borne\r\nall this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and\r\ncontinued, with great rapidity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember this! And don\xe2\x80\x99t let me suffer more for you, just now. If I\r\ncould help you, I would; but I have not the power. They don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\nharm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! Every\r\nword from you is a blow for me. Give me your hand. Make haste! Your\r\nhand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and,\r\nblowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was\r\nopened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as\r\nquickly closed, when they had passed out. A hackney-cabriolet was in\r\nwaiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing\r\nOliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close.\r\nThe driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed,\r\nwithout the delay of an instant.\r\n\r\nThe girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into\r\nhis ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted. All was\r\nso quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he\r\nwas, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to\r\nwhich the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s steps had been directed on the previous evening.\r\n\r\nFor one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty\r\nstreet, and a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl\xe2\x80\x99s voice was\r\nin his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that\r\nhe had not the heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the opportunity\r\nwas gone; he was already in the house, and the door was shut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a\r\ncandle. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! That\xe2\x80\x99s the time of day. Come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty\r\nwelcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes\xe2\x80\x99 temperament. Nancy, appearing much\r\ngratified thereby, saluted him cordially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye\xe2\x80\x99s gone home with Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sikes, as he lighted them\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d have been in the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Nancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the kid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes when they had all reached the room:\r\nclosing the door as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here he is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he come quiet?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a lamb,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Nancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\nsake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it.\r\nCome here, young \xe2\x80\x99un; and let me read you a lectur\xe2\x80\x99, which is as well\r\ngot over at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s cap and\r\nthrew it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat\r\nhimself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, first: do you know wot this is?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes, taking up a\r\npocket-pistol which lay on the table.\r\n\r\nOliver replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, look here,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is powder; that \xe2\x80\x99ere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to;\r\nand Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s loaded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see it is, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber, grasping Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s wrist, and putting the\r\nbarrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the\r\nboy could not repress a start; \xe2\x80\x9cif you speak a word when you\xe2\x80\x99re out\r\no\xe2\x80\x99doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in\r\nyour head without notice. So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak\r\nwithout leave, say your prayers first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase\r\nits effect, Mr. Sikes continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs near as I know, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody as would be asking very\r\npartickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn\xe2\x80\x99t take this\r\ndevil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nyour own good. D\xe2\x80\x99ye hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe short and the long of what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy: speaking very\r\nemphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his\r\nserious attention to her words: \xe2\x80\x9cis, that if you\xe2\x80\x99re crossed by him in\r\nthis job you have on hand, you\xe2\x80\x99ll prevent his ever telling tales\r\nafterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance\r\nof swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way\r\nof business, every month of your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; \xe2\x80\x9cwomen can always put\r\nthings in fewest words.\xe2\x80\x94Except when it\xe2\x80\x99s blowing up; and then they\r\nlengthens it out. And now that he\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughly up to it, let\xe2\x80\x99s have\r\nsome supper, and get a snooze before starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth;\r\ndisappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of\r\nporter and a dish of sheep\xe2\x80\x99s heads: which gave occasion to several\r\npleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular\r\ncoincidence of \xe2\x80\x9cjemmies\xe2\x80\x9d being a can name, common to them, and also to\r\nan ingenious implement much used in his profession. Indeed, the worthy\r\ngentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on\r\nactive service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof,\r\nit may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a\r\ndraught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than\r\nfour-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.\r\n\r\nSupper being ended\xe2\x80\x94it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great\r\nappetite for it\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits\r\nand water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many\r\nimprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely. Oliver\r\nstretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on\r\na mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before\r\nit, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy\r\nmight seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the\r\ngirl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to\r\ntrim the light. Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was\r\nthrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which\r\nhung over the back of a chair. Nancy was busily engaged in preparing\r\nbreakfast. It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning,\r\nand it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against\r\nthe window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; \xe2\x80\x9chalf-past five! Look\r\nsharp, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll get no breakfast; for it\xe2\x80\x99s late as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast,\r\nhe replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite\r\nready.\r\n\r\nNancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie\r\nround his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his\r\nshoulders. Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely\r\npausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same\r\npistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his,\r\nand, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.\r\n\r\nOliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope\r\nof meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in\r\nfront of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE EXPEDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and\r\nraining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night had\r\nbeen very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the\r\nkennels were overflowing. There was a faint glimmering of the coming\r\nday in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the\r\nscene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street\r\nlamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the\r\nwet house-tops, and dreary streets. There appeared to be nobody\r\nstirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were\r\nall closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were\r\nnoiseless and empty.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had\r\nfairly begun to break. Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a\r\nfew country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and\r\nthen, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver\r\nbestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner\r\nwho, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his\r\narriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time. The\r\npublic-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open. By\r\ndegrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people\r\nwere met with. Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their\r\nwork; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads;\r\ndonkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock\r\nor whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken\r\nconcourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern\r\nsuburbs of the town. As they approached the City, the noise and traffic\r\ngradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch\r\nand Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle. It was\r\nas light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy\r\nmorning of half the London population had begun.\r\n\r\nTurning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square,\r\nMr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into\r\nLong Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a\r\ntumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.\r\n\r\nIt was market-morning. The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with\r\nfilth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking\r\nbodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest\r\nupon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above. All the pens in the centre\r\nof the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into\r\nthe vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the\r\ngutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.\r\nCountrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and\r\nvagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the\r\nwhistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of\r\nthe oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs,\r\nthe cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides;\r\nthe ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every\r\npublic-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and\r\nyelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every\r\ncorner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty\r\nfigures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the\r\nthrong; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite\r\nconfounded the senses.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the\r\nthickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the\r\nnumerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy. He nodded,\r\ntwice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many\r\ninvitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they\r\nwere clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane\r\ninto Holborn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, young \xe2\x80\x99un!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChurch, \xe2\x80\x9chard upon seven! you must step out. Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t lag behind\r\nalready, Lazy-legs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast\r\nwalk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as\r\nwell as he could.\r\n\r\nThey held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park\r\ncorner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his\r\npace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind,\r\ncame up. Seeing \xe2\x80\x9cHounslow\xe2\x80\x9d written on it, he asked the driver with as\r\nmuch civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far\r\nas Isleworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJump up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that your boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he\xe2\x80\x99s my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting\r\nhis hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father walks rather too quick for you, don\xe2\x80\x99t he, my man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes, interposing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s used to it. Here,\r\ntake hold of my hand, Ned. In with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver,\r\npointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and\r\nmore, where his companion meant to take him. Kensington, Hammersmith,\r\nChiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on\r\nas steadily as if they had only just begun their journey. At length,\r\nthey came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way\r\nbeyond which, another road appeared to run off. And here, the cart\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nSikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand\r\nall the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look\r\nupon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s sulky,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes, giving him a shake; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s sulky. A young\r\ndog! Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the other, getting into his cart. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fine day,\r\nafter all.\xe2\x80\x9d And he drove away.\r\n\r\nSikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he\r\nmight look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThey turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and\r\nthen, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many\r\nlarge gardens and gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s houses on both sides of the way, and\r\nstopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town. Here\r\nagainst the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large\r\nletters, \xe2\x80\x9cHampton.\xe2\x80\x9d They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours.\r\nAt length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old\r\npublic-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the\r\nkitchen fire.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the\r\nmiddle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the\r\nfire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking\r\nand smoking. They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes;\r\nand, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade\r\nsat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThey had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr.\r\nSikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to\r\nfeel quite certain they were not going any further. Being much tired\r\nwith the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first;\r\nthen, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing\r\nhimself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy\r\nin close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint\r\nof ale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, who seemed a little the worse\xe2\x80\x94or better,\r\nas the case might be\xe2\x80\x94for drinking; \xe2\x80\x9cand not slow about it neither. My\r\nhorse hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in\r\nthe mornin\xe2\x80\x99; and he won\xe2\x80\x99t be long a-doing of it. Here\xe2\x80\x99s luck to him.\r\nEcod! he\xe2\x80\x99s a good \xe2\x80\x99un!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Sikes,\r\npushing the ale towards his new friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re going directly, I can,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, looking out of the\r\npot. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to Halliford?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing on to Shepperton,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m your man, as far as I go,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other. \xe2\x80\x9cIs all paid,\r\nBecky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the other gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s paid,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, with tipsy gravity; \xe2\x80\x9cthat won\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a-going to accommodate us, and wot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face;\r\nhaving done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real\r\ngood fellow. To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had\r\nbeen sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.\r\n\r\nAfter the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company\r\ngood-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as\r\nthey did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see\r\nthe party start.\r\n\r\nThe horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing\r\noutside: ready harnessed to the cart. Oliver and Sikes got in without\r\nany further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered\r\nfor a minute or two \xe2\x80\x9cto bear him up,\xe2\x80\x9d and to defy the hostler and the\r\nworld to produce his equal, mounted also. Then, the hostler was told to\r\ngive the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very\r\nunpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and\r\nrunning into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those\r\nfeats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs, he\r\nstarted off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right\r\ngallantly.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark. A damp mist rose from the river, and the\r\nmarshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was\r\npiercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken;\r\nfor the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him\r\ninto conversation. Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the\r\ncart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange\r\nobjects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as\r\nif in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.\r\n\r\nAs they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. There was a\r\nlight in the ferry-house window opposite: which streamed across the\r\nroad, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves\r\nbeneath it. There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and\r\nthe leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind. It seemed\r\nlike quiet music for the repose of the dead.\r\n\r\nSunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.\r\nTwo or three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took\r\nOliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.\r\n\r\nThey turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected;\r\nbut still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes\r\nand over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights\r\nof a town at no great distance. On looking intently forward, Oliver saw\r\nthat the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the\r\nfoot of a bridge.\r\n\r\nSikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then\r\nturned suddenly down a bank upon the left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe water!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has brought me\r\nto this lonely place to murder me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for\r\nhis young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house:\r\nall ruinous and decayed. There was a window on each side of the\r\ndilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible.\r\nThe house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited.\r\n\r\nSikes, with Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s hand still in his, softly approached the low\r\nporch, and raised the latch. The door yielded to the pressure, and they\r\npassed in together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE BURGLARY\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make such a row,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, bolting the door. \xe2\x80\x9cShow a glim,\r\nToby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! my pal!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the same voice. \xe2\x80\x9cA glim, Barney, a glim! Show the\r\ngentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the\r\nperson he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a\r\nwooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct\r\nmuttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the same voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Bill Sikes in the passage\r\nwith nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you\r\ntook laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you any\r\nfresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you\r\nthoroughly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the\r\nroom, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on\r\nthe right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same\r\nindividual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the\r\ninfirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at\r\nthe public-house on Saffron Hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBister Sikes!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; \xe2\x80\x9ccub\r\nid, sir; cub id.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! you get on first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him;\r\nand they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken\r\nchairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much\r\nhigher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long\r\nclay pipe. He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with\r\nlarge brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring,\r\nshawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches. Mr. Crackit (for he it was)\r\nhad no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but\r\nwhat he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew\r\ncurls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers,\r\nornamented with large common rings. He was a trifle above the middle\r\nsize, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by\r\nno means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he\r\ncontemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said this figure, turning his head towards the door,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you\xe2\x80\x99d given it up: in which\r\ncase I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes\r\nrested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting\r\nposture, and demanded who that was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy. Only the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWud of Bister Fagid\xe2\x80\x99s lads,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Barney, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFagin\xe2\x80\x99s, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cWot an inwalable boy\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99ll make, for the old ladies\xe2\x80\x99 pockets in chapels! His mug is a\r\nfortin\xe2\x80\x99 to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s enough of that,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Sikes, impatiently; and\r\nstooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his\r\near: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a\r\nlong stare of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll give us something\r\nto eat and drink while we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting, you\xe2\x80\x99ll put some heart in us; or\r\nin me, at all events. Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself;\r\nfor you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool\r\nto the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing\r\nwhere he was, or what was passing around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and\r\na bottle upon the table, \xe2\x80\x9cSuccess to the crack!\xe2\x80\x9d He rose to honour the\r\ntoast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced\r\nto the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents.\r\nMr. Sikes did the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA drain for the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. \xe2\x80\x9cDown with\r\nit, innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man\xe2\x80\x99s face;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cindeed, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown with it!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Toby. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for\r\nyou? Tell him to drink it, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had better!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cBurn my\r\nbody, if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. Drink\r\nit, you perwerse imp; drink it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily\r\nswallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a\r\nviolent fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and\r\neven drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.\r\n\r\nThis done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat\r\nnothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the\r\ntwo men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap. Oliver retained\r\nhis stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself\r\non the floor: close outside the fender.\r\n\r\nThey slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but\r\nBarney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell\r\ninto a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes,\r\nor wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other\r\nof the scenes of the past day: when he was roused by Toby Crackit\r\njumping up and declaring it was half-past one.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively\r\nengaged in busy preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped their\r\nnecks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats;\r\nBarney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he\r\nhastily crammed into the pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarkers for me, Barney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nloaded them yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Toby, stowing them away. \xe2\x80\x9cThe persuaders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrape, keys, centre-bits, darkies\xe2\x80\x94nothing forgotten?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Toby:\r\nfastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cBring them bits of timber,\r\nBarney. That\xe2\x80\x99s the time of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he took a thick stick from Barney\xe2\x80\x99s hands, who,\r\nhaving delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s cape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\nOliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the\r\nair, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand\r\nmechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake his other hand, Toby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cLook out, Barney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet.\r\nThe two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having\r\nmade all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.\r\n\r\nIt was now intensely dark. The fog was much heavier than it had been in\r\nthe early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that,\r\nalthough no rain fell, Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes\r\nafter leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture\r\nthat was floating about. They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards\r\nthe lights which he had seen before. They were at no great distance\r\noff; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlap through the town,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be nobody in the\r\nway, to-night, to see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little\r\ntown, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at\r\nintervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs\r\noccasionally broke the silence of the night. But there was nobody\r\nabroad. They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two.\r\n\r\nQuickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After\r\nwalking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house\r\nsurrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely\r\npausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy next,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby. \xe2\x80\x9cHoist him up; I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch hold of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the\r\narms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass\r\non the other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously\r\ntowards the house.\r\n\r\nAnd now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and\r\nterror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the\r\nobjects of the expedition. He clasped his hands together, and\r\ninvoluntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. A mist came\r\nbefore his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs\r\nfailed him; and he sank upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol\r\nfrom his pocket; \xe2\x80\x9cGet up, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll strew your brains upon the grass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver; \xe2\x80\x9clet me run away and die\r\nin the fields. I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray\r\nhave mercy on me, and do not make me steal. For the love of all the\r\nbright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had\r\ncocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his\r\nhand upon the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and dragged him to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the man; \xe2\x80\x9cit won\xe2\x80\x99t answer here. Say another word, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no\r\nnoise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench\r\nthe shutter open. He\xe2\x80\x99s game enough now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll engage. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen older\r\nhands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s head for sending\r\nOliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little\r\nnoise. After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to\r\nwhich he had referred, swung open on its hinges.\r\n\r\nIt was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the\r\nground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or\r\nsmall brewing-place, at the end of the passage. The aperture was so\r\nsmall, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to\r\ndefend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s size, nevertheless. A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike\xe2\x80\x99s art,\r\nsufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood\r\nwide open also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen, you young limb,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern\r\nfrom his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s face; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ngoing to put you through there. Take this light; go softly up the steps\r\nstraight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door;\r\nunfasten it, and let us in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bolt at the top, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to reach,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed\r\nToby. \xe2\x80\x9cStand upon one of the hall chairs. There are three there, Bill,\r\nwith a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on \xe2\x80\x99em: which is the\r\nold lady\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep quiet, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes, with a threatening look. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nroom-door is open, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWide,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThe game of\r\nthat is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog,\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels\r\nwakeful. Ha! ha! Barney \xe2\x80\x99ticed him away to-night. So neat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed\r\nwithout noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get\r\nto work. Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it\r\non the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against\r\nthe wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to\r\nmake a step of his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting\r\nupon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first;\r\nand, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the\r\nfloor inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this lantern,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, looking into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see the\r\nstairs afore you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d Sikes, pointing to the\r\nstreet-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice\r\nthat he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would\r\nfall dead that instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s done in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, in the same low whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cDirectly\r\nI leave go of you, do your work. Hark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the other man.\r\n\r\nThey listened intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly\r\nresolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one\r\neffort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. Filled\r\nwith this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly cried Sikes aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cBack! back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and\r\nby a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew\r\nnot whether to advance or fly.\r\n\r\nThe cry was repeated\xe2\x80\x94a light appeared\xe2\x80\x94a vision of two terrified\r\nhalf-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nflash\xe2\x80\x94a loud noise\xe2\x80\x94a smoke\xe2\x80\x94a crash somewhere, but where he knew\r\nnot,\xe2\x80\x94and he staggered back.\r\n\r\nSikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him\r\nby the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own\r\npistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClasp your arm tighter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, as he drew him through the\r\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a shawl here. They\xe2\x80\x99ve hit him. Quick! How the boy\r\nbleeds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of\r\nfire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried\r\nover uneven ground at a rapid pace. And then, the noises grew confused\r\nin the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy\xe2\x80\x99s heart;\r\nand he saw or heard no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIII.\r\nWHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR.\r\nBUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON\r\nSOME POINTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was bitter cold. The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a\r\nhard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways\r\nand corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which,\r\nas if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it\r\nsavagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies,\r\nscattered it in air. Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for\r\nthe well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God\r\nthey were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him\r\ndown and die. Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare\r\nstreets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may,\r\ncan hardly open them in a more bitter world.\r\n\r\nSuch was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the\r\nmatron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already\r\nintroduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a\r\ncheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree\r\nof complacency, at a small round table: on which stood a tray of\r\ncorresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most\r\ngrateful meal that matrons enjoy. In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to\r\nsolace herself with a cup of tea. As she glanced from the table to the\r\nfireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a\r\nsmall song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently\r\nincreased,\xe2\x80\x94so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking\r\nreflectively at the fire; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we have all on us a great deal to\r\nbe grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental\r\nblindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver\r\nspoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin\r\ntea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.\r\n\r\nHow slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! The\r\nblack teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs.\r\nCorney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrat the pot!\xe2\x80\x9d said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on\r\nthe hob; \xe2\x80\x9ca little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups! What\r\nuse is it of, to anybody! Except,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Corney, pausing, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\r\nto a poor desolate creature like me. Oh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more\r\nresting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate. The small\r\nteapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections\r\nof Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years);\r\nand she was overpowered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never get another!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nnever get another\xe2\x80\x94like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is\r\nuncertain. It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it\r\nas she spoke; and took it up afterwards. She had just tasted her first\r\ncup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come in with you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Corney, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of the old\r\nwomen dying, I suppose. They always die when I\xe2\x80\x99m at meals. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nthere, letting the cold air in, don\xe2\x80\x99t. What\xe2\x80\x99s amiss now, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, \xe2\x80\x9cis that Mr.\r\nBumble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your service, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping\r\noutside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and\r\nwho now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a\r\nbundle in the other. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I shut the door, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any\r\nimpropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.\r\nMr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold\r\nhimself, shut it without permission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard weather, Mr. Bumble,\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard, indeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnti-porochial weather\r\nthis, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a\r\nmatter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very\r\nblessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not. When would they be, Mr. Bumble?\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron,\r\nsipping her tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen, indeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy here\xe2\x80\x99s one man that,\r\nin consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and\r\na good pound of cheese, full weight. Is he grateful, ma\xe2\x80\x99am? Is he\r\ngrateful? Not a copper farthing\xe2\x80\x99s worth of it! What does he do, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nbut ask for a few coals; if it\xe2\x80\x99s only a pocket handkerchief full, he\r\nsays! Coals! What would he do with coals? Toast his cheese with \xe2\x80\x99em and\r\nthen come back for more. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way with these people, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; give\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em a apron full of coals to-day, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll come back for another,\r\nthe day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible\r\nsimile; and the beadle went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, \xe2\x80\x9csee anything like the pitch it\xe2\x80\x99s got to.\r\nThe day afore yesterday, a man\xe2\x80\x94you have been a married woman, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nand I may mention it to you\xe2\x80\x94a man, with hardly a rag upon his back\r\n(here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer\xe2\x80\x99s door\r\nwhen he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be\r\nrelieved, Mrs. Corney. As he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away, and shocked the company\r\nvery much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a\r\npint of oatmeal. \xe2\x80\x98My heart!\xe2\x80\x99 says the ungrateful villain, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nuse of _this_ to me? You might as well give me a pair of iron\r\nspectacles!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 says our overseer, taking \xe2\x80\x99em away again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you won\xe2\x80\x99t get anything else here.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll die in the streets!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays the vagrant. \xe2\x80\x98Oh no, you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 says our overseer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterposed the matron. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Bumble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the beadle, \xe2\x80\x9che went away; and he _did_ die in\r\nthe streets. There\xe2\x80\x99s a obstinate pauper for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt beats anything I could have believed,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the matron\r\nemphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing,\r\nany way, Mr. Bumble? You\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman of experience, and ought to\r\nknow. Come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Corney,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious\r\nof superior information, \xe2\x80\x9cout-of-door relief, properly managed:\r\nproperly managed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am: is the porochial safeguard. The great\r\nprinciple of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t want; and then they get tired of coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Corney. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is a good one, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Betwixt you and me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Bumble, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ngreat principle; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why, if you look at any cases\r\nthat get into them owdacious newspapers, you\xe2\x80\x99ll always observe that\r\nsick families have been relieved with slices of cheese. That\xe2\x80\x99s the rule\r\nnow, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle,\r\nstopping to unpack his bundle, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are official secrets, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; not\r\nto be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers,\r\nsuch as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that the board ordered\r\nfor the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask\r\nthis forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to\r\ntest its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of\r\ndrawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it\r\ncarefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt blows, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cenough to cut one\xe2\x80\x99s ears off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was\r\nmoving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to\r\nbidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether\xe2\x80\x94whether he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake a cup of tea?\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat\r\nand stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. As he\r\nslowly seated himself, he looked at the lady. She fixed her eyes upon\r\nthe little teapot. Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she\r\nsat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle;\r\nshe coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea. Again\r\nMr. Bumble coughed\xe2\x80\x94louder this time than he had coughed yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweet? Mr. Bumble?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sweet, indeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble. He fixed his eyes on\r\nMrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr.\r\nBumble was that beadle at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe tea was made, and handed in silence. Mr. Bumble, having spread a\r\nhandkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the\r\nsplendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these\r\namusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had\r\nno injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather\r\nseemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a cat, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who,\r\nin the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; \xe2\x80\x9cand kittens\r\ntoo, I declare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nmatron. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that\r\nthey are quite companions for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery nice animals, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; \xe2\x80\x9cso very\r\ndomestic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; \xe2\x80\x9cso fond of their home\r\ntoo, that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a pleasure, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Corney, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time\r\nwith his teaspoon, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say this, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; that any cat, or kitten,\r\nthat could live with you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be\r\na ass, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Bumble!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Mrs. Corney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of no use disguising facts, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, slowly\r\nflourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him\r\ndoubly impressive; \xe2\x80\x9cI would drown it myself, with pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re a cruel man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron vivaciously, as she held out\r\nher hand for the beadle\xe2\x80\x99s cup; \xe2\x80\x9cand a very hard-hearted man besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard-hearted, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cHard?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bumble resigned his\r\ncup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney\xe2\x80\x99s little finger as she\r\ntook it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat,\r\ngave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther\r\nfrom the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been\r\nsitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and\r\nfronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from\r\nthe fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance\r\nbetween himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers\r\nwill doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great\r\nheroism on Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s part: he being in some sort tempted by time,\r\nplace, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,\r\nwhich however well they may become the lips of the light and\r\nthoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the\r\nland, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other\r\ngreat public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the\r\nstateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be\r\nthe sternest and most inflexible among them all.\r\n\r\nWhatever were Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, however (and no doubt they were\r\nof the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before\r\nremarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble,\r\nmoving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the\r\ndistance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel\r\nround the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close\r\nto that in which the matron was seated.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nNow, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have\r\nbeen scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen\r\ninto Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt\r\nforeseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was,\r\nand handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and\r\nlooking up into the matron\xe2\x80\x99s face; \xe2\x80\x9care _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs.\r\nCorney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the matron, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a very curious question from a\r\nsingle man. What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast;\r\nwhisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately\r\nkissed the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bumble!\xe2\x80\x9d cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was\r\nso great, that she had quite lost her voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bumble, I shall\r\nscream!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner,\r\nput his arm round the matron\xe2\x80\x99s waist.\r\n\r\nAs the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would\r\nhave screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was\r\nrendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no\r\nsooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine\r\nbottles, and began dusting them with great violence: while the matron\r\nsharply demanded who was there.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy\r\nof a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that\r\nher voice had quite recovered all its official asperity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d said a withered old female pauper, hideously\r\nugly: putting her head in at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cOld Sally is a-going fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s that to me?\xe2\x80\x9d angrily demanded the matron. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nher alive, can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cnobody can; she\xe2\x80\x99s far\r\nbeyond the reach of help. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a many people die; little babes and\r\ngreat strong men; and I know when death\xe2\x80\x99s a-coming, well enough. But\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not often, for she is dying very hard,\xe2\x80\x94she says she has got\r\nsomething to tell, which you must hear. She\xe2\x80\x99ll never die quiet till you\r\ncome, mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of\r\ninvectives against old women who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even die without purposely\r\nannoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which\r\nshe hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she\r\ncame back, lest anything particular should occur. Bidding the messenger\r\nwalk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed\r\nher from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.\r\nHe opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs,\r\nclosely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the\r\ngenuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put\r\non his cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four\r\ndistinct times round the table.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off\r\nthe cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his\r\nback towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact\r\ninventory of the furniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF\r\nIMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the\r\nmatron\xe2\x80\x99s room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy;\r\nher face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque\r\nshaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nAlas! How few of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s faces are left alone to gladden us with their\r\nbeauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change\r\nthem as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep,\r\nand have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off,\r\nand leave Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s surface clear. It is a common thing for the\r\ncountenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to\r\nsubside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and\r\nsettle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they\r\ngrow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by\r\nthe coffin\xe2\x80\x99s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering\r\nsome indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at\r\nlength compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand,\r\nand remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble\r\nsuperior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay.\r\n\r\nIt was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end.\r\nThere was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish\r\napothecary\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick\r\nout of a quill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold night, Mrs. Corney,\xe2\x80\x9d said this young gentleman, as the matron\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery cold, indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the mistress, in her most civil\r\ntones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should get better coals out of your contractors,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\napothecary\xe2\x80\x99s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the\r\nrusty poker; \xe2\x80\x9cthese are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the board\xe2\x80\x99s choosing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the matron. \xe2\x80\x9cThe least\r\nthey could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, turning his face towards the bed, as if he\r\nhad previously quite forgotten the patient, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all U.P. there, Mrs.\r\nCorney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, is it, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\napothecary\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick\xe2\x80\x99s point. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbreak-up of the system altogether. Is she dozing, old lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99ll go off in that way, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t make a row,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe young man. \xe2\x80\x9cPut the light on the floor. She won\xe2\x80\x99t see it there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to\r\nintimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she\r\nresumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time\r\nreturned. The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped\r\nherself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\nThe apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the\r\ntoothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it\r\nfor ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished\r\nMrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.\r\n\r\nWhen they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from\r\nthe bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to\r\ncatch the heat. The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled\r\nfaces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position,\r\nthey began to converse in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other. \xe2\x80\x9cShe plucked and tore at her arms for\r\na little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. She\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t so\r\nweak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to get it down,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the other. \xe2\x80\x9cBut her teeth were tight\r\nset, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do\r\nto get it back again. So I drank it; and it did me good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard,\r\nthe two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mind the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first speaker, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she would have done\r\nthe same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that she would,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the other; \xe2\x80\x9cshe had a merry heart. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nmany, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as\r\nwaxwork. My old eyes have seen them\xe2\x80\x94ay, and those old hands touched\r\nthem too; for I have helped her, scores of times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature\r\nshook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket,\r\nbrought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook\r\na few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few\r\nmore into her own. While they were thus employed, the matron, who had\r\nbeen impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her\r\nstupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to\r\nwait?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot long, mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the second woman, looking up into her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience!\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be here soon enough for us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, you doting idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou,\r\nMartha, tell me; has she been in this way before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the first woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will never be again,\xe2\x80\x9d added the second one; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is, she\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nwake again but once\xe2\x80\x94and mind, mistress, that won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong or short,\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron, snappishly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe won\xe2\x80\x99t find me here\r\nwhen she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for\r\nnothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house\r\ndie, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s more. Mind that, you impudent old harridans. If\r\nyou make a fool of me again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon cure you, I warrant you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned\r\ntowards the bed, caused her to look round. The patient had raised\r\nherself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women, stooping over her. \xe2\x80\x9cLie down, lie\r\ndown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never lie down again alive!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n_will_ tell her! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in your ear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the\r\nbedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of\r\nthe two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn them away,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, drowsily; \xe2\x80\x9cmake haste! make haste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous\r\nlamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best\r\nfriends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never\r\nleave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the\r\ndoor, and returned to the bedside. On being excluded, the old ladies\r\nchanged their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was\r\ndrunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a\r\nmoderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring\r\nunder the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been\r\nprivily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy\r\nold ladies themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great\r\neffort to revive one latent spark of energy. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this very room\xe2\x80\x94in this\r\nvery bed\xe2\x80\x94I once nursed a pretty young creetur\xe2\x80\x99, that was brought into\r\nthe house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled\r\nwith dust and blood. She gave birth to a boy, and died. Let me\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94what was the year again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the year,\xe2\x80\x9d said the impatient auditor; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat about her?\xe2\x80\x94what about\xe2\x80\x94I know!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, jumping fiercely up:\r\nher face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI robbed her, so\r\nI did! She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cold\xe2\x80\x94I tell you she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cold, when I stole it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStole what, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the matron, with a gesture as if\r\nshe would call for help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_It_!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman, laying her hand over the other\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nonly thing she had. She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to\r\neat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom. It was gold, I\r\ntell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGold!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, go on\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94what of it? Who was the mother? When was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe charged me to keep it safe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman with a groan, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ntrusted me as the only woman about her. I stole it in my heart when she\r\nfirst showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nperhaps, is on me besides! They would have treated him better, if they\r\nhad known it all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnown what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the other. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy grew so like his mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, rambling on, and not\r\nheeding the question, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I could never forget it when I saw his\r\nface. Poor girl! poor girl! She was so young, too! Such a gentle lamb!\r\nWait; there\xe2\x80\x99s more to tell. I have not told you all, have I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as\r\nthey came more faintly from the dying woman. \xe2\x80\x9cBe quick, or it may be\r\ntoo late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, making a more violent effort than before;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in\r\nmy ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come\r\nwhen it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother\r\nnamed. \xe2\x80\x98And oh, kind Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, folding her thin hands\r\ntogether, \xe2\x80\x98whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in\r\nthis troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child,\r\nabandoned to its mercy!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _called_ him Oliver,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman, feebly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gold I\r\nstole was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other.\r\n\r\nShe was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew\r\nback, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a\r\nsitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered\r\nsome indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStone dead!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the\r\ndoor was opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd nothing to tell, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the matron, walking\r\ncarelessly away.\r\n\r\nThe two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the\r\npreparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left\r\nalone, hovering about the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXV.\r\nWHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat\r\nin the old den\xe2\x80\x94the same from which Oliver had been removed by the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x94brooding over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair of bellows upon\r\nhis knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it\r\ninto more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and\r\nwith his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed\r\nhis eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.\r\n\r\nAt a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and\r\nMr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy\r\nagainst Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the\r\nfirst-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired\r\ngreat additional interest from his close observance of the game, and\r\nhis attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling\xe2\x80\x99s hand; upon which, from time to\r\ntime, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances:\r\nwisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon\r\nhis neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s cards. It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat,\r\nas, indeed, was often his custom within doors. He also sustained a clay\r\npipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he\r\ndeemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the\r\ntable, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the\r\naccommodation of the company.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more\r\nexcitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that\r\nhe more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover\r\nindulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a\r\nscientific rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close\r\nattachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his\r\ncompanion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master\r\nBates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to\r\nbe \xe2\x80\x9cblowed,\xe2\x80\x9d or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some\r\nother neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application\r\nof which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling.\r\nIt was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably\r\nlost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates,\r\nappeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed\r\nmost uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had\r\nnever seen such a jolly game in all his born days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s two doubles and the rub,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Chitling, with a very long\r\nface, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI never see\r\nsuch a feller as you, Jack; you win everything. Even when we\xe2\x80\x99ve good\r\ncards, Charley and I can\xe2\x80\x99t make nothing of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEither the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very\r\nruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of\r\nlaughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire\r\nwhat was the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter, Fagin!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Charley. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had watched the play. Tommy\r\nChitling hasn\xe2\x80\x99t won a point; and I went partners with him against the\r\nArtfull and dumb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated\r\nthat he was at no loss to understand the reason. \xe2\x80\x9cTry \xe2\x80\x99em again, Tom;\r\ntry \xe2\x80\x99em again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more of it for me, thank \xe2\x80\x99ee, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Chitling; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad enough. That \xe2\x80\x99ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nstanding again\xe2\x80\x99 him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must get up very early in the\r\nmorning, to win against the Dodger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley Bates; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must put your boots on over-night,\r\nand have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your\r\nshoulders, if you want to come over him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy,\r\nand offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first\r\npicture-card, at a shilling at a time. Nobody accepting the challenge,\r\nand his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse\r\nhimself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the\r\npiece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling,\r\nmeantime, with peculiar shrillness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow precious dull you are, Tommy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger, stopping short\r\nwhen there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndo you think he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, looking round as he\r\nplied the bellows. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout his losses, maybe; or the little retirement\r\nin the country that he\xe2\x80\x99s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of\r\ndiscourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do _you_ say,\r\nCharley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ should say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Master Bates, with a grin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he was\r\nuncommon sweet upon Betsy. See how he\xe2\x80\x99s a-blushing! Oh, my eye! here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na merry-go-rounder! Tommy Chitling\xe2\x80\x99s in love! Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a\r\nspree!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim\r\nof the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair\r\nwith such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the\r\nfloor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at\r\nfull length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former\r\nposition, and began another laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind him, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and\r\ngiving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetsy\xe2\x80\x99s a fine girl. Stick up to her, Tom. Stick up to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean to say, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9cis, that that isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to anybody here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cCharley will talk. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him,\r\nmy dear; don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him. Betsy\xe2\x80\x99s a fine girl. Do as she bids you, Tom,\r\nand you will make your fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I _do_ do as she bids me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Chitling; \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen milled, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for her advice. But it turned out a good\r\njob for you; didn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Fagin! And what\xe2\x80\x99s six weeks of it? It must\r\ncome, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to be sure, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it again, Tom, would you,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Dodger, winking\r\nupon Charley and the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cif Bet was all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tom, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, now.\r\nAh! Who\xe2\x80\x99ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cnot a soul, Tom. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know one\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em that would do it besides you; not one of \xe2\x80\x99em, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have got clear off, if I\xe2\x80\x99d split upon her; mightn\xe2\x80\x99t I, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nangrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. \xe2\x80\x9cA word from me would have\r\ndone it; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure it would, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t blab it; did I, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Tom, pouring question\r\nupon question with great volubility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cyou were too stout-hearted for\r\nthat. A deal too stout, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I was,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Tom, looking round; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I was, what\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nlaugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened\r\nto assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the\r\ncompany, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. But,\r\nunfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never\r\nmore serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a\r\nviolent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary\r\nceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender;\r\nwho, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose\r\nhis time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old\r\ngentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood\r\npanting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Dodger at this moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard the tinkler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCatching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in\r\ndarkness. After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered\r\nFagin mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9calone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the\r\ncandle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb\r\nshow, that he had better not be funny just then. Having performed this\r\nfriendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s face, and awaited his\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his\r\nface working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and\r\nfeared to know the worst. At length he raised his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to\r\nleave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; \xe2\x80\x9cbring him down. Hush!\r\nQuiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was\r\nsoftly and immediately obeyed. There was no sound of their whereabout,\r\nwhen the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand,\r\nand followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a\r\nhurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had\r\nconcealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard,\r\nunwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Faguey?\xe2\x80\x9d said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cPop that\r\nshawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it\r\nwhen I cut; that\xe2\x80\x99s the time of day! You\xe2\x80\x99ll be a fine young cracksman\r\nafore the old file now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round\r\nhis middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there, Faguey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnot a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of\r\nblacking, by Jove! But don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me in that way, man. All in good\r\ntime. I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about business till I\xe2\x80\x99ve eat and drank; so produce\r\nthe sustainance, and let\xe2\x80\x99s have a quiet fill-out for the first time\r\nthese three days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon\r\nthe table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nTo judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the\r\nconversation. At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently\r\nwatching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue\r\nto the intelligence he brought; but in vain.\r\n\r\nHe looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon\r\nhis features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and\r\nwhisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of\r\nflash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched\r\nevery morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room,\r\nmeanwhile, in irrepressible excitement. It was all of no use. Toby\r\ncontinued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could\r\neat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a\r\nglass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to\r\ndeclare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the\r\nlow mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his\r\neye, he quietly resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housebreaker, \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x99s Bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Toby, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are\r\nthey? Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where\r\nare they hiding? Why have they not been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe crack failed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and\r\npointing to it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with\r\nhim between us\xe2\x80\x94straight as the crow flies\xe2\x80\x94through hedge and ditch. They\r\ngave chase. Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to\r\ntake him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were\r\nclose upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!\r\nWe parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or\r\ndead, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I know about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining\r\nhis hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVI.\r\nIN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY\r\nTHINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover\r\nthe effect of Toby Crackit\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing of\r\nhis unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and\r\ndisordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a\r\nboisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger: drove him\r\nback upon the pavement. Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main\r\nstreets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at length\r\nemerged on Snow Hill. Here he walked even faster than before; nor did\r\nhe linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious\r\nthat he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling\r\npace, and seemed to breathe more freely.\r\n\r\nNear to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon\r\nthe right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley,\r\nleading to Saffron Hill. In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge\r\nbunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns;\r\nfor here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets.\r\nHundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the\r\nwindows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are\r\npiled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its\r\nbarber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse.\r\nIt is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny:\r\nvisited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants,\r\nwho traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they\r\ncome. Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant,\r\ndisplay their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of\r\nold iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and\r\nlinen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.\r\n\r\nIt was into this place that the Jew turned. He was well known to the\r\nsallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out\r\nto buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to\r\ntheir salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition\r\nuntil he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to\r\naddress a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his\r\nperson into a child\xe2\x80\x99s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a\r\npipe at his warehouse door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!\xe2\x80\x9d said this\r\nrespectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry after his\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, elevating\r\nhis eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe trader; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it soon cools down again; don\xe2\x80\x99t you find it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of Saffron\r\nHill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Cripples?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the man.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the merchant, reflecting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there\xe2\x80\x99s some half-dozen of \xe2\x80\x99em gone in, that I knows. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink your friend\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSikes is not, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Jew, with a disappointed\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the little man, shaking\r\nhis head, and looking amazingly sly. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got anything in my line\r\nto-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the little man,\r\ncalling after him. \xe2\x80\x9cStop! I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I have a drop there with\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he\r\npreferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very\r\neasily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was,\r\nfor a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively\xe2\x80\x99s presence. By the\r\ntime he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively,\r\nafter ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight\r\nof him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a\r\nshake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and\r\nmistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.\r\n\r\nThe Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which\r\nthe establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the\r\npublic-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured.\r\nMerely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight\r\nupstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating\r\nhimself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with\r\nhis hand, as if in search of some particular person.\r\n\r\nThe room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was\r\nprevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded\r\nred, from being visible outside. The ceiling was blackened, to prevent\r\nits colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the\r\nplace was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely\r\npossible to discern anything more. By degrees, however, as some of it\r\ncleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused\r\nas the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye\r\ngrew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware\r\nof the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a\r\nlong table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of\r\noffice in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose,\r\nand his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a\r\njingling piano in a remote corner.\r\n\r\nAs Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over\r\nthe keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a\r\nsong; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the\r\ncompany with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the\r\naccompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could. When\r\nthis was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the\r\nprofessional gentleman on the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s right and left volunteered a\r\nduet, and sang it, with great applause.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from\r\namong the group. There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the\r\nhouse,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were\r\nproceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give\r\nhimself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and\r\nan ear for everything that was said\xe2\x80\x94and sharp ones, too. Near him were\r\nthe singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments\r\nof the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered\r\nglasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous\r\nadmirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost\r\nevery grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very\r\nrepulsiveness. Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages,\r\nwere there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last\r\nlingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked:\r\nothers with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and\r\npresenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere\r\ngirls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed\r\nthe darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.\r\n\r\nFagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face\r\nwhile these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without\r\nmeeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in\r\ncatching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him\r\nslightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the man, as he followed\r\nhim out to the landing. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you join us? They\xe2\x80\x99ll be delighted, every\r\none of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cIs _he_\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no news of Barney?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstir till it\xe2\x80\x99s all safe. Depend on it, they\xe2\x80\x99re on the scent down there;\r\nand that if he moved, he\xe2\x80\x99d blow upon the thing at once. He\xe2\x80\x99s all right\r\nenough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pound it, that\r\nBarney\xe2\x80\x99s managing properly. Let him alone for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill _he_ be here to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis\r\non the pronoun as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonks, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the landlord, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nexpected him here before now. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll wait ten minutes, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might\r\nbe to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his\r\nabsence. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me\r\nto-night. No, say to-morrow. As he is not here, to-morrow will be time\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, descending the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a\r\nhoarse whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a time this would be for a sell! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got Phil\r\nBarker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! But it\xe2\x80\x99s not Phil Barker\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cPhil\r\nhas something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go\r\nback to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives\xe2\x80\x94_while\r\nthey last_. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord reciprocated the old man\xe2\x80\x99s laugh; and returned to his\r\nguests. The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its\r\nformer expression of anxiety and thought. After a brief reflection, he\r\ncalled a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green.\r\nHe dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresidence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cif there is any\r\ndeep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was in her room, the woman said. Fagin crept softly upstairs, and\r\nentered it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying\r\nwith her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been drinking,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Jew, cooly, \xe2\x80\x9cor perhaps she is\r\nonly miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the\r\nnoise thus occasioned, roused the girl. She eyed his crafty face\r\nnarrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit\xe2\x80\x99s story. When\r\nit was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a\r\nword. She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she\r\nfeverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but\r\nthis was all.\r\n\r\nDuring the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to\r\nassure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly\r\nreturned. Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or\r\nthrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl\r\nheeded him no more than if he had been made of stone. At length he made\r\nanother attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most\r\nconciliatory tone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where should you think Bill was now, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not\r\ntell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the boy, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse\r\nof her face. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, suddenly looking up, \xe2\x80\x9cis better where he\r\nis, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies\r\ndead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the girl, meeting his gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad to\r\nhave him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbear to have him about me. The sight of him turns me against myself,\r\nand all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no fault of yours, if I am not!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except\r\nnow;\xe2\x80\x94the humour doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit you, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Jew, furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange it, then!\xe2\x80\x9d responded the girl, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n_will_ change it! Listen to me, you drab. Listen to me, who with six\r\nwords, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull\xe2\x80\x99s throat\r\nbetween my fingers now. If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind\r\nhim; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to\r\nme; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch. And do\r\nit the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too\r\nlate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Fagin, mad with rage. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the boy\xe2\x80\x99s worth\r\nhundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way\r\nof getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could\r\nwhistle away the lives of! And me bound, too, to a born devil that only\r\nwants the will, and has the power to, to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPanting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that\r\ninstant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole\r\ndemeanour. A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his\r\neyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he\r\nshrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the\r\napprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy. After a\r\nshort silence, he ventured to look round at his companion. He appeared\r\nsomewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from\r\nwhich he had first roused her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you mind me,\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry me now, Fagin!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, raising her head\r\nlanguidly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has\r\ndone many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and\r\nwhen he can\xe2\x80\x99t he won\xe2\x80\x99t; so no more about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegarding this boy, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his\r\nhands nervously together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy must take his chance with the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Nancy,\r\nhastily; \xe2\x80\x9cand I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way,\r\nand out of yours,\xe2\x80\x94that is, if Bill comes to no harm. And if Toby got\r\nclear off, Bill\xe2\x80\x99s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill\xe2\x80\x99s worth two of Toby\r\nany time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd about what I was saying, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Jew, keeping his\r\nglistening eye steadily upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must say it all over again, if it\xe2\x80\x99s anything you want me to do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrejoined Nancy; \xe2\x80\x9cand if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow. You\r\nput me up for a minute; but now I\xe2\x80\x99m stupid again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of\r\nascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but,\r\nshe answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his\r\nsearching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a\r\ntrifle in liquor, was confirmed. Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a\r\nfailing which was very common among the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s female pupils; and in\r\nwhich, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than\r\nchecked. Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva\r\nwhich pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of\r\nthe justice of the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s supposition; and when, after indulging in the\r\ntemporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into\r\ndullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the\r\ninfluence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave\r\nutterance to various exclamations of \xe2\x80\x9cNever say die!\xe2\x80\x9d and divers\r\ncalculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a\r\nlady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable\r\nexperience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction,\r\nthat she was very far gone indeed.\r\n\r\nHaving eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his\r\ntwofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard,\r\nand of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned,\r\nMr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend\r\nasleep, with her head upon the table.\r\n\r\nIt was within an hour of midnight. The weather being dark, and piercing\r\ncold, he had no great temptation to loiter. The sharp wind that scoured\r\nthe streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and\r\nmud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance\r\nhastening fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the Jew,\r\nhowever, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as\r\nevery fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling\r\nin his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a\r\nprojecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road,\r\nglided up to him unperceived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFagin!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered a voice close to his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, turning quickly round, \xe2\x80\x9cis that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been lingering here these two\r\nhours. Where the devil have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your business, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his\r\ncompanion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cOn your business all\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, with a sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cWell; and what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncome of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing bad, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a\r\nstartled look on his companion.\r\n\r\nThe Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger,\r\ninterrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this\r\ntime arrived: remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say,\r\nunder cover: for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and\r\nthe wind blew through him.\r\n\r\nFagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking\r\nhome a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered\r\nsomething about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request\r\nin a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to\r\nclose it softly, while he got a light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as dark as the grave,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, groping forward a few steps.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake haste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut the door,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he\r\nspoke, it closed with a loud noise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other man, feeling his way. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wind\r\nblew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp\r\nwith the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in\r\nthis confounded hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. After a short absence,\r\nhe returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby\r\nCrackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in\r\nthe front one. Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can say the few words we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say in here, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nJew, throwing open a door on the first floor; \xe2\x80\x9cand as there are holes\r\nin the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we\xe2\x80\x99ll set\r\nthe candle on the stairs. There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper\r\nflight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. This done, he led\r\nthe way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a\r\nbroken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which\r\nstood behind the door. Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat\r\nhimself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the\r\narm-chair opposite, they sat face to face. It was not quite dark; the\r\ndoor was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble\r\nreflection on the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nThey conversed for some time in whispers. Though nothing of the\r\nconversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and\r\nthere, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be\r\ndefending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the\r\nlatter was in a state of considerable irritation. They might have been\r\ntalking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks\xe2\x80\x94by which\r\nname the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course\r\nof their colloquy\xe2\x80\x94said, raising his voice a little,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you again, it was badly planned. Why not have kept him here\r\namong the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at\r\nonce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly hear him!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, do you mean to say you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it, if you had chosen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded Monks, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you done it, with other boys, scores\r\nof times? If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps\r\nfor life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose turn would that have served, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Jew humbly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, submissively. \xe2\x80\x9cHe might have become of\r\nuse to me. When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only\r\nreasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my\r\ngood friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it was not easy to train him to the business,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che was not like other boys in the same circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse him, no!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the man, \xe2\x80\x9cor he would have been a thief, long\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no hold upon him to make him worse,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Jew, anxiously\r\nwatching the countenance of his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cHis hand was not in. I had\r\nnothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the\r\nbeginning, or we labour in vain. What could I do? Send him out with the\r\nDodger and Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I\r\ntrembled for us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ was not my doing,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d renewed the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel with it now;\r\nbecause, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on\r\nthe boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you\r\nwere looking for. Well! I got him back for you by means of the girl;\r\nand then _she_ begins to favour him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrottle the girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to do that just now, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew,\r\nsmiling; \xe2\x80\x9cand, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one\r\nof these days, I might be glad to have it done. I know what these girls\r\nare, Monks, well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she\xe2\x80\x99ll care no\r\nmore for him, than for a block of wood. You want him made a thief. If\r\nhe is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nJew, drawing nearer to the other,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not likely, mind,\xe2\x80\x94but if the\r\nworst comes to the worst, and he is dead\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no fault of mine if he is!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the other man, with a look\r\nof terror, and clasping the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s arm with trembling hands. \xe2\x80\x9cMind that.\r\nFagin! I had no hand in it. Anything but his death, I told you from the\r\nfirst. I won\xe2\x80\x99t shed blood; it\xe2\x80\x99s always found out, and haunts a man\r\nbesides. If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me?\r\nFire this infernal den! What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both\r\narms, as he sprung to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. \xe2\x80\x9cThe shadow! I\r\nsaw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the\r\nwainscot like a breath!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room.\r\nThe candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been\r\nplaced. It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white\r\nfaces. They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll swear I saw it!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks, trembling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was bending\r\nforward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and,\r\ntelling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs. They\r\nlooked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty. They\r\ndescended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below. The\r\ngreen damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug\r\nglistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think now?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, when they had regained the\r\npassage. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides ourselves, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a creature in the house except\r\nToby and the boys; and they\xe2\x80\x99re safe enough. See here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket;\r\nand explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them\r\nin, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.\r\n\r\nThis accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His\r\nprotestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they\r\nproceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he\r\ngave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have\r\nbeen his excited imagination. He declined any renewal of the\r\nconversation, however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was\r\npast one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. And so the amiable couple parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVII.\r\nATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY,\r\nMOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so\r\nmighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and\r\nthe skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as\r\nit might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less\r\nbecome his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a\r\nlady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and\r\naffection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming\r\nfrom such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of\r\nwhatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words\xe2\x80\x94trusting\r\nthat he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence\r\nfor those upon earth to whom high and important authority is\r\ndelegated\xe2\x80\x94hastens to pay them that respect which their position\r\ndemands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their\r\nexalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at\r\nhis hands. Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in\r\nthis place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and\r\nelucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could\r\nnot fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the\r\nright-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of\r\ntime and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting\r\nopportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that\r\na beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle,\r\nattached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official\r\ncapacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office,\r\npossessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and\r\nthat to none of those excellences, can mere companies\xe2\x80\x99 beadles, or\r\ncourt-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last,\r\nand they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest\r\nsustainable claim.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs,\r\nmade a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety\r\nthe exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats\r\nof the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times;\r\nbefore he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.\r\nThinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napproach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and\r\nvirtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his\r\ncuriousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney\xe2\x80\x99s chest\r\nof drawers.\r\n\r\nHaving listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was\r\napproaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded\r\nto make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers:\r\nwhich, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture,\r\ncarefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with\r\ndried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction. Arriving,\r\nin course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the\r\nkey), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken,\r\ngave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble\r\nreturned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old\r\nattitude, said, with a grave and determined air, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nfollowed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a\r\nwaggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with\r\nhimself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his\r\nlegs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.\r\n\r\nHe was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney,\r\nhurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a\r\nchair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the\r\nother over her heart, and gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Corney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is\r\nthis, ma\xe2\x80\x99am? Has anything happened, ma\xe2\x80\x99am? Pray answer me: I\xe2\x80\x99m on\xe2\x80\x94on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctenterhooks,\xe2\x80\x9d so he said \xe2\x80\x9cbroken bottles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Bumble!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been so dreadfully put out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut out, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bumble; \xe2\x80\x9cwho has dared to\xe2\x80\x94? I know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is them\r\nwicious paupers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful to think of!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ think of it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take something, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cA little of\r\nthe wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for the world!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Corney. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94oh! The top\r\nshelf in the right-hand corner\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x9d Uttering these words, the good lady\r\npointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from\r\ninternal spasms. Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint\r\ngreen-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a\r\ntea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m better now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,\r\nbringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeppermint,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently\r\non the beadle as she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cTry it! There\xe2\x80\x99s a little\xe2\x80\x94a little\r\nsomething else in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips;\r\ntook another taste; and put the cup down empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very comforting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Corney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much so indeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle. As he spoke, he drew a\r\nchair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to\r\ndistress her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Corney. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a foolish, excitable, weak\r\ncreetur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot weak, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little\r\ncloser. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all weak creeturs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle.\r\n\r\nNothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the\r\nexpiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by\r\nremoving his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney\xe2\x80\x99s chair, where it\r\nhad previously rested, to Mrs. Corney\xe2\x80\x99s apron-string, round which it\r\ngradually became entwined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all weak creeturs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t sigh, Mrs. Corney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Corney. And she sighed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very comfortable room, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble looking\r\nround. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother room, and this, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, would be a complete thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be too much for one,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not for two, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. \xe2\x80\x9cEh,\r\nMrs. Corney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle\r\ndrooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney\xe2\x80\x99s face. Mrs. Corney, with\r\ngreat propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at\r\nher pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr.\r\nBumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe board allows you coals, don\xe2\x80\x99t they, Mrs. Corney?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\nbeadle, affectionately pressing her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd candles,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoals, candles, and house-rent free,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mrs.\r\nCorney, what an Angel you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady was not proof against this burst of feeling. She sank into Mr.\r\nBumble\xe2\x80\x99s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a\r\npassionate kiss upon her chaste nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch porochial perfection!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t live a week, the doctor says,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the\r\nmaster of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that\r\nwacancy must be filled up. Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens!\r\nWhat a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney sobbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little word?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x94ye\xe2\x80\x94yes!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed out the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the beadle; \xe2\x80\x9ccompose your darling feelings for only\r\none more. When is it to come off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed. At length\r\nsummoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and\r\nsaid, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nirresistible duck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract\r\nwas solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture;\r\nwhich was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s spirits. While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr.\r\nBumble with the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s decease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call at\r\nSowerberry\xe2\x80\x99s as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning. Was\r\nit that as frightened you, love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything particular, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady evasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been something, love,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell\r\nyour own B.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the lady; \xe2\x80\x9cone of these days. After we\xe2\x80\x99re married,\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter we\xe2\x80\x99re married!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any impudence\r\nfrom any of them male paupers as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, love!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the lady, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I thought it was,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Bumble; \xe2\x80\x9cif I thought as any one\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have dared to do it, love,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had better not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see\r\nany man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I\r\ncan tell him that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it a second time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed\r\nno very high compliment to the lady\xe2\x80\x99s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble\r\naccompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched\r\nwith this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration,\r\nthat he was indeed a dove.\r\n\r\nThe dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat;\r\nand, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future\r\npartner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing,\r\nfor a few minutes, in the male paupers\xe2\x80\x99 ward, to abuse them a little,\r\nwith the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of\r\nworkhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications,\r\nMr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of\r\nhis future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached\r\nthe shop of the undertaker.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and\r\nNoah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a\r\ngreater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient\r\nperformance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was\r\nnot closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up. Mr.\r\nBumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but,\r\nattracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the\r\nglass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made\r\nbold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what\r\nwas going forward, he was not a little surprised.\r\n\r\nThe cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and\r\nbutter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the\r\nupper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an\r\neasy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open\r\nclasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other.\r\nClose beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which\r\nMr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity. A more\r\nthan ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and\r\na kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight\r\ndegree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish\r\nwith which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong\r\nappreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever,\r\ncould have sufficiently accounted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x9ctry him, do;\r\nonly this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a delicious thing is a oyster!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr. Claypole, after he\r\nhad swallowed it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity it is, a number of \xe2\x80\x99em should ever make\r\nyou feel uncomfortable; isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Charlotte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite a cruelty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d acquiesced Mr. Claypole. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99t yer fond of oysters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot overmuch,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x9cI like to see you eat \xe2\x80\x99em, Noah\r\ndear, better than eating \xe2\x80\x99em myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, reflectively; \xe2\x80\x9chow queer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave another,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s one with such a beautiful,\r\ndelicate beard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t manage any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry. Come here,\r\nCharlotte, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cSay that again, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron. Mr.\r\nClaypole, without making any further change in his position than\r\nsuffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare\r\nyou mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him, you\r\ninsolent minx? Kiss her!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, blubbering. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\na-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Noah,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Charlotte, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer are; yer know yer are!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s always a-doin\xe2\x80\x99 of\r\nit, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and\r\nmakes all manner of love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cTake yourself downstairs, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\nNoah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes\r\nhome, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr.\r\nBumble said he was to send a old woman\xe2\x80\x99s shell after breakfast\r\nto-morrow morning. Do you hear sir? Kissing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bumble, holding\r\nup his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this\r\nporochial district is frightful! If Parliament don\xe2\x80\x99t take their\r\nabominable courses under consideration, this country\xe2\x80\x99s ruined, and the\r\ncharacter of the peasantry gone for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d With these words, the beadle\r\nstrode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s premises.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have\r\nmade all necessary preparations for the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, let us set\r\non foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether\r\nhe be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nLOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWolves tear your throats!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish\r\nI was among some of you; you\xe2\x80\x99d howl the hoarser for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate\r\nferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body\r\nof the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an\r\ninstant, to look back at his pursuers.\r\n\r\nThere was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud\r\nshouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the\r\nneighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, you white-livered hound!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the robber, shouting after Toby\r\nCrackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. For he\r\nwas not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot;\r\nand Sikes was in no mood to be played with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear a hand with the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his\r\nconfederate. \xe2\x80\x9cCome back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for\r\nwant of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuicker!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and\r\ndrawing a pistol from his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t play booty with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the noise grew louder. Sikes, again looking round, could\r\ndiscern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate\r\nof the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some\r\npaces in advance of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all up, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Toby; \xe2\x80\x9cdrop the kid, and show \xe2\x80\x99em your\r\nheels.\xe2\x80\x9d With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of\r\nbeing shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his\r\nenemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed. Sikes\r\nclenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form\r\nof Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along\r\nthe front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those\r\nbehind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before\r\nanother hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol\r\nhigh into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, ho, there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a tremulous voice in the rear. \xe2\x80\x9cPincher!\r\nNeptune! Come here, come here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no\r\nparticular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily\r\nanswered to the command. Three men, who had by this time advanced some\r\ndistance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nfattest man of the party, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we \xe2\x80\x99mediately go home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nshorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very\r\npale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the third,\r\nwho had called the dogs back, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Giles ought to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the shorter man; \xe2\x80\x9cand whatever Mr. Giles says, it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t our place to contradict him. No, no, I know my sitiwation! Thank\r\nmy stars, I know my sitiwation.\xe2\x80\x9d To tell the truth, the little man\r\n_did_ seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it\r\nwas by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are afraid, Brittles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI an\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brittles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brittles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a lie, Brittles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles.\r\n\r\nNow, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s taunt; and Mr. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of\r\ngoing home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment. The\r\nthird man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re all afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak for yourself, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s natural and proper to be afraid,\r\nunder such circumstances. I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brittles; \xe2\x80\x9conly there\xe2\x80\x99s no call to tell a man he is, so\r\nbounceably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that _he_\r\nwas afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again\r\nwith the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest\r\nwind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely\r\ninsisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a\r\nman will do, when his blood is up. I should have committed murder\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow I should\xe2\x80\x94if we\xe2\x80\x99d caught one of them rascals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as\r\ntheir blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued\r\nupon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles; \xe2\x80\x9cit was the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if it was,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Brittles, catching at the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may depend upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, \xe2\x80\x9cthat that gate stopped the flow\r\nof the excitement. I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was\r\nclimbing over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the\r\nsame unpleasant sensation at that precise moment. It was quite obvious,\r\ntherefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt\r\nregarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all\r\nthree remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the\r\ninstant of its occurance.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the\r\nburglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse,\r\nand who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in\r\nthe pursuit. Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and\r\nsteward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work:\r\nwho, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a\r\npromising young boy still, though he was something past thirty.\r\n\r\nEncouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very\r\nclose together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round,\r\nwhenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried\r\nback to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its\r\nlight should inform the thieves in what direction to fire. Catching up\r\nthe light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot;\r\nand long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the\r\nlight might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like\r\nsome exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was\r\nswiftly borne.\r\n\r\nThe air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along\r\nthe ground like a dense cloud of smoke. The grass was wet; the\r\npathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of\r\nan unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning. Still,\r\nOliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMorning drew on apace. The air become more sharp and piercing, as its\r\nfirst dull hue\xe2\x80\x94the death of night, rather than the birth of\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94glimmered faintly in the sky. The objects which had looked dim and\r\nterrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually\r\nresolved into their familiar shapes. The rain came down, thick and\r\nfast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes. But, Oliver felt\r\nit not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless\r\nand unconscious, on his bed of clay.\r\n\r\nAt length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and\r\nuttering it, the boy awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl,\r\nhung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with\r\nblood. He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a\r\nsitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help,\r\nand groaned with pain. Trembling in every joint, from cold and\r\nexhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from\r\nhead to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long\r\nplunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which\r\nseemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon\r\nhis feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to\r\nand fro like a drunken man. But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his\r\nhead drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew\r\nnot whither.\r\n\r\nAnd now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his\r\nmind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were\r\nangrily disputing\xe2\x80\x94for the very words they said, sounded in his ears;\r\nand when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some\r\nviolent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was\r\ntalking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the\r\nprevious day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of\r\nfirearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights\r\ngleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand\r\nbore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an\r\nundefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented\r\nhim incessantly.\r\n\r\nThus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars\r\nof gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he\r\nreached a road. Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house,\r\nwhich perhaps he could reach. Pitying his condition, they might have\r\ncompassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought,\r\nto die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields. He summoned\r\nup all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps\r\ntowards it.\r\n\r\nAs he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had\r\nseen it before. He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and\r\naspect of the building seemed familiar to him.\r\n\r\nThat garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last\r\nnight, and prayed the two men\xe2\x80\x99s mercy. It was the very house they had\r\nattempted to rob.\r\n\r\nOliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that,\r\nfor the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of\r\nflight. Flight! He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full\r\npossession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame,\r\nwhither could he fly? He pushed against the garden-gate; it was\r\nunlocked, and swung open on its hinges. He tottered across the lawn;\r\nclimbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength\r\nfailing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little\r\nportico.\r\n\r\nIt happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker,\r\nwere recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the\r\nnight, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it was Mr.\r\nGiles\xe2\x80\x99s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants:\r\ntowards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty\r\naffability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of\r\nhis superior position in society. But, death, fires, and burglary, make\r\nall men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the\r\nkitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his\r\nright, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the\r\nrobbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid,\r\nwho were of the party) listened with breathless interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was about half-past two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles, \xe2\x80\x9cor I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t swear that\r\nit mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and,\r\nturning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned\r\nround in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him\r\nto imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the\r\nhousemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker,\r\nwho pretended not to hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Heerd a noise,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cI says, at first, \xe2\x80\x98This is\r\nillusion\xe2\x80\x99; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the\r\nnoise again, distinct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a noise?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA kind of a busting noise,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsuggested Brittles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Giles; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, at this\r\ntime, it had a busting sound. I turned down the clothes\xe2\x80\x9d; continued\r\nGiles, rolling back the table-cloth, \xe2\x80\x9csat up in bed; and listened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated \xe2\x80\x9cLor!\xe2\x80\x9d and drew their\r\nchairs closer together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heerd it now, quite apparent,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr. Giles. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Somebody,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98is forcing of a door, or window; what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? I\xe2\x80\x99ll call up\r\nthat poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed;\r\nor his throat,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98may be cut from his right ear to his left,\r\nwithout his ever knowing it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the\r\nspeaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face\r\nexpressive of the most unmitigated horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tossed off the clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth,\r\nand looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, \xe2\x80\x9cgot softly out of\r\nbed; drew on a pair of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies present, Mr. Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the tinker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Of _shoes_, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great\r\nemphasis on the word; \xe2\x80\x9cseized the loaded pistol that always goes\r\nupstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brittles,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, when I had woke him, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you did,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Brittles, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re dead men, I think, Brittles,\xe2\x80\x99 I says,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Giles; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Was_ he frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was as firm\xe2\x80\x94ah! pretty near\r\nas firm as I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have died at once, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, if it had been me,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\r\nhousemaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrittles is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfrom a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a\r\ndark lantern that was standing on Brittle\xe2\x80\x99s hob, and groped our way\r\ndownstairs in the pitch dark,\xe2\x80\x94as it might be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes\r\nshut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he\r\nstarted violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried\r\nback to his chair. The cook and housemaid screamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a knock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. \xe2\x80\x9cOpen the\r\ndoor, somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in\r\nthe morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded\r\nhim, and looking very blank himself; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the door must be opened. Do\r\nyou hear, somebody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being\r\nnaturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that\r\nthe inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he\r\ntendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the\r\ntinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep. The women were out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Giles, after a short silence, \xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to make one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nBrittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat\r\nre-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that\r\nit was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.\r\nThe two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear. By\r\nthe advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any\r\nevil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by\r\na master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same\r\ningenious gentleman, the dogs\xe2\x80\x99 tails were well pinched, in the hall, to\r\nmake them bark savagely.\r\n\r\nThese precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the\r\ntinker\xe2\x80\x99s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and\r\ngave the word of command to open the door. Brittles obeyed; the group,\r\npeeping timorously over each other\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, beheld no more\r\nformidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and\r\nexhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the\r\nbackground. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x94Why\xe2\x80\x94Brittles\xe2\x80\x94look\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver,\r\nthan he uttered a loud cry. Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and\r\none arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the\r\nhall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up\r\nthe staircase; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s one of the thieves, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a thief, miss!\r\nWounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94In a lantern, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of\r\nhis mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.\r\n\r\nThe two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.\r\nGiles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in\r\nendeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be\r\nhanged. In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a\r\nsweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the voice from the stair-head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened, miss; I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t much injured. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a very desperate resistance, miss! I\r\nwas soon too many for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young lady; \xe2\x80\x9cyou frighten my aunt as much as the\r\nthieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWounded desperate, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Giles, with indescribable\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks as if he was a-going, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d bawled Brittles, in the same\r\nmanner as before. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to come and look at him, miss, in\r\ncase he should?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, pray; there\xe2\x80\x99s a good man!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWait quietly only\r\none instant, while I speak to aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped\r\naway. She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was\r\nto be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s room; and that\r\nBrittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to\r\nChertsey: from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a\r\nconstable and doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t you take one look at him, first, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Giles,\r\nwith as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he\r\nhad skilfully brought down. \xe2\x80\x9cNot one little peep, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now, for the world,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow! Oh!\r\ntreat him kindly, Giles for my sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a\r\nglance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then,\r\nbending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and\r\nsolicitude of a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIX.\r\nHAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH\r\nOLIVER RESORTED\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of\r\nold-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at\r\na well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care\r\nin a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his\r\nstation some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table;\r\nand, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back,\r\nand inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and\r\nhis right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by\r\nhis side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very\r\nagreeable sense of his own merits and importance.\r\n\r\nOf the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed\r\noaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed\r\nwith the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone\r\ncostume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which\r\nrather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its\r\neffect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the\r\ntable before her. Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their\r\nbrightness) were attentively upon her young companion.\r\n\r\nThe younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood;\r\nat that age, when, if ever angels be for God\xe2\x80\x99s good purposes enthroned\r\nin mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in\r\nsuch as hers.\r\n\r\nShe was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so\r\nmild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her\r\nelement, nor its rough creatures her fit companions. The very\r\nintelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her\r\nnoble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the\r\nchanging expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights\r\nthat played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the\r\nsmile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside\r\npeace and happiness.\r\n\r\nShe was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to\r\nraise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put\r\nback her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into\r\nher beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless\r\nloveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old\r\nlady, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour and twelve minutes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Giles, referring to a\r\nsilver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is always slow,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrittles always was a slow boy, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the attendant. And\r\nseeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of\r\nthirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a\r\nfast one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gets worse instead of better, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other\r\nboys,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, smiling.\r\n\r\nMr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a\r\nrespectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out\r\nof which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door:\r\nand who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process,\r\nburst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the\r\nbreakfast-table together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of such a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the fat gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nMrs. Maylie\xe2\x80\x94bless my soul\xe2\x80\x94in the silence of the night, too\xe2\x80\x94I _never_\r\nheard of such a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands\r\nwith both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fat\r\ngentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you send? Bless me, my man should have come in a\r\nminute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or\r\nanybody, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, under such circumstances. Dear, dear! So unexpected!\r\nIn the silence of the night, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having\r\nbeen unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the\r\nestablished custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact\r\nbusiness at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two\r\nprevious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Miss Rose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, turning to the young lady, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! very much so, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, interrupting him; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is\r\na poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cso there is. That was your\r\nhandiwork, Giles, I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights,\r\nblushed very red, and said that he had had that honour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonour, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nhonourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at\r\ntwelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve fought a duel,\r\nGiles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust\r\nattempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was\r\nnot for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it\r\nwas no joke to the opposite party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad, that\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he? Show me the way.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That\xe2\x80\x99s the little\r\nwindow that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTalking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is\r\ngoing upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a\r\nsurgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles\r\nround as \xe2\x80\x9cthe doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d had grown fat, more from good-humour than from\r\ngood living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old\r\nbachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had\r\nanticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom\r\nbell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs\r\nperpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something\r\nimportant was going on above. At length he returned; and in reply to an\r\nanxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed\r\nthe door, carefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor,\r\nstanding with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not in danger, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the\r\ncircumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cthough I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is. Have\r\nyou seen the thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor heard anything about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, interposed Mr. Giles; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was going to\r\ntell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his\r\nmind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. Such commendations had\r\nbeen bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him,\r\nhelp postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during\r\nwhich he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for\r\nundaunted courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRose wished to see the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing very alarming in his\r\nappearance. Have you any objection to see him in my presence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old lady, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I think it is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cat all events, I am\r\nquite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you\r\npostponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nRose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my\r\nhonour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXX.\r\nRELATES WHAT OLIVER\xe2\x80\x99S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nWith many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised\r\nin the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\nthrough one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie,\r\nled them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of\r\na bedroom-door, \xe2\x80\x9clet us hear what you think of him. He has not been\r\nshaved very recently, but he don\xe2\x80\x99t look at all ferocious\r\nnotwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in visiting\r\norder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStepping before them, he looked into the room. Motioning them to\r\nadvance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back\r\nthe curtains of the bed. Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged\r\nruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with\r\npain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound\r\nand splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon\r\nthe other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed\r\nover the pillow.\r\n\r\nThe honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a\r\nminute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the\r\nyounger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the\r\nbedside, gathered Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s hair from his face. As she stooped over him,\r\nher tears fell upon his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity\r\nand compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection\r\nhe had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of\r\nwater in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a\r\nfamiliar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes\r\nthat never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some\r\nbrief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have\r\nawakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the elder lady. \xe2\x80\x9cThis poor child can\r\nnever have been the pupil of robbers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, \xe2\x80\x9ctakes up her abode in\r\nmany temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut at so early an age!\xe2\x80\x9d urged Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his\r\nhead; \xe2\x80\x9ccrime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered\r\nalone. The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, can you\xe2\x80\x94oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has\r\nbeen the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRose.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared\r\nit was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the\r\npatient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut even if he has been wicked,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cthink how young he is;\r\nthink that he may never have known a mother\xe2\x80\x99s love, or the comfort of a\r\nhome; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven\r\nhim to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for\r\nmercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child\r\nto a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of\r\namendment. Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want\r\nof parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done\r\nso, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor\r\nchild, have pity upon him before it is too late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear love,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to\r\nher bosom, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I would harm a hair of his head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, surely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady; \xe2\x80\x9cmy days are drawing to their close:\r\nand may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to\r\nsave him, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me think, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9clet me think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns\r\nup and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his\r\ntoes, and frowning frightfully. After various exclamations of \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nit now\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cno, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d and as many renewals of the walking and\r\nfrowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles,\r\nand that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful\r\nfellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a\r\nthousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t object to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless there is some other way of preserving the child,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs.\r\nMaylie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no other,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cNo other, take my word for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my aunt invests you with full power,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, smiling through\r\nher tears; \xe2\x80\x9cbut pray don\xe2\x80\x99t be harder upon the poor fellows than is\r\nindispensably necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to think,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat everybody is disposed\r\nto be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for\r\nthe sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as\r\nvulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow\r\nwho appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that\r\nI might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for\r\ndoing so, as the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rose,\r\nblushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, laughing heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is no very difficult\r\nmatter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is\r\nyet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I\r\nhave told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse\r\nwith him without danger. Now I make this stipulation\xe2\x80\x94that I shall\r\nexamine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we\r\njudge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he\r\nis a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall\r\nbe left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at\r\nall events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cIs is a bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot be hardened in vice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose; \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cthen so much the more reason for\r\nacceding to my proposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down\r\nto wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.\r\n\r\nThe patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial\r\nthan Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed\r\non, and still Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before\r\nthe kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at\r\nlength sufficiently restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he\r\nsaid, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled\r\nwith anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give\r\nhim the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next\r\nmorning: which he should otherwise have done.\r\n\r\nThe conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history,\r\nand was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a\r\nsolemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the\r\nsick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which\r\nhard men had brought upon him. Oh! if when we oppress and grind our\r\nfellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of\r\nhuman error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it\r\nis true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance\r\non our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep\r\ntestimony of dead men\xe2\x80\x99s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride\r\nshut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering,\r\nmisery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day\xe2\x80\x99s life brings with it!\r\n\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness\r\nand virtue watched him as he slept. He felt calm and happy, and could\r\nhave died without a murmur.\r\n\r\nThe momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to\r\nrest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them\r\nfor being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr.\r\nGiles. And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that\r\nhe could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the\r\nkitchen; so into the kitchen he went.\r\n\r\nThere were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament,\r\nthe women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had\r\nreceived a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of\r\nthe day, in consideration of his services), and the constable. The\r\nlatter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and\r\nlarge half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a\r\nproportionate allowance of ale\xe2\x80\x94as indeed he had.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for\r\nMr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor\r\nentered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating\r\neverything, before his superior said it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit still!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, waving his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cMisses wished some ale to be given\r\nout, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir,\r\nand was disposed for company, I am taking mine among \xe2\x80\x99em here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen\r\ngenerally were understood to express the gratification they derived\r\nfrom Mr. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a\r\npatronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved\r\nproperly, he would never desert them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the patient to-night, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Giles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo-so\xe2\x80\x9d; returned the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you have got yourself into a\r\nscrape there, Mr. Giles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles, trembling, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the\r\nplate in the county, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the point,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, mysteriously. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Giles, are\r\nyou a Protestant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are _you_, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, turning sharply upon\r\nBrittles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless me, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Brittles, starting violently; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the\r\nsame as Mr. Giles, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell me this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cboth of you, both of you! Are\r\nyou going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is\r\nthe boy that was put through the little window last night? Out with it!\r\nCome! We are prepared for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered\r\ncreatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger,\r\nthat Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and\r\nexcitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay attention to the reply, constable, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor,\r\nshaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the\r\nbridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nutmost acuteness. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething may come of this before long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of\r\noffice: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a simple question of identity, you will observe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the constable, coughing with great\r\nviolence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had\r\ngone the wrong way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the house broken into,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cand a couple of men\r\ncatch one moment\xe2\x80\x99s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke,\r\nand in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a boy comes to\r\nthat very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his\r\narm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him\xe2\x80\x94by doing which, they\r\nplace his life in great danger\xe2\x80\x94and swear he is the thief. Now, the\r\nquestion is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in\r\nwhat situation do they place themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t law, he would\r\nbe glad to know what was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask you again,\xe2\x80\x9d thundered the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9care you, on your solemn\r\noaths, able to identify that boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at\r\nBrittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the\r\nreply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the\r\ndoctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at\r\nthe same moment, the sound of wheels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the runners!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe what?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bow Street officers, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Brittles, taking up a candle;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cme and Mr. Giles sent for \xe2\x80\x99em this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Brittles; \xe2\x80\x9cI sent a message up by the coachman, and I\r\nonly wonder they weren\xe2\x80\x99t here before, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did, did you? Then confound your\xe2\x80\x94slow coaches down here; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, walking away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXI.\r\nINVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with\r\nthe chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a man outside; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the officers from Bow\r\nStreet, as was sent to to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full\r\nwidth, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in,\r\nwithout saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly\r\nas if he lived there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe officer; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have you got a coach\r\n\xe2\x80\x99us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building,\r\nthe portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his\r\ncompanion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of\r\ngreat admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being\r\nshown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed\r\nlike what they were.\r\n\r\nThe man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle\r\nheight, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close;\r\nhalf-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes. The other was a\r\nred-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured\r\ncountenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nstouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on\r\nthe table. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Good-evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you\r\nin private, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that\r\ngentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and\r\nshut the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the lady of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards\r\nMrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\nMr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on\r\nthe floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The\r\nlatter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good\r\nsociety, or quite so much at his ease in it\xe2\x80\x94one of the two\xe2\x80\x94seated\r\nhimself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and\r\nthe head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, with regard to this here robbery, master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blathers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nare the circumstances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at\r\ngreat length, and with much circumlocution. Messrs. Blathers and Duff\r\nlooked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBlathers; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my opinion at once is,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind committing myself to\r\nthat extent,\xe2\x80\x94that this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Duff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I\r\napprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a\r\ncountryman?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, master,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Blathers. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is all about the robbery,\r\nis it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking\r\non?\xe2\x80\x9d said Blathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the frightened servants\r\nchose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this\r\nattempt to break into the house; but it\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense: sheer absurdity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWery easy disposed of, if it is,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Duff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat he says is quite correct,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Blathers, nodding his head in\r\na confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if\r\nthey were a pair of castanets. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is the boy? What account does he\r\ngive of himself? Where did he come from? He didn\xe2\x80\x99t drop out of the\r\nclouds, did he, master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two\r\nladies. \xe2\x80\x9cI know his whole history: but we can talk about that\r\npresently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves\r\nmade their attempt, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Blathers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had better inspect the premises\r\nfirst, and examine the servants afterwards. That\xe2\x80\x99s the usual way of\r\ndoing business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by\r\nthe native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short,\r\nwent into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at\r\nthe window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in\r\nat the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the\r\nshutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with;\r\nand after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with. This done, amidst\r\nthe breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr.\r\nGiles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of\r\ntheir share in the previous night\xe2\x80\x99s adventures: which they performed\r\nsome six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one\r\nimportant respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the\r\nlast. This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the\r\nroom, and held a long council together, compared with which, for\r\nsecrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest\r\npoint in medicine, would be mere child\xe2\x80\x99s play.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy\r\nstate; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, making a halt, after a great number of very\r\nrapid turns, \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cthe poor child\xe2\x80\x99s story, faithfully repeated to\r\nthese men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it, my dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal\r\nfunctionaries of a higher grade. What is he, after all, they would say?\r\nA runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his\r\nstory is a very doubtful one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe it, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for\r\ndoing so,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is exactly the\r\ntale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, my pretty cross-examiner,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor: \xe2\x80\x9cbecause,\r\nviewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can\r\nonly prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.\r\nConfound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and\r\nwill take nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been\r\nthe companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a\r\npolice-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s pocket; he has\r\nbeen taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s house, to a place\r\nwhich he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he\r\nhas not the remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who\r\nseem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and\r\nis put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very\r\nmoment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing\r\nthat would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a\r\nblundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose\r\nto prevent his doing any good for himself! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose, smiling at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpetuosity; \xe2\x80\x9cbut still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the\r\npoor child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cof course not! Bless the bright eyes of your\r\nsex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any\r\nquestion; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his\r\nhands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even\r\ngreater rapidity than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more I think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cthe more I see that it will\r\noccasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in\r\npossession of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s real story. I am certain it will not be\r\nbelieved; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the\r\ndragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will\r\nbe cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan\r\nof rescuing him from misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear! why did they send\r\nfor these people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not have had them here,\r\nfor the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind\r\nof desperate calmness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we must try and carry it off with a bold\r\nface. The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. The boy\r\nhas strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be\r\ntalked to any more; that\xe2\x80\x99s one comfort. We must make the best of it;\r\nand if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blathers, entering the room followed by his\r\ncolleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t a put-up thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what the devil\xe2\x80\x99s a put-up thing?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the doctor,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe call it a put-up robbery, ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blathers, turning to them,\r\nas if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen the servants is in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody suspected them, in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWery likely not, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Blathers; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they might have been\r\nin it, for all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore likely on that wery account,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe find it was a town hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blathers, continuing his report;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor the style of work is first-rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWery pretty indeed it is,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Duff, in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was two of \xe2\x80\x99em in it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Blathers; \xe2\x80\x9cand they had a boy\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em; that\xe2\x80\x99s plain from the size of the window. That\xe2\x80\x99s all to be\r\nsaid at present. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see this lad that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got upstairs at once,\r\nif you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rose, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it\r\nimmediately, if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, thank you, miss!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across\r\nhis mouth; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink that\xe2\x80\x99s handy,\r\nmiss; don\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall it be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor, following the young lady to the\r\nsideboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little drop of spirits, master, if it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nBlathers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a cold ride from London, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; and I always find that\r\nspirits comes home warmer to the feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who\r\nreceived it very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the\r\ndoctor slipped out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but\r\ngrasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand:\r\nand placing it in front of his chest; \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen a good many pieces\r\nof business like this, in my time, ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nDuff, assisting his colleague\xe2\x80\x99s memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was something in this way, warn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Blathers;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always gave that to him\xe2\x80\x9d replied Duff. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the Family Pet, I\r\ntell you. Conkey hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any more to do with it than I had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Blathers; \xe2\x80\x9cI know better. Do you mind that time\r\nwhen Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was!\r\nBetter than any novel-book _I_ ever see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of\r\ngood-humour in the unwelcome visitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down\r\nupon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blathers. \xe2\x80\x9cThis here Conkey Chickweed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConkey means Nosey, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Duff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course the lady knows that, don\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Blathers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey Chickweed,\r\nmiss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar,\r\nwhere a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and\r\nbadger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was\r\nconducted in, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen \xe2\x80\x99em off\xe2\x80\x99en. He warn\xe2\x80\x99t one of the family, at\r\nthat time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom\r\nin the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye,\r\nwho had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the\r\nrobbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high. He was\r\nwery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a\r\nblunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a\r\nhue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about \xe2\x80\x99em, found that\r\nConkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way\r\nto some palings a good distance off; and there they lost \xe2\x80\x99em. However,\r\nhe had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr.\r\nChickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other\r\nbankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state\r\nof mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or\r\nfour days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many\r\npeople was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day\r\nhe came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview\r\nwith the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and\r\norders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go\r\nand assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see him, Spyers,\xe2\x80\x99 said Chickweed, \xe2\x80\x98pass my house yesterday morning,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you up, and collar him!\xe2\x80\x99 says Spyers. \xe2\x80\x98I was so struck all\r\nof a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays the poor man; \xe2\x80\x98but we\xe2\x80\x99re sure to have him; for between ten and\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night he passed again.\xe2\x80\x99 Spyers no sooner heard this,\r\nthan he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he\r\nshould have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself\r\ndown at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain,\r\nwith his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. He was\r\nsmoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed\r\nroars out, \xe2\x80\x98Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!\xe2\x80\x99 Jem Spyers dashes out; and\r\nthere he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry. Away goes\r\nSpyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thieves!\xe2\x80\x99 and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like\r\nmad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots\r\nround; sees a little crowd; dives in; \xe2\x80\x98Which is the man?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98D\xe2\x80\x94me!\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nChickweed, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost him again!\xe2\x80\x99 It was a remarkable occurrence, but\r\nhe warn\xe2\x80\x99t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house.\r\nNext morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind\r\nthe curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his\r\nown two eyes ached again. At last, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help shutting \xe2\x80\x99em, to\r\nease \xe2\x80\x99em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed\r\na-roaring out, \xe2\x80\x98Here he is!\xe2\x80\x99 Off he starts once more, with Chickweed\r\nhalf-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as\r\nthe yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s one, the man\xe2\x80\x99s lost again! This was done, once or twice\r\nmore, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been\r\nrobbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and\r\nthe other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Jem Spyers say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the doctor; who had returned to the\r\nroom shortly after the commencement of the story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJem Spyers,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a long time said nothing at\r\nall, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he\r\nunderstood his business. But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and\r\ntaking out his snuffbox, says \xe2\x80\x98Chickweed, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found out who done this\r\nhere robbery.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Have you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Chickweed. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear Spyers, only\r\nlet me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers,\r\nwhere is the villain!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 said Spyers, offering him a pinch of\r\nsnuff, \xe2\x80\x98none of that gammon! You did it yourself.\xe2\x80\x99 So he had; and a\r\ngood bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have\r\nfound it out, if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so precious anxious to keep up\r\nappearances!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and\r\nclinking the handcuffs together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery curious, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, if you please, you\r\ncan walk upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _you_ please, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Blathers. Closely following Mr.\r\nLosberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom; Mr. Giles\r\npreceding the party, with a lighted candle.\r\n\r\nOliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he\r\nhad appeared yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in\r\nbed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all\r\nunderstanding what was going forward\xe2\x80\x94in fact, without seeming to\r\nrecollect where he was, or what had been passing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence\r\nnotwithstanding, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a\r\nspring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d\xe2\x80\x99 ye-call-him\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this\r\nmorning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that\r\ningenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his\r\nlife in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMessrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus\r\nrecommended to their notice. The bewildered butler gazed from them\r\ntowards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most\r\nludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to deny that, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, laying\r\nOliver gently down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all done for the\xe2\x80\x94for the best, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure\r\nI thought it was the boy, or I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have meddled with him. I am not\r\nof an inhuman disposition, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThought it was what boy?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the senior officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe housebreaker\xe2\x80\x99s boy, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x94they certainly had\r\na boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Do you think so now?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Blathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink what, now?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink it\xe2\x80\x99s the same boy, Stupid-head?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Blathers, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, with a rueful\r\ncountenance. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swear to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Blathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied poor Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is\r\nthe boy; indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99m almost certain that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. You know it can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas this man been a-drinking, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Blathers, turning to the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a precious muddle-headed chap you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Duff, addressing Mr.\r\nGiles, with supreme contempt.\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne had been feeling the patient\xe2\x80\x99s pulse during this short\r\ndialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked,\r\nthat if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would\r\nperhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.\r\n\r\nActing upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring\r\napartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and\r\nhis respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions\r\nand impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on\r\nanything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed,\r\nhis declarations that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know the real boy, if he were put\r\nbefore him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he,\r\nbecause Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes\r\npreviously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much\r\nafraid he had been a little too hasty.\r\n\r\nAmong other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether\r\nMr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow\r\npistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more\r\ndestructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which\r\nmade a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had\r\ndrawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it\r\nmake a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after\r\nlabouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a\r\nfellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to\r\nthe utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very\r\nmuch about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took\r\nup their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nWith the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were\r\nin the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under\r\nsuspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff\r\njourneyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving\r\nthemselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been\r\ndiscovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is\r\nonly punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the\r\nEnglish law, and its comprehensive love of all the King\xe2\x80\x99s subjects,\r\nheld to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence,\r\nthat the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with\r\nviolence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the\r\npunishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise\r\nas they went.\r\n\r\nIn short, after some more examination, and a great deal more\r\nconversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the\r\njoint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s appearance if\r\nhe should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded\r\nwith a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the\r\nsubject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature\r\nconsideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that\r\nthe burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the\r\nformer being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the\r\ngreat Mr. Conkey Chickweed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care\r\nof Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. If fervent\r\nprayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x94and if they be not, what prayers are!\xe2\x80\x94the blessings which the\r\norphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing\r\npeace and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXII.\r\nOF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s ailings were neither slight nor few. In addition to the pain\r\nand delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold\r\nhad brought on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and\r\nreduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get\r\nbetter, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how\r\ndeeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently\r\nhe hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something\r\nto show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the\r\nlove and duty with which his breast was full; something, however\r\nslight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not\r\nbeen cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued\r\nfrom misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly\r\nendeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale\r\nlips; \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. We\r\nare going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall\r\naccompany us. The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and\r\nbeauties of spring, will restore you in a few days. We will employ you\r\nin a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trouble!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear lady, if I could but work for\r\nyou; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or\r\nwatching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make\r\nyou happy; what would I give to do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall give nothing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Maylie, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, as I\r\ntold you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only\r\ntake half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make\r\nme very happy indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver; \xe2\x80\x9chow kind of you to say so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will make me happier than I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young lady.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing\r\nany one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an\r\nunspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness\r\nand compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence,\r\nwould delight me, more than you can well imagine. Do you understand\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, watching Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtful face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was thinking that\r\nI am ungrateful now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care\r\nof me before,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they knew how happy I am, they\r\nwould be pleased, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure they would,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s benefactress; \xe2\x80\x9cand Mr.\r\nLosberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well\r\nenough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the\r\nfatigue of this expedition. One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out,\r\naccordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. When\r\nthey came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a\r\nloud exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor, as usual, all in a\r\nbustle. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see anything\xe2\x80\x94hear anything\xe2\x80\x94feel anything\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; well, what of it? Stop coachman. Pull up here,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of the house, my man; eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thieves\xe2\x80\x94the house they took me to!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil it is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cHallo, there! let me out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled\r\nout of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the\r\ndeserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa?\xe2\x80\x9d said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so\r\nsuddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick,\r\nnearly fell forward into the passage. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreflection. \xe2\x80\x9cA good deal. Robbery is the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be Murder the matter, too,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hump-backed man,\r\ncoolly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t take your hands off. Do you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94confound the fellow, what\xe2\x80\x99s his rascally name\xe2\x80\x94Sikes; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nit. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Sikes, you thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and\r\nindignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the\r\nhouse. Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed\r\ninto the parlour, without a word of parley.\r\n\r\nHe looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige\r\nof anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the\r\ncupboards; answered Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s description!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do\r\nyou mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to\r\nrob me, or to murder me? Which is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair,\r\nyou ridiculous old vampire?\xe2\x80\x9d said the irritable doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, then?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the hunchback. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you take\r\nyourself off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I think proper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other\r\nparlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s account of it. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall find you out, some day, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you?\xe2\x80\x9d sneered the ill-favoured cripple. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ever want me, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhere. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty\r\nyears, to be scared by you. You shall pay for this; you shall pay for\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and\r\ndanced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid enough, this,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the doctor to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cthe boy must\r\nhave made a mistake. Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself\r\nup again.\xe2\x80\x9d With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money,\r\nand returned to the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations\r\nand curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the\r\ndriver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant\r\nwith a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and\r\nvindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months\r\nafterwards. He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until\r\nthe driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their\r\nway, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the\r\nground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an ass!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, after a long silence. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you know\r\nthat before, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t forget it another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn ass,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor again, after a further silence of some\r\nminutes. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if it had been the right place, and the right fellows\r\nhad been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had\r\nassistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my\r\nown exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I\r\nhave hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though.\r\nI am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on\r\nimpulse. It might have done me good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon\r\nanything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment\r\nto the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from\r\nbeing involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the\r\nwarmest respect and esteem of all who knew him. If the truth must be\r\ntold, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being\r\ndisappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s story on\r\nthe very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any. He\r\nsoon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s replies to\r\nhis questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still\r\ndelivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever\r\nbeen, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that\r\ntime forth.\r\n\r\nAs Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided,\r\nthey were enabled to drive straight thither. When the coach turned into\r\nit, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my boy, which house is it?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Losberne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat! That!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nwhite house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should\r\ndie: it makes me tremble so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwill see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I hope so!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were so good to me; so very, very\r\ngood to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next\r\ndoor. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at\r\nthe windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.\r\n\r\nAlas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Let.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnock at the next door,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s arm in\r\nhis. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the\r\nadjoining house, do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant did not know; but would go and inquire. She presently\r\nreturned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone\r\nto the West Indies, six weeks before. Oliver clasped his hands, and\r\nsank feebly backward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas his housekeeper gone too?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir\xe2\x80\x9d; replied the servant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old gentleman, the housekeeper,\r\nand a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow\xe2\x80\x99s, all went together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen turn towards home again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Losberne to the driver; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded\r\nLondon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe book-stall keeper, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the way there. See\r\nhim, pray, sir! Do see him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndoctor. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite enough for both of us. If we go to the book-stall\r\nkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house\r\non fire, or run away. No; home again straight!\xe2\x80\x9d And in obedience to the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s impulse, home they went.\r\n\r\nThis bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in\r\nthe midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times\r\nduring his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs.\r\nBedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how\r\nmany long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had\r\ndone for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope\r\nof eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he\r\nhad been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many\r\nof his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so\r\nfar, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a\r\nrobber\xe2\x80\x94a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nalmost more than he could bear.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of\r\nhis benefactors. After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather\r\nhad fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young\r\nleaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house\r\nat Chertsey, for some months.\r\n\r\nSending the plate, which had so excited Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s cupidity, to the\r\nbanker\xe2\x80\x99s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,\r\nthey departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took\r\nOliver with them.\r\n\r\nWho can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft\r\ntranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green\r\nhills and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of\r\npeace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close\r\nand noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded\r\nhearts! Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives\r\nof toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has\r\nindeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick\r\nand stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even\r\nthey, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at\r\nlast for one short glimpse of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s face; and, carried far from the\r\nscenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once\r\ninto a new state of being. Crawling forth, from day to day, to some\r\ngreen sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by\r\nthe sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a\r\nforetaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they\r\nhave sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they\r\nwatched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded\r\nfrom their dim and feeble sight! The memories which peaceful country\r\nscenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes.\r\nTheir gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the\r\ngraves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before\r\nit old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the\r\nleast reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having\r\nheld such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which\r\ncalls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride\r\nand worldliness beneath it.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely spot to which they repaired. Oliver, whose days had\r\nbeen spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and\r\nbrawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there. The rose and\r\nhoneysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks\r\nof the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious\r\nodours. Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall\r\nunsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh\r\nturf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at\r\nrest. Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave\r\nin which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen;\r\nbut, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease\r\nto think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly,\r\nbut without pain.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy time. The days were peaceful and serene; the nights\r\nbrought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched\r\nprison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and\r\nhappy thoughts. Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman,\r\nwho lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to\r\nwrite: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could\r\nnever try enough to please him. Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie\r\nand Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in\r\nsome shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could\r\nhave done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his\r\nown lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work\r\nhard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came\r\nslowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them:\r\nlistening with such pleasure to all they said: and so happy if they\r\nwanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything\r\nhe could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it.\r\nWhen it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would\r\nsit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low\r\nand gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear.\r\nThere would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver\r\nwould sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a\r\nperfect rapture.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way\r\nin which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the\r\nother days in that most happy time! There was the little church, in the\r\nmorning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds\r\nsinging without: and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low\r\nporch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor\r\npeople were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that\r\nit seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there\r\ntogether; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and\r\nsounded more musical (to Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s ears at least) than any he had ever\r\nheard in church before. Then, there were the walks as usual, and many\r\ncalls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver\r\nread a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all\r\nthe week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and\r\npleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, roaming the\r\nfields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild\r\nflowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took\r\ngreat care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the\r\nembellishment of the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too,\r\nfor Miss Maylie\xe2\x80\x99s birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the\r\nsubject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the\r\ncages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce\r\nand smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of\r\ncharity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare\r\ncricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was\r\nalways something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which\r\nOliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who\r\nwas a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until\r\nMiss Rose made her appearance: when there were a thousand commendations\r\nto be bestowed on all he had done.\r\n\r\nSo three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the\r\nmost blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled\r\nhappiness, and which, in Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s were true felicity. With the purest\r\nand most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest,\r\nsoul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of\r\nthat short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with\r\nthe old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his\r\nyoung and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment\r\nto, himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nWHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN\r\nCHECK\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been\r\nbeautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its\r\nrichness. The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the\r\nearlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and\r\nstretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted\r\nopen and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant\r\nshade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine,\r\nwhich lay stretched beyond. The earth had donned her mantle of\r\nbrightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad. It was the prime\r\nand vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.\r\n\r\nStill, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same\r\ncheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. Oliver had long since\r\ngrown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in\r\nhis warm feelings of a great many people. He was still the same gentle,\r\nattached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and\r\nsuffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every\r\nslight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was\r\ncustomary with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was\r\na brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually\r\nrefreshing. Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on,\r\nin merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary\r\nbounds. Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home. The\r\nyoung lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano\r\nas usual. After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes,\r\nshe fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they\r\nheard a sound as if she were weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRose, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder lady.\r\n\r\nRose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words\r\nhad roused her from some painful thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRose, my love!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, aunt; nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\r\nis; I can\xe2\x80\x99t describe it; but I feel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot ill, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Oh, not ill!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly\r\nchillness were passing over her, while she spoke; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be better\r\npresently. Close the window, pray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an\r\neffort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune;\r\nbut her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with\r\nher hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she\r\nwas now unable to repress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\nsaw you so before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not alarm you if I could avoid it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Rose; \xe2\x80\x9cbut indeed\r\nI have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the\r\nvery short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of\r\nher countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had\r\nlost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an\r\nanxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn\r\nbefore. Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a\r\nheavy wildness came over the soft blue eye. Again this disappeared,\r\nlike the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly\r\npale.\r\n\r\nOliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was\r\nalarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that\r\nshe affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and\r\nthey so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to\r\nretire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in\r\nbetter health: assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in\r\nthe morning, quite well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthat nothing is the\r\nmatter? She don\xe2\x80\x99t look well to-night, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in\r\na dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length,\r\nshe said, in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not, Oliver. I have been very happy with her for some years:\r\ntoo happy, perhaps. It may be time that I should meet with some\r\nmisfortune; but I hope it is not this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heavy blow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, \xe2\x80\x9cof losing the dear girl who has\r\nso long been my comfort and happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! God forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Oliver, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen to that, my child!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo\r\nhours ago, she was quite well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very ill now,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Maylies; \xe2\x80\x9cand will be worse, I am\r\nsure. My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own\r\nemotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that,\r\nfor the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd consider, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into\r\nhis eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! consider how\r\nyoung and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all\r\nabout her. I am sure\xe2\x80\x94certain\xe2\x80\x94quite certain\xe2\x80\x94that, for your sake, who are\r\nso good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so\r\nhappy; she will not die. Heaven will never let her die so young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think\r\nlike a child, poor boy. But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. I\r\nhad forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned,\r\nfor I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the\r\nagony of separation from the objects of our love. I have seen enough,\r\ntoo, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared\r\nto those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow;\r\nfor Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there\r\nis a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s will be done! I love her; and He knows how well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she\r\nchecked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself\r\nup as she spoke, became composed and firm. He was still more astonished\r\nto find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and\r\nwatching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected:\r\nperforming all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and,\r\nto all external appearances, even cheerfully. But he was young, and did\r\nnot know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances.\r\nHow should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves?\r\n\r\nAn anxious night ensued. When morning came, Mrs. Maylie\xe2\x80\x99s predictions\r\nwere but too well verified. Rose was in the first stage of a high and\r\ndangerous fever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into\r\nhis face; \xe2\x80\x9cthis letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to\r\nMr. Losberne. It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more\r\nthan four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence\r\ndispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The\r\npeople at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to\r\nsee it done, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is another letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwhether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I\r\nscarcely know. I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it for Chertsey, too, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oliver; impatient to execute\r\nhis commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver\r\nglanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire,\r\nat some great lord\xe2\x80\x99s house in the country; where, he could not make\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall it go, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. \xe2\x80\x9cI will wait until\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off,\r\nwithout more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.\r\n\r\nSwiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which\r\nsometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either\r\nside, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers\r\nwere busy at their work: nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a\r\nfew seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and\r\ncovered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.\r\n\r\nHere he paused, and looked about for the inn. There were a white bank,\r\nand a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was\r\na large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which\r\nwas the sign of \xe2\x80\x9cThe George.\xe2\x80\x9d To this he hastened, as soon as it caught\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after\r\nhearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing\r\nall he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall\r\ngentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots\r\nwith tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking\r\nhis teeth with a silver toothpick.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out\r\nthe bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready,\r\nand paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which\r\ntook up ten good minutes more. Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate\r\nstate of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have\r\njumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the\r\nnext stage. At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been\r\nhanded up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy\r\ndelivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven\r\npaving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along\r\nthe turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nAs it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and\r\nthat no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a\r\nsomewhat lighter heart. He was turning out of the gateway when he\r\naccidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at\r\nthat moment coming out of the inn door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly\r\nrecoiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver; \xe2\x80\x9cI was in a great hurry to get\r\nhome, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you were coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large\r\ndark eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWho would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He\xe2\x80\x99d start\r\nup from a stone coffin, to come in my way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man\xe2\x80\x99s wild\r\nlook. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I have not hurt you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot you!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his\r\nclenched teeth; \xe2\x80\x9cif I had only had the courage to say the word, I might\r\nhave been free of you in a night. Curses on your head, and black death\r\non your heart, you imp! What are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He\r\nadvanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at\r\nhim, but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.\r\n\r\nOliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he\r\nsupposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help. Having\r\nseen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards,\r\nrunning as fast as he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling\r\nwith a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary\r\nbehaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for\r\nwhen he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and\r\nto drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.\r\n\r\nRose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was\r\ndelirious. A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in\r\nconstant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he\r\nhad taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a\r\nmost alarming nature. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be little short of\r\na miracle, if she recovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out,\r\nwith noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest\r\nsound from the sick chamber! How often did a tremble shake his frame,\r\nand cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling\r\nof feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had\r\neven then occurred! And what had been the fervency of all the prayers\r\nhe had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the\r\nagony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the\r\ngentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave\xe2\x80\x99s verge!\r\n\r\nOh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by\r\nwhile the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! Oh!\r\nthe racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat\r\nviolently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they\r\nconjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to\r\nrelieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to\r\nalleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of\r\nour helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what\r\nreflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time,\r\nallay them!\r\n\r\nMorning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke\r\nin whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time;\r\nwomen and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for\r\nhours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the\r\ngarden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and\r\nshuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay\r\nstretched inside. Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; \xe2\x80\x9cso young; so much\r\nbeloved; but there is very little hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother morning. The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked\r\nupon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom\r\nabout her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy,\r\nsurrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting\r\nfast. Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one\r\nof the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.\r\n\r\nThere was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and\r\nmirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the\r\nsummer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering\r\noverhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy\r\nraised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively\r\noccurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could\r\nsurely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that\r\ngraves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and\r\nfragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and\r\nshrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in\r\ntheir ghastly folds.\r\n\r\nA knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.\r\nAnother! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of\r\nhumble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse\r\nwas young. They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmother once\xe2\x80\x94among the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and\r\nthe birds sang on.\r\n\r\nOliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received\r\nfrom the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that\r\nhe might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was. He\r\nhad no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of\r\nthought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred\r\nlittle occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have\r\nbeen more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been. We need be\r\ncareful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to\r\nsome small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so\r\nlittle done\xe2\x80\x94of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might\r\nhave been repaired! There is no remorse so deep as that which is\r\nunavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this,\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside\r\nof her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven\r\nher away. He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which\r\nshe would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell,\r\nand die.\r\n\r\nThey sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted meal\r\nwas removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were\r\nelsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at\r\nlength, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his\r\ndeparture. Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching\r\nfootstep. They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of Rose?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me at once! I can bear it;\r\nanything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must compose yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor supporting her. \xe2\x80\x9cBe calm,\r\nmy dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am, pray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name! My dear child! She is dead! She is dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cAs He is good and merciful, she\r\nwill live to bless us all, for years to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but\r\nthe energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her\r\nfirst thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were\r\nextended to receive her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nCONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN\r\nWHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO\r\nOLIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and\r\nstupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak,\r\nor rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had\r\npassed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of\r\ntears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a\r\nfull sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost\r\ninsupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.\r\n\r\nThe night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with\r\nflowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of\r\nthe sick chamber. As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind\r\nhim, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace. Looking\r\nround, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as\r\nthe horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning\r\nagainst a gate until it should have passed him.\r\n\r\nAs it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap,\r\nwhose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that\r\nhe could not identify the person. In another second or two, the\r\nnightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice\r\nbellowed to the driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull\r\nup his horses. Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same\r\nvoice called Oliver by his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOliver, what\xe2\x80\x99s the news? Miss Rose! Master\r\nO-li-ver!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Giles?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.\r\n\r\nGiles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply,\r\nwhen he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the\r\nother corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a word!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cBetter or worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter\xe2\x80\x94much better!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cThe change took place only a few hours\r\nago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door,\r\nleaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite certain? There is no possibility of any mistake on your\r\npart, my boy, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not for the world, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you may\r\nbelieve me. Mr. Losberne\xe2\x80\x99s words were, that she would live to bless us\r\nall for many years to come. I heard him say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears stood in Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the\r\nbeginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away,\r\nand remained silent, for some minutes. Oliver thought he heard him sob,\r\nmore than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nhe could well guess what his feelings were\xe2\x80\x94and so stood apart, feigning\r\nto be occupied with his nosegay.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting\r\non the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and\r\nwiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with\r\nwhite spots. That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was\r\nabundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the\r\nyoung gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better go on to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s in the chaise, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time\r\nbefore I see her. You can say I am coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles: giving a final polish to\r\nhis ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you would leave\r\nthe postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should\r\nnever have any more authority with them if they did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can do as you like. Let\r\nhim go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us.\r\nOnly first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering,\r\nor we shall be taken for madmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and\r\npocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape,\r\nwhich he took out of the chaise. This done, the postboy drove off;\r\nGiles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.\r\n\r\nAs they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much\r\ninterest and curiosity at the new comer. He seemed about\r\nfive-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his\r\ncountenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and\r\nprepossessing. Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he\r\nbore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had\r\nno great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not\r\nalready spoken of her as his mother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached\r\nthe cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did you not write before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Maylie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, on reflection, I determined to keep\r\nback the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy run the chance of that occurring\r\nwhich so nearly happened? If Rose had\xe2\x80\x94I cannot utter that word now\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthis illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have\r\nforgiven yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that _had_ been the case, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear your\r\nhappiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival\r\nhere, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little\r\nimport.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who can wonder if it be so, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cor\r\nwhy should I say, _if_?\xe2\x80\x94It is\xe2\x80\x94it is\xe2\x80\x94you know it, mother\xe2\x80\x94you must know\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can\r\noffer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie; \xe2\x80\x9cI know that the devotion and affection of\r\nher nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and\r\nlasting. If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed\r\nbehaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my\r\ntask so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many\r\nstruggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the\r\nstrict line of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is unkind, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you still suppose that I am a\r\nboy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own\r\nsoul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, my dear son,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his\r\nshoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cthat youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and\r\nthat among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more\r\nfleeting. Above all, I think\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, fixing her eyes on her\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s face, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a\r\nwife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no\r\nfault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and\r\nupon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the\r\nworld, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against\r\nhim: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent\r\nof the connection he formed in early life. And she may have the pain of\r\nknowing that he does so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9che would be a selfish\r\nbrute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe,\r\nwho acted thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so now, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ever will!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mental agony I have suffered,\r\nduring the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion\r\nwhich, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have\r\nlightly formed. On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly\r\nas ever heart of man was set on woman. I have no thought, no view, no\r\nhope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you\r\ntake my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.\r\nMother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the\r\nhappiness of which you seem to think so little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie, \xe2\x80\x9cit is because I think so much of warm and\r\nsensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we\r\nhave said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it rest with Rose, then,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not press\r\nthese overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle\r\nin my way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Maylie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would have you consider\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ considered!\xe2\x80\x9d was the impatient reply; \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I have\r\nconsidered, years and years. I have considered, ever since I have been\r\ncapable of serious reflection. My feelings remain unchanged, as they\r\never will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them\r\nvent, which can be productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave\r\nthis place, Rose shall hear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she\r\nwill hear me coldly, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot coldly,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the old lady; \xe2\x80\x9cfar from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow then?\xe2\x80\x9d urged the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has formed no other attachment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his mother; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have, or I mistake, too strong a\r\nhold on her affections already. What I would say,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the old\r\nlady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, \xe2\x80\x9cis this. Before you\r\nstake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried\r\nto the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child,\r\non Rose\xe2\x80\x99s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her\r\ndoubtful birth may have on her decision: devoted as she is to us, with\r\nall the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of\r\nself which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her\r\ncharacteristic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I leave you to discover,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Maylie. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go back to\r\nher. God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you again to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy and by,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I leave Rose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will tell her I am here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how\r\nI long to see her. You will not refuse to do this, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady; \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell her all.\xe2\x80\x9d And pressing her son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment\r\nwhile this hurried conversation was proceeding. The former now held out\r\nhis hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between\r\nthem. The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions\r\nfrom his young friend, a precise account of his patient\xe2\x80\x99s situation;\r\nwhich was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstatement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr.\r\nGiles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\ndoctor, when he had concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing particular, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone at all, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear it, because you do that\r\nsort of thing admirably. Pray, how is Brittles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy is very well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone\r\nof patronage; \xe2\x80\x9cand sends his respectful duty, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cSeeing you here, reminds me, Mr.\r\nGiles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so\r\nhurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small\r\ncommission in your favour. Just step into this corner a moment, will\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,\r\nand was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on\r\nthe termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with\r\nsteps of unusual stateliness. The subject matter of this conference was\r\nnot disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened\r\nconcerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called\r\nfor a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly\r\neffective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his\r\ngallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to\r\ndeposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds,\r\nfor his sole use and benefit. At this, the two women-servants lifted up\r\ntheir hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his\r\nshirt-frill, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x9d; and that if they observed that he was\r\nat all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so.\r\nAnd then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of\r\nhis humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and\r\nwere, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of\r\ngreat men commonly are.\r\n\r\nAbove stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for\r\nthe doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful\r\nHarry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the\r\nworthy gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s good humour, which displayed itself in a great\r\nvariety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of\r\nsmall jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had\r\never heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident\r\nsatisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and\r\nmade Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy. So,\r\nthey were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could\r\nwell have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and\r\nthankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and\r\nsuspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.\r\n\r\nOliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual\r\noccupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many\r\ndays. The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places;\r\nand the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more\r\ngathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had\r\nseemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over\r\nevery object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic. The dew\r\nseemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle\r\namong them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue\r\nand bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own\r\nthoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects. Men\r\nwho look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and\r\ngloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from\r\ntheir own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and\r\nneed a clearer vision.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time,\r\nthat his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie,\r\nafter the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was\r\nseized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in\r\ntheir arrangement, as left his young companion far behind. If Oliver\r\nwere behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be\r\nfound; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and\r\nbrought home the fairest that blossomed. The window of the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air\r\nstream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in\r\nwater, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was\r\nmade up with great care, every morning. Oliver could not help noticing\r\nthat the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little\r\nvase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that\r\nwhenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes\r\nup to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as\r\nhe set forth on his morning\xe2\x80\x99s walk. Pending these observations, the\r\ndays were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.\r\n\r\nNor did Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady\r\nhad not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now\r\nand then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself,\r\nwith redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old\r\ngentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even\r\nhimself. It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was\r\ngreatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his\r\nbooks, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house. It was quite\r\na cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of\r\njessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the\r\nplace with their delicious perfume. It looked into a garden, whence a\r\nwicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine\r\nmeadow-land and wood. There was no other dwelling near, in that\r\ndirection; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning\r\nto settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his\r\nbooks. He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had\r\nbeen uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is\r\nno disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say,\r\nthat gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it\r\nholds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things\r\nabout it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. So far as an\r\noverpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter\r\ninability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called\r\nsleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is\r\ngoing on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are\r\nreally spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate\r\nthemselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and\r\nimagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost\r\nmatter of impossibility to separate the two. Nor is this, the most\r\nstriking phenomenon incidental to such a state. It is an undoubted\r\nfact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead,\r\nyet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before\r\nus, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent\r\npresence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when\r\nwe closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nOliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that\r\nhis books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was\r\nstirring among the creeping plants outside. And yet he was asleep.\r\nSuddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he\r\nthought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s house again.\r\nThere sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at\r\nhim, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought he heard the Jew say; \xe2\x80\x9cit is he, sure\r\nenough. Come away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe!\xe2\x80\x9d the other man seemed to answer; \xe2\x80\x9ccould I mistake him, think you?\r\nIf a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and\r\nhe stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to\r\npoint him out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across\r\nhis grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a mark above it, that\r\nhe lay buried there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver\r\nawoke with the fear, and started up.\r\n\r\nGood Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart,\r\nand deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x94at the\r\nwindow\xe2\x80\x94close before him\xe2\x80\x94so close, that he could have almost touched him\r\nbefore he started back: with his eyes peering into the room, and\r\nmeeting his: there stood the Jew! And beside him, white with rage or\r\nfear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted\r\nhim in the inn-yard.\r\n\r\nIt was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they\r\nwere gone. But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was\r\nas firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in\r\nstone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed for a\r\nmoment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXV.\r\nCONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER\xe2\x80\x99S ADVENTURE; AND A\r\nCONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s cries, hurried to\r\nthe spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,\r\npointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely\r\nable to articulate the words, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jew! the Jew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry\r\nMaylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s history from his mother, understood it at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat direction did he take?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, catching up a heavy stick which\r\nwas standing in a corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmissed them in an instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, they are in the ditch!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cFollow! And keep as near\r\nme, as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off\r\nwith a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the\r\nothers to keep near him.\r\n\r\nGiles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the\r\ncourse of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and\r\njust then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking\r\nhimself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to\r\npossess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting\r\nall the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.\r\n\r\nOn they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader,\r\nstriking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to\r\nsearch, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time\r\nfor the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to\r\ncommunicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so\r\nvigorous a pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe search was all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent\r\nfootsteps, to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill,\r\ncommanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.\r\nThere was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain\r\nthat, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must\r\nhave made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could\r\nhave accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood skirted the\r\nmeadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that\r\ncovert for the same reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been a dream, Oliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry Maylie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, indeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, shuddering at the very\r\nrecollection of the old wretch\xe2\x80\x99s countenance; \xe2\x80\x9cI saw him too plainly\r\nfor that. I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the other?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the\r\ninn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I\r\ncould swear to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey took this way?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Harry: \xe2\x80\x9care you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I am that the men were at the window,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, pointing\r\ndown, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from\r\nthe meadow. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running\r\na few paces to the right, crept through that gap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen watched Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s earnest face, as he spoke, and\r\nlooking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the\r\naccuracy of what he said. Still, in no direction were there any\r\nappearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was\r\nlong; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had\r\ncrushed it. The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but\r\nin no one place could they discern the print of men\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, or the\r\nslightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the\r\nground for hours before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is strange!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cBlathers and Duff, themselves, could\r\nmake nothing of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did\r\nnot desist until the coming on of night rendered its further\r\nprosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance.\r\nGiles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village,\r\nfurnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance\r\nand dress of the strangers. Of these, the Jew was, at all events,\r\nsufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen\r\ndrinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any\r\nintelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but\r\nwith no better success. On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie\r\nrepaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something\r\nof the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless. After a few\r\ndays, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when\r\nwonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. She had left her room: was able\r\nto go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the\r\nhearts of all.\r\n\r\nBut, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little\r\ncircle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more\r\nheard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon\r\nsome there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to\r\nremark. Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long\r\ntime; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her\r\nface. After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey,\r\nthese symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in\r\nprogress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody\r\nelse besides.\r\n\r\nAt length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour,\r\nHarry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to\r\nspeak with her for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few\xe2\x80\x94a very few\xe2\x80\x94will suffice, Rose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, drawing his\r\nchair towards her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I shall have to say, has already presented\r\nitself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not\r\nunknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might\r\nhave been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and\r\nbending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94ought to have left here, before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me for saying so, but I\r\nwish you had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all\r\napprehensions,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fear of losing the one dear\r\nbeing on whom my every wish and hope are fixed. You had been dying;\r\ntrembling between earth and heaven. We know that when the young, the\r\nbeautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits\r\ninsensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know,\r\nHeaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade\r\nin blooming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were\r\nspoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and\r\nglistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as\r\nthough the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred\r\nnaturally, with the loveliest things in nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA creature,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the young man, passionately, \xe2\x80\x9ca creature as\r\nfair and innocent of guile as one of God\xe2\x80\x99s own angels, fluttered\r\nbetween life and death. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to\r\nwhich she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to\r\nthe sorrow and calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were\r\npassing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts\r\nupon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who\r\nlinger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that\r\nyou belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and\r\nthe best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all\r\nthese consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine,\r\nby day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears,\r\nand apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never\r\nknow how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in\r\nits course. You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some\r\ndrop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream\r\nof life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a\r\nhigh and rushing tide. I have watched you change almost from death, to\r\nlife, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep\r\naffection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has\r\nsoftened my heart to all mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, weeping; \xe2\x80\x9cI only wish you had left\r\nhere, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to\r\npursuits well worthy of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest\r\nnature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the young man, taking her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cRose, my own dear Rose! For\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94for years\xe2\x80\x94I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and\r\nthen come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to\r\nshare; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy\r\nmoment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy\xe2\x80\x99s attachment,\r\nand claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that\r\nhad been sealed between us! That time has not arrived; but here, with\r\nnot fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so\r\nlong your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the\r\noffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour behaviour has ever been kind and noble.\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, mastering the\r\nemotions by which she was agitated. \xe2\x80\x9cAs you believe that I am not\r\ninsensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you must endeavour to forget me; not as\r\nyour old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply;\r\nbut, as the object of your love. Look into the world; think how many\r\nhearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other\r\npassion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most\r\nfaithful friend you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with\r\none hand, gave free vent to her tears. Harry still retained the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your reasons, Rose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at length, in a low voice; \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nreasons for this decision?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a right to know them,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can say nothing to\r\nalter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform. I owe it, alike\r\nto others, and to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Harry. I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless,\r\ngirl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason\r\nto suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and\r\nfastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects. I owe it to\r\nyou and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your\r\ngenerous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your inclinations chime with your sense of duty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Harry began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose, colouring deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you return my love?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cSay but that, dear Rose; say\r\nbut that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrejoined Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cI could have\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave received this declaration very differently?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not\r\nconceal that from me, at least, Rose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, disengaging her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\nshould we prolong this painful interview? Most painful to me, and yet\r\nproductive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be\r\nhappiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which\r\nI now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me\r\nwith new fortitude and firmness. Farewell, Harry! As we have met\r\nto-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which\r\nthis conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined;\r\nand may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can\r\ncall down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother word, Rose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cYour reason in your own words. From\r\nyour own lips, let me hear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prospect before you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rose, firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cis a brilliant one.\r\nAll the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can\r\nhelp men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections\r\nare proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the\r\nmother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of\r\nher who has so well supplied that mother\xe2\x80\x99s place. In a word,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nis a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads. I\r\nwill carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest\r\nalone on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more, Rose. Dearest Rose! one more!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harry, throwing\r\nhimself before her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been less\xe2\x80\x94less fortunate, the world would\r\ncall it\xe2\x80\x94if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny\xe2\x80\x94if I had\r\nbeen poor, sick, helpless\xe2\x80\x94would you have turned from me then? Or has my\r\nprobable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not press me to reply,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question does not\r\narise, and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Harry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the\r\npath before me. It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance\r\nof a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. Oh, Rose:\r\nin the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I\r\nhave suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this\r\none question!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if your lot had been differently cast,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Rose; \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nhad been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been\r\na help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement,\r\nand not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I\r\nshould have been spared this trial. I have every reason to be happy,\r\nvery happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBusy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded\r\ninto the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears\r\nwith them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they\r\nrelieved her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRose, extending her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI must leave you now, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask one promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce, and only once more,\xe2\x80\x94say within\r\na year, but it may be much sooner,\xe2\x80\x94I may speak to you again on this\r\nsubject, for the last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to press me to alter my right determination,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose, with a\r\nmelancholy smile; \xe2\x80\x9cit will be useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry; \xe2\x80\x9cto hear you repeat it, if you will\xe2\x80\x94finally repeat\r\nit! I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may\r\npossess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not\r\nseek, by word or act, to change it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let it be so,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Rose; \xe2\x80\x9cit is but one pang the more, and\r\nby that time I may be enabled to bear it better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand again. But the young man caught her to his bosom;\r\nand imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nIS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS\r\nPLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST,\r\nAND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning;\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the\r\nbreakfast-table. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are not in the same mind or intention two\r\nhalf-hours together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will tell me a different tale one of these days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry,\r\ncolouring without any perceptible reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I may have good cause to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Losberne; \xe2\x80\x9cthough\r\nI confess I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall. But yesterday morning you had made up\r\nyour mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your\r\nmother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce\r\nthat you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I\r\ngo, on your road to London. And at night, you urge me, with great\r\nmystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of\r\nwhich is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when\r\nhe ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all\r\nkinds. Too bad, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and\r\nMr. Maylie went away, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall come and see me\r\nwhen you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication\r\nfrom the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be\r\ngone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great nobs,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cunder which designation, I presume,\r\nyou include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at\r\nall, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it\r\nlikely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate\r\nattendance among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a queer fellow. But of course they\r\nwill get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and\r\nthese sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political\r\nlife. There\xe2\x80\x99s something in that. Good training is always desirable,\r\nwhether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue\r\nby one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a\r\nlittle; but he contented himself with saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\npursued the subject no farther. The post-chaise drove up to the door\r\nshortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good\r\ndoctor bustled out, to see it packed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9clet me speak a word with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him;\r\nmuch surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which\r\nhis whole behaviour displayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can write well now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would\r\nwrite to me\xe2\x80\x94say once a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the\r\nGeneral Post Office in London. Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Oliver,\r\ngreatly delighted with the commission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know how\xe2\x80\x94how my mother and Miss Maylie are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung man; \xe2\x80\x9cand you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you\r\ntake, and what you talk about, and whether she\xe2\x80\x94they, I mean\xe2\x80\x94seem happy\r\nand quite well. You understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! quite, sir, quite,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather you did not mention it to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, hurrying\r\nover his words; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it might make my mother anxious to write to me\r\noftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret\r\nbetween you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance,\r\nfaithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.\r\nMr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should\r\nbe left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants\r\nwere in the garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight glance at the\r\nlatticed window, and jumped into the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive on!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9chard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying\r\nwill keep pace with me, to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great\r\nhurry, and shouting to the postillion; \xe2\x80\x9csomething very short of flying\r\nwill keep pace with _me_. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible,\r\nand its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound\r\nits way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly\r\ndisappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects,\r\nor the intricacies of the way, permitted. It was not until even the\r\ndusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.\r\n\r\nAnd there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot\r\nwhere the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away;\r\nfor, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when\r\nHarry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems in high spirits and happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, at length. \xe2\x80\x9cI feared\r\nfor a time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very\r\nglad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed\r\ndown Rose\xe2\x80\x99s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in\r\nthe same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nIN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN\r\nMATRIMONIAL CASES\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on\r\nthe cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam\r\nproceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which\r\nwere sent back from its cold and shining surface. A paper fly-cage\r\ndangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in\r\ngloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy\r\nnet-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy\r\nshadow overspread his countenance. Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might\r\nbe that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own\r\npast life.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a\r\npleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting\r\nother appearances, and those closely connected with his own person,\r\nwhich announced that a great change had taken place in the position of\r\nhis affairs. The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He\r\nstill wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether\r\nlimbs; but they were not _the_ breeches. The coat was wide-skirted; and\r\nin that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different! The mighty\r\ncocked hat was replaced by a modest round one. Mr. Bumble was no longer\r\na beadle.\r\n\r\nThere are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more\r\nsubstantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from\r\nthe coats and waistcoats connected with them. A field-marshal has his\r\nuniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle\r\nhis cocked hat. Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat\r\nand lace; what are they? Men. Mere men. Dignity, and even holiness too,\r\nsometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.\r\nAnother beadle had come into power. On him the cocked hat, gold-laced\r\ncoat, and staff, had all three descended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to-morrow two months it was done!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence\r\nof happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sold myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small\r\nquantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money. I went\r\nvery reasonable. Cheap, dirt cheap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheap!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s ear: \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have been\r\ndear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort,\r\nwho, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his\r\ncomplaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bumble, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the goodness to look at me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she stands such a eye as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\ncan stand anything. It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers. If\r\nit fails with her, my power is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell\r\npaupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or\r\nwhether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle\r\nglances; are matters of opinion. The matter of fact, is, that the\r\nmatron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s scowl, but, on the\r\ncontrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh\r\nthereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first\r\nincredulous, and afterwards amazed. He then relapsed into his former\r\nstate; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened\r\nby the voice of his partner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to sit snoring there, all day?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nMr. Bumble; \xe2\x80\x9cand although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape,\r\nsneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my\r\nprerogative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Your_ prerogative!\xe2\x80\x9d sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said the word, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cThe prerogative of a man is\r\nto command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe relict of Mr. Corney deceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo obey, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cYour late unfortunate husband\r\nshould have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive\r\nnow. I wish he was, poor man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now\r\narrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or\r\nother, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this\r\nallusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with\r\na loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a\r\nparoxysm of tears.\r\n\r\nBut, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s soul;\r\nhis heart was waterproof. Like washable beaver hats that improve with\r\nrain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of\r\ntears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of\r\nhis own power, pleased and exalted him. He eyed his good lady with\r\nlooks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that\r\nshe should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the\r\nfaculty, as strongly conducive to health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and\r\nsoftens down the temper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cSo cry away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat\r\nfrom a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man\r\nmight, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner,\r\nthrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with\r\nmuch ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.\r\n\r\nNow, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less\r\ntroublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make\r\ntrial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in\r\ndiscovering.\r\n\r\nThe first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow\r\nsound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the\r\nopposite end of the room. This preliminary proceeding laying bare his\r\nhead, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one\r\nhand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and\r\ndexterity) upon it with the other. This done, she created a little\r\nvariety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by\r\nthis time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the\r\noffence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated\r\nfor the purpose: and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if\r\nhe dared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd take yourself\r\naway from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what\r\nsomething desperate might be. Picking up his hat, he looked towards the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker\r\nmotion towards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going, my dear! You\r\nare so very violent, that really I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the\r\ncarpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle. Mr. Bumble immediately\r\ndarted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his\r\nunfinished sentence: leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. He had a\r\ndecided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure\r\nfrom the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is\r\nneedless to say) a coward. This is by no means a disparagement to his\r\ncharacter; for many official personages, who are held in high respect\r\nand admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities. The remark is\r\nmade, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of\r\nimpressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nBut, the measure of his degradation was not yet full. After making a\r\ntour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws\r\nreally were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their\r\nwives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be\r\nvisited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious\r\nindividuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some\r\nof the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish\r\nlinen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHem!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nwomen at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo\r\nthere! What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very\r\nfierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most\r\nhumiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the\r\nform of his lady wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was here!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do _you_ do\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work\r\nproperly, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a\r\ncouple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of\r\nadmiration at the workhouse-master\xe2\x80\x99s humility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ thought they were talking too much?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nbusiness is it of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d urged Mr. Bumble submissively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business is it of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very true, you\xe2\x80\x99re matron here, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d submitted Mr. Bumble;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I thought you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the way just then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want any\r\nof your interference. You\xe2\x80\x99re a great deal too fond of poking your nose\r\ninto things that don\xe2\x80\x99t concern you, making everybody in the house\r\nlaugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a\r\nfool every hour in the day. Be off; come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two\r\nold paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated\r\nfor an instant. Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up\r\na bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him\r\ninstantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nWhat could Mr. Bumble do? He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away;\r\nand, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a\r\nshrill chuckle of irrepressible delight. It wanted but this. He was\r\ndegraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very\r\npaupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to\r\nthe lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll in two months!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo\r\nmonths! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but\r\neverybody else\xe2\x80\x99s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the\r\ngate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and\r\nwalked, distractedly, into the street.\r\n\r\nHe walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated\r\nthe first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made\r\nhim thirsty. He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length\r\npaused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a\r\nhasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary\r\ncustomer. It began to rain, heavily, at the moment. This determined\r\nhim. Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he\r\npassed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large\r\ncloak. He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain\r\nhaggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to\r\nhave travelled some distance. He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered,\r\nbut scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his\r\nsalutation.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the\r\nstranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin-and-water in\r\nsilence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall\r\ninto company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now\r\nand then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a\r\nlook at the stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his\r\neyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment\r\nstealing a look at him. Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s awkwardness was enhanced by the\r\nvery remarkable expression of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s eye, which was keen and\r\nbright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike\r\nanything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.\r\n\r\nWhen they had encountered each other\xe2\x80\x99s glance several times in this\r\nway, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you looking for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you peered in at the window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I am aware of, unless you\xe2\x80\x99re Mr.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here Mr. Bumble stopped\r\nshort; for he was curious to know the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s name, and thought in\r\nhis impatience, he might supply the blank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you were not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm\r\nplaying about his mouth; \xe2\x80\x9cor you have known my name. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\r\nI would recommend you not to ask for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant no harm, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have done none,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger.\r\n\r\nAnother silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken\r\nby the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen you before, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were differently\r\ndressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should\r\nknow you again. You were beadle here, once; were you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; \xe2\x80\x9cporochial beadle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the other, nodding his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in that\r\ncharacter I saw you. What are you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster of the workhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and\r\nimpressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might\r\notherwise assume. \xe2\x80\x9cMaster of the workhouse, young man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I\r\ndoubt not?\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t scruple to answer freely, man. I know you pretty well, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, a married man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with\r\nhis hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident\r\nperplexity, \xe2\x80\x9cis not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can,\r\nthan a single one. Porochial officers are not so well paid that they\r\ncan afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a\r\ncivil and proper manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had\r\nnot mistaken his man; then rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFill this glass again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s empty tumbler to\r\nthe landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it be strong and hot. You like it so, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot too strong,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand what that means, landlord!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, drily.\r\n\r\nThe host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a\r\nsteaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr.\r\nBumble\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, after closing the door and\r\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cI came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by\r\none of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends\r\nsometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you\r\nwere uppermost in my mind. I want some information from you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is. Put up that, to begin\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his\r\ncompanion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money\r\nshould be heard without. When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the\r\ncoins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much\r\nsatisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry your memory back\xe2\x80\x94let me see\xe2\x80\x94twelve years, last winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe scene, the workhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the time, night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable\r\ndrabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to\r\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x94gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and\r\nhid their shame, rot \xe2\x80\x99em in the grave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lying-in room, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, not quite following\r\nthe stranger\xe2\x80\x99s excited description.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cA boy was born there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA many boys,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA murrain on the young devils!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the stranger; \xe2\x80\x9cI speak of one; a\r\nmeek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a\r\ncoffin-maker\xe2\x80\x94I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble; \xe2\x80\x9cI remember him,\r\nof course. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a obstinater young rascal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not of him I want to hear; I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard enough of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nstranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject\r\nof poor Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s vices. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of a woman; the hag that nursed his\r\nmother. Where is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered\r\nfacetious. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be hard to tell. There\xe2\x80\x99s no midwifery there,\r\nwhichever place she\xe2\x80\x99s gone to; so I suppose she\xe2\x80\x99s out of employment,\r\nanyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the stranger, sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she died last winter,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nThe man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and\r\nalthough he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his\r\ngaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in\r\nthought. For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be\r\nrelieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed\r\nmore freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great\r\nmatter. With that he rose, as if to depart.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an\r\nopportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in\r\nthe possession of his better half. He well remembered the night of old\r\nSally\xe2\x80\x99s death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good\r\nreason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs.\r\nCorney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure\r\nof which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know\r\nthat it related to something that had occurred in the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.\r\nHastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger,\r\nwith an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old\r\nharridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason\r\nto believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I find her?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and\r\nplainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused\r\nafresh by the intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly through me,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the stranger, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt nine in the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, producing a scrap of\r\npaper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side,\r\nin characters that betrayed his agitation; \xe2\x80\x9cat nine in the evening,\r\nbring her to me there. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you to be secret. It\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\ninterest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for\r\nthe liquor that had been drunk. Shortly remarking that their roads were\r\ndifferent, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic\r\nrepetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.\r\n\r\nOn glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it\r\ncontained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him\r\nto ask it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble\r\ntouched him on the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cFollowing me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to ask a question,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, pointing to the scrap of\r\npaper. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat name am I to ask for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonks!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the man; and strode hastily away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nCONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND\r\nMR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had\r\nbeen threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of\r\nvapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a\r\nviolent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the\r\nmain street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered\r\nlittle colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half,\r\nor thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nThey were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might,\r\nperhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the\r\nrain, and sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a\r\nlantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few\r\npaces in front, as though\xe2\x80\x94the way being dirty\xe2\x80\x94to give his wife the\r\nbenefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound\r\nsilence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned\r\nhis head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then,\r\ndiscovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of\r\nwalking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards\r\ntheir place of destination.\r\n\r\nThis was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long\r\nbeen known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under\r\nvarious pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on\r\nplunder and crime. It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily\r\nbuilt with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled\r\ntogether without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for\r\nthe most part, within a few feet of the river\xe2\x80\x99s bank. A few leaky boats\r\ndrawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it:\r\nand here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to\r\nindicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some\r\navocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless\r\ncondition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by,\r\nwithout much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed\r\nthere, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view\r\nto their being actually employed.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its\r\nupper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a\r\nmanufactory of some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished\r\nemployment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. But it had\r\nlong since gone to ruin. The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp,\r\nhad weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable\r\nportion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the\r\nremainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a\r\nfavourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving\r\nitself in the same fate.\r\n\r\nIt was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as\r\nthe first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain\r\ncommenced pouring violently down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place should be somewhere here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bumble, consulting a scrap\r\nof paper he held in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice from above.\r\n\r\nFollowing the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man\r\nlooking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand still, a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the voice; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be with you directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWith which the head disappeared, and the door closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s good lady.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, mind what I told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron: \xe2\x80\x9cand be careful to say\r\nas little as you can, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll betray us at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was\r\napparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of\r\nproceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was\r\nprevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near\r\nwhich they stood, and beckoned them inwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t keep me here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any\r\nother invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind,\r\nfollowed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that\r\nremarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMonks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the\r\ndoor behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x94we were only cooling ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Bumble, looking\r\napprehensively about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCooling yourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cNot all the rain that ever fell,\r\nor ever will fall, will put as much of hell\xe2\x80\x99s fire out, as a man can\r\ncarry about with him. You won\xe2\x80\x99t cool yourself so easily; don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and\r\nbent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was\r\nfain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the woman, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHem! That is the woman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron,\r\ninterposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know they will always keep _one_ till it\xe2\x80\x99s found out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what may that be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe loss of their own good name,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, by the same\r\nrule, if a woman\xe2\x80\x99s a party to a secret that might hang or transport\r\nher, I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you\r\nunderstand, mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two\r\ncompanions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened\r\nacross the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the\r\nroof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder,\r\nleading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of\r\nlightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed,\r\nwhich shook the crazy building to its centre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, shrinking back. \xe2\x80\x9cHear it! Rolling and crashing on\r\nas if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding\r\nfrom it. I hate the sound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands\r\nsuddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr.\r\nBumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese fits come over me, now and then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, observing his\r\nalarm; \xe2\x80\x9cand thunder sometimes brings them on. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me now; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall over for this once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the\r\nwindow-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which\r\nhung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy\r\nbeams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and\r\nthree chairs that were placed beneath it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsooner we come to our business, the better for all. The woman know what\r\nit is, does she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the\r\nreply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died;\r\nand that she told you something\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the mother of the boy you named,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the matron\r\ninterrupting him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first question is, of what nature was her communication?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMonks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the second,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the woman with much deliberation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nfirst is, what may the communication be worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody better than you, I am persuaded,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Bumble: who did\r\nnot want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere may be money\xe2\x80\x99s worth to get, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps there may,\xe2\x80\x9d was the composed reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that was taken from her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething that she\r\nwore. Something that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better bid,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mrs. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard enough,\r\nalready, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any\r\ngreater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened\r\nto this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he\r\ndirected towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised\r\nastonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded,\r\nwhat sum was required for the disclosure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it worth to you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the woman, as collectedly as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak\r\nout, and let me know which.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdd five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty\r\npounds in gold,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all I know. Not\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive-and-twenty pounds!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Monks, drawing back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke as plainly as I could,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a large\r\nsum, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntold!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Monks impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cand which has been lying dead for\r\ntwelve years past or more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value\r\nin course of time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the matron, still preserving the resolute\r\nindifference she had assumed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to lying dead, there are those who\r\nwill lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for\r\nanything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I pay it for nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monks, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can easily take it away again,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the matron. \xe2\x80\x9cI am but a\r\nwoman; alone here; and unprotected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,\xe2\x80\x9d submitted Mr. Bumble,\r\nin a voice tremulous with fear: \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Monks is too\r\nmuch of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr.\r\nMonks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a\r\nlittle run to seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd: I say I have no\r\ndoubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined\r\nofficer, with very uncommon strength, if I\xe2\x80\x99m once roused. I only want a\r\nlittle rousing; that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern\r\nwith fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed\r\nexpression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and\r\nnot a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless,\r\nindeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; \xe2\x80\x9cand had better hold your\r\ntongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can\xe2\x80\x99t speak in a\r\nlower tone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cSo! He\xe2\x80\x99s your husband, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe my husband!\xe2\x80\x9d tittered the matron, parrying the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much, when you came in,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Monks, marking the\r\nangry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much\r\nthe better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I\r\nfind that there\xe2\x80\x99s only one will between them. I\xe2\x80\x99m in earnest. See\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told\r\nout twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cgather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder,\r\nwhich I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhear your story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break\r\nalmost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from\r\nthe table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say. The\r\nfaces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small\r\ntable in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to\r\nrender her whisper audible. The sickly rays of the suspended lantern\r\nfalling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of\r\ntheir countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness,\r\nlooked ghastly in the extreme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen this woman, that we called old Sally, died,\xe2\x80\x9d the matron began,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe and I were alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there no one by?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nsick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and\r\nmight, by possibility, understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a soul,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cwe were alone. _I_ stood alone beside\r\nthe body when death came over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, regarding her attentively. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe spoke of a young creature,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the matron, \xe2\x80\x9cwho had brought a\r\nchild into the world some years before; not merely in the same room,\r\nbut in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlood! How things come about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child was the one you named to him last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the matron,\r\nnodding carelessly towards her husband; \xe2\x80\x9cthe mother this nurse had\r\nrobbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn life?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn death,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman, with something like a shudder. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nstole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the\r\ndead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the\r\ninfant\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sold it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; \xe2\x80\x9cdid she sell it?\r\nWhere? When? To whom? How long before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe matron, \xe2\x80\x9cshe fell back and died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout saying more?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very\r\nsuppression, seemed only the more furious. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie! I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be\r\nplayed with. She said more. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tear the life out of you both, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll know what it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t utter another word,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, to all appearance\r\nunmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nviolence; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which\r\nwas partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the\r\nhand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich contained\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Monks, stretching forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cit was a pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s duplicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn good time I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI judge that she had\r\nkept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better\r\naccount; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together\r\nmoney to pay the pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s interest year by year, and prevent its\r\nrunning out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be\r\nredeemed. Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the\r\nscrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand. The time was out in\r\ntwo days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so\r\nredeemed the pledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monks quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_There_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she\r\nhastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for\r\na French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling\r\nhands. It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of\r\nhair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has the word \xe2\x80\x98Agnes\xe2\x80\x99 engraved on the inside,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date;\r\nwhich is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the\r\ncontents of the little packet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the\r\nstory was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty\r\npounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration\r\nwhich had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of\r\nthe previous dialogue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nwife addressing Monks, after a short silence; \xe2\x80\x9cand I want to know\r\nnothing; for it\xe2\x80\x99s safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, with some show of surprise; \xe2\x80\x9cbut whether I\r\nanswer or not is another question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Which makes three,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of\r\nfacetiousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you expected to get from me?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the matron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Monks; \xe2\x80\x9cnor against me either. See here! But don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmove a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an\r\niron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened\r\nclose at Mr. Bumble\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several\r\npaces backward, with great precipitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were\r\nseated over it, if that had been my game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble\r\nhimself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid\r\nwater, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all\r\nother sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against\r\nthe green and slimy piles. There had once been a water-mill beneath;\r\nthe tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments\r\nof machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new\r\nimpulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted\r\nto stem its headlong course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you flung a man\xe2\x80\x99s body down there, where would it be to-morrow\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nBumble, recoiling at the thought.\r\n\r\nMonks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly\r\nthrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of\r\nsome pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It\r\nfell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely\r\naudible splash; and was gone.\r\n\r\nThe three looking into each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces, seemed to breathe more\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back\r\ninto its former position. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the sea ever gives up its dead, as books\r\nsay it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash\r\namong it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant\r\nparty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, with a\r\nthreatening look. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid of your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may depend upon me, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Bumble, bowing\r\nhimself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. \xe2\x80\x9cOn\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad, for your sake, to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cLight your\r\nlantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr.\r\nBumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would\r\ninfallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his\r\nlantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now\r\ncarried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse,\r\ndescended in silence, followed by his wife. Monks brought up the rear,\r\nafter pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other\r\nsounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the\r\nrushing of the water.\r\n\r\nThey traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks\r\nstarted at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot\r\nabove the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a\r\nmarvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking\r\nnervously about him for hidden trap-doors. The gate at which they had\r\nentered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a\r\nnod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into\r\nthe wet and darkness outside.\r\n\r\nThey were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an\r\ninvincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been\r\nhidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he\r\nreturned to the chamber he had just quitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nINTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY\r\nACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS\r\nTOGETHER\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned\r\nin the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as\r\ntherein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily\r\ngrowled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.\r\n\r\nThe room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of\r\nthose he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it\r\nwas in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great\r\ndistance from his former lodgings. It was not, in appearance, so\r\ndesirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and\r\nbadly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one\r\nsmall window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty\r\nlane. Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhaving gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of\r\nfurniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the\r\ndisappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen,\r\nbespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated\r\ncondition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these\r\nsymptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat,\r\nby way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree\r\nimproved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled\r\nnightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week\xe2\x80\x99s growth. The dog sat at\r\nthe bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now\r\npricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the\r\nstreet, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.\r\nSeated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which\r\nformed a portion of the robber\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale\r\nand reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been\r\nconsiderable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has\r\nalready figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to\r\nMr. Sikes\xe2\x80\x99s question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot long gone seven,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel to-night, Bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs weak as water,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes\r\nand limbs. \xe2\x80\x9cHere; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering\r\nbed anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIllness had not improved Mr. Sikes\xe2\x80\x99s temper; for, as the girl raised\r\nhim up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her\r\nawkwardness, and struck her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhining are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! Don\xe2\x80\x99t stand snivelling there. If\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D\xe2\x80\x99ye hear\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat fancy have you got in your head now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought better of it, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sikes, marking the\r\ntear which trembled in her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the better for you, you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a number of nights,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, with a touch of woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even\r\nto her voice: \xe2\x80\x9csuch a number of nights as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been patient with you,\r\nnursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the\r\nfirst that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have served me as\r\nyou did just now, if you\xe2\x80\x99d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Sikes, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Why, damme, now, the\r\ngirls\xe2\x80\x99s whining again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou seem to mind me. It\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll be over?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat foolery\r\nare you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don\xe2\x80\x99t come over\r\nme with your woman\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was\r\ndelivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really\r\nweak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and\r\nfainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths\r\nwith which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his\r\nthreats. Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon\r\nemergency; for Miss Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s hysterics were usually of that violent kind\r\nwhich the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance;\r\nMr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment\r\nwholly ineffectual, called for assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter here, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, looking in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLend a hand to the girl, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand chattering and grinning at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who\r\nhad followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on\r\nthe floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from\r\nthe grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked\r\nit in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents\r\ndown the patient\xe2\x80\x99s throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to\r\nprevent mistakes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nDawkins; \xe2\x80\x9cand you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the\r\npetticuts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially\r\nthat department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his\r\nshare in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not\r\nlong in producing the desired effect. The girl gradually recovered her\r\nsenses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon\r\nthe pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some\r\nastonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what evil wind has blowed you here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought something good with me, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to see.\r\nDodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that\r\nwe spent all our money on, this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn compliance with Mr. Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s request, the Artful untied this bundle,\r\nwhich was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed\r\nthe articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed\r\nthem on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSitch a rabbit pie, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing\r\nto view a huge pasty; \xe2\x80\x9csitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender\r\nlimbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\noccasion to pick \xe2\x80\x99em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so\r\nprecious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it\xe2\x80\x99ll go nigh to\r\nblow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that\r\nthe niggers didn\xe2\x80\x99t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a\r\npitch of goodness,\xe2\x80\x94oh no! Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh;\r\npiece of double Glo\xe2\x80\x99ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort\r\nyou ever lushed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his\r\nextensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while\r\nMr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw\r\nspirits from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his\r\nthroat without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo, Bill; you\xe2\x80\x99ll do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cI might have been done for, twenty times\r\nover, afore you\xe2\x80\x99d have done anything to help me. What do you mean by\r\nleaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted\r\nwagabond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly hear him, boys!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd us\r\ncome to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe things is well enough in their way,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Sikes: a little\r\nsoothed as he glanced over the table; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what have you got to say for\r\nyourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health,\r\nblunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this\r\nmortal time, than if I was that \xe2\x80\x99ere dog.\xe2\x80\x94Drive him down, Charley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never see such a jolly dog as that,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Master Bates, doing as he\r\nwas desired. \xe2\x80\x9cSmelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nmake his fortun\xe2\x80\x99 on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma\r\nbesides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your din,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still\r\ngrowling angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got to say for yourself, you withered\r\nold fence, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about the other fortnight?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the\r\nother fortnight that you\xe2\x80\x99ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his\r\nhole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, Bill. I can\xe2\x80\x99t go into a long explanation before\r\ncompany; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, upon my honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon your what?\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cHere! Cut me\r\noff a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out\r\nof my mouth, or it\xe2\x80\x99ll choke me dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be out of temper, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Fagin, submissively. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nnever forgot you, Bill; never once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I\xe2\x80\x99ll pound it that you han\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid\r\nshivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do\r\nthat; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well:\r\nand was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the\r\ngirl, I might have died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means\r\nof your having such a handy girl about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says true enough there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, coming hastily forward. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nhim be; let him be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy\xe2\x80\x99s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,\r\nreceiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with\r\nliquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin,\r\nassuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a\r\nbetter temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant\r\nbanter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough\r\njokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he\r\ncondescended to make.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must have some blunt from\r\nyou to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a piece of coin about me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ve got lots at home,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cand I must have some\r\nfrom there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLots!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin, holding up is hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t so much as would\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much you\xe2\x80\x99ve got, and I dare say you hardly know\r\nyourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I must have some to-night; and that\xe2\x80\x99s flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send the Artful round\r\npresently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t do nothing of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Artful\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndeal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get\r\ndodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you\r\nput him up to it. Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all\r\nsure; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down and have a snooze while she\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the\r\namount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four\r\nand sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would\r\nonly leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly\r\nremarking that if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any more he must accompany him home;\r\nwith the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The\r\nJew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,\r\nattended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself\r\non the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the\r\nyoung lady\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nIn due course, they arrived at Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s abode, where they found Toby\r\nCrackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage,\r\nwhich it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and\r\nwith it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his\r\nyoung friends. Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found\r\nrelaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and\r\nmental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat\r\nto go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas nobody been, Toby?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a living leg,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen as dull as swipes. You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin,\r\nto recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I\xe2\x80\x99m as flat as a\r\njuryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhad the good natur\xe2\x80\x99 to amuse this youngster. Horrid dull, I\xe2\x80\x99m blessed\r\nif I an\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit\r\nswept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with\r\na haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly\r\nbeneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he\r\nswaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that\r\nMr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots\r\ntill they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his\r\nacquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t value his losses the snap of his little finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot a rum chap you are, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Bates, highly amused by this\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Chitling. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very clever fellow, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, patting him on the\r\nshoulder, and winking to his other pupils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an\xe2\x80\x99t he, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt at all of that, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nFagin?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much so, indeed, my dear. They\xe2\x80\x99re only jealous, Tom, because he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t give it to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom, triumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s where it is! He has cleaned me\r\nout. But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can\xe2\x80\x99t I, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up\r\nyour loss at once, and don\xe2\x80\x99t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime you were on the lay. Come! It\xe2\x80\x99s near ten, and nothing done yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their\r\nhats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging,\r\nas they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in\r\nwhose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very\r\nconspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as there are a great number of\r\nspirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.\r\nChitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine\r\ngentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their\r\nreputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, when they had left the room, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and get you\r\nthat cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where I\r\nkeep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money,\r\nfor I\xe2\x80\x99ve got none to lock up, my dear\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x94none to lock up. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of seeing the young\r\npeople about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nhastily concealing the key in his breast; \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x99s that? Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared\r\nin no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person,\r\nwhoever he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice reached\r\nher ears. The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and\r\nshawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table.\r\nThe Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint\r\nof the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably,\r\nwith the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had\r\nbeen unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nman I expected before; he\xe2\x80\x99s coming downstairs. Not a word about the\r\nmoney while he\xe2\x80\x99s here, Nance. He won\xe2\x80\x99t stop long. Not ten minutes, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to\r\nthe door, as a man\xe2\x80\x99s step was heard upon the stairs without. He reached\r\nit, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the\r\nroom, was close upon the girl before he observed her.\r\n\r\nIt was Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one of my young people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, observing that Monks drew\r\nback, on beholding a stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t move, Nancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of\r\ncareless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she\r\nstole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if\r\nthere had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly\r\nhave believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny news?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94good?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the\r\nother man by being too sanguine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot bad, any way,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been prompt\r\nenough this time. Let me have a word with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room,\r\nalthough she could see that Monks was pointing to her. The Jew: perhaps\r\nfearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he\r\nendeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that infernal hole we were in before,\xe2\x80\x9d she could hear the man say\r\nas they went upstairs. Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did\r\nnot reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his\r\ncompanion to the second story.\r\n\r\nBefore the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the\r\nhouse, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely\r\nover her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door,\r\nlistening with breathless interest. The moment the noise ceased, she\r\nglided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and\r\nsilence; and was lost in the gloom above.\r\n\r\nThe room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl\r\nglided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards,\r\nthe two men were heard descending. Monks went at once into the street;\r\nand the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money. When he returned, the\r\ngirl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Nance!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the\r\ncandle, \xe2\x80\x9chow pale you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPale!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look\r\nsteadily at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how long and all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! Let me get\r\nback; that\xe2\x80\x99s a dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her\r\nhand. They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep;\r\nand seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue\r\nher way. Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite\r\nopposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened\r\nher pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run. After\r\ncompletely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if\r\nsuddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do\r\nsomething she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\nIt might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full\r\nhopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with\r\nnearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover\r\nlost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own\r\nthoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the\r\nhousebreaker.\r\n\r\nIf she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes,\r\nhe did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the\r\nmoney, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of\r\nsatisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the\r\nslumbers which her arrival had interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so\r\nmuch employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal\r\nhad so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his\r\ntemper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical\r\nupon her behaviour and deportment. That she had all the abstracted and\r\nnervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous\r\nstep, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would\r\nhave been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have\r\ntaken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of\r\ndiscrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than\r\nthose which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour\r\ntowards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable\r\ncondition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her\r\ndemeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had\r\nher agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been\r\nvery unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.\r\n\r\nAs that day closed in, the girl\xe2\x80\x99s excitement increased; and, when night\r\ncame on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink\r\nhimself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire\r\nin her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water\r\nwith his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass\r\ntowards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when\r\nthese symptoms first struck him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, burn my body!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, raising himself on his hands as he\r\nstared the girl in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look like a corpse come to life\r\nagain. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing. What do you look at me so hard\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat foolery is this?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and\r\nshaking her roughly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What do you mean? What are you\r\nthinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf many things, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so,\r\npressing her hands upon her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Lord! What odds in that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed\r\nto produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look\r\nwhich had preceded them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you wot it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes; \xe2\x80\x9cif you haven\xe2\x80\x99t caught the fever,\r\nand got it comin\xe2\x80\x99 on, now, there\xe2\x80\x99s something more than usual in the\r\nwind, and something dangerous too. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a-going to\xe2\x80\x94. No, damme!\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the\r\nwords to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave cut her throat three months ago. She\xe2\x80\x99s got the fever coming on;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the\r\nbottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The\r\ngirl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with\r\nher back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank\r\noff the contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber, \xe2\x80\x9ccome and sit aside of me, and put on your own\r\nface; or I\xe2\x80\x99ll alter it so, that you won\xe2\x80\x99t know it agin when you do want\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the\r\npillow: turning his eyes upon her face. They closed; opened again;\r\nclosed once more; again opened. He shifted his position restlessly;\r\nand, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as\r\noften springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about\r\nhim, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of\r\nrising, into a deep and heavy sleep. The grasp of his hand relaxed; the\r\nupraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a\r\nprofound trance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe laudanum has taken effect at last,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the girl, as she rose\r\nfrom the bedside. \xe2\x80\x9cI may be too late, even now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully\r\nround, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she\r\nexpected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes\xe2\x80\x99s heavy hand upon\r\nher shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the\r\nrobber\xe2\x80\x99s lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with\r\nnoiseless touch, hurried from the house.\r\n\r\nA watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which\r\nshe had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas it long gone the half-hour?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll strike the hour in another quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man: raising his\r\nlantern to her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Nancy:\r\nbrushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.\r\n\r\nMany of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues\r\nthrough which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards\r\nthe West-End of London. The clock struck ten, increasing her\r\nimpatience. She tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers\r\nfrom side to side; and darting almost under the horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads, crossed\r\ncrowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their\r\nopportunity to do the like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman is mad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the people, turning to look after her as she\r\nrushed away.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were\r\ncomparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still\r\ngreater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. Some\r\nquickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening\r\nat such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back,\r\nsurprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and\r\nwhen she neared her place of destination, she was alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. As\r\nthe brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her\r\nto the spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces\r\nas though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound\r\ndetermined her, and she stepped into the hall. The porter\xe2\x80\x99s seat was\r\nvacant. She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced\r\ntowards the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, young woman!\xe2\x80\x9d said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a\r\ndoor behind her, \xe2\x80\x9cwho do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady who is stopping in this house,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady!\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Maylie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy.\r\n\r\nThe young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied\r\nonly by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her.\r\nTo him, Nancy repeated her request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name am I to say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s of no use saying any,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor business?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nor that neither,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI must see the lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, pushing her towards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of this. Take\r\nyourself off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be carried out if I go!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl violently; \xe2\x80\x9cand I can\r\nmake that a job that two of you won\xe2\x80\x99t like to do. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there anybody\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking round, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will see a simple message carried\r\nfor a poor wretch like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who\r\nwith some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward\r\nto interfere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it up for her, Joe; can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said this person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose the young lady\r\nwill see such as her; do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis allusion to Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of\r\nchaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great\r\nfervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly\r\nadvocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what you like with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, turning to the men again;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for\r\nGod Almighty\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that\r\nthe man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it to be?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, with one foot on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNancy; \xe2\x80\x9cand that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to\r\nsay, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned\r\nout of doors as an impostor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re coming it strong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou give the message,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl firmly; \xe2\x80\x9cand let me hear the\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man ran upstairs. Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless,\r\nlistening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn,\r\nof which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they\r\nbecame still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman\r\nwas to walk upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good being proper in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first housemaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe third contented herself with wondering \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ladies was made of\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand the fourth took the first in a quartette of \xe2\x80\x9cShameful!\xe2\x80\x9d with which\r\nthe Dianas concluded.\r\n\r\nRegardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy\r\nfollowed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber,\r\nlighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XL.\r\nA STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most\r\nnoisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light\r\nstep approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered,\r\nand thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another\r\nmoment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame,\r\nand shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with\r\nwhom she had sought this interview.\r\n\r\nBut struggling with these better feelings was pride,\xe2\x80\x94the vice of the\r\nlowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and\r\nself-assured. The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the\r\nfallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the\r\njails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,\xe2\x80\x94even\r\nthis degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the\r\nwomanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected\r\nher with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so\r\nmany, many traces when a very child.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which\r\npresented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending\r\nthem on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a hard matter to get to see you, lady. If I had taken offence,\r\nand gone away, as many would have done, you\xe2\x80\x99d have been sorry for it\r\none day, and not without reason either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think of that. Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the\r\nperson you inquired for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the\r\nabsence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl\r\ncompletely by surprise, and she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lady, lady!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, clasping her hands passionately before her\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9cif there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94there would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are in poverty or affliction\r\nI shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,\xe2\x80\x94I shall indeed. Sit\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me stand, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, still weeping, \xe2\x80\x9cand do not speak\r\nto me so kindly till you know me better. It is growing late. Is\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ndoor shut?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance\r\nin case she should require it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cI am about to put my life and the lives of\r\nothers in your hands. I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to\r\nold Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose Maylie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, lady!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the infamous creature you have heard\r\nof, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment\r\nI can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known\r\nany better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me\r\nGod! Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you\r\nwould think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women\r\nfall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dreadful things are these!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, involuntarily falling from\r\nher strange companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nhad friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you\r\nwere never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94something worse than all\xe2\x80\x94as I have been from my cradle. I may\r\nuse the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be\r\nmy deathbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pity you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, in a broken voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wrings my heart to hear\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven bless you for your goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew\r\nwhat I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away\r\nfrom those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to\r\ntell you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cand knew you were here, for it was\r\nby hearing him tell the place that I found you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard the name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he goes by some other amongst us,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I\r\nmore than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put\r\ninto your house on the night of the robbery, I\xe2\x80\x94suspecting this\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.\r\nI found out, from what I heard, that Monks\xe2\x80\x94the man I asked you about,\r\nyou know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94That Monks,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the girl, \xe2\x80\x9chad seen him accidently with two of\r\nour boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be\r\nthe same child that he was watching for, though I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out\r\nwhy. A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he\r\nshould have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a\r\nthief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of\r\nfinding out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cand there are not many people besides me\r\nthat could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery. But I\r\ndid; and I saw him no more till last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what occurred then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, lady. Last night he came again. Again they went\r\nupstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray\r\nme, again listened at the door. The first words I heard Monks say were\r\nthese: \xe2\x80\x98So the only proofs of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s identity lie at the bottom of\r\nthe river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is\r\nrotting in her coffin.\xe2\x80\x99 They laughed, and talked of his success in\r\ndoing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,\r\nsaid that though he had got the young devil\xe2\x80\x99s money safely now, he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been\r\nto have brought down the boast of the father\xe2\x80\x99s will, by driving him\r\nthrough every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital\r\nfelony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit\r\nof him besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to\r\nyours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nwithout bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he\r\ntook advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. \xe2\x80\x98In\r\nshort, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis brother!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose were his words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had\r\nscarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes\r\nhaunted her perpetually. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd more. When he spoke of you and the other\r\nlady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against\r\nhim, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said\r\nthere was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds\r\nof thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who\r\nyour two-legged spaniel was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, turning very pale, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell me that this\r\nwas said in earnest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\ngirl, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is an earnest man when his hatred is up. I\r\nknow many who do worse things; but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather listen to them all a\r\ndozen times, than to that Monks once. It is growing late, and I have to\r\nreach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this.\r\nI must get back quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cTo what use can I turn this\r\ncommunication without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to\r\ncompanions you paint in such terrible colors? If you repeat this\r\ninformation to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the\r\nnext room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to go back,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go back, because\xe2\x80\x94how can I\r\ntell such things to an innocent lady like you?\xe2\x80\x94because among the men I\r\nhave told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour having interfered in this dear boy\xe2\x80\x99s behalf before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard;\r\nyour manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your\r\nevident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you\r\nmight yet be reclaimed. Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the earnest girl, folding her hands\r\nas the tears coursed down her face, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not turn a deaf ear to the\r\nentreaties of one of your own sex; the first\xe2\x80\x94the first, I do believe,\r\nwho ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion. Do hear\r\nmy words, and let me save you yet, for better things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, sinking on her knees, \xe2\x80\x9cdear, sweet, angel lady,\r\nyou _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and\r\nif I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of\r\nsin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is never too late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cfor penitence and atonement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot leave\r\nhim now! I could not be his death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing could save him,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I told others what I have\r\ntold you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is\r\nthe boldest, and has been so cruel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cthat for such a man as this, you can\r\nresign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is\r\nmadness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cI only know that it is\r\nso, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and\r\nwretched as myself. I must go back. Whether it is God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath for the\r\nwrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through\r\nevery suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew\r\nthat I was to die by his hand at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI should not let you depart from me\r\nthus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should, lady, and I know you will,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl, rising.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness,\r\nand forced no promise from you, as I might have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what use, then, is the communication you have made?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me,\r\nbenefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a\r\nsecret, and advise you what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where can I find you again when it is necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndo not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will\r\nyou be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and\r\ncome alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I\r\nshall not be watched or followed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise you solemnly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe girl without hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cI will walk on London Bridge if I am\r\nalive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay another moment,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly\r\ntowards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cThink once again on your own condition, and the\r\nopportunity you have of escaping from it. You have a claim on me: not\r\nonly as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost\r\nalmost beyond redemption. Will you return to this gang of robbers, and\r\nto this man, when a word can save you? What fascination is it that can\r\ntake you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is\r\nthere no chord in your heart that I can touch! Is there nothing left,\r\nto which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\ngirl steadily, \xe2\x80\x9cgive away your hearts, love will carry you all\r\nlengths\xe2\x80\x94even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers,\r\neverything, to fill them. When such as I, who have no certain roof but\r\nthe coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital\r\nnurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place\r\nthat has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to\r\ncure us? Pity us, lady\xe2\x80\x94pity us for having only one feeling of the woman\r\nleft, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort\r\nand a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9ctake some money from me, which\r\nmay enable you to live without dishonesty\xe2\x80\x94at all events until we meet\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a penny,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, waving her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRose, stepping gently forward. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to serve you indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would serve me best, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, wringing her hands,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think\r\nof what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be\r\nsomething not to die in the hell in which I have lived. God bless you,\r\nsweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought\r\nshame on mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away;\r\nwhile Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which\r\nhad more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank\r\ninto a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLI.\r\nCONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE\r\nMISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE\r\n\r\n\r\nHer situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While\r\nshe felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in\r\nwhich Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the\r\nconfidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed,\r\nhad reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner\r\nhad touched Rose Maylie\xe2\x80\x99s heart; and, mingled with her love for her\r\nyoung charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was\r\nher fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.\r\n\r\nThey purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing\r\nfor some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of\r\nthe first day. What course of action could she determine upon, which\r\ncould be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone\r\nthe journey without exciting suspicion?\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but\r\nRose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first\r\nexplosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her\r\nrepresentations in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s behalf could be seconded by no\r\nexperienced person. These were all reasons for the greatest caution and\r\nmost circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose\r\nfirst impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy\r\ndoctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if\r\nshe had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the\r\nsame reason. Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance\r\nfrom Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting,\r\nand it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when\xe2\x80\x94the tears rose to\r\nher eyes as she pursued this train of reflection\xe2\x80\x94he might have by this\r\ntime learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.\r\n\r\nDisturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course\r\nand then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive\r\nconsideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and\r\nanxious night. After more communing with herself next day, she arrived\r\nat the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be painful to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cto come back here, how painful\r\nit will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may\r\ncome himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me\xe2\x80\x94he did when he\r\nwent away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very\r\npaper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.\r\n\r\nShe had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and\r\nhad considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without\r\nwriting the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the\r\nstreets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such\r\nbreathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new\r\ncause of alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you look so flurried?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rose, advancing to meet him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the boy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be\r\nable to know that I have told you the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought you had told us anything but the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose,\r\nsoothing him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is this?\xe2\x80\x94of whom do you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, scarcely able to\r\narticulate, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gentleman who was so good to me\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Brownlow, that we\r\nhave so often talked about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting out of a coach,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand going into a house. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him,\r\nfor he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up\r\nto him. But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said\r\nhe did. Look here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, \xe2\x80\x9chere it is;\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s where he lives\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me!\r\nWhat shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many\r\nother incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was\r\nCraven Street, in the Strand. She very soon determined upon turning the\r\ndiscovery to account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to\r\ngo with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute\xe2\x80\x99s loss of\r\ntime. I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and\r\nbe ready as soon as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five\r\nminutes they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived\r\nthere, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the\r\nold gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,\r\nrequested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. The servant\r\nsoon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him\r\ninto an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman\r\nof benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. At no great distance\r\nfrom whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and\r\ngaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting\r\nwith his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin\r\npropped thereupon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising\r\nwith great politeness, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, young lady\xe2\x80\x94I imagined it was\r\nsome importunate person who\xe2\x80\x94I beg you will excuse me. Be seated, pray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, glancing from the other\r\ngentleman to the one who had spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my name,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my friend, Mr.\r\nGrimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Miss Maylie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat at this period of our\r\ninterview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If\r\nI am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I\r\nwish to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow inclined his head. Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very\r\nstiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and\r\ndropped into it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, naturally\r\nembarrassed; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a\r\nvery dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest\r\nin hearing of him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOliver Twist you knew him as,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose.\r\n\r\nThe words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been\r\naffecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with\r\na great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his\r\nfeatures every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged\r\nin a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed\r\nso much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into\r\nhis former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long\r\ndeep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air,\r\nbut to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.\r\n\r\nMr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not\r\nexpressed in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to\r\nMiss Maylie\xe2\x80\x99s, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the\r\nquestion that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which\r\nnobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce\r\nany evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once\r\ninduced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name put me in\r\npossession of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad one! I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mr.\r\nGrimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle\r\nof his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose,\r\ncolouring; \xe2\x80\x9cand that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his\r\nyears, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do\r\nhonour to many who have numbered his days six times over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only sixty-one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\r\nas the devil\xe2\x80\x99s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see the application of that remark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9che does not\r\nmean what he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he does,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he does not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll eat his head, if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Mr.\r\nGrimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.\r\n\r\nHaving gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and\r\nafterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Maylie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cto return to the subject in\r\nwhich your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what\r\nintelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I\r\nexhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I\r\nhave been absent from this country, my first impression that he had\r\nimposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob\r\nme, has been considerably shaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a\r\nfew natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.\r\nBrownlow\xe2\x80\x99s house; reserving Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s information for that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivate ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,\r\nfor some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former\r\nbenefactor and friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is great happiness to me,\r\ngreat happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie.\r\nYou must pardon my finding fault with you,\xe2\x80\x94but why not have brought\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is waiting in a coach at the door,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this door!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out of\r\nthe room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach,\r\nwithout another word.\r\n\r\nWhen the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head,\r\nand converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot,\r\ndescribed three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and\r\nthe table; sitting in it all the time. After performing this evolution,\r\nhe rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a\r\ndozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without\r\nthe slightest preface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual\r\nproceeding. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. I\xe2\x80\x99m old enough to be your grandfather.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former\r\nseat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig\r\nreceived very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had\r\nbeen the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s behalf,\r\nRose Maylie would have been well repaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cSend Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and\r\ndropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, rather\r\ntestily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that I do, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, at my\r\ntime of life, don\xe2\x80\x99t improve with age, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have told you that,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cbut put on your\r\nglasses, and see if you can\xe2\x80\x99t find out what you were wanted for, will\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to\r\nhis first impulse, he sprang into her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be good to me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old lady, embracing him; \xe2\x80\x9cit is my\r\ninnocent boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear old nurse!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would come back\xe2\x80\x94I knew he would,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, holding him in\r\nher arms. \xe2\x80\x9cHow well he looks, and how like a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s son he is\r\ndressed again! Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same\r\nsweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad. I have\r\nnever forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day,\r\nside by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I\r\nwas a lightsome young creature.\xe2\x80\x9d Running on thus, and now holding\r\nOliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and\r\npassing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and\r\nwept upon his neck by turns.\r\n\r\nLeaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led\r\nthe way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration\r\nof her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise\r\nand perplexity. Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in\r\nher friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman\r\nconsidered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold\r\nsolemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. To afford him an\r\nearly opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged\r\nthat he should call at the hotel at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening, and\r\nthat in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all\r\nthat had occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\nRose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wrath.\r\nNancy\xe2\x80\x99s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a\r\nshower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the\r\nfirst victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff;\r\nand actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the\r\nassistance of those worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first\r\noutbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in\r\npart, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was\r\nhimself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and\r\nrepresentations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his\r\nhotbrained purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what the devil is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said the impetuous doctor, when\r\nthey had rejoined the two ladies. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we to pass a vote of thanks to\r\nall these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred\r\npounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some\r\nslight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly that,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we must\r\nproceed gently and with great care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentleness and care,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d send them one and all\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind where,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cBut reflect whether\r\nsending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat object?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply, the discovery of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s parentage, and regaining for him the\r\ninheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently\r\ndeprived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost forgot that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cplacing this poor girl entirely out\r\nof the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these\r\nscoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should\r\nwe bring about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHanging a few of them at least, in all probability,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the\r\ndoctor, \xe2\x80\x9cand transporting the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cbut no doubt they will\r\nbring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step\r\nin to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very\r\nQuixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest\xe2\x80\x94or at least to\r\nOliver\xe2\x80\x99s, which is the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in\r\ngetting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man,\r\nMonks, upon his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by\r\ncatching him when he is not surrounded by these people. For, suppose he\r\nwere apprehended, we have no proof against him. He is not even (so far\r\nas we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in\r\nany of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely\r\nthat he could receive any further punishment than being committed to\r\nprison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth\r\nwould be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes,\r\nbe deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor impetuously, \xe2\x80\x9cI put it to you again, whether\r\nyou think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be\r\nconsidered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest\r\nintentions, but really\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cThe promise\r\nshall be kept. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will, in the slightest degree,\r\ninterfere with our proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any\r\nprecise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to\r\nascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the\r\nunderstanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law;\r\nor, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an\r\naccount of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us\r\nto identify him. She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is\r\nTuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly\r\nquiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving\r\na delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course\r\noccurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very\r\nstrongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s proposition was carried\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. He\r\nis a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material\r\nassistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted\r\nthe Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of\r\ncourse, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not,\r\nyou must determine for yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in\r\nmine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must put it to the vote,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cwho may he be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat lady\xe2\x80\x99s son, and this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94very old friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndoctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an\r\nexpressive glance at her niece.\r\n\r\nRose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this\r\nmotion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and\r\nMr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe stay in town, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile there remains\r\nthe slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of\r\nsuccess. I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the\r\nobject in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to\r\nremain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that\r\nany hope remains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as I see on the faces about me, a\r\ndisposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to\r\ncorroborate Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me\r\nstipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may\r\ndeem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe\r\nme, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite\r\nhopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and\r\ndisappointments already quite numerous enough. Come! Supper has been\r\nannounced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will\r\nhave begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company,\r\nand entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and\r\nescorted her into the supper-room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose;\r\nand the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLII.\r\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER\xe2\x80\x99S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,\r\nBECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on\r\nher self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London,\r\nby the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that\r\nthis history should bestow some attention.\r\n\r\nThey were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as\r\na male and female: for the former was one of those long-limbed,\r\nknock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign\r\nany precise age,\xe2\x80\x94looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like\r\nundergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys. The\r\nwoman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been\r\nto bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back.\r\nHer companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely\r\ndangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel\r\nwrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough. This\r\ncircumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual\r\nextent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in\r\nadvance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an\r\nimpatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging\r\nher to greater exertion.\r\n\r\nThus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any\r\nobject within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider\r\npassage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until\r\nthey passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller\r\nstopped and called impatiently to his companion,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, can\xe2\x80\x99t yer? What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a heavy load, I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the female, coming up, almost\r\nbreathless with fatigue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavy! What are yer talking about? What are yer made for?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nthe male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the\r\nother shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nenough to tire anybody\xe2\x80\x99s patience out, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it much farther?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the woman, resting herself against a bank,\r\nand looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch farther! Yer as good as there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the long-legged tramper,\r\npointing out before him. \xe2\x80\x9cLook there! Those are the lights of London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re a good two mile off, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman despondingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind whether they\xe2\x80\x99re two mile off, or twenty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah\r\nClaypole; for he it was; \xe2\x80\x9cbut get up and come on, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll kick yer, and\r\nso I give yer notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Noah\xe2\x80\x99s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road\r\nwhile speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution,\r\nthe woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, after they\r\nhad walked a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably\r\nimpaired by walking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not near,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Claypole. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! Not near; so don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I tell yer that I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do a thing, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough,\r\nwithout any why or because either,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Claypole with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be so cross,\xe2\x80\x9d said his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty thing it would be, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it to go and stop at the very\r\nfirst public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up\r\nafter us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart\r\nwith handcuffs on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! I shall\r\ngo and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop\r\ntill we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCod, yer may thanks yer stars I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a head; for if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone,\r\nat first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady. And serve yer\r\nright for being a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I ain\xe2\x80\x99t as cunning as you are,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nput all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. You\r\nwould have been if I had been, any way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nClaypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took it for you, Noah, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I keep it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm\r\nthrough his.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole\xe2\x80\x99s habit to\r\nrepose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be\r\nobserved, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte\r\nto this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be\r\nfound on her: which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his\r\ninnocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of\r\nescape. Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of\r\nhis motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without\r\nhalting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely\r\njudged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that\r\nLondon began in earnest. Just pausing to observe which appeared the\r\nmost crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he\r\ncrossed into Saint John\xe2\x80\x99s Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of\r\nthe intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Lane and\r\nSmithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst\r\nthat improvement has left in the midst of London.\r\n\r\nThrough these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after\r\nhim; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole\r\nexternal character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as\r\nsome fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his\r\npurpose. At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in\r\nappearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed\r\nover and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced\r\nhis intention of putting up there, for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo give us the bundle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders, and slinging it over his own; \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t yer speak, except\r\nwhen yer spoke to. What\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the house\xe2\x80\x94t-h-r\xe2\x80\x94three what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCripples,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree Cripples,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Noah, \xe2\x80\x9cand a very good sign too. Now, then!\r\nKeep close at my heels, and come along.\xe2\x80\x9d With these injunctions, he\r\npushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house,\r\nfollowed by his companion.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows\r\non the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at\r\nNoah, and Noah stared very hard at him.\r\n\r\nIf Noah had been attired in his charity-boy\xe2\x80\x99s dress, there might have\r\nbeen some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had\r\ndiscarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his\r\nleathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting\r\nso much attention in a public-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the Three Cripples?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the dabe of this \xe2\x80\x99ouse,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country,\r\nrecommended us here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her\r\nattention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and\r\nperhaps to warn her to betray no surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to sleep here\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99b dot certaid you cad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barney, who was the attendant sprite;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll idquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer\r\nwhile yer inquiring, will yer?\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah.\r\n\r\nBarney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting\r\nthe required viands before them; having done which, he informed the\r\ntravellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable\r\ncouple to their refreshment.\r\n\r\nNow, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps\r\nlower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small\r\ncurtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the\r\nlast-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only\r\nlook down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of\r\nbeing observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between\r\nwhich and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but\r\ncould, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable\r\ndistinctness, their subject of conversation. The landlord of the house\r\nhad not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes,\r\nand Barney had only just returned from making the communication above\r\nrelated, when Fagin, in the course of his evening\xe2\x80\x99s business, came into\r\nthe bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Barney: \xe2\x80\x9cstradegers id the next roob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrangers!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the old man in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Ad rub uds too,\xe2\x80\x9d added Barney. \xe2\x80\x9cFrob the cuttry, but subthig in\r\nyour way, or I\xe2\x80\x99b bistaked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.\r\n\r\nMounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass,\r\nfrom which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from\r\nthe dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses\r\nof both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, looking round to Barney, \xe2\x80\x9cI like that fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlooks. He\xe2\x80\x99d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ntalk\xe2\x80\x94let me hear \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the\r\npartition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his\r\nface, that might have appertained to some old goblin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I mean to be a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs,\r\nand continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had\r\narrived too late to hear. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like that well enough, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tills\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTills be blowed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Claypole; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s more things besides\r\ntills to be emptied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPockets, women\xe2\x80\x99s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nClaypole, rising with the porter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t do all that, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall look out to get into company with them as can,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you\r\nyourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and\r\ndeceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Charlotte,\r\nimprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do: don\xe2\x80\x99t yer be too affectionate, in case I\xe2\x80\x99m cross\r\nwith yer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nlike to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of \xe2\x80\x99em, and\r\nfollering \xe2\x80\x99em about, unbeknown to themselves. That would suit me, if\r\nthere was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman\r\nof this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot,\xe2\x80\x94especially as we don\xe2\x80\x99t very well know how to get rid of it\r\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot\r\nwith an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents,\r\nnodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he\r\nappeared greatly refreshed. He was meditating another, when the sudden\r\nopening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was Mr. Fagin. And very amiable he looked, and a very low\r\nbow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest\r\ntable, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin,\r\nrubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the country, I see, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do yer see that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noah Claypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not so much dust as that in London,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, pointing\r\nfrom Noah\xe2\x80\x99s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two\r\nbundles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer a sharp feller,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew,\r\nsinking his voice to a confidential whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his\r\nright forefinger,\xe2\x80\x94a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not\r\nwith complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large\r\nenough for the purpose. However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the\r\nendeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put\r\nabout the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood stuff that,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cA man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket,\r\nor a woman\xe2\x80\x99s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he\r\ndrinks it regularly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he\r\nfell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a\r\ncountenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. \xe2\x80\x9cHa!\r\nha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very\r\nlucky it was only me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs\r\nlike an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could\r\nunder his chair; \xe2\x80\x9cit was all her doing; yer\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now, Charlotte,\r\nyer know yer have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter who\xe2\x80\x99s got it, or who did it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin,\r\nglancing, nevertheless, with a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s eye at the girl and the two\r\nbundles. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in that way myself, and I like you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that way of business,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Fagin; \xe2\x80\x9cand so are the people of\r\nthe house. You\xe2\x80\x99ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe\r\nhere as you could be. There is not a safer place in all this town than\r\nis the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so. And I have taken a\r\nfancy to you and the young woman; so I\xe2\x80\x99ve said the word, and you may\r\nmake your minds easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole\xe2\x80\x99s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but\r\nhis body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into\r\nvarious uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled\r\nfear and suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by\r\ndint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got a friend\r\nthat I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right\r\nway, where you can take whatever department of the business you think\r\nwill suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYer speak as if yer were in earnest,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat advantage would it be to me to be anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Fagin,\r\nshrugging his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cHere! Let me have a word with you outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, getting\r\nhis legs by gradual degrees abroad again. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll take the luggage\r\nupstairs the while. Charlotte, see to them bundles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed\r\nwithout the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off\r\nwith the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s kept tolerably well under, ain\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked as he resumed\r\nhis seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na genius, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I suppose if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nI say, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be back if yer lose time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you was to like my friend,\r\ncould you do better than join him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in a good way of business; that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is!\xe2\x80\x9d responded Noah,\r\nwinking one of his little eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best\r\nsociety in the profession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegular town-maders?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a countryman among \xe2\x80\x99em; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d take you, even on\r\nmy recommendation, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t run rather short of assistants just\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould I have to hand over?\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be done without,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, in a most\r\ndecided manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty pound, though\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when it\xe2\x80\x99s in a note you can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cNumber\r\nand date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah! It\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nworth much to him. It\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go abroad, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell it for\r\na great deal in the market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen could I see him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noah doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the wages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive like a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94board and lodging, pipes and spirits free\xe2\x80\x94half\r\nof all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr.\r\nFagin.\r\n\r\nWhether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least\r\ncomprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he\r\nbeen a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected\r\nthat, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new\r\nacquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely\r\nthings had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought\r\nthat would suit him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, yer see,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Noah, \xe2\x80\x9cas she will be able to do a good deal,\r\nI should like to take something very light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little fancy work?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! something of that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think would\r\nsuit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very\r\ndangerous, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend wants somebody who would do that well,\r\nvery much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I did mention that, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind turning my hand to it\r\nsometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay by\r\nitself, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it might not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not\r\nmuch more risk than being at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of the old ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\ndeal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running\r\nround the corner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noah,\r\nshaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that would answer my purpose. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere any other line open?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah\xe2\x80\x99s knee. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kinchin lay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe kinchins, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cis the young children that\xe2\x80\x99s sent\r\non errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay\r\nis just to take their money away\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve always got it ready in their\r\nhands,\xe2\x80\x94then knock \xe2\x80\x99em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if\r\nthere were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt\r\nitself. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, that\xe2\x80\x99s the very thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin; \xe2\x80\x9cand you can have a few good beats\r\nchalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like\r\nthat, where they\xe2\x80\x99re always going errands; and you can upset as many\r\nkinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a\r\nburst of laughter both long and loud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and\r\nCharlotte had returned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat time to-morrow shall we say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill ten do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name shall I tell my good friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bolter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such\r\nemergency. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Morris Bolter. This is Mrs. Bolter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s humble servant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, bowing with grotesque\r\npoliteness. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall know her better very shortly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Noah, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Morris\r\nBolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I understand\xe2\x80\x94perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, telling the truth for\r\nonce. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night! Good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah\r\nClaypole, bespeaking his good lady\xe2\x80\x99s attention, proceeded to enlighten\r\nher relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness\r\nand air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex,\r\nbut a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on\r\nthe kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLIII.\r\nWHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it was you that was your own friend, was it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr.\r\nClaypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into\r\nbetween them, he had removed next day to Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s house. \xe2\x80\x9cCod, I thought\r\nas much last night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery man\xe2\x80\x99s his own friend, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, with his most\r\ninsinuating grin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t as good a one as himself anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of\r\nthe world. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people are nobody\xe2\x80\x99s enemies but their own, yer know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t believe that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a man\xe2\x80\x99s his own enemy, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly because he\xe2\x80\x99s too much his own friend; not because he\xe2\x80\x99s careful for\r\neverybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There ain\xe2\x80\x99t such a thing in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere oughn\xe2\x80\x99t to be, if there is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat stands to reason. Some conjurers say that number three is the\r\nmagic number, and some say number seven. It\xe2\x80\x99s neither, my friend,\r\nneither. It\xe2\x80\x99s number one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bolter. \xe2\x80\x9cNumber one for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a little community like ours, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, who felt it\r\nnecessary to qualify this position, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have a general number one,\r\nwithout considering me too as the same, and all the other young\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nare so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must\r\nbe so. For instance, it\xe2\x80\x99s your object to take care of number\r\none\xe2\x80\x94meaning yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bolter. \xe2\x80\x9cYer about right there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! You can\xe2\x80\x99t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care\r\nof me, number one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumber two, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with\r\nthe quality of selfishness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m of the same importance to you, as\r\nyou are to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr. Bolter, \xe2\x80\x9cyer a very nice man, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very\r\nfond of yer; but we ain\xe2\x80\x99t quite so thick together, as all that comes\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out\r\nhis hands; \xe2\x80\x9conly consider. You\xe2\x80\x99ve done what\xe2\x80\x99s a very pretty thing, and\r\nwhat I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the\r\ncravat round your throat, that\xe2\x80\x99s so very easily tied and so very\r\ndifficult to unloose\xe2\x80\x94in plain English, the halter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it\r\ninconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not\r\nin substance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gallows,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gallows, my dear, is an ugly\r\nfinger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has\r\nstopped many a bold fellow\xe2\x80\x99s career on the broad highway. To keep in\r\nthe easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bolter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do yer talk about such\r\nthings for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to show you my meaning clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, raising his\r\neyebrows. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my little\r\nbusiness all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number one, the\r\nsecond my number one. The more you value your number one, the more\r\ncareful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do\r\nso, unless we would all go to pieces in company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! yer a cunning\r\nold codger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no\r\nmere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a\r\nsense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should\r\nentertain in the outset of their acquaintance. To strengthen an\r\nimpression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by\r\nacquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his\r\noperations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his\r\npurpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrespect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with\r\na degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under\r\nheavy losses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cMy best hand was taken from me, yesterday\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say he died?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cnot so bad as that. Not quite so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, I suppose he was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanted,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he was wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery particular?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cnot very. He was charged with attempting to pick\r\na pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,\xe2\x80\x94his own, my dear,\r\nhis own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. They\r\nremanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner. Ah! he\r\nwas worth fifty boxes, and I\xe2\x80\x99d give the price of as many to have him\r\nback. You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known\r\nthe Dodger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but I shall know him, I hope; don\xe2\x80\x99t yer think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBolter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m doubtful about it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they don\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nany fresh evidence, it\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a summary conviction, and we shall\r\nhave him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it\xe2\x80\x99s a case\r\nof lagging. They know what a clever lad he is; he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a lifer.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by lagging and a lifer?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Bolter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe good of talking in that way to me; why don\xe2\x80\x99t yer speak so as I can\r\nunderstand yer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the\r\nvulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been\r\ninformed that they represented that combination of words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctransportation for life,\xe2\x80\x9d when the dialogue was cut short by the entry\r\nof Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face\r\ntwisted into a look of semi-comical woe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all up, Fagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, when he and his new companion had\r\nbeen made known to each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncoming to \xe2\x80\x99dentify him; and the Artful\xe2\x80\x99s booked for a passage out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Master Bates. \xe2\x80\x9cI must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and\r\na hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels. To\r\nthink of Jack Dawkins\xe2\x80\x94lummy Jack\xe2\x80\x94the Dodger\xe2\x80\x94the Artful Dodger\xe2\x80\x94going\r\nabroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box! I never thought he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\na done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest. Oh, why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out\r\nas a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor\r\nglory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master\r\nBates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and\r\ndespondency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t he always\r\nthe top-sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him\r\nor come near him on any scent! Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnot one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what do you talk of?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin angrily; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you\r\nblubbering for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Cause it isn\xe2\x80\x99t on the rec-ord, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, chafed into\r\nperfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cause it can\xe2\x80\x99t come out in the \xe2\x80\x99dictment; \xe2\x80\x99cause nobody will never\r\nknow half of what he was. How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar?\r\nP\xe2\x80\x99raps not be there at all. Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr.\r\nBolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the\r\npalsy; \xe2\x80\x9csee what a pride they take in their profession, my dear. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of\r\nCharley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to\r\nthat young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Charley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin soothingly; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll come out, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nsure to come out. They\xe2\x80\x99ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshow it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers. Think how\r\nyoung he is too! What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time\r\nof life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is a honour that is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley, a little consoled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall have all he wants,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall be kept in\r\nthe Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman. Like a gentleman! With his\r\nbeer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t spend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, shall he though?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that he shall,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a big-wig, Charley:\r\none that\xe2\x80\x99s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence;\r\nand he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll read\r\nit all in the papers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Artful Dodger\xe2\x80\x94shrieks of laughter\xe2\x80\x94here the court\r\nwas convulsed\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94eh, Charley, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Master Bates, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a lark that would be, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit, Fagin? I say, how the Artful would bother \xe2\x80\x99em wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall\xe2\x80\x94he will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to be sure, so he will,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I see him now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his\r\npupil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Charley Bates. \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha! so do I. I see it all\r\nafore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin. What a game! What a regular game!\r\nAll the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge\xe2\x80\x99s own son making\r\na speech arter dinner\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s eccentric\r\ndisposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to\r\nconsider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now\r\nlooked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and\r\nexquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time\r\nwhen his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying his abilities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for the world,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad, my dear, stark mad,\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99d walk into the very place where\xe2\x80\x94No, Charley, no. One is\r\nenough to lose at a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to go yourself, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Charley with a\r\nhumorous leer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite fit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why don\xe2\x80\x99t you send this new cove?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Master Bates, laying his\r\nhand on Noah\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d observed Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Charley. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should he have to mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally nothing, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, \xe2\x80\x9creally\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I dare say about that, yer know,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Noah, backing towards\r\nthe door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94none\r\nof that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not in my department, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot department has he got, Fagin?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Master Bates, surveying\r\nNoah\xe2\x80\x99s lank form with much disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cutting away when there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there\xe2\x80\x99s everything\r\nright; is that his branch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Bolter; \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t yer take liberties with\r\nyer superiors, little boy, or yer\xe2\x80\x99ll find yerself in the wrong shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it\r\nwas some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter\r\nthat he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office;\r\nthat, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had\r\nengaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to\r\nthe metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of\r\nhaving resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly\r\ndisguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in\r\nLondon, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which\r\nhe could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.\r\n\r\nPersuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much\r\ngreater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented,\r\nwith a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirections, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles\r\nthe Jew had at hand. He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well\r\ngarnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter\xe2\x80\x99s whip. Thus equipped, he\r\nwas to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent\r\nGarden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his\r\ncuriousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow\r\nas need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs\r\nand tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by\r\nMaster Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short\r\ndistance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the\r\noffice, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk\r\nstraight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off\r\nhis hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on\r\nalone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually\r\nfollowed the directions he had received, which\xe2\x80\x94Master Bates being\r\npretty well acquainted with the locality\xe2\x80\x94were so exact that he was\r\nenabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question,\r\nor meeting with any interruption by the way.\r\n\r\nHe found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who\r\nwere huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which\r\nwas a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the\r\nprisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in\r\nthe middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful\r\nlocality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed\r\nthe bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they\r\ncould) the full majesty of justice.\r\n\r\nThere were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to\r\ntheir admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a\r\ncouple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the\r\ntable. A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose\r\nlistlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency\r\nto conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked\r\nsternly up to bid some woman \xe2\x80\x9cTake that baby out,\xe2\x80\x9d when the gravity of\r\njustice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshawl, from some meagre infant. The room smelt close and unwholesome;\r\nthe walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. There was\r\nan old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the\r\ndock\xe2\x80\x94the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for\r\ndepravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left\r\na taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the\r\nthick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.\r\n\r\nNoah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were\r\nseveral women who would have done very well for that distinguished\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x99s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be\r\nsupposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all\r\nanswering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen. He\r\nwaited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women,\r\nbeing committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly\r\nrelieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once\r\ncould be no other than the object of his visit.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big\r\ncoat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his\r\nhat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait\r\naltogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested\r\nin an audible voice to know what he was placed in that \xe2\x80\x99ere disgraceful\r\nsitivation for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an Englishman, ain\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Dodger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are my\r\npriwileges?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get your privileges soon enough,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the jailer, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\npepper with \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to\r\nsay to the beaks, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Dawkins. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then! Wot is\r\nthis here business? I shall thank the madg\xe2\x80\x99strates to dispose of this\r\nhere little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man\r\nof my word and wery punctual in business matters, he\xe2\x80\x99ll go away if I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t there to my time, and then pr\xe2\x80\x99aps ther won\xe2\x80\x99t be an action for\r\ndamage against them as kep me away. Oh no, certainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a\r\nview to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to\r\ncommunicate \xe2\x80\x9cthe names of them two files as was on the bench.\xe2\x80\x9d Which so\r\ntickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master\r\nBates could have done if he had heard the request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the jailer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired one of the magistrates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pick-pocketing case, your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the boy ever been here before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to have been, a many times,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the jailer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been\r\npretty well everywhere else. _I_ know him well, your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you know me, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Artful, making a note of the\r\nstatement. \xe2\x80\x9cWery good. That\xe2\x80\x99s a case of deformation of character, any\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, where are the witnesses?\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Dodger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they? I should like to\r\nsee \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward\r\nwho had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in\r\na crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very\r\nold one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own\r\ncountenance. For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon\r\nas he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon\r\nhis person a silver snuff-box, with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s name engraved upon the\r\nlid. This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court\r\nGuide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was\r\nhis, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had\r\ndisengaged himself from the crowd before referred to. He had also\r\nremarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making\r\nhis way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything to ask this witness, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything to say at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear his worship ask if you\xe2\x80\x99ve anything to say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\njailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dodger, looking up with an air of\r\nabstraction. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you redress yourself to me, my man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved the officer with a grin. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say anything, you\r\nyoung shaver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger, \xe2\x80\x9cnot here, for this ain\xe2\x80\x99t the shop for\r\njustice: besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with\r\nthe Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something\r\nto say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and\r\n\xe2\x80\x99spectable circle of acquaintance as\xe2\x80\x99ll make them beaks wish they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever been born, or that they\xe2\x80\x99d got their footmen to hang \xe2\x80\x99em up to\r\ntheir own hat-pegs, afore they let \xe2\x80\x99em come out this morning to try it\r\non upon me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! He\xe2\x80\x99s fully committed!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cTake him away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh ah! I\xe2\x80\x99ll come on,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the\r\npalm of his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! (to the Bench) it\xe2\x80\x99s no use your looking\r\nfrightened; I won\xe2\x80\x99t show you no mercy, not a ha\xe2\x80\x99porth of it. _You\xe2\x80\x99ll_\r\npay for this, my fine fellers. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be you for something! I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask\r\nme. Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the\r\ncollar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary\r\nbusiness of it; and then grinning in the officer\xe2\x80\x99s face, with great\r\nglee and self-approval.\r\n\r\nHaving seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the\r\nbest of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting\r\nhere some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had\r\nprudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully\r\nabroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not\r\nbeen followed by any impertinent person.\r\n\r\nThe two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news\r\nthat the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and\r\nestablishing for himself a glorious reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLIV.\r\nTHE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE\r\nFAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the\r\ngirl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of\r\nthe step she had taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both\r\nthe crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which\r\nhad been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was\r\ntrustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those\r\nschemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were\r\nher feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and\r\ndeeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;\r\nstill, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some\r\nrelenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp\r\nhe had so long eluded, and he should fall at last\xe2\x80\x94richly as he merited\r\nsuch a fate\xe2\x80\x94by her hand.\r\n\r\nBut, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach\r\nitself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix\r\nitself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by\r\nany consideration. Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful\r\ninducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated\r\nthat her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which\r\ncould lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a\r\nrefuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhat more could she do! She was resolved.\r\n\r\nThough all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they\r\nforced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too.\r\nShe grew pale and thin, even within a few days. At times, she took no\r\nheed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where\r\nonce, she would have been the loudest. At other times, she laughed\r\nwithout merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards\xe2\x80\x94she sat\r\nsilent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the\r\nvery effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even\r\nthese indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were\r\noccupied with matters very different and distant from those in the\r\ncourse of discussion by her companions.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the\r\nhour. Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The\r\ngirl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened\r\ntoo. Eleven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour this side of midnight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, raising the blind to look\r\nout and returning to his seat. \xe2\x80\x9cDark and heavy it is too. A good night\r\nfor business this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity, Bill, my dear, that there\xe2\x80\x99s none\r\nquite ready to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right for once,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity, for I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin the humour too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must make up for lost time when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got things into a good train.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way to talk, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, venturing to pat him\r\non the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does me good to hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes you good, does it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, so be it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this\r\nconcession. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re like yourself to-night, Bill. Quite like yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my\r\nshoulder, so take it away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, casting off the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt make you nervous, Bill,\xe2\x80\x94reminds you of being nabbed, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFagin, determined not to be offended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReminds me of being nabbed by the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cThere never\r\nwas another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father,\r\nand I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time,\r\nunless you came straight from the old \xe2\x80\x99un without any father at all\r\nbetwixt you; which I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at, a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the\r\nsleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of\r\nthe foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cNance. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the gal going to at this time of\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat answer\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because\r\nhe had any real objection to the girl going where she listed. \xe2\x80\x9cNowhere.\r\nSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not well. I told you that before,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI want a\r\nbreath of air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut your head out of the winder,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not enough there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI want it in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t have it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes. With which assurance he rose,\r\nlocked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her\r\nhead, flung it up to the top of an old press. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow stop quietly where you are, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl\r\nturning very pale. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Bill? Do you know what you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndoing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow what I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s out of her\r\nsenses, you know, or she daren\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll drive me on the something desperate,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the girl placing\r\nboth hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some\r\nviolent outbreak. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, will you,\xe2\x80\x94this minute\xe2\x80\x94this instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him to let me go, Fagin. He had better. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be better for him.\r\nDo you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear you!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have\r\nsuch a grip on your throat as\xe2\x80\x99ll tear some of that screaming voice out.\r\nWot has come over you, you jade! Wot is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself\r\ndown on the floor, before the door, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cBill, let me go; you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are doing. You don\xe2\x80\x99t, indeed. For only one\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x94do\xe2\x80\x94do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut my limbs off one by one!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the\r\narm, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the gal\xe2\x80\x99s stark raving mad. Get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till you let me go\xe2\x80\x94not till you let me go\xe2\x80\x94Never\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed\r\nthe girl. Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and\r\nsuddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with\r\nhim by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a\r\nbench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force. She\r\nstruggled and implored by turns until twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock had struck, and\r\nthen, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further.\r\nWith a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out\r\nthat night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew!\xe2\x80\x9d said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot a precious strange gal that is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may say that, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may say\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cCome; you should know her better than me. Wot\r\ndoes it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObstinacy; woman\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose it is,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had tamed her, but\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s as bad as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew her like this, for such\r\na little cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s got a touch of that fever in her\r\nblood yet, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t come out\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntook that way again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched\r\non my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself\r\naloof,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe was poor too, all the time, and I think, one\r\nway or other, it\xe2\x80\x99s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here\r\nso long has made her restless\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her\r\nformer seat. Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and\r\nfro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, now she\xe2\x80\x99s on the other tack!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of\r\nexcessive surprise on his companion.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few\r\nminutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering\r\nSikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat\r\nand bade him good-night. He paused when he reached the room-door, and\r\nlooking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLight him down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity he\r\nshould break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers. Show him\r\na light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached\r\nthe passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the\r\ngirl, said, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Nancy, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, in the same tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason of all this,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cIf _he_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed with his\r\nskinny fore-finger up the stairs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis so hard with you (he\xe2\x80\x99s a brute,\r\nNance, a brute-beast), why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching\r\nher ear, and his eyes looking into hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter just now. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk of this again. You have a friend in me,\r\nNance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If\r\nyou want revenge on those that treat you like a dog\xe2\x80\x94like a dog! worse\r\nthan his dog, for he humours him sometimes\xe2\x80\x94come to me. I say, come to\r\nme. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, without manifesting the least\r\nemotion. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said\r\ngood-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look\r\nwith a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.\r\n\r\nFagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were\r\nworking within his brain. He had conceived the idea\xe2\x80\x94not from what had\r\njust passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by\r\ndegrees\xe2\x80\x94that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker\xe2\x80\x99s brutality, had\r\nconceived an attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her\r\nrepeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the\r\ninterests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and,\r\nadded to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a\r\nparticular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him\r\nat least, almost matter of certainty. The object of this new liking was\r\nnot among his myrmidons. He would be a valuable acquisition with such\r\nan assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nThere was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too\r\nmuch, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the\r\nwounds were hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him\r\noff, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely\r\nwreaked\xe2\x80\x94to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nobject of her more recent fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a little persuasion,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat more likely than that\r\nshe would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and\r\nworse, to secure the same object before now. There would be the\r\ndangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place;\r\nand my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back\r\nit, unlimited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he\r\nsat alone, in the housebreaker\xe2\x80\x99s room; and with them uppermost in his\r\nthoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of\r\nsounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There\r\nwas no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to\r\nunderstand his meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her glance at\r\nparting showed _that_.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and\r\nthat was one of the chief ends to be attained. \xe2\x80\x9cHow,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Fagin, as\r\nhe crept homeward, \xe2\x80\x9ccan I increase my influence with her? What new\r\npower can I acquire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a\r\nconfession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her\r\naltered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of\r\nwhom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs,\r\ncould he not secure her compliance?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, almost aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cShe durst not refuse me then. Not\r\nfor her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and\r\nshall be set to work. I shall have you yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards\r\nthe spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way:\r\nbusying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he\r\nwrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy\r\ncrushed with every motion of his fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLV.\r\nNOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for\r\nthe appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed\r\ninterminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious\r\nassault on the breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBolter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite\r\nMorris Bolter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here I am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Don\xe2\x80\x99t yer ask me\r\nto do anything till I have done eating. That\xe2\x80\x99s a great fault in this\r\nplace. Yer never get time enough over yer meals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can talk as you eat, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, cursing his dear\r\nyoung friend\xe2\x80\x99s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I can talk. I get on better when I talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, cutting a\r\nmonstrous slice of bread. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Charlotte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cI sent her out this morning with the other young\r\nwoman, because I wanted us to be alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish yer\xe2\x80\x99d ordered her to make some buttered toast\r\nfirst. Well. Talk away. Yer won\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he\r\nhad evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did well yesterday, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful! Six\r\nshillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! The kinchin\r\nlay will be a fortune to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBolter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my dear. The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the\r\nmilk-can was a perfect masterpiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, I think, for a beginner,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr. Bolter\r\ncomplacently. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was\r\nstanding by itself outside a public-house. I thought it might get rusty\r\nwith the rain, or catch cold, yer know. Eh? Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his\r\nlaugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk\r\nof bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you, Bolter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, leaning over the table, \xe2\x80\x9cto do a\r\npiece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Bolter, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t yer go shoving me into danger, or\r\nsending me any more o\xe2\x80\x99 yer police-offices. That don\xe2\x80\x99t suit me, that\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t; and so I tell yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the smallest danger in it\xe2\x80\x94not the very smallest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nJew; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s only to dodge a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old woman?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do that pretty well, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bolter. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a regular\r\ncunning sneak when I was at school. What am I to dodge her for? Not\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and,\r\nif possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street,\r\nor the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the\r\ninformation you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll yer give me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking\r\nhis employer, eagerly, in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do it well, a pound, my dear. One pound,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, wishing\r\nto interest him in the scent as much as possible. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nnever gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t valuable\r\nconsideration to be gained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Noah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Lor!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Noah, curling up his nose. \xe2\x80\x9cYer doubtful of her, are\r\nyer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cJust to have the pleasure of knowing them, if\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I\xe2\x80\x99m your man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would be,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin, elated by the success of his\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she? Where am I to wait\r\nfor her? Where am I to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that, my dear, you shall hear from me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll point her out at the\r\nproper time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou keep ready, and leave the rest to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and\r\nequipped in his carter\xe2\x80\x99s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin.\r\nSix nights passed\xe2\x80\x94six long weary nights\xe2\x80\x94and on each, Fagin came home\r\nwith a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet\r\ntime. On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he\r\ncould not conceal. It was Sunday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe goes abroad to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cand on the right errand, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will\r\nnot be back much before daybreak. Come with me. Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of\r\nsuch intense excitement that it infected him. They left the house\r\nstealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at\r\nlength before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in\r\nwhich he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.\r\n\r\nIt was past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly\r\non its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise;\r\nand the door was closed behind them.\r\n\r\nScarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,\r\nFagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of\r\nglass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in\r\nthe adjoining room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, scarcely above his breath.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see her face well,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Noah. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is looking down, and\r\nthe candle is behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay there,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Fagin. He signed to Barney, who withdrew. In an\r\ninstant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of\r\nsnuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking\r\nto the girl, caused her to raise her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see her now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the spy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlainly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should know her among a thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out.\r\nFagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and\r\nthey held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place\r\nof concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lad who held the door. \xe2\x80\x9cDow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the left,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the lad; \xe2\x80\x9ctake the left had, and keep od the\r\nother side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl\xe2\x80\x99s retreating\r\nfigure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he\r\nconsidered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the\r\nbetter to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or\r\nthrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind\r\nher, pass on. She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk\r\nwith a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative\r\ndistance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVI.\r\nTHE APPOINTMENT KEPT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures\r\nemerged on London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid\r\nstep, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in\r\nquest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who\r\nslunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance,\r\naccommodated his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she\r\nmoved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the\r\nardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. Thus, they crossed\r\nthe bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman,\r\napparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers,\r\nturned back. The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not\r\nthrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses\r\nwhich surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet\r\nthe better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the\r\nopposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in advance as\r\nshe had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again.\r\nAt nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. The man stopped too.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that\r\nhour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were,\r\nhurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly\r\nwithout noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view.\r\nTheir appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards\r\nof such of London\xe2\x80\x99s destitute population, as chanced to take their way\r\nover the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless\r\nhovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither\r\nspeaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.\r\n\r\nA mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that\r\nburnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and\r\nrendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks.\r\nThe old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull\r\nfrom the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water\r\ntoo black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old\r\nSaint Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the\r\ngiant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the\r\nforest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of\r\nchurches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.\r\n\r\nThe girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro\xe2\x80\x94closely watched\r\nmeanwhile by her hidden observer\xe2\x80\x94when the heavy bell of St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntolled for the death of another day. Midnight had come upon the crowded\r\ncity. The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the\r\nchambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of\r\nthe corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all.\r\n\r\nThe hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by\r\na grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a\r\nshort distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked\r\nstraight towards it. They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when\r\nthe girl started, and immediately made towards them.\r\n\r\nThey walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who\r\nentertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of\r\nbeing realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate.\r\nThey halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it\r\nimmediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94brushed against them, indeed\xe2\x80\x94at that precise moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid to speak to you here.\r\nCome away\xe2\x80\x94out of the public road\xe2\x80\x94down the steps yonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction\r\nin which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and\r\nroughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.\r\n\r\nThe steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the\r\nSurrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChurch, form a landing-stairs from the river. To this spot, the man\r\nbearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s survey of the place, he began to descend.\r\n\r\nThese stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights.\r\nJust below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the\r\nleft terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. At\r\nthis point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle\r\nof the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who\r\nchance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily\r\nround, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place\r\nof concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he\r\nslipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty\r\ncertain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not\r\nhear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.\r\n\r\nSo tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the\r\nspy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he\r\nhad been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for\r\nlost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or\r\nhad resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious\r\nconversation. He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place,\r\nand regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and\r\ndirectly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.\r\n\r\nHe drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely\r\nbreathing, listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is far enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice, which was evidently that of the\r\ngentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not suffer the young lady to go any farther. Many\r\npeople would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but\r\nyou see I am willing to humour you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo humour me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re considerate, indeed, sir. To humour me! Well, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, for what,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman in a kinder tone, \xe2\x80\x9cfor what purpose\r\ncan you have brought us to this strange place? Why not have let me\r\nspeak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something\r\nstirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you before,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nancy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was afraid to speak to you\r\nthere. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, shuddering, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have\r\nsuch a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fear of what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely know of what,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I did. Horrible\r\nthoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that\r\nhas made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. I was\r\nreading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things\r\ncame into the print.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagination,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, soothing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo imagination,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl in a hoarse voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll swear I saw\r\n\xe2\x80\x98coffin\xe2\x80\x99 written in every page of the book in large black letters,\xe2\x80\x94aye,\r\nand they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing unusual in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have\r\npassed me often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Real ones_,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the\r\nconcealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and\r\nthe blood chilled within him. He had never experienced a greater relief\r\nthan in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to\r\nbe calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful\r\nfancies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to her kindly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady to her companion. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\ncreature! She seems to need it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me\r\nas I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\ngirl. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear lady, why ar\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t those who claim to be God\xe2\x80\x99s own folks\r\nas gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth,\r\nand beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud\r\ninstead of so much humbler?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cA Turk turns his face, after washing it\r\nwell, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after\r\ngiving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles\r\noff, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven.\r\nBetween the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were\r\nperhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover\r\nherself. The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not here last Sunday night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nancy; \xe2\x80\x9cI was kept by force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim that I told the young lady of before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on\r\nthe subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not very easy for me to\r\nleave him unless he knows why; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a drink of laudanum\r\nbefore I came away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he awake before you returned?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cNow listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d the gentleman began, \xe2\x80\x9chas communicated to me, and to\r\nsome other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly\r\na fortnight since. I confess to you that I had doubts, at first,\r\nwhether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe\r\nyou are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat that I firmly believe it. To prove to you that I am disposed\r\nto trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the\r\nsecret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks. But\r\nif\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9che cannot be secured, or, if secured,\r\ncannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFagin,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, recoiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man must be delivered up by you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not do it! I will never do it!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cDevil that\r\nhe is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not?\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one reason,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor one reason, that the\r\nlady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her\r\npromise: and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has\r\nled, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the\r\nsame courses together, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll not turn upon them, who might\xe2\x80\x94any of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94have turned upon me, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t, bad as they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he\r\nhad been aiming to attain; \xe2\x80\x9cput Monks into my hands, and leave him to\r\nme to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if he turns against the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him,\r\nthere the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye,\r\nand if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it is not?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthis Fagin shall not be brought to\r\njustice without your consent. In such a case I could show you reasons,\r\nI think, which would induce you to yield it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I the lady\xe2\x80\x99s promise for that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cMy true and faithful pledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonks would never learn how you knew what you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl,\r\nafter a short pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe intelligence should be brought to\r\nbear upon him, that he could never even guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngirl after another interval of silence, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will take your words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so,\r\nshe proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the\r\nlistener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by\r\nname and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that\r\nnight. From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as\r\nif the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she\r\ncommunicated. When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the\r\nplace, the best position from which to watch it without exciting\r\nobservation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the\r\nhabit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for\r\nthe purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to\r\nher recollection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is tall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cand a strongly made man, but not stout;\r\nhe has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his\r\nshoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that,\r\nfor his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthat you might almost tell him by that alone. His face is dark, like\r\nhis hair and eyes; and, although he can\xe2\x80\x99t be more than six or eight and\r\ntwenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and\r\ndisfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and\r\nsometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds\xe2\x80\x94why did you\r\nstart?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, stopping suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious\r\nof having done so, and begged her to proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPart of this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cI have drawn out from other people at\r\nthe house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times\r\nhe was covered up in a large cloak. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s all I can give you\r\nto know him by. Stay though,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon his throat: so high that\r\nyou can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face:\r\nthere is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA broad red mark, like a burn or scald?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they\r\nwere so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, breaking silence. \xe2\x80\x9cI should by your\r\ndescription. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each other.\r\nIt may not be the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he\r\ntook a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell\r\nfrom the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where\r\nhe had stood before, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have given us most valuable assistance, young\r\nwoman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to serve\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not persist in saying that,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the gentleman, with a\r\nvoice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder\r\nand more obdurate heart. \xe2\x80\x9cThink now. Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl, weeping. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can do nothing to help\r\nme. I am past all hope, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou put yourself beyond its pale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe past has\r\nbeen a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such\r\npriceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never\r\ngrants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it\r\nis in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must\r\ncome as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you\r\nfear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the\r\ncompass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before\r\nthe dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of\r\nday-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your\r\nformer associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind\r\nyou, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment. Come! I\r\nwould not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion,\r\nor take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is\r\npestilence and death to you. Quit them all, while there is time and\r\nopportunity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be persuaded now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cShe hesitates, I am\r\nsure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear not, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sir, I do not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, after a short struggle. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nchained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave\r\nit. I must have gone too far to turn back,\xe2\x80\x94and yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, for if\r\nyou had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.\r\nBut,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking hastily round, \xe2\x80\x9cthis fear comes over me again.\r\nI must go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cTo such a home as I have raised for\r\nmyself with the work of my whole life. Let us part. I shall be watched\r\nor seen. Go! Go! If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you\r\nleave me, and let me go my way alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cWe compromise her\r\nsafety, perhaps, by staying here. We may have detained her longer than\r\nshe expected already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d urged the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady, \xe2\x80\x9ccan be the end of this poor creature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cLook before you, lady. Look at that dark\r\nwater. How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the\r\ntide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them. It may be\r\nyears hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at\r\nlast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not speak thus, pray,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the young lady, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors\r\nshould!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis purse,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it for my sake, that you may\r\nhave some resource in an hour of need and trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not done this for money. Let me have\r\nthat to think of. And yet\xe2\x80\x94give me something that you have worn: I\r\nshould like to have something\xe2\x80\x94no, no, not a ring\xe2\x80\x94your gloves or\r\nhandkerchief\xe2\x80\x94anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet\r\nlady. There. Bless you! God bless you. Good-night, good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some\r\ndiscovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to\r\ndetermine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.\r\n\r\nThe sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.\r\n\r\nThe two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards\r\nappeared upon the bridge. They stopped at the summit of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady, listening. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she call! I thought I\r\nheard her voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has not\r\nmoved, and will not till we are gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his,\r\nand led her, with gentle force, away. As they disappeared, the girl\r\nsunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and\r\nvented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended\r\nthe street. The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for\r\nsome minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious\r\nglances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his\r\nhiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in\r\nthe same manner as he had descended.\r\n\r\nPeeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that\r\nhe was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and\r\nmade for the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s house as fast as his legs would carry him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVII.\r\nFATAL CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn\r\nof the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets\r\nare silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and\r\nprofligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still\r\nand silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so\r\ndistorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less\r\nlike a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and\r\nworried by an evil spirit.\r\n\r\nHe sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet,\r\nwith his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table\r\nby his side. His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in\r\nthought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless\r\ngums a few such fangs as should have been a dog\xe2\x80\x99s or rat\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nStretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.\r\nTowards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and\r\nthen brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt\r\nwick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon\r\nthe table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIndeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme;\r\nhatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter\r\ndistrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter\r\ndisappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of\r\ndetection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by\r\nall; these were the passionate considerations which, following close\r\nupon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain\r\nof Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHe sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take\r\nthe smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted\r\nby a footstep in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cAt last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and\r\npresently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who\r\ncarried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his\r\nouter coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying the bundle on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care of that,\r\nand do the most you can with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s been trouble enough to get; I\r\nthought I should have been here, three hours ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard,\r\nsat down again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off the\r\nrobber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over\r\nagainst each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his\r\nlips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions\r\nwhich had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back\r\nhis chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot now?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWot do you look at a man so for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the\r\nair; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the\r\nmoment gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamme!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone mad. I must look to myself here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Fagin, finding his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re not the\r\nperson, Bill. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\xe2\x80\x94no fault to find with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and\r\nostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlucky\xe2\x80\x94for one of us. Which one that is, don\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got that to tell you, Bill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, drawing his chair\r\nnearer, \xe2\x80\x9cwill make you worse than me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the robber with an incredulous air. \xe2\x80\x9cTell away! Look\r\nsharp, or Nance will think I\xe2\x80\x99m lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has pretty well settled that, in her own\r\nmind, already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nand reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched\r\nhis coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, will you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cor if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, it shall be for want of\r\nbreath. Open your mouth and say wot you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say in plain words.\r\nOut with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose that lad that\xe2\x80\x99s laying there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Fagin began.\r\n\r\nSikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not\r\npreviously observed him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, resuming his former position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose that lad,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Fagin, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to peach\xe2\x80\x94to blow upon us\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having\r\na meeting with \xe2\x80\x99em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe\r\nevery mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be\r\nmost easily taken. Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow\r\nupon a plant we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been in, more or less\xe2\x80\x94of his own fancy; not\r\ngrabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on\r\nbread and water,\xe2\x80\x94but of his own fancy; to please his own taste;\r\nstealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and\r\npeaching to them. Do you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew, his eyes flashing\r\nwith rage. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose he did all this, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he was left\r\nalive till I came, I\xe2\x80\x99d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot\r\ninto as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I did it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin almost in a yell. \xe2\x80\x9cI, that knows so\r\nmuch, and could hang so many besides myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at\r\nthe mere suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do something in the jail that \xe2\x80\x99ud get me put\r\nin irons; and if I was tried along with you, I\xe2\x80\x99d fall upon you with\r\nthem in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I\r\nshould have such strength,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the robber, poising his brawny\r\narm, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould I!\xe2\x80\x9d said the housebreaker. \xe2\x80\x9cTry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care who,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sikes impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever it was, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nserve them the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent,\r\nstooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse\r\nhim. Sikes leant forward in his chair: looking on with his hands upon\r\nhis knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and\r\npreparation was to end in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBolter, Bolter! Poor lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, looking up with an expression\r\nof devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s tired\xe2\x80\x94tired with watching for her so long,\xe2\x80\x94watching for _her_,\r\nBill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sikes, drawing back.\r\n\r\nFagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him\r\ninto a sitting posture. When his assumed name had been repeated several\r\ntimes, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me that again\xe2\x80\x94once again, just for him to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew,\r\npointing to Sikes as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell yer what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat about\xe2\x80\x94 _Nancy_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if\r\nto prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nfollowed her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London Bridge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere she met two people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before,\r\nwho asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she\r\ndid\xe2\x80\x94and to describe him, which she did\xe2\x80\x94and to tell her what house it\r\nwas that we meet at, and go to, which she did\xe2\x80\x94and where it could be\r\nbest watched from, which she did\xe2\x80\x94and what time the people went there,\r\nwhich she did. She did all this. She told it all every word without a\r\nthreat, without a murmur\xe2\x80\x94she did\xe2\x80\x94did she not?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin, half mad\r\nwith fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah, scratching his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what it\r\nwas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did they say, about last Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout last Sunday!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah, considering. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy I told yer that\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain. Tell it again!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and\r\nbrandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey asked her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to\r\nhave a dawning perception who Sikes was, \xe2\x80\x9cthey asked her why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome, last Sunday, as she promised. She said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why? Tell him that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told\r\nthem of before,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Noah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat more of him?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat more of the man she had told\r\nthem of before? Tell him that, tell him that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t very easily get out of doors unless he knew\r\nwhere she was going to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Noah; \xe2\x80\x9cand so the first time she went to\r\nsee the lady, she\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that\r\nit did\xe2\x80\x94she gave him a drink of laudanum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell\xe2\x80\x99s fire!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\ngo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted,\r\nwildly and furiously, up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin, following him hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cA word. Only a\r\nword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was\r\nunable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and\r\nviolence, when the Jew came panting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me; it\xe2\x80\x99s not safe. Let me\r\nout, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me speak a word,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be\xe2\x80\x94too\xe2\x80\x94violent, Bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s faces. They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire\r\nin the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now\r\nuseless, \xe2\x80\x9cnot too violent for safety. Be crafty, Bill, and not too\r\nbold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had\r\nturned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.\r\n\r\nWithout one pause, or moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration; without once turning his\r\nhead to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering\r\nthem to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage\r\nresolution: his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw\r\nseemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong\r\ncourse, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his\r\nown door. He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the\r\nstairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting\r\na heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.\r\n\r\nThe girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it. He had roused her from her\r\nsleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is you, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cGet up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the\r\ncandlestick, and hurled it under the grate. Seeing the faint light of\r\nearly day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s enough\r\nlight for wot I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you look like\r\nthat at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils\r\nand heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat,\r\ndragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the\r\ndoor, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal\r\nfear,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t scream or cry\xe2\x80\x94not once\xe2\x80\x94hear me\xe2\x80\x94speak to me\xe2\x80\x94tell me\r\nwhat I have done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you she devil!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the robber, suppressing his breath.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrejoined the girl, clinging to him. \xe2\x80\x9cBill, dear Bill, you cannot have\r\nthe heart to kill me. Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one\r\nnight, for you. You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this\r\ncrime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off. Bill, Bill,\r\nfor dear God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my\r\nblood! I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl\r\nwere clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear\r\nthem away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ngentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some\r\nforeign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. Let me\r\nsee them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and\r\ngoodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far\r\napart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in\r\nprayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent.\r\nThey told me so\xe2\x80\x94I feel it now\xe2\x80\x94but we must have time\xe2\x80\x94a little, little\r\ntime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty\r\nof immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the\r\nmidst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could\r\nsummon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own.\r\n\r\nShe staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down\r\nfrom a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty,\r\non her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief\xe2\x80\x94Rose Maylie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as\r\nher feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her\r\nMaker.\r\n\r\nIt was a ghastly figure to look upon. The murderer staggering backward\r\nto the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy\r\nclub and struck her down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nTHE FLIGHT OF SIKES\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed\r\nwithin wide London\xe2\x80\x99s bounds since night hung over it, that was the\r\nworst. Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning\r\nair, that was the foulest and most cruel.\r\n\r\nThe sun\xe2\x80\x94the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new\r\nlife, and hope, and freshness to man\xe2\x80\x94burst upon the crowded city in\r\nclear and radiant glory. Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended\r\nwindow, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal\r\nray. It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. It did. He\r\ntried to shut it out, but it would stream in. If the sight had been a\r\nghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that\r\nbrilliant light!\r\n\r\nHe had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. There had been a moan and\r\nmotion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and\r\nstruck again. Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy\r\nthe eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring\r\nupward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered\r\nand danced in the sunlight on the ceiling. He had plucked it off again.\r\nAnd there was the body\xe2\x80\x94mere flesh and blood, no more\xe2\x80\x94but such flesh,\r\nand so much blood!\r\n\r\nHe struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There\r\nwas hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder,\r\nand, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney. Even that frightened\r\nhim, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then\r\npiled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes. He washed\r\nhimself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be\r\nremoved, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. How those stains\r\nwere dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were bloody.\r\n\r\nAll this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no,\r\nnot for a moment. Such preparations completed, he moved, backward,\r\ntowards the door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his\r\nfeet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He\r\nshut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.\r\n\r\nHe crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing\r\nwas visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which\r\nshe would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay\r\nnearly under there. _He_ knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon\r\nthe very spot!\r\n\r\nThe glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the\r\nroom. He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\nHe went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which\r\nstands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate\r\nHill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the\r\nright again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the\r\nfoot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on\r\nHampstead Heath. Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted\r\nthe opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of\r\nHampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath\r\nto the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under\r\na hedge, and slept.\r\n\r\nSoon he was up again, and away,\xe2\x80\x94not far into the country, but back\r\ntowards London by the high-road\xe2\x80\x94then back again\xe2\x80\x94then over another part\r\nof the same ground as he already traversed\xe2\x80\x94then wandering up and down\r\nin fields, and lying on ditches\xe2\x80\x99 brinks to rest, and starting up to\r\nmake for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.\r\n\r\nWhere could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat\r\nand drink? Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s way. Thither he directed his steps,\xe2\x80\x94running sometimes, and\r\nsometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail\xe2\x80\x99s pace, or\r\nstopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. But when\r\nhe got there, all the people he met\xe2\x80\x94the very children at the\r\ndoors\xe2\x80\x94seemed to view him with suspicion. Back he turned again, without\r\nthe courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for\r\nmany hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nHe wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the\r\nold place. Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane,\r\nand still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round,\r\nand still lingered about the same spot. At last he got away, and shaped\r\nhis course for Hatfield.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the\r\ndog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the\r\nhill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little\r\nstreet, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided\r\nthem to the spot. There was a fire in the tap-room, and some\r\ncountry-labourers were drinking before it.\r\n\r\nThey made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest\r\ncorner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he\r\ncast a morsel of food from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the\r\nneighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted,\r\nupon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous\r\nSunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men\r\npresent declaring him to have been quite young\xe2\x80\x94not older, one\r\nwhite-haired grandfather said, than he was\xe2\x80\x94with ten or fifteen year of\r\nlife in him at least\xe2\x80\x94if he had taken care; if he had taken care.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The\r\nrobber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his\r\ncorner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the\r\nnoisy entrance of a new comer.\r\n\r\nThis was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who\r\ntravelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors,\r\nwashballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap\r\nperfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case\r\nslung to his back. His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes\r\nwith the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper,\r\nand opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite\r\nbusiness with amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a grinning\r\ncountryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fellow, producing one, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the infallible and\r\ninvaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt,\r\nmildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen,\r\ncambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or\r\nwoollen stuff. Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains,\r\npaint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with\r\nthe infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour,\r\nshe has only need to swallow one cake and she\xe2\x80\x99s cured at once\xe2\x80\x94for it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoison. If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt\r\none little square, and he has put it beyond question\xe2\x80\x94for it\xe2\x80\x99s quite as\r\nsatisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the\r\nflavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. One penny a square.\r\nWith all these virtues, one penny a square!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly\r\nhesitated. The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all bought up as fast as it can be made,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fellow. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nare fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery,\r\nalways a-working upon it, and they can\xe2\x80\x99t make it fast enough, though\r\nthe men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned\r\ndirectly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a\r\npremium of fifty for twins. One penny a square! Two half-pence is all\r\nthe same, and four farthings is received with joy. One penny a square!\r\nWine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains,\r\npitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of\r\na gentleman in company, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll take clean out, before he can order\r\nme a pint of ale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cGive that back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take it clean out, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, winking to the company,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbefore you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe\r\nthe dark stain upon this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s hat, no wider than a shilling, but\r\nthicker than a half-crown. Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain,\r\nbeer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or\r\nblood-stain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew\r\nthe table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.\r\n\r\nWith the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened\r\nupon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was\r\nnot followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken\r\nsullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of\r\nthe lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking\r\npast, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was\r\nstanding at the little post-office. He almost knew what was to come;\r\nbut he crossed over, and listened.\r\n\r\nThe guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man,\r\ndressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a\r\nbasket which lay ready on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for your people,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, look alive in there,\r\nwill you. Damn that \xe2\x80\x99ere bag, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t ready night afore last; this\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything new up in town, Ben?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the game-keeper, drawing back to\r\nthe window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing that I knows on,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, pulling on his gloves.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorn\xe2\x80\x99s up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields\r\nway, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon much upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d said a gentleman inside, who was looking out\r\nof the window. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd a dreadful murder it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the guard, touching his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cMan or woman,\r\npray, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is supposed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Ben,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the coachman impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn that \xe2\x80\x99ere bag,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guard; \xe2\x80\x9care you gone to sleep in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the office keeper, running out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the guard. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, and so\xe2\x80\x99s the young \xe2\x80\x99ooman of property\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a fancy to me, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when. Here, give\r\nhold. All ri\xe2\x80\x94ight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.\r\n\r\nSikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he\r\nhad just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where\r\nto go. At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from\r\nHatfield to St. Albans.\r\n\r\nHe went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged\r\ninto the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe\r\ncreeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him,\r\nsubstance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some\r\nfearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that\r\nhaunted him of that morning\xe2\x80\x99s ghastly figure following at his heels. He\r\ncould trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the\r\noutline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along. He\r\ncould hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of\r\nwind came laden with that last low cry. If he stopped it did the same.\r\nIf he ran, it followed\xe2\x80\x94not running too: that would have been a relief:\r\nbut like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on\r\none slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.\r\n\r\nAt times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat\r\nthis phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on\r\nhis head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was\r\nbehind him then. He had kept it before him that morning, but it was\r\nbehind now\xe2\x80\x94always. He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it\r\nstood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky. He threw\r\nhimself upon the road\xe2\x80\x94on his back upon the road. At his head it stood,\r\nsilent, erect, and still\xe2\x80\x94a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nLet no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence\r\nmust sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long\r\nminute of that agony of fear.\r\n\r\nThere was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the\r\nnight. Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it\r\nvery dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.\r\nHe _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched\r\nhimself close to the wall\xe2\x80\x94to undergo new torture.\r\n\r\nFor now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than\r\nthat from which he had escaped. Those widely staring eyes, so\r\nlustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than\r\nthink upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in\r\nthemselves, but giving light to nothing. There were but two, but they\r\nwere everywhere. If he shut out the sight, there came the room with\r\nevery well-known object\xe2\x80\x94some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if\r\nhe had gone over its contents from memory\xe2\x80\x94each in its accustomed place.\r\nThe body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he\r\nstole away. He got up, and rushed into the field without. The figure\r\nwas behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more. The\r\neyes were there, before he had laid himself along.\r\n\r\nAnd here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling\r\nin every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when\r\nsuddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting,\r\nand the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder. Any sound of men in\r\nthat lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was\r\nsomething to him. He regained his strength and energy at the prospect\r\nof personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe broad sky seemed on fire. Rising into the air with showers of\r\nsparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting\r\nthe atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the\r\ndirection where he stood. The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled\r\nthe roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing\r\nof an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames\r\nas they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though\r\nrefreshed by food. The noise increased as he looked. There were people\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94men and women\xe2\x80\x94light, bustle. It was like new life to him. He\r\ndarted onward\xe2\x80\x94straight, headlong\xe2\x80\x94dashing through brier and brake, and\r\nleaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and\r\nsounding bark before him.\r\n\r\nHe came upon the spot. There were half-dressed figures tearing to and\r\nfro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables,\r\nothers driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others\r\ncoming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks,\r\nand the tumbling down of red-hot beams. The apertures, where doors and\r\nwindows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls\r\nrocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron\r\npoured down, white hot, upon the ground. Women and children shrieked,\r\nand men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers. The\r\nclanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water\r\nas it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar. He\r\nshouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself,\r\nplunged into the thickest of the throng. Hither and thither he dived\r\nthat night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the\r\nsmoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and\r\nmen were thickest. Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of\r\nbuildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under\r\nthe lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire\r\nwas he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise,\r\nnor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke\r\nand blackened ruins remained.\r\n\r\nThis mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the\r\ndreadful consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him,\r\nfor the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject\r\nof their talk. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and\r\nthey drew off, stealthily, together. He passed near an engine where\r\nsome men were seated, and they called to him to share in their\r\nrefreshment. He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of\r\nbeer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the\r\nmurder. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone to Birmingham, they say,\xe2\x80\x9d said one: \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe a cry all through the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then\r\nlay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. He\r\nwandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the\r\nfear of another solitary night.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody to speak to there, at all event,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cA good\r\nhiding-place, too. They\xe2\x80\x99ll never expect to nab me there, after this\r\ncountry scent. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt\r\nfrom Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I\xe2\x80\x99ll risk it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least\r\nfrequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed\r\nwithin a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by\r\na circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had\r\nfixed on for his destination.\r\n\r\nThe dog, though. If any description of him were out, it would not be\r\nforgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him.\r\nThis might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets. He\r\nresolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking\r\nup a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.\r\n\r\nThe animal looked up into his master\xe2\x80\x99s face while these preparations\r\nwere making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their\r\npurpose, or the robber\xe2\x80\x99s sidelong look at him was sterner than\r\nordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and\r\ncowered as he came more slowly along. When his master halted at the\r\nbrink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me call? Come here!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes.\r\n\r\nThe animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped\r\nto attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and\r\nstarted back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back!\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber.\r\n\r\nThe dog wagged his tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and\r\ncalled him again.\r\n\r\nThe dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his\r\nhardest speed.\r\n\r\nThe man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the\r\nexpectation that he would return. But no dog appeared, and at length he\r\nresumed his journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLIX.\r\nMONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE\r\nINTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from\r\na hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly. The door being\r\nopened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one\r\nside of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box,\r\ndismounted too, and stood upon the other side. At a sign from Mr.\r\nBrownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them,\r\nhurried him into the house. This man was Monks.\r\n\r\nThey walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.\r\nBrownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of\r\nthis apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance,\r\nstopped. The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows the alternative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Browlow. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he hesitates or moves\r\na finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid\r\nof the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you say this of me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you urge me to it, young man?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow,\r\nconfronting him with a steady look. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad enough to leave this\r\nhouse? Unhand him. There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow.\r\nBut I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant\r\nwill have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery. I am\r\nresolute and immoveable. If you are determined to be the same, your\r\nblood be upon your own head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by\r\nthese dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who\r\nstood beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy mine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cThose persons are indemnified by me.\r\nIf you complain of being deprived of your liberty\xe2\x80\x94you had power and\r\nopportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it\r\nadvisable to remain quiet\xe2\x80\x94I say again, throw yourself for protection on\r\nthe law. I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far\r\nto recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have\r\npassed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf\r\ninto which you rushed, yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. He hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will decide quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and\r\ncomposure. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign\r\nyou to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a\r\nshudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the\r\nway. If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those\r\nyou have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair.\r\nIt has waited for you two whole days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be prompt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cA word from me, and the\r\nalternative has gone for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill the man hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not the inclination to parley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cand, as I\r\nadvocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis there\xe2\x80\x94no middle\r\ncourse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in\r\nhis countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the\r\nroom, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLock the door on the outside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand come when I ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is pretty treatment, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, throwing down his hat and\r\ncloak, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom my father\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is because I was your father\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friend, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nMr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cit is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy\r\nyears were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and\r\nkindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary,\r\nlonely man: it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would\xe2\x80\x94but Heaven\r\nwilled otherwise\xe2\x80\x94have made her my young wife; it is because my seared\r\nheart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and\r\nerrors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations\r\nfilled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts\r\nof him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you\r\ngently now\xe2\x80\x94yes, Edward Leeford, even now\xe2\x80\x94and blush for your\r\nunworthiness who bear the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has the name to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the other, after\r\ncontemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the\r\nagitation of his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the name to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to you. But it was _hers_,\r\nand even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the\r\nglow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a\r\nstranger. I am very glad you have changed it\xe2\x80\x94very\xe2\x80\x94very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all mighty fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks (to retain his assumed\r\ndesignation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself\r\nin sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his\r\nface with his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: \xe2\x80\x9ca brother,\r\nthe whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the\r\nstreet, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither,\r\nin wonder and alarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no brother,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I was an only child. Why\r\ndo you talk to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttend to what I do know, and you may not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall interest you by and by. I know that of the wretched marriage,\r\ninto which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all\r\nambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole\r\nand most unnatural issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for hard names,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the fact, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I also know,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthe misery, the slow\r\ntorture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how\r\nlistlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their\r\nheavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both. I know how\r\ncold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave\r\nplace to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last\r\nthey wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space\r\napart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death\r\ncould break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest\r\nlooks they could assume. Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon. But\r\nit rusted and cankered at your father\xe2\x80\x99s heart for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they were separated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, \xe2\x80\x9cand what of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they had been separated for some time,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Brownlow,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had\r\nutterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who,\r\nwith prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new\r\nfriends. This circumstance, at least, you know already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon\r\nthe ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. \xe2\x80\x9cNot I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never\r\nforgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr.\r\nBrownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cI speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than\r\neleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty\xe2\x80\x94for he was, I\r\nrepeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry. Must I go back\r\nto events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will\r\nyou spare it, and disclose to me the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to disclose,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must talk on if you\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese new friends, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cwere a naval officer\r\nretired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year\r\nbefore, and left him with two children\xe2\x80\x94there had been more, but, of all\r\ntheir family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters; one a\r\nbeautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or\r\nthree years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this to me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey resided,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the\r\ninterruption, \xe2\x80\x9cin a part of the country to which your father in his\r\nwandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.\r\nAcquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your\r\nfather was gifted as few men are. He had his sister\xe2\x80\x99s soul and person.\r\nAs the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him. I would\r\nthat it had ended there. His daughter did the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes\r\nfixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that\r\ndaughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a\r\nguileless girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour tale is of the longest,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Monks, moving restlessly in his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nMr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cand such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed\r\njoy and happiness, it would be very brief. At length one of those rich\r\nrelations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had\r\nbeen sacrificed, as others are often\xe2\x80\x94it is no uncommon case\xe2\x80\x94died, and\r\nto repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him\r\nhis panacea for all griefs\xe2\x80\x94Money. It was necessary that he should\r\nimmediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and\r\nwhere he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion. He went; was\r\nseized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the\r\nintelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he\r\ndied the day after her arrival, leaving no will\xe2\x80\x94_no will_\xe2\x80\x94so that the\r\nwhole property fell to her and you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a\r\nface of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards\r\nthe speaker. As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the\r\nair of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face\r\nand hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che came to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of that,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear\r\nincredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nportrait painted by himself\xe2\x80\x94a likeness of this poor girl\xe2\x80\x94which he did\r\nnot wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty\r\njourney. He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked\r\nin a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself;\r\nconfided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any\r\nloss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of\r\nhis recent acquisition, to fly the country\xe2\x80\x94I guessed too well he would\r\nnot fly alone\xe2\x80\x94and never see it more. Even from me, his old and early\r\nfriend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that\r\ncovered one most dear to both\xe2\x80\x94even from me he withheld any more\r\nparticular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after\r\nthat to see me once again, for the last time on earth. Alas! _That_ was\r\nthe last time. I had no letter, and I never saw him more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI went, when all was\r\nover, to the scene of his\xe2\x80\x94I will use the term the world would freely\r\nuse, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him\xe2\x80\x94of his guilty\r\nlove, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should\r\nfind one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her. The family\r\nhad left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling\r\ndebts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by\r\nnight. Why, or whither, none can tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected child: was cast\r\nin my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life\r\nof vice and infamy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you I should interest you before\r\nlong. I say by me\xe2\x80\x94I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name,\r\nalthough for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears.\r\nWhen he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my\r\nhouse, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck\r\nme with astonishment. Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and\r\nmisery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me\r\nlike a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream. I\r\nneed not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Monks hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you know it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDenial to me is vain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall show you that I\r\nknow more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t prove anything against me,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cI defy you\r\nto do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old gentleman with a searching glance. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him. Your mother\r\nbeing dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody\r\ncould, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate\r\nin the West Indies\xe2\x80\x94whither, as you well know, you retired upon your\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmade the voyage. You had left it, months before, and were supposed to\r\nbe in London, but no one could tell where. I returned. Your agents had\r\nno clue to your residence. You came and went, they said, as strangely\r\nas you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for\r\nmonths: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with\r\nthe same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce\r\nungovernable boy. I wearied them with new applications. I paced the\r\nstreets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were\r\nfruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you do see me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, rising boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat then? Fraud\r\nand robbery are high-sounding words\xe2\x80\x94justified, you think, by a fancied\r\nresemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man\xe2\x80\x99s Brother!\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t even know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _did not_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; \xe2\x80\x9cbut within the last\r\nfortnight I have learnt it all. You have a brother; you know it, and\r\nhim. There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret\r\nand the gain to you at her own death. It contained a reference to some\r\nchild likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was\r\nborn, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were\r\nfirst awakened by his resemblance to your father. You repaired to the\r\nplace of his birth. There existed proofs\xe2\x80\x94proofs long suppressed\xe2\x80\x94of his\r\nbirth and parentage. Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in\r\nyour own words to your accomplice the Jew, \xe2\x80\x98_the only proofs of the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that\r\nreceived them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.\xe2\x80\x99 Unworthy son,\r\ncoward, liar,\xe2\x80\x94you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in\r\ndark rooms at night,\xe2\x80\x94you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent\r\ndeath upon the head of one worth millions such as you,\xe2\x80\x94you, who from\r\nyour cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and in\r\nwhom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found\r\na vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to\r\nyour mind\xe2\x80\x94you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery word!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cevery word that has passed between\r\nyou and this detested villain, is known to me. Shadows on the wall have\r\ncaught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the\r\npersecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and\r\nalmost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you\r\nwere morally if not really a party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I knew nothing of that; I was going to\r\ninquire the truth of the story when you overtook me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the\r\ncause. I thought it was a common quarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the partial disclosure of your secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you disclose the whole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before\r\nwitnesses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I promise too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed\r\nwith me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose\r\nof attesting it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you insist upon that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that also,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must do more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cMake restitution to\r\nan innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the\r\noffspring of a guilty and most miserable love. You have not forgotten\r\nthe provisions of the will. Carry them into execution so far as your\r\nbrother is concerned, and then go where you please. In this world you\r\nneed meet no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks\r\non this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears\r\non the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly\r\nunlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man will be taken,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be taken to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe murderer?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other. \xe2\x80\x9cHis dog has been seen lurking about\r\nsome old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is,\r\nor will be, there, under cover of the darkness. Spies are hovering\r\nabout in every direction. I have spoken to the men who are charged with\r\nhis capture, and they tell me he cannot escape. A reward of a hundred\r\npounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give fifty more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cand proclaim it with my\r\nown lips upon the spot, if I can reach it. Where is Mr. Maylie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with\r\nyou, he hurried off to where he heard this,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nmounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place\r\nin the outskirts agreed upon between them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by\r\nthis time. They\xe2\x80\x99re sure of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you made up your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of\r\nMonks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94will be secret with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will. Remain here till I return. It is your only hope of safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey left the room, and the door was again locked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that I could hope to do, and even more. Coupling the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and\r\nlaid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day.\r\nWrite and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the\r\nmeeting. We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require\r\nrest: especially the young lady, who _may_ have greater need of\r\nfirmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now. But my blood\r\nboils to avenge this poor murdered creature. Which way have they\r\ntaken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive straight to the office and you will be in time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr.\r\nLosberne. \xe2\x80\x9cI will remain here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement\r\nwholly uncontrollable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER L.\r\nTHE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nNear to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe\r\nabuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on\r\nthe river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of\r\nclose-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the\r\nstrangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are\r\nhidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of\r\nits inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTo reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of\r\nclose, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest\r\nof waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to\r\noccasion. The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the\r\nshops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at\r\nthe salesman\xe2\x80\x99s door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows.\r\nJostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class,\r\nballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the\r\nraff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along,\r\nassailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which\r\nbranch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of\r\nponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks\r\nof warehouses that rise from every corner. Arriving, at length, in\r\nstreets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has\r\npassed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the\r\npavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys\r\nhalf crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron\r\nbars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign\r\nof desolation and neglect.\r\n\r\nIn such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark,\r\nstands Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet\r\ndeep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill\r\nPond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch. It is a creek\r\nor inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by\r\nopening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name.\r\nAt such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges\r\nthrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses\r\non either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets,\r\npails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up;\r\nand when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses\r\nthemselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before\r\nhim. Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses,\r\nwith holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken\r\nand patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is\r\nnever there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would\r\nseem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter;\r\nwooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening\r\nto fall into it\xe2\x80\x94as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying\r\nfoundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome\r\nindication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of\r\nFolly Ditch.\r\n\r\nIn Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are\r\ncrumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling\r\ninto the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.\r\nThirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon\r\nit, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.\r\nThe houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by\r\nthose who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die.\r\nThey must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced\r\nto a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s Island.\r\n\r\nIn an upper room of one of these houses\xe2\x80\x94a detached house of fair size,\r\nruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of\r\nwhich house the back commanded the ditch in manner already\r\ndescribed\xe2\x80\x94there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other\r\nevery now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation,\r\nsat for some time in profound and gloomy silence. One of these was Toby\r\nCrackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years,\r\nwhose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose\r\nface bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same\r\noccasion. This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you had picked out\r\nsome other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come\r\nhere, my fine feller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, blunder-head!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kags.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d have been a little more glad to see me than\r\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, look\xe2\x80\x99e, young gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a man keeps himself so\r\nvery ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over\r\nhis head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather a\r\nstartling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman\r\n(however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with\r\nat conweniency) circumstanced as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping\r\nwith him, that\xe2\x80\x99s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts,\r\nand is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Mr. Kags.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon\r\nas hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care\r\nswagger, turned to Chitling and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was Fagin took then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust at dinner-time\xe2\x80\x94two o\xe2\x80\x99clock this afternoon. Charley and I made our\r\nlucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water-butt,\r\nhead downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out\r\nat the top, and so they took him too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Bet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Bet! She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nChitling, his countenance falling more and more, \xe2\x80\x9cand went off mad,\r\nscreaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they\r\nput a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital\xe2\x80\x94and there she\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot\xe2\x80\x99s come of young Bates?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Kags.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll be here\r\nsoon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Chitling. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere else to go to now, for the\r\npeople at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwent up there and see it with my own eyes\xe2\x80\x94is filled with traps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a smash,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Toby, biting his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s more than\r\none will go with this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sessions are on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kags: \xe2\x80\x9cif they get the inquest over, and\r\nBolter turns King\xe2\x80\x99s evidence: as of course he will, from what he\xe2\x80\x99s said\r\nalready: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the\r\ntrial on on Friday, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll swing in six days from this, by G\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have heard the people groan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chitling; \xe2\x80\x9cthe officers\r\nfought like devils, or they\xe2\x80\x99d have torn him away. He was down once, but\r\nthey made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should have\r\nseen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them\r\nas if they were his dearest friends. I can see \xe2\x80\x99em now, not able to\r\nstand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along\r\namongst \xe2\x80\x99em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and\r\nsnarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon\r\nhis hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked\r\nthemselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d tear his heart out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his\r\nears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro,\r\nlike one distracted.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their\r\neyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs,\r\nand Sikes\xe2\x80\x99s dog bounded into the room. They ran to the window,\r\ndownstairs, and into the street. The dog had jumped in at an open\r\nwindow; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Toby when they had returned. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be coming here. I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he was coming here, he\xe2\x80\x99d have come with the dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kags,\r\nstooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s drunk it all up, every drop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chitling after watching the\r\ndog some time in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cCovered with mud\xe2\x80\x94lame\xe2\x80\x94half blind\xe2\x80\x94he must\r\nhave come a long way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere can he have come from!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Toby. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been to the other\r\nkens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here,\r\nwhere he\xe2\x80\x99s been many a time and often. But where can he have come from\r\nfirst, and how comes he here alone without the other!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(none of them called the murderer by his old name)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nmade away with himself. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chitling.\r\n\r\nToby shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kags, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dog \xe2\x80\x99ud want to lead us away to where he\r\ndid it. No. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s got out of the country, and left the dog\r\nbehind. He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so\r\neasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the\r\nright; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep,\r\nwithout more notice from anybody.\r\n\r\nIt being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and\r\nplaced upon the table. The terrible events of the last two days had\r\nmade a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and\r\nuncertainty of their own position. They drew their chairs closer\r\ntogether, starting at every sound. They spoke little, and that in\r\nwhispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the\r\nmurdered woman lay in the next room.\r\n\r\nThey had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried\r\nknocking at the door below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Bates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he\r\nfelt himself.\r\n\r\nThe knocking came again. No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he. He never knocked like that.\r\n\r\nCrackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head.\r\nThere was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough.\r\nThe dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must let him in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking up the candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there any help for it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the other man in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone. He _must_ come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave us in the dark,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kags, taking down a candle from the\r\nchimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the\r\nknocking was twice repeated before he had finished.\r\n\r\nCrackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the\r\nlower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over\r\nhis head under his hat. He drew them slowly off. Blanched face, sunken\r\neyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days\xe2\x80\x99 growth, wasted flesh, short\r\nthick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room,\r\nbut shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance\r\nover his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall\xe2\x80\x94as close as it\r\nwould go\xe2\x80\x94and ground it against it\xe2\x80\x94and sat down.\r\n\r\nNot a word had been exchanged. He looked from one to another in\r\nsilence. If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly\r\naverted. When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.\r\nThey seemed never to have heard its tones before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came that dog here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone. Three hours ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night\xe2\x80\x99s paper says that Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s took. Is it true, or a lie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were silent again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn you all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou nothing to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou that keep this house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may stop here, if you think it safe,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the person\r\naddressed, after some hesitation.\r\n\r\nSikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to\r\nturn his head than actually doing it: and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x94the body\xe2\x80\x94is it\r\nburied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy isn\xe2\x80\x99t it!\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted with the same glance behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cWot do\r\nthey keep such ugly things above the ground for?\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s that knocking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that\r\nthere was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates\r\nbehind him. Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy\r\nentered the room he encountered his figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToby,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me this, downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the\r\nthree, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad.\r\nAccordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go into some other room,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, retreating still\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sikes, stepping forward. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come nearer me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the boy, still retreating, and\r\nlooking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmonster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes sunk gradually to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWitness you three,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and\r\nbecoming more and more excited as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cWitness you three\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nafraid of him\xe2\x80\x94if they come here after him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him up; I will. I\r\ntell you out at once. He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he\r\ndares, but if I am here I\xe2\x80\x99ll give him up. I\xe2\x80\x99d give him up if he was to\r\nbe boiled alive. Murder! Help! If there\xe2\x80\x99s the pluck of a man among you\r\nthree, you\xe2\x80\x99ll help me. Murder! Help! Down with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent\r\ngesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the\r\nstrong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of\r\nhis surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe three spectators seemed quite stupefied. They offered no\r\ninterference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the\r\nformer, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his\r\nhands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s breast,\r\nand never ceasing to call for help with all his might.\r\n\r\nThe contest, however, was too unequal to last long. Sikes had him down,\r\nand his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a\r\nlook of alarm, and pointed to the window. There were lights gleaming\r\nbelow, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried\r\nfootsteps\xe2\x80\x94endless they seemed in number\xe2\x80\x94crossing the nearest wooden\r\nbridge. One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there\r\nwas the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement. The gleam of\r\nlights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. Then,\r\ncame a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a\r\nmultitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s here!\r\nBreak down the door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the King\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry\r\narose again, but louder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreak down the door!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you they\xe2\x80\x99ll never open\r\nit. Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower\r\nwindow-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the\r\ncrowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of\r\nits immense extent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door of some place where I can lock this screeching\r\nHell-babe,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the\r\nboy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. \xe2\x80\x9cThat door. Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nflung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the downstairs door\r\nfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDouble-locked and chained,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Crackit, who, with the other two\r\nmen, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe panels\xe2\x80\x94are they strong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLined with sheet-iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the windows too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the windows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and\r\nmenacing the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cDo your worst! I\xe2\x80\x99ll cheat you yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could\r\nexceed the cry of the infuriated throng. Some shouted to those who were\r\nnearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to\r\nshoot him dead. Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on\r\nhorseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting\r\nthrough the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the\r\nwindow, in a voice that rose above all others, \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty guineas to the\r\nman who brings a ladder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. Some called\r\nfor ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro\r\nas if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent\r\ntheir breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward\r\nwith the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those\r\nbelow; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout\r\nand crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness\r\nbeneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from\r\ntime to time in one loud furious roar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tide,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and\r\nshut the faces out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a\r\nlong rope. They\xe2\x80\x99re all in front. I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and\r\nclear off that way. Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders\r\nand kill myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the\r\nmurderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up\r\nto the house-top.\r\n\r\nAll the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up,\r\nexcept one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that\r\nwas too small even for the passage of his body. But, from this\r\naperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the\r\nback; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by\r\nthe door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in\r\nfront, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in\r\nan unbroken stream.\r\n\r\nHe planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose,\r\nso firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty\r\nto open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over\r\nthe low parapet.\r\n\r\nThe water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.\r\n\r\nThe crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his\r\nmotions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it\r\nand knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to\r\nwhich all their previous shouting had been whispers. Again and again it\r\nrose. Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took\r\nup the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole\r\ncity had poured its population out to curse him.\r\n\r\nOn pressed the people from the front\xe2\x80\x94on, on, on, in a strong struggling\r\ncurrent of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten\r\nthem up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion. The houses\r\non the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes\r\nwere thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces\r\nin every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every\r\nhouse-top. Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent\r\nbeneath the weight of the crowd upon it. Still the current poured on to\r\nfind some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an\r\ninstant see the wretch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have him now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a man on the nearest bridge. \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give fifty pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d cried an old gentleman from the same\r\nquarter, \xe2\x80\x9cto the man who takes him alive. I will remain here, till he\r\ncome to ask me for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another roar. At this moment the word was passed among the\r\ncrowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first\r\ncalled for the ladder had mounted into the room. The stream abruptly\r\nturned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at\r\nthe windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their\r\nstations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now\r\nthronged pell-mell to the spot they had left: each man crushing and\r\nstriving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near\r\nthe door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out.\r\nThe cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation,\r\nor trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were\r\ndreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time,\r\nbetween the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and\r\nthe unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the\r\nmass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer,\r\nalthough the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible,\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the\r\ncrowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change\r\nwith no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet,\r\ndetermined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the\r\nditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in\r\nthe darkness and confusion.\r\n\r\nRoused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within\r\nthe house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he\r\nset his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the\r\nrope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong\r\nrunning noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second. He\r\ncould let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the\r\nground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut\r\nit then and drop.\r\n\r\nAt the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to\r\nslipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman\r\nbefore-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge\r\nas to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly\r\nwarned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthat very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw\r\nhis arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes again!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in an unearthly screech.\r\n\r\nStaggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled\r\nover the parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight,\r\ntight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. He fell for\r\nfive-and-thirty feet. There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of\r\nthe limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his\r\nstiffening hand.\r\n\r\nThe old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The\r\nmurderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside\r\nthe dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come\r\nand take him out, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nA dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on\r\nthe parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring,\r\njumped for the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the\r\nditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head\r\nagainst a stone, dashed out his brains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LI.\r\nAFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING\r\nA PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when\r\nOliver found himself, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, in a\r\ntravelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town. Mrs. Maylie,\r\nand Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr.\r\nBrownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person\r\nwhose name had not been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThey had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of\r\nagitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting\r\nhis thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less\r\neffect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.\r\nHe and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr.\r\nBrownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from\r\nMonks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey\r\nwas to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole\r\nmatter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in\r\nendurance of the most intense suspense.\r\n\r\nThe same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, cautiously\r\nstopped all channels of communication through which they could receive\r\nintelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they must know them before long,\r\nbut it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be\r\nat a worse.\xe2\x80\x9d So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with\r\nreflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one\r\ndisposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.\r\n\r\nBut if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they\r\njourneyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the\r\nwhole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a\r\ncrowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into\r\nthat which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy,\r\nwithout a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there, there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose,\r\nand pointing out at the carriage window; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the stile I came over;\r\nthere are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake\r\nme and force me back! Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to\r\nthe old house where I was a little child! Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old\r\nfriend, if I could only see you now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see him soon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands\r\nbetween her own. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich\r\nyou have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great\r\nas the coming back to make him happy too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll take him away from here, and\r\nhave him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place\r\nwhere he may grow strong and well,\xe2\x80\x94shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose nodded \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d for the boy was smiling through such happy tears\r\nthat she could not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nOliver. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but\r\nnever mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow that too\xe2\x80\x94to think how changed he is; you did the same with me. He\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x98God bless you\xe2\x80\x99 to me when I ran away,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy with a burst\r\nof affectionate emotion; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will say \xe2\x80\x98God bless you\xe2\x80\x99 now, and show\r\nhim how I love him for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow\r\nstreets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy\r\nwithin reasonable bounds. There was Sowerberry\xe2\x80\x99s the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nas it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he\r\nremembered it\xe2\x80\x94there were all the well-known shops and houses, with\r\nalmost every one of which he had some slight incident connected\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas Gamfield\xe2\x80\x99s cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old\r\npublic-house door\xe2\x80\x94there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his\r\nyouthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nthe same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver\r\ninvoluntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so\r\nfoolish, then cried, then laughed again\xe2\x80\x94there were scores of faces at\r\nthe doors and windows that he knew quite well\xe2\x80\x94there was nearly\r\neverything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life\r\nhad been but a happy dream.\r\n\r\nBut it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. They drove straight to the\r\ndoor of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe,\r\nand think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur\r\nand size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing\r\nthe young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as\r\nif he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness,\r\nand not offering to eat his head\xe2\x80\x94no, not once; not even when he\r\ncontradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and\r\nmaintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and\r\nthat time fast asleep. There was dinner prepared, and there were\r\nbedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was\r\nover, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their\r\njourney down. Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in\r\na separate room. The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with\r\nanxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present,\r\nconversed apart. Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being\r\nabsent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping. All\r\nthese things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets,\r\nnervous and uncomfortable. They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they\r\nexchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to\r\nhear the sound of their own voices.\r\n\r\nAt length, when nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock had come, and they began to think they\r\nwere to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered\r\nthe room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost\r\nshrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother,\r\nand it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking\r\nin with Fagin at the window of his little room. Monks cast a look of\r\nhate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy,\r\nand sat down near the door. Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand,\r\nwalked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a painful task,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut these declarations, which have\r\nbeen signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance\r\nrepeated here. I would have spared you the degradation, but we must\r\nhear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the person addressed, turning away his face. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick. I\r\nhave almost done enough, I think. Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his\r\nhand upon his head, \xe2\x80\x9cis your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your\r\nfather, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who\r\ndied in giving him birth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose\r\nheart he might have heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the bastard child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe term you use,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cis a reproach to those\r\nlong since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects\r\ndisgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass. He was\r\nborn in this town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the workhouse of this town,\xe2\x80\x9d was the sullen reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have the\r\nstory there.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have it here, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the\r\nlisteners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen then! You!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Monks. \xe2\x80\x9cHis father being taken ill at\r\nRome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long\r\nseparated, who went from Paris and took me with her\xe2\x80\x94to look after his\r\nproperty, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor\r\nhe for her. He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he\r\nslumbered on till next day, when he died. Among the papers in his desk,\r\nwere two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x9d; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cand enclosed in a few\r\nshort lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that\r\nit was not to be forwarded till after he was dead. One of these papers\r\nwas a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter?\xe2\x80\x94A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a\r\npenitent confession, and prayers to God to help her. He had palmed a\r\ntale on the girl that some secret mystery\xe2\x80\x94to be explained one\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on,\r\ntrusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what\r\nnone could ever give her back. She was, at that time, within a few\r\nmonths of her confinement. He told her all he had meant to do, to hide\r\nher shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse\r\nhis memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on\r\nher or their young child; for all the guilt was his. He reminded her of\r\nthe day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her\r\nchristian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he\r\nhoped one day to have bestowed upon her\xe2\x80\x94prayed her yet to keep it, and\r\nwear it next her heart, as she had done before\xe2\x80\x94and then ran on, wildly,\r\nin the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted. I\r\nbelieve he had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s tears fell fast.\r\n\r\nMonks was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, \xe2\x80\x9cwas in the same\r\nspirit as the letter. He talked of miseries which his wife had brought\r\nupon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature\r\nbad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and\r\nleft you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The\r\nbulk of his property he divided into two equal portions\xe2\x80\x94one for Agnes\r\nFleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and\r\never come of age. If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money\r\nunconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his\r\nminority he should never have stained his name with any public act of\r\ndishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong. He did this, he said, to mark\r\nhis confidence in the mother, and his conviction\xe2\x80\x94only strengthened by\r\napproaching death\xe2\x80\x94that the child would share her gentle heart, and\r\nnoble nature. If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the\r\nmoney was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both\r\nchildren were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his\r\npurse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed\r\nhim with coldness and aversion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, in a louder tone, \xe2\x80\x9cdid what a woman should\r\nhave done. She burnt this will. The letter never reached its\r\ndestination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever\r\ntried to lie away the blot. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s father had the truth from her\r\nwith every aggravation that her violent hate\xe2\x80\x94I love her for it\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94could add. Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children\r\ninto a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his friends\r\nmight never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards,\r\nhe was found dead in his bed. The girl had left her home, in secret,\r\nsome weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and\r\nvillage near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that\r\nshe had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old\r\nheart broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread\r\nof the narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYears after this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis man\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94Edward Leeford\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94mother came\r\nto me. He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and\r\nmoney; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two\r\nyears he had associated with the lowest outcasts. She was sinking under\r\na painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she\r\ndied. Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were\r\nunavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back\r\nwith her to France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she died,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monks, \xe2\x80\x9cafter a lingering illness; and, on her\r\ndeath-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her\r\nunquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved\xe2\x80\x94though she\r\nneed not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before. She\r\nwould not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child\r\ntoo, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been\r\nborn, and was alive. I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to\r\nhunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and\r\nmost unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply\r\nfelt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by\r\ndraggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot. She was right. He\r\ncame in my way at last. I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I\r\nwould have finished as I began!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on\r\nhimself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the\r\nterrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been\r\nhis old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver\r\nensnared: of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his\r\nbeing rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit\r\nto the country house for the purpose of identifying him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe locket and ring?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them\r\nfrom the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Monks without\r\nraising his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what became of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great\r\nalacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her\r\nunwilling consort after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo my hi\xe2\x80\x99s deceive me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor is that little Oliver? Oh O-li-ver, if you know\xe2\x80\x99d how I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\na-grieving for you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, fool,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the workhouse master.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I be supposed to feel\xe2\x80\x94_I_ as brought him up porochially\xe2\x80\x94when I\r\nsee him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest\r\ndescription! I always loved that boy as if he\xe2\x80\x99d been my\xe2\x80\x94my\xe2\x80\x94my own\r\ngrandfather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the\r\nwhite waistcoat? Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with\r\nplated handles, Oliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; \xe2\x80\x9csuppress your feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do my endeavours, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bumble. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do,\r\nsir? I hope you are very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to\r\nwithin a short distance of the respectable couple. He inquired, as he\r\npointed to Monks,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw him in all my life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor sold him anything, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the matron. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are we brought here to answer\r\nto such nonsense as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman\r\nlimped away with extraordinary readiness. But not again did he return\r\nwith a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women,\r\nwho shook and tottered as they walked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shut the door the night old Sally died,\xe2\x80\x9d said the foremost one,\r\nraising her shrivelled hand, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t shut out the sound, nor\r\nstop the chinks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless\r\njaws. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe heard her try to tell you what she\xe2\x80\x99d done, and saw you take a paper\r\nfrom her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d added the second, \xe2\x80\x9cand it was a \xe2\x80\x98locket and gold ring.\xe2\x80\x99 We found\r\nout that, and saw it given you. We were by. Oh! we were by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we know more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the first, \xe2\x80\x9cfor she told us\r\noften, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she\r\nshould never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was\r\ntaken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to see the pawnbroker himself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Grimwig with\r\na motion towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cif he\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she pointed to Monks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chas been coward\r\nenough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags\r\ntill you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say. I _did_\r\nsell them, and they\xe2\x80\x99re where you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get them. What then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that it remains for us to take\r\ncare that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again. You\r\nmay leave the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as\r\nMr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope that this\r\nunfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial\r\noffice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed it will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may make up your mind to\r\nthat, and think yourself well off besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all Mrs. Bumble. She _would_ do it,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Mr. Bumble; first\r\nlooking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no excuse,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were present on the\r\noccasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more\r\nguilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that\r\nyour wife acts under your direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the law supposes that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat\r\nemphatically in both hands, \xe2\x80\x9cthe law is a ass\xe2\x80\x94a idiot. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\neye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is,\r\nthat his eye may be opened by experience\xe2\x80\x94by experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble\r\nfixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets,\r\nfollowed his helpmate downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me your hand.\r\nDo not tremble. You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we\r\nhave to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they have\xe2\x80\x94I do not know how they can, but if they have\xe2\x80\x94any\r\nreference to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cpray let me hear them at some other time.\r\nI have not strength or spirits now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nhave more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know this young lady,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw you before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen you often,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Monks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the fate of the other\xe2\x80\x94the child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Monks, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen her father died in a strange place,\r\nin a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that\r\nyielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be\r\ntraced\xe2\x80\x94the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as\r\ntheir own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the spot to which these people had repaired,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMonks, \xe2\x80\x9cbut where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way. My\r\nmother found it, after a year of cunning search\xe2\x80\x94ay, and found the\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe took it, did she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The people were poor and began to sicken\xe2\x80\x94at least the man did\xe2\x80\x94of\r\ntheir fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small\r\npresent of money which would not last long, and promised more, which\r\nshe never meant to send. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite rely, however, on their\r\ndiscontent and poverty for the child\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness, but told the\r\nhistory of the sister\xe2\x80\x99s shame, with such alterations as suited her;\r\nbade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and\r\ntold them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or\r\nother. The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it;\r\nand there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to\r\nsatisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the\r\ngirl by chance, pitied her, and took her home. There was some cursed\r\nspell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she\r\nremained there and was happy. I lost sight of her, two or three years\r\nago, and saw her no more until a few months back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see her now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Leaning on your arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not the less my niece,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting\r\ngirl in her arms; \xe2\x80\x9cnot the less my dearest child. I would not lose her\r\nnow, for all the treasures of the world. My sweet companion, my own\r\ndear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only friend I ever had,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rose, clinging to her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nkindest, best of friends. My heart will burst. I cannot bear all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest\r\ncreature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nMaylie, embracing her tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, my love, remember who this\r\nis who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here\xe2\x80\x94look, look,\r\nmy dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\ncall her aunt\xe2\x80\x94sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my\r\nheart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling Rose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLet the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in\r\nthe long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred. A father,\r\nsister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment. Joy and\r\ngrief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even\r\ngrief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender\r\nrecollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character\r\nof pain.\r\n\r\nThey were a long, long time alone. A soft tap at the door, at length\r\nannounced that some one was without. Oliver opened it, glided away, and\r\ngave place to Harry Maylie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl. \xe2\x80\x9cDear\r\nRose, I know it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not here by accident,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a lengthened silence; \xe2\x80\x9cnor\r\nhave I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday\xe2\x80\x94only yesterday.\r\nDo you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _do_ know all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll. You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the\r\nsubject of our last discourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to press you to alter your determination,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the young man,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of\r\nstation or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still\r\nadhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or\r\nact, to seek to change it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Rose firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose\r\ngoodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I\r\never feel it, as I should to-night? It is a struggle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\none I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe disclosure of to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Harry began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe disclosure of to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rose softly, \xe2\x80\x9cleaves me in the\r\nsame position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou harden your heart against me, Rose,\xe2\x80\x9d urged her lover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Harry, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, bursting into tears; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\r\ncould, and spare myself this pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why inflict it on yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, taking her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThink,\r\ndear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have I heard! What have I heard!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rose. \xe2\x80\x9cThat a sense\r\nof his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, detaining her as she rose. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nhopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my\r\nlove for you: have undergone a change. I offer you, now, no distinction\r\namong a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and\r\ndetraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but\r\nreal disgrace and shame; but a home\xe2\x80\x94a heart and home\xe2\x80\x94yes, dearest Rose,\r\nand those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean!\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean but this\xe2\x80\x94that when I left you last, I left you with a firm\r\ndetermination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me;\r\nresolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine;\r\nthat no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn\r\nfrom it. This I have done. Those who have shrunk from me because of\r\nthis, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right. Such power and\r\npatronage: such relatives of influence and rank: as smiled upon me\r\nthen, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x99s richest county; and by one village church\xe2\x80\x94mine, Rose, my\r\nown!\xe2\x80\x94there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of,\r\nthan all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold. This is\r\nmy rank and station now, and here I lay it down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig,\r\nwaking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time.\r\nNeither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together),\r\ncould offer a word in extenuation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grimwig,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor I began to think I should get nothing else. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the liberty,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the\r\nblushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by\r\nthe doctor and Mr. Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had\r\nbeen observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the\r\nbest authorities consider this downright scandal: he being young and a\r\nclergyman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOliver, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Maylie, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere have you been, and why do\r\nyou look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this\r\nmoment. What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish,\r\nand hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.\r\n\r\nPoor Dick was dead!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LII.\r\nFAGIN\xe2\x80\x99S LAST NIGHT ALIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive\r\nand eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before\r\nthe dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the\r\ngalleries, all looks were fixed upon one man\xe2\x80\x94Fagin. Before him and\r\nbehind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand\r\nsurrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand\r\nresting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and\r\nhis head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater\r\ndistinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was\r\ndelivering his charge to the jury. At times, he turned his eyes sharply\r\nupon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his\r\nfavour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible\r\ndistinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would,\r\neven then, urge something in his behalf. Beyond these manifestations of\r\nanxiety, he stirred not hand or foot. He had scarcely moved since the\r\ntrial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained\r\nin the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on\r\nhim, as though he listened still.\r\n\r\nA slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking round,\r\nhe saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict.\r\nAs his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising\r\nabove each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses\r\nto their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks\r\nexpressive of abhorrence. A few there were, who seemed unmindful of\r\nhim, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could\r\ndelay. But in no one face\xe2\x80\x94not even among the women, of whom there were\r\nmany there\xe2\x80\x94could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any\r\nfeeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned.\r\n\r\nAs he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness\r\ncame again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards\r\nthe judge. Hush!\r\n\r\nThey only sought permission to retire.\r\n\r\nHe looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed\r\nout, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was\r\nfruitless. The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed\r\nmechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair. The man\r\npointed it out, or he would not have seen it.\r\n\r\nHe looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating,\r\nand some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place\r\nwas very hot. There was one young man sketching his face in a little\r\nnote-book. He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the\r\nartist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any\r\nidle spectator might have done.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind\r\nbegan to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost,\r\nand how he put it on. There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too,\r\nwho had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back. He\r\nwondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner,\r\nwhat he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of\r\ncareless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nNot that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one\r\noppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it\r\nwas ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could\r\nnot fix his thoughts upon it. Thus, even while he trembled, and turned\r\nburning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron\r\nspikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken\r\noff, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was. Then, he\r\nthought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold\xe2\x80\x94and stopped\r\nto watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it\xe2\x80\x94and then went on to\r\nthink again.\r\n\r\nAt length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all\r\ntowards the door. The jury returned, and passed him close. He could\r\nglean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone.\r\nPerfect stillness ensued\xe2\x80\x94not a rustle\xe2\x80\x94not a breath\xe2\x80\x94Guilty.\r\n\r\nThe building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another,\r\nand then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled\r\nout, like angry thunder. It was a peal of joy from the populace\r\noutside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why\r\nsentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his\r\nlistening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the\r\ndemand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it,\r\nand then he only muttered that he was an old man\xe2\x80\x94an old man\xe2\x80\x94and so,\r\ndropping into a whisper, was silent again.\r\n\r\nThe judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the\r\nsame air and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation,\r\ncalled forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry\r\nat the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. The address\r\nwas solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he stood,\r\nlike a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve. His haggard face\r\nwas still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes\r\nstaring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and\r\nbeckoned him away. He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\nThey led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners\r\nwere waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their\r\nfriends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.\r\nThere was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the\r\nprisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were\r\nclinging to the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and\r\nscreeched and hissed. He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them;\r\nbut his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by\r\na few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.\r\n\r\nHere, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of\r\nanticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of\r\nthe condemned cells, and left him there\xe2\x80\x94alone.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat\r\nand bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to\r\ncollect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few\r\ndisjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed\r\nto him, at the time, that he could not hear a word. These gradually\r\nfell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that\r\nin a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered. To be\r\nhanged by the neck, till he was dead\xe2\x80\x94that was the end. To be hanged by\r\nthe neck till he was dead.\r\n\r\nAs it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known\r\nwho had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. They\r\nrose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them. He\r\nhad seen some of them die,\xe2\x80\x94and had joked too, because they died with\r\nprayers upon their lips. With what a rattling noise the drop went down;\r\nand how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling\r\nheaps of clothes!\r\n\r\nSome of them might have inhabited that very cell\xe2\x80\x94sat upon that very\r\nspot. It was very dark; why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they bring a light? The cell had\r\nbeen built for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last\r\nhours there. It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath\r\nthat hideous veil.\xe2\x80\x94Light, light!\r\n\r\nAt length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door\r\nand walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into\r\nan iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a\r\nmattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left\r\nalone no more.\r\n\r\nThen came the night\xe2\x80\x94dark, dismal, silent night. Other watchers are glad\r\nto hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day.\r\nTo him they brought despair. The boom of every iron bell came laden\r\nwith the one, deep, hollow sound\xe2\x80\x94Death. What availed the noise and\r\nbustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was\r\nanother form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.\r\n\r\nThe day passed off. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in\r\nits dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours. At one time he\r\nraved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair.\r\nVenerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he\r\nhad driven them away with curses. They renewed their charitable\r\nefforts, and he beat them off.\r\n\r\nSaturday night. He had only one night more to live. And as he thought\r\nof this, the day broke\xe2\x80\x94Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering\r\nsense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon\r\nhis blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive\r\nhope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than\r\nthe dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of\r\nthe two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and\r\nthey, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention. He had\r\nsat there, awake, but dreaming. Now, he started up, every minute, and\r\nwith gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a\r\nparoxysm of fear and wrath that even they\xe2\x80\x94used to such sights\xe2\x80\x94recoiled\r\nfrom him with horror. He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures\r\nof his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there,\r\neyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.\r\n\r\nHe cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had\r\nbeen wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his\r\ncapture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair\r\nhung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into\r\nknots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh\r\ncrackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight\xe2\x80\x94nine\xe2\x80\x94then. If it was\r\nnot a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s heels, where would he be, when they came round again!\r\nEleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had\r\nceased to vibrate. At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own\r\nfuneral train; at eleven\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThose dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and\r\nsuch unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and\r\ntoo long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as\r\nthat. The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man\r\nwas doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that\r\nnight, if they could have seen him.\r\n\r\nFrom early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two\r\nand three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with\r\nanxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received. These being\r\nanswered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to\r\nclusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from\r\nwhich he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built,\r\nand, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the\r\nscene. By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the\r\ndead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.\r\n\r\nThe space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,\r\npainted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the\r\npressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared\r\nat the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner,\r\nsigned by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately admitted into the\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the young gentleman to come too, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man whose duty it\r\nwas to conduct them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a sight for children, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not indeed, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my business\r\nwith this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has\r\nseen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94even at the cost of some pain and fear\xe2\x80\x94that he should see him\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.\r\nThe man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity,\r\nopened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and\r\nled them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of\r\nworkmen were making some preparations in profound silence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis is the\r\nplace he passes through. If you step this way, you can see the door he\r\ngoes out at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the\r\nprison food, and pointed to a door. There was an open grating above it,\r\nthrough which came the sound of men\xe2\x80\x99s voices, mingled with the noise of\r\nhammering, and the throwing down of boards. They were putting up the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nFrom this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by\r\nother turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard,\r\nascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row\r\nof strong doors on the left hand. Motioning them to remain where they\r\nwere, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The\r\ntwo attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage,\r\nstretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned\r\nthe visitors to follow the jailer into the cell. They did so.\r\n\r\nThe condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side\r\nto side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the\r\nface of a man. His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he\r\ncontinued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence\r\notherwise than as a part of his vision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood boy, Charley\xe2\x80\x94well done\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cOliver, too, ha! ha! ha!\r\nOliver too\xe2\x80\x94quite the gentleman now\xe2\x80\x94quite the\xe2\x80\x94take that boy away to\r\nbed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not\r\nto be alarmed, looked on without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him away to bed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me, some of you? He\r\nhas been the\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94somehow the cause of all this. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth the money to\r\nbring him up to it\xe2\x80\x94Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s throat, Bill; never mind the girl\xe2\x80\x94Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthroat as deep as you can cut. Saw his head off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFagin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of\r\nlistening he had assumed upon his trial. \xe2\x80\x9cAn old man, my Lord; a very\r\nold, old man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him\r\ndown. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I\r\nsuppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t be one long,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, looking up with a face retaining no\r\nhuman expression but rage and terror. \xe2\x80\x9cStrike them all dead! What right\r\nhave they to butcher me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to\r\nthe furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey, still holding him down. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, tell him\r\nwhat you want. Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time\r\ngets on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have some papers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow advancing, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich were placed\r\nin your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all a lie together,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t one\xe2\x80\x94not one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not say that\r\nnow, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. You know\r\nthat Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of\r\nany further gain. Where are those papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOliver,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin, beckoning to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, here! Let me whisper to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr.\r\nBrownlow\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe papers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, \xe2\x80\x9care in a canvas\r\nbag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I\r\nwant to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me say a prayer. Do! Let me say one\r\nprayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOutside, outside,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards\r\nthe door, and looking vacantly over his head. \xe2\x80\x9cSay I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to\r\nsleep\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll believe you. You can get me out, if you take me so. Now\r\nthen, now then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! God forgive this wretched man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boy with a burst of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll help us on. This\r\ndoor first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nmind, but hurry on. Now, now, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you nothing else to ask him, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo other question,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brownlow. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I hoped we could recall\r\nhim to a sense of his position\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will do that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhad better leave him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPress on, press on,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fagin. \xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, but not so slow. Faster,\r\nfaster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp,\r\nheld him back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an\r\ninstant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those\r\nmassive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before they left the prison. Oliver nearly swooned\r\nafter this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more,\r\nhe had not the strength to walk.\r\n\r\nDay was dawning when they again emerged. A great multitude had already\r\nassembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing\r\ncards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking.\r\nEverything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects\r\nin the centre of all\xe2\x80\x94the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all\r\nthe hideous apparatus of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LIII.\r\nAND LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.\r\nThe little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few\r\nand simple words.\r\n\r\nBefore three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were\r\nmarried in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of\r\nthe young clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s labours; on the same day they entered into\r\npossession of their new and happy home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to\r\nenjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity\r\nthat age and worth can know\xe2\x80\x94the contemplation of the happiness of those\r\non whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent\r\nlife, have been unceasingly bestowed.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of\r\nproperty remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered\r\neither in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided\r\nbetween himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than\r\nthree thousand pounds. By the provisions of his father\xe2\x80\x99s will, Oliver\r\nwould have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to\r\ndeprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices\r\nand pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to\r\nwhich his young charge joyfully acceded.\r\n\r\nMonks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a\r\ndistant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he\r\nonce more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long\r\nconfinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk\r\nunder an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison. As far from\r\nhome, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin\xe2\x80\x99s gang.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old\r\nhousekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear\r\nfriends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s warm\r\nand earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose\r\ncondition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever\r\nbe known in this changing world.\r\n\r\nSoon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned\r\nto Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would\r\nhave been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a\r\nfeeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. For\r\ntwo or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared\r\nthe air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really\r\nno longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his\r\nassistant, took a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s cottage outside the village of which his\r\nyoung friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered. Here he took to\r\ngardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits\r\nof a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity.\r\nIn each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood,\r\nas a most profound authority.\r\n\r\nBefore his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for\r\nMr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He\r\nis accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course\r\nof the year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and\r\ncarpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and\r\nunprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite\r\nasseveration, that his mode is the right one. On Sundays, he never\r\nfails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s face: always\r\ninforming Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he\r\nconsiders it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say\r\nso. It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally\r\nhim on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the\r\nnight on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his\r\nreturn; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in\r\nproof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which\r\nalways calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.\r\n\r\nMr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in\r\nconsequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering\r\nhis profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for\r\nsome little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened\r\nwith too much work. After some consideration, he went into business as\r\nan informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence. His\r\nplan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by\r\nCharlotte in respectable attire. The lady faints away at the doors of\r\ncharitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with\r\nthree-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next\r\nday, and pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints\r\nhimself, but the result is the same.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually\r\nreduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in\r\nthat very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.\r\nMr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation,\r\nhe has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts,\r\nalthough the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. They\r\nsleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among\r\nits inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to\r\nthis day the villagers have never been able to discover to which\r\nestablishment they properly belong.\r\n\r\nMaster Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes\xe2\x80\x99s crime, fell into a train of\r\nreflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.\r\nArriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back\r\nupon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of\r\naction. He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but,\r\nhaving a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the\r\nend; and, from being a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s drudge, and a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s lad, he is now\r\nthe merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches\r\nthe conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space,\r\nthe thread of these adventures.\r\n\r\nI would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long\r\nmoved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would\r\nshow Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood,\r\nshedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell\r\non all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would paint\r\nher the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer\r\ngroup; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear\r\nthe low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would\r\nwatch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling\r\nuntiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and\r\nher dead sister\xe2\x80\x99s child happy in their love for one another, and\r\npassing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so\r\nsadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little\r\nfaces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle;\r\nI would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the\r\nsympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye. These, and a\r\nthousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech\xe2\x80\x94I would fain\r\nrecall them every one.\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his\r\nadopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him,\r\nmore and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving\r\nseeds of all he wished him to become\xe2\x80\x94how he traced in him new traits of\r\nhis early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances,\r\nmelancholy and yet sweet and soothing\xe2\x80\x94how the two orphans, tried by\r\nadversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love,\r\nand fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them\xe2\x80\x94these\r\nare all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were\r\ntruly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and\r\ngratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute\r\nis Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nWithin the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble\r\ntablet, which bears as yet but one word: \xe2\x80\x9cAGNES.\xe2\x80\x9d There is no coffin in\r\nthat tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is\r\nplaced above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to\r\nearth, to visit spots hallowed by the love\xe2\x80\x94the love beyond the grave\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nthose whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes\r\nsometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less\r\nbecause that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OLIVER TWIST ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 730-0.txt or 730-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/7/3/730/\r\n\r\nProduced by Peggy Gaugy and Leigh Little.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
