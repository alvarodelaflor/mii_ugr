Abstract    :
                   The research is to investigate a cognitive engineering based              
              approach which incorporates user's (operator's) cognitive                      
              characteristics into the interface design of decision                          
              support systems (DSS) for troubleshooting advanced  manufacturing              
              systems.  The objectives are (1) to verify operator's task-related             
              knowledge model which is derived from a cognitive theory of human              
              knowledge systems; (2) to evaluate usability of a theory-based                 
              interface of DSS which is designed through integrating  operator's             
              knowledge model and advanced human-computer interaction technology             
              (direct manipulation).  Three experiments will be conducted to test            
              hypotheses on three aspects of operator's knowledge model:                     
              structure, content, and control strategy.  An additional experiment            
              will be conducted to compare usability of the theory-based                     
              interface to that of a conventional interface of DSS.                          
                   The research will enhance the understanding of operator's                 
              supervisory control behaviors and lead to a design model for the               
              interface of DSS.
