Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of mixed diatom assemblages from                   
              Pliocene to late Quaternary glacial sediments in the Ross Sea                  
              region of Antarctica that are referred to as the Ross Sea                      
              Diamicton.  This layer of glacial sediment is the record of glacial            
              activity during the last glacial maximum and holds information                 
              about the waxing and waning of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  This             
              study will utilize samples that have been recovered in piston and              
              drill cores from the Ross Sea and from beneath the West Antarctic              
              Ice Sheet and will use modern quantitative methods for identifying             
              and interpreting diatom populations.  The data developed in this               
              study will be used to test stratigraphic models for the Ross                   
              Sea Embayment.  These stratigraphic models will be used to assess              
              the level of dynamic behavior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,                 
              specifically the question of whether, and how often, this ice sheet            
              has collapsed in the geologically recent past.
