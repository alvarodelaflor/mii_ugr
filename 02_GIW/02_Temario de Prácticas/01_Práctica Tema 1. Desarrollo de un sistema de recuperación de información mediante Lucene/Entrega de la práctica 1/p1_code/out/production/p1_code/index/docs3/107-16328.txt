for a\r\nvery close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be\r\nprose to a modern ear.\r\n\r\nThe Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally\r\na deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient\r\nreason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,\r\nhowever, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted\r\nfrom the criticisms of other students of the poem.\r\n\r\nThis work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike\r\nthe translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he\r\nhopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of\r\nEnglish literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the\r\nmost ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;\r\nand yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow\r\neven a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of\r\nHrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the\r\nhearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.\r\n\r\nIn order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been\r\nused, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of\r\nthe original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.\r\n\r\nPerhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf\r\nshould be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe\r\nto be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold\r\nto say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is\r\njustly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,\r\nseveral have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it\r\nproper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and\r\nHrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,\r\nagain, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be\r\ninterpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear\r\nwhat has been beautifully called "the clanging tread of a warrior in\r\nmail"?\r\n\r\n[viii]\r\n\r\nOf all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone\r\ngives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great\r\nTeutonic epic.\r\n\r\nThe measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a\r\nreproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences\r\nclosely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking\r\npoems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as\r\nmuch thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular\r\ncadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought\r\nthat modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has\r\nbeen used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some\r\nwarrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for\r\ninternal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)\r\n\r\nWhat Gummere[1] calls the "rime-giver" has been studiously kept; _viz._,\r\nthe first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the\r\nalliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only\r\nsporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the\r\noriginal. (See 7_61, 8_5.)\r\n\r\nNo two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally\r\nafter a c\xc3\xa6sural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,\r\nSievers\'s C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of\r\ntranslation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and\r\na variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |\r\nx / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives\r\nfurther variety to the types used in the translation.\r\n\r\nThe parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,\r\n1_16 and 1_17: "Lord" and "Wielder of Glory"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and\r\n2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been\r\nsustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.\r\n\r\nThe effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the\r\ntranslation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have\r\nbeen avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are\r\nnone, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.\r\n\r\n[ix]\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of\r\nthe story of the poem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE STORY._\r\n\r\n_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or\r\npalace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.\r\nThe joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the\r\nmonster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of\r\njoyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and\r\nanon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after\r\nthane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong\r\nenough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he\r\npersecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._\r\n\r\n_Over sea, a day\'s voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,\r\nking of the Geats, hears of Grendel\'s doings and of Hrothgar\'s misery. He\r\nresolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With\r\nfourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that\r\ncountry, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours\r\nthat elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When\r\nHrothgar\'s bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling\r\nhim that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his\r\npalace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._\r\n\r\n_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God\'s anger. He seizes\r\nand kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.\r\nA fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,\r\nboth combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears\r\nGrendel\'s shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,\r\nhowling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._\r\n\r\n_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall\r\nHeorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and\r\nhis retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._\r\n\r\n_Grendel\'s mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She\r\nis furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart\r\n[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar\'s\r\nfavorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is\r\ncalled. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and\r\ngoes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the\r\nwaters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her\r\nden. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal\r\nstruggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking\r\nwith him Grendel\'s head._\r\n\r\n_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar\r\nliterally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among\r\nthe vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._\r\n\r\n_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._\r\n\r\n_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a\r\ndistinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._\r\n\r\n_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he\r\nhas been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried\r\nby a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing\r\nstruggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is\r\ninexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor\r\nthe memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is\r\nburnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that\r\nsailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national\r\nhero of Geatland._\r\n\r\n_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,\r\nhis goodness of heart, and his generosity._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the\r\nstory of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that\r\nof the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history\r\nof the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our\r\nforefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nMy special thanks are due to Professors Francis A.

Another,\r\n    that adopted by S. and endorsed in the H.-So. notes, is: _B. heard\r\n    from his neighborhood (neighbors),_ i.e. _in his home, etc_. A third\r\n    is: _B., being at home, heard this as occurring away from home_. The\r\n    H.-So. glossary and notes conflict.\r\n\r\n    [2] \'Eoletes\' (224) is marked with a (?) by H.-So.; our rendering\r\n    simply follows his conjecture.--Other conjectures as to \'eolet\' are:\r\n    (1) _voyage_, (2) _toil_, _labor_, (3) _hasty journey_.\r\n\r\n    [3] The lacuna of the MS at this point has been supplied by various\r\n    conjectures. The reading adopted by H.-So. has been rendered in the\r\n    above translation. W., like H.-So., makes \'ic\' the beginning of a new\r\n    sentence, but, for \'helmas b\xc3\xa6ron,\' he reads \'hringed stefnan.\' This\r\n    has the advantage of giving a parallel to \'brontne ceol\' instead of a\r\n    kenning for \'go.\'--B puts the (?) after \'holmas\', and begins a new\r\n    sentence at the middle of the line. Translate: _What warriors are ye,\r\n    clad in armor, who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the\r\n    water way, hither over the seas? For some time on the wall I have been\r\n    coast guard, etc_. S. endorses most of what B. says, but leaves out\r\n    \'on the wall\' in the last sentence. If W.\'s \'hringed stefnan\' be\r\n    accepted, change line 51 above to, _A ring-stemmed vessel hither\r\n    o\'ersea_.\r\n\r\n    [4] \'Seld-guma\' (249) is variously rendered: (1) _housecarle_; (2)\r\n    _home-stayer_; (3) _common man_. Dr. H. Wood suggests _a man-at-arms\r\n    in another\'s house_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE GEATS REACH HEOROT.\r\n\r\n\r\n{Beowulf courteously replies.}\r\n\r\n          The chief of the strangers rendered him answer,\r\n          War-troopers\' leader, and word-treasure opened:\r\n\r\n{We are Geats.}\r\n\r\n          "We are sprung from the lineage of the people of Geatland,\r\n          And Higelac\'s hearth-friends.

In the two\r\n    Beowulf passages, the \xc3\xbe\xc3\xa6t-clause is anticipated by \'\xc3\xbe\xc3\xa6s,\' which is\r\n    clearly a gen. of the thing agreed on.\r\n\r\n    The first passage (v. 1599 (b)-1600) I translate literally: _Then many\r\n    agreed upon this (namely), that the sea-wolf had killed him_.\r\n\r\n    The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): _She is promised ...; to this\r\n    the friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc_. By emending \'is\' instead\r\n    of \'w\xc3\xa6s\' (2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.\r\n\r\n    In v. 1997 ff. this same idiom occurs, and was noticed in B.\'s great\r\n    article on Beowulf, which appeared about the time I published my\r\n    reading of 1599 and 2027. Translate 1997 then: _Wouldst let the\r\n    South-Danes themselves decide about their struggle with Grendel_. Here\r\n    \'S\xc3\xba\xc3\xb0-Dene\' is accus. of person, and \'g\xc3\xba\xc3\xb0e\' is gen. of thing agreed on.\r\n\r\n    With such collateral support as that afforded by B. (P. and B. XII.\r\n    97), I have no hesitation in departing from H.-So., my usual guide.\r\n\r\n    The idiom above treated runs through A.-S., Old Saxon, and other\r\n    Teutonic languages, and should be noticed in the lexicons.\r\n\r\n    [2] \'Br\xc3\xb3den-m\xc3\xa6l\' is regarded by most scholars as meaning a damaskeened\r\n    sword.

Hrothgar discoursed then,\r\n          Making rejoinder: "These words thou hast uttered\r\n       25 All-knowing God hath given thy spirit!\r\n\r\n{O Beowulf, thou art wise beyond thy years.}\r\n\r\n          Ne\'er heard I an earlman thus early in life\r\n          More clever in speaking: thou\'rt cautious of spirit,\r\n          Mighty of muscle, in mouth-answers prudent.\r\n          I count on the hope that, happen it ever\r\n       30 That missile shall rob thee of Hrethel\'s descendant,\r\n          Edge-horrid battle, and illness or weapon\r\n          Deprive thee of prince, of people\'s protector,\r\n\r\n{Should Higelac die, the Geats could find no better successor than thou\r\nwouldst make.}\r\n\r\n          And life thou yet holdest, the Sea-Geats will never\r\n          Find a more fitting folk-lord to choose them,\r\n       35 Gem-ward of heroes, than _thou_ mightest prove thee,\r\n          If the kingdom of kinsmen thou carest to govern.\r\n          Thy mood-spirit likes me the longer the better,\r\n          Beowulf dear: thou hast brought it to pass that\r\n          To both these peoples peace shall be common,\r\n\r\n{Thou hast healed the ancient breach between our races.}\r\n\r\n       40 To Geat-folk and Danemen, the strife be suspended,\r\n          The secret assailings they suffered in yore-days;\r\n          And also that jewels be shared while I govern\r\n          The wide-stretching kingdom, and that many shall visit\r\n          Others o\'er the ocean with excellent gift-gems:\r\n       45 The ring-adorned bark shall bring o\'er the currents\r\n          Presents and love-gifts.

Beowulf thenceward,\r\n          Gold-splendid warrior, walked o\'er the meadows\r\n       65 Exulting in treasure: the sea-going vessel\r\n          Riding at anchor awaited its owner.\r\n          As they pressed on their way then, the present of Hrothgar\r\n\r\n{Giving liberally is the true proof of kingship.}\r\n\r\n          Was frequently referred to: a folk-king indeed that\r\n          Everyway blameless, till age did debar him\r\n       70 The joys of his might, which hath many oft injured.\r\n\r\n    [1] For \'geworhte,\' the crux of this passage, B. proposes \'ge\xc3\xbe\xc3\xb3hte,\'\r\n    rendering: _I know this people with firm thought every way blameless\r\n    towards foe and friends_.\r\n\r\n    [2] S. and B. emend so as to negative the verb \'meet.\' "Why should\r\n    Hrothgar weep if he expects to meet Beowulf again?" both these\r\n    scholars ask. But the weeping is mentioned before the \'expectations\':\r\n    the tears may have been due to many emotions, especially gratitude,\r\n    struggling for expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOMEWARD JOURNEY.--THE TWO QUEENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Then the band of very valiant retainers\r\n          Came to the current; they were clad all in armor,\r\n\r\n{The coast-guard again.}\r\n\r\n          In link-woven burnies. The land-warder noticed\r\n          The return of the earlmen, as he erstwhile had seen them;\r\n        5 Nowise with insult he greeted the strangers\r\n          From the naze of the cliff, but rode on to meet them;\r\n          Said the bright-armored visitors[1] vesselward traveled\r\n[65]      Welcome to Weders. The wide-bosomed craft then\r\n          Lay on the sand, laden with armor,\r\n       10 With horses and jewels, the ring-stemm\xc3\xa8d sailer:\r\n          The mast uptowered o\'er the treasure of Hrothgar.\r\n\r\n{Beowulf gives the guard a handsome sword.}\r\n\r\n          To the boat-ward a gold-bound brand he presented,\r\n          That he was afterwards honored on the ale-bench more highly\r\n          As the heirloom\'s owner. [2]Set he out on his vessel,\r\n       15 To drive on the deep, Dane-country left he.\r\n          Along by the mast then a sea-garment fluttered,\r\n          A rope-fastened sail. The sea-boat resounded,\r\n          The wind o\'er the waters the wave-floater nowise\r\n          Kept from its journey; the sea-goer traveled,\r\n       20 The foamy-necked floated forth o\'er the currents,\r\n          The well-fashioned vessel o\'er the ways of the ocean,\r\n\r\n{The Geats see their own land again.}\r\n\r\n          Till they came within sight of the cliffs of the Geatmen,\r\n          The well-known headlands. The wave-goer hastened\r\n          Driven by breezes, stood on the shore.\r\n\r\n{The port-warden is anxiously looking for them.}\r\n\r\n       25 Prompt at the ocean, the port-ward was ready,\r\n          Who long in the past outlooked in the distance,[3]\r\n          At water\'s-edge waiting well-lov\xc3\xa8d heroes;\r\n          He bound to the bank then the broad-bosomed vessel\r\n          Fast in its fetters, lest the force of the waters\r\n       30 Should be able to injure the ocean-wood winsome.\r\n          Bade he up then take the treasure of princes,\r\n          Plate-gold and fretwork; not far was it thence\r\n          To go off in search of the giver of jewels:\r\n[66]      Hrethel\'s son Higelac at home there remaineth,[4]\r\n       35 Himself with his comrades close to the sea-coast.\r\n          The building was splendid, the king heroic,\r\n          Great in his hall, Hygd very young was,\r\n\r\n{Hygd, the noble queen of Higelac, lavish of gifts.}\r\n\r\n          Fine-mooded, clever, though few were the winters\r\n          That the daughter of H\xc3\xa6reth had dwelt in the borough;\r\n       40 But she nowise was cringing nor niggard of presents,\r\n          Of ornaments rare, to the race of the Geatmen.\r\n\r\n{Offa\'s consort, Thrytho, is contrasted with Hygd.}\r\n\r\n          Thrytho nursed anger, excellent[5] folk-queen,\r\n          Hot-burning hatred: no hero whatever\r\n          \'Mong household companions, her husband excepted\r\n\r\n{She is a terror to all save her husband.}\r\n\r\n       45 Dared to adventure to look at the woman\r\n          With eyes in the daytime;[6] but he knew that death-chains\r\n          Hand-wreathed were wrought him: early thereafter,\r\n          When the hand-strife was over, edges were ready,\r\n          That fierce-raging sword-point had to force a decision,\r\n       50 Murder-bale show.

Accepting this,\r\n    we may render: _He said the bright-armored warriors were going to\r\n    their vessel, welcome, etc_. (Cf. 1804.)\r\n\r\n    [2] R. suggests, \'Gew\xc3\xa1t him on naca,\' and renders: _The vessel set\r\n    out, to drive on the sea, the Dane-country left_. \'On\' bears the\r\n    alliteration; cf. \'on hafu\' (2524). This has some advantages over the\r\n    H.-So. reading; viz. (1) It adds nothing to the text; (2) it makes\r\n    \'naca\' the subject, and thus brings the passage into keeping with the\r\n    context, where the poet has exhausted his vocabulary in detailing the\r\n    actions of the vessel.--B.\'s emendation (cf. P. and B. XII. 97) is\r\n    violent.\r\n\r\n    [3] B. translates: _Who for a long time, ready at the coast, had\r\n    looked out into the distance eagerly for the dear men_. This changes\r\n    the syntax of \'l\xc3\xa9ofra manna.\'\r\n\r\n    [4] For \'wuna\xc3\xb0\' (v. 1924) several eminent critics suggest \'wunade\'\r\n    (=remained). This makes the passage much clearer.\r\n\r\n    [5] Why should such a woman be described as an \'excellent\' queen? C.\r\n    suggests \'fr\xc3\xa9cnu\' = dangerous, bold.\r\n\r\n    [6] For \'an d\xc3\xa6ges\' various readings have been offered. If \'and-\xc3\xa9ges\'\r\n    be accepted, the sentence will read: _No hero ... dared look upon her,\r\n    eye to eye_. If \'\xc3\xa1n-d\xc3\xa6ges\' be adopted, translate: _Dared look upon her\r\n    the whole day_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\nBEOWULF AND HIGELAC.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Then the brave one departed, his band along with him,\r\n\r\n{Beowulf and his party seek Higelac.}\r\n\r\n          Seeking the sea-shore, the sea-marches treading,\r\n          The wide-stretching shores.

The coming of Beowulf\r\n          Was announced in a message quickly to Higelac,\r\n       10 That the folk-troop\'s defender forth to the palace\r\n          The linden-companion alive was advancing,\r\n          Secure from the combat courtward a-going.\r\n          The building was early inward made ready\r\n          For the foot-going guests as the good one had ordered.\r\n\r\n{Beowulf sits by his liegelord.}\r\n\r\n       15 He sat by the man then who had lived through the struggle,\r\n          Kinsman by kinsman, when the king of the people\r\n          Had in lordly language saluted the dear one,\r\n\r\n{Queen Hygd receives the heroes.}\r\n\r\n          In words that were formal.

As, however, this book may fall\r\ninto the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems\r\nbest to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.\r\n\r\n~From h\xc3\xa1m~ (194).--Notes and glossary conflict; the latter not having been\r\naltered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former.\r\n\r\n~\xc3\x9e\xc3\xa6r gel\xc3\xbdfan sceal dryhtnes d\xc3\xb3me~ (440).--Under \'d\xc3\xb3m\' H. says \'the might\r\nof the Lord\'; while under \'gel\xc3\xbdfan\' he says \'the judgment of the Lord.\'\r\n\r\n~Eal benc\xc3\xbeelu~ (486).--Under \'benc-\xc3\xbeelu\' H. says _nom. plu._; while under\r\n\'eal\' he says _nom. sing._\r\n\r\n~Heatho-r\xc3\xa6mas~ (519).--Under \'\xc3\xa6tberan\' H. translates \'to the Heathoremes\';\r\nwhile under \'Heatho-r\xc3\xa6mas\' he says \'Heathor\xc3\xa6mas reaches Breca in the\r\nswimming-match with Beowulf.\' Harrison and Sharp (3d edition, 1888) avoid\r\nthe discrepancy.\r\n\r\n~F\xc3\xa1h f\xc3\xa9ond-sca\xc3\xb0a~ (554).--Under \'f\xc3\xa9ond-sca\xc3\xb0a\' H. says \'a gleaming\r\nsea-monster\'; under \'f\xc3\xa1h\' he says \'hostile.\'\r\n\r\n~Onfeng hra\xc3\xb0e inwit-\xc3\xbeancum~ (749).--Under \'onf\xc3\xb3n\' H. says \'he _received_\r\nthe maliciously-disposed one\'; under \'inwit-\xc3\xbeanc\' he says \'he _grasped_,\'\r\netc.\r\n\r\n~N\xc3\xad\xc3\xb0-wundor s\xc3\xa9on~ (1366).--Under \'n\xc3\xad\xc3\xb0-wundor\' H. calls this word itself\r\n_nom. sing._; under \'s\xc3\xa9on\' he translates it as accus. sing., understanding\r\n\'man\' as subject of \'s\xc3\xa9on.\' H. and S.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
