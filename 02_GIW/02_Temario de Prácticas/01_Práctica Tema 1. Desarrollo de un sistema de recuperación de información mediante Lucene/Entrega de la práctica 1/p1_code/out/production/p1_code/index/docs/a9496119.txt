Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Dr. Haegel has been selected as a Presidential Young                      
              Investigator.  She is active in research on optoelectronic                     
              properties of semiconductor materials, with emphasis on transient              
              behavior and space charge-related effects in high resistivity                  
              materials.  In this research program for the National Science                  
              Foundation she will pursue studies to include the following:  (1)              
              electrical transport and trasient phenomena in high resistivity                
              materials, such as high purity materials at low temperature,                   
              semi-insulating gallium arsenide, or large bandgap materials, (2)              
              transition from transport dominated by carrier lifetime to                     
              transport dominated by dielectric relaxation as a function of                  
              temperature, (3) effects of extended defects, and point defects                
              on optical and electronic properties, (4) development of new                   
              techniqaues to characterize semiconductor thin films and                       
              heterostructures.  The ultimate goal of the research is to                     
              acquire the knowledge and understanding necessary to study both                
              optically and electrical induced transient effects in materials                
              over a wide range of time scales to elucidate the dynamics of the              
              interactions between free and trapped carriers and defects in                  
              semiconductors.                                                                
                                                                                             
                   The research is important for materials used in high=speed                
              switches, fast detectors, isolating substrates for optoelectronic              
              circuits, and future communications and computation systems.
