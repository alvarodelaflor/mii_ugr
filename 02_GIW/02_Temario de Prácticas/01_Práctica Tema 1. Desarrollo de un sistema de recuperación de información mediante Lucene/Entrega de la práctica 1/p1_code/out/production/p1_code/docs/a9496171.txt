Abstract    :
              Although the structure of sunspots has been studied in considerable            
              detail in and above the photosphere, it has only recently been                 
              possible to probe the structure beneath the visible surface of the             
              Sun.  Recent work shows that this can be done using the scattering             
              of p-mode acoustic waves by spots.  This work will be expanded to              
              include the scattering of p-modes from a variety of active regions,            
              the temporal evolution of the scattering properties of emerging and            
              decaying active regions and the reconstruction of the subsurface               
              morphology.
