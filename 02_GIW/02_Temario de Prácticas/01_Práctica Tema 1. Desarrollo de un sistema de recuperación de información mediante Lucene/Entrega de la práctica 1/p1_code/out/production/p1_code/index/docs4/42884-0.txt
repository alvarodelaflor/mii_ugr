PREFACE


In this and the succeeding volume, we present various documents
(notably the Relation of Antonio Pigafetta) which could not be obtained
in season for publication in regular chronological order, and which it
has seemed advisable to insert as addenda at this point.



With the present volume is begun the publication of Antonio
Pigafetta’s relation of the first circumnavigation of the world—the
greatest single achievement in all the history of sea exploration and
discovery. Written by a participant of the expedition, Pigafetta’s
relation has a greater value than any other narrative of the voyage.
Its great value and the fact that it has never been adequately
presented to the English-speaking public have induced the editors to
insert this relation in the present series both in the original Italian
(rigidly adhering to and preserving all the peculiarities of the
original manuscript) and in English translation. This relation is
especially valuable for its descriptions of the various peoples,
countries, and products, of Oriental seas, and for its vocabularies, as
well as for its account of the first circumnavigation. From its very
nature, the relation has called for an unusual amount of annotation,
which has been drawn freely from various sources: chiefly Mosto’s
annotations in his publication of Pigafetta’s relation in Part V,
volume iii, of the Raccolta di documenti e studi, published by the
Royal Columbian Commission of the fourth centenary of the discovery of
America under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction (Roma,
1894); Navarrete’s Col. de viages, iv (Madrid, 1837); various
publications of the Hakluyt Society; and F. H. H. Guillemard’s Life
of Ferdinand Magellan (New York, 1891). The publication of the original
Italian and the English, page for page, renders it necessary to place
the annotations at the end of the volume instead of in footnote as
hitherto. The various charts of the Italian manuscript are all
presented in facsimile in the course of the work. In order that the
various peculiarities of the manuscript might be preserved, it has been
necessary to specially design and cast certain characters that appear
in Pigafetta’s narrative. None of these characters have been
reproduced by Mosto, who also writes out all abbreviations. Throughout
we have aimed to present the document as it exists in the Biblioteca
Ambrosiana (even to the spacing of words) with the exception that
paragraphs in the manuscript begin with a hanging indention and usually
end with a series of dots and dashes. A brief synopsis of the relation
follows.

After a brief dedication to the grand master of the Hospitaler knights
of Rhodes or Malta, as they were called later, and of which order he is
a member, Pigafetta relates that, being at Barcelona in 1519 with the
papal legate, he first hears of the expedition about to set out under
Magalhães. Being desirous of seeing the world, he gains permission to
accompany the expedition, and soon joins the fleet at Seville, whence
it is to depart. Magalhães, as a wise commander, issues his
instructions to the various commanders of the vessels ere port is left,
so that they may keep together in the unknown seas before them, and
that they may act in harmony.

Setting sail from Seville on August 10, 1519, the fleet of five small
vessels starts on its long journey amid salvos of artillery. At the
mouth of the Guadalquivir, San Lucar de Barrameda, they anchor until
September 20, when setting sail once more, they make for the Canaries,
which are reached September 26. There they reprovision and taking their
departure on October 3, coast southward along Africa amid alternating
calms and violent storms (cheered however by the welcome apparition of
St. Elmo’s fire, which promises them safety), until they cross the
line. Thereupon taking a general westerly course, the cape of St.
Augustine on the Brazilian coast is soon sighted. The fresh provisions,
so essential to sea voyages, are procured on the coast of Brazil, where
occurs the first communication with the natives, with whom wonderful
bargains are made. Those Indians, cannibals though they be, and whom
Pigafetta describes briefly (not failing to inscribe some of their
language) receive the mariners hospitably, and thinking that the latter
are come to remain among them, build them a house. But after a stay of
eighteen days, the sails are again trimmed toward the south, and
descending the coast, Magalhães anchors next at the Rio de la Plata
which had formerly proved so disastrous to Juan de Solis and his men.
Unable here to hold converse with the anthropophagous natives, who flee
at their approach, the fleet retakes its course, anchoring at two
islands where many sea-wolves and penguins are taken, and thus fresh
food obtained. The next anchorage is at the famous Bay of St. Julian
along the desolate Patagonian coast, where for five months they winter.
For two months not an individual is seen, but one day they gain their
first sight of the Patagonians, whose huge bulk strikes all with
surprise, and who are held as giants. Amicable relations are entered
into with various of these wandering Indians, and finally Magalhães,
with the taste for the wonderful that characterized his period, as
strongly, or more strongly than our own, determines to capture two of
them to take back to Spain as novelties. His ruse is successful, but an
attempt to induce the wife of one of the Indians to go to the ship
fails. Very interesting are these giants to the curious Pigafetta, and
to him is due the earliest description of their manners and customs and
the earliest specimens of their language. The two captured giants are
placed in separate vessels, but unfortunately both die ere reaching the
end of the journey, one in the deserting ship “San Antonio,” and
the other in Magalhães’s own ship, the “Trinidad.”

During the five months at that port “many things happened there.”
Shortly after entering the port, the most critical moment of all
Magalhães’s life comes, and one which he has perhaps, dreaded from
the beginning of the expedition. This is the mutiny headed by Juan de
Cartagena, captain of one of the vessels, and other malcontents, who
hate Magalhães because he is a Portuguese. The latter, however, proves
equal to the emergency, and by his prompt action and the punishments
tempered by mercy that he inflicts, quiets the trouble. João Serrão,
captain of the “Santiago” is sent to explore the coast, but is
shipwrecked, although all the crew are saved. Their rescue (not well
told by Pigafetta) is a thrilling and arduous matter, and calls into
play the endurance of men already tried by misfortune and buffetings
with Nature.

With the fleet reduced to four vessels, the mariners leave port St.
Julian and proceeding along the coast, anchor at the river of Sardines,
where stormy weather threatens a disastrous end to the expedition. A
stay of two months is made, during which the ships are enabled to lay
in a good supply of provisions, wood, and water. Before leaving that
river, the crews (for Magalhães looks after the spiritual welfare of
his men) confess and take communion. Then resuming the voyage, the
great object of the first half of the expedition is attained, namely,
the discovery of the strait, which occurs October 21, 1520. “That
strait is one hundred and ten leguas ... long, and it is one-half legua
broad, more or less.” Its discovery is due to the indomitable energy
and endurance of Magalhães, and his certain knowledge (probably
overstated by Pigafetta) of its existence. Continuing, Pigafetta
briefly narrates the passage through the strait, and the desertion of
the “San Antonio,” which returns to Spain, after putting the
captain, Alvaro de Mesquita, a relative of Magalhães, in irons; for
the pilot, a Portuguese named Esteban Gomez, is jealous of Magalhães,
as the latter’s expedition has destroyed ambitious plans of his own.
The other three ships, leaving letters and signals in the strait, in
case the “San Antonio” tries to regain them, proceeds on its way,
debouching from the strait November 28. Then begins a long voyage over
the trackless Pacific “in truth ... very pacific;” and the three
ships sail on steadily for three and two-thirds months without being
able to reprovision. To the horrors of famine are added the sufferings
of the dread scurvy. Pigafetta, whose curiosity is always alert and
active, and who remains well, diverts himself with talking to the
Patagonian, who is finally baptized, but who is one of those to die. In
the vast stretch from the strait to the Ladrones (first seen by them of
all Europeans), only two islands, both desert, are sighted, and those,
since they are unable to find anchorage there, are called the
“Unfortunate Isles.” Pigafetta mentions the southern constellation
Crux and the star clouds since called after Magalhães. His
geographical information, as one might expect, is not always accurate,
for he places Cipangu (Japan) in the open Pacific. Thoughts of relief
that come upon sighting various islands (which they called the Ladrones
because of the thievishness of the inhabitants) are quickly dissipated
by the hostility there encountered. So bold are these natives (whose
appearance, life, and customs, Pigafetta describes briefly), that they
even steal the ship’s boat from the stern of the “Trinidad,” thus
necessitating a raid into one of the islands, where some of the natives
are killed, and some houses burned, but the boat recovered.

On March 16, 1521, the first of the Philippines (by them called the
archipelago of San Lazaro) to be seen by Europeans, is sighted. Anchor
is cast at a small desert island called Humunu, (but which the mariners
call “The watering-place of good signs” because the first traces of
gold are found there), near Samar, where two tents are quickly set up
for the sick, whom Magalhães himself tends with solicitude. March 18,
they gain their first acquaintance with the natives, who prove
hospitable, and promise fresh provisions. These are brought on the
twenty-second of March, and the Europeans have their first sight of a
tattooed Visayan chief, who, as well as his men, is decked out in gold
ornaments. After a week’s stay, the ships again set sail, Pigafetta
almost coming to an untimely end by slipping over the side of the
vessel while fishing, but happily saved by the aid of “that fount of
mercy,” the Virgin.

March 28, anchor is cast at the island of Limasaua (Mazava), where
Enrique, the Malaccan slave of Magalhães, serves as interpreter.
Amicable relations are speedily entered into and confirmed by the
Malayan rite of blood brotherhood. The king of Limasaua, and his
brother, the king of certain districts in Mindanao, prove most helpful,
and are completely won over by a judicious presentation of gifts.
Greatly are the natives impressed by the power of the new comers, as
seen in the artillery and armor, and their astonishment is increased
when Magalhães relates his course to their islands and the discovery
of the strait.

On Good Friday, Pigafetta and a companion visit the natives ashore,
where they spend the night in the king’s palace, a typical Visayan
house raised aloft on supports and thatched with nipa. Here the various
ceremonies that he witnesses impress Pigafetta, and his companion, cast
in coarser mould than he, becomes intoxicated. Pigafetta, always
interested in the language of the new peoples whom he meets, writes
down certain of their words, whereat they are greatly astonished. He
records that he “ate meat on Holy Friday, for I could not help
myself.” On Easter Sunday, the natives are deeply impressed by the
mass that is celebrated ashore, and the cross which is planted in the
highest part of the island, and which they promise to adore.

The limited amount of food in Limasaua, which is used only as a place
of recreation by the two kings, who go there to visit one another and
hunt, leads Magalhães to seek a more abundant harbor. Among the places
pointed out where food is abundant is the island of Cebú, and there
Magalhães determines to go, “for so did his unhappy fate will.”
After a seven days’ stay at Limasaua, the course is laid to Cebú
under the pilotage of the king of Limasaua, who is finally taken aboard
the “Trinidad” as his vessel is unable to keep up with the
swifter-moving European vessels. Entering the port of Cebú on April 7,
amid the thunder of their guns, the settlement is thrown into
consternation, but the Malaccan being sent ashore reassures them of his
master’s good intentions, whom he proclaims to be a “captain of the
greatest king and prince in the world,” who “was going to discover
Malucho,” but hearing of the great fame of the king of Cebú, wishes
trade with him. The king of Cebú is willing to accord friendship to
the Europeans, but asks a tribute, as it is the custom for all visitors
to pay it to him. But no tribute will be paid him, asserts Enrique, and
the king, at the advice of a Moro merchant who has heard of the deeds
of the Portuguese along Malacca and the Indian coast, and confuses the
strangers with them, until undeceived by Enrique (who declares them to
be much greater than the Portuguese), expresses his willingness to make
friendship with Magalhães. With the help of the friendly king of
Limasaua, peace is made according to Malay rites, and gifts exchanged.
Magalhães, deeply religious, in common with many of his age, early
seeks to lure the natives of Cebú to holy baptism, by presenting to
them its most attractive side, and promising the king if he becomes a
Christian, a suit of armor; but they must become willing converts, and
not for the hope of gain or for fear. The peace is more firmly cemented
by the visit of Pigafetta and a companion to the king, where they
witness ceremonies similar to those of Limasaua, and where gifts are
bestowed upon the king and some others. They also visit the house of
the prince apparent, where they hear their first concert of Visayan
music and see a native dance. On the following Wednesday two of the
crew are buried ashore on consecrated ground with as much pomp as
possible.

Trading is instituted by carrying a quantity of merchandise ashore, the
safety of which is assured by the king. Those people are found to have
weights and measures for their trading; and besides their gongs, a
flute-like instrument. Their houses are entered by ladders. On Friday
begins the trading, gold being given for metals and large articles, and
food for the smaller wares. The good bargains obtained by the
Europeans, would have been materially less and the trade spoiled
forever had it not been for Magalhães’s watchfulness, for so eager
are the men at the sight of the gold, that they would have given almost
anything for it. On the following Sunday, the king and his chief men,
and the queen and many women, are baptized and given European names,
and ere the week closes all the Cebuans have become Christians, as well
as some from neighboring islands. The queen at her earnest request, is
given a small image of the Christ child, the same afterward recovered
by Legazpi, and still held in the greatest of reverence at Cebú. The
opposition of certain chiefs to the king of Cebú is satisfactorily
ended by the inducements and threats of Magalhães. The latter swears
to be faithful in his friendship with the natives, who likewise swear
allegiance to the king of Spain. However, the natives are loath to
destroy their idols, according to their promise, and Magalhães finds
them still sacrificing to them for the cure of sickness. Substituting
therefore the assurance that the new faith will work a cure, in lieu of
which he offers his head, the sick man (who is the prince’s brother
and the bravest and wisest man in the island) is miraculously cured.
Thereupon many idols are burned amid great demonstrations. Vivid
descriptions are given of the people and their customs and ceremonies,
especially those of sacrifice and mourning.

April 20, a chief from the neighboring island of Mactan sends a small
present to Magalhães, with the request to aid him with a boat load of
men against the chief Cilapulapu, who refuses allegiance to Spain.
Magalhães in his ardor, and notwithstanding the remonstrances of his
friends, leads three boat loads of men (sixty in all) to the island,
where having ordered the king of Cebú to be a witness of the battle
only, he engages the natives. Disastrous indeed does that day prove,
for beset by multitudes of foes, the Europeans are compelled to
retreat, and the retreat becomes a rout, the personal bravery of
Magalhães and a few of his closest friends only saving the men from
almost complete massacre. Recognizing the leader, the natives make
their greatest efforts against him, and finally he is killed while knee
deep in the water, but after all the others are saved. Pigafetta’s
lament is tragic and sorrowful; they “killed our mirror, our light,
our comfort, and our true guide.” Insolent in their victory, the
natives refuse to give up the body of the slain leader at the request
of the king of Cebú. The Europeans stunned by the loss of their
leader, withdraw their merchandise and guards to the ship, and make
preparations for departure. Duarte Barbosa and João de Serrão are
chosen leaders. The second act in the drama follows speedily. The slave
Enrique, enraged at a severe reprimand and threats by Barbosa,
conspires with the king of Cebú; with the result that twenty-six men,
including both of the leaders, are murdered at a banquet on May 1, to
which the king invites them. João Carvalho, deaf to the entreaties of
João Serrão, his comrade, and anxious to become leader, sails away
leaving him to his death. Pigafetta names the products of Cebú, and
gives a valuable vocabulary of Visayan words, most of which are still
in use by those people.

By mutual consent, the three vessels proceed to Bohol, where the
“Concepcion” is burned, as there are too few men left to work all
three ships; although its supplies and all else possible are
transferred to the “Victoria” and “Trinidad.” Then, cruising
along, they put in at Mindanao where Pigafetta goes ashore alone, after
the king has made blood friendship at the ships. There they hear of
Luzón, where the Chinese trade annually. Departing from Mindanao, they
anchor at Cagayan Sulu, a penal settlement for Borneo, where the
blowpipe and poisoned arrows are used, and the daggers adorned with
gold. The next anchorage is at Paragua, although before reaching that
island, the men have been tempted to abandon the ships because of
hunger. There the rice is cooked under the fire in bamboos and is
better than that cooked in earthen pots. Those people raise fighting
cocks and bet on their favorite birds. Ten leagues from Paragua is the
great island of Borneo, whither the ships next go, and anchor at the
city of Brunei, which is built over the water, and contains twenty-five
thousand fires. Hospitably received by eight chiefs who visit the
ships, they enter into relations with the Borneans. Seven men go as
ambassadors to visit the king, and bear presents to him and the chief
men. Here some of the grandeurs of an oriental court are spread before
their eyes, which Pigafetta briefly describes. The strangers are
graciously given permission to take on fresh supplies of food, water,
and wood, and to trade at pleasure. Later actions of the Borneans cause
the men of the ships to fear treachery, and forestalling any action by
that people, they attack a number of junks near them, and capture four.
Among the captives is the son of the king of Luzón, who is the chief
captain in Borneo, and whom Carvalho allows to escape, without
consulting the others, for a large sum of gold. His action in so doing
reacts on himself, for the king refuses to allow two men who were
ashore and Carvalho’s own son (born of a native woman in Brazil) to
return to the ships, and they are left behind. The Borneans and their
junks are described. They use porcelain dishes which are made from a
fine white clay that is buried under ground for fifty years in order to
refine it, and inherited from father to son. Camphor is obtained there,
and the island is so large that it can be circumnavigated by a prau
only in three months’ time.

On leaving Borneo, a number of prisoners from the captured junks are
kept, among them three women whom Carvalho ostensibly retains as
presents for the queen of Spain, but in reality for himself. Happily
escaping from the point on which one of the ships has become grounded,
and the fear of explosion from a candle which is snuffed into a barrel
of powder, the ships anchor at a point of Borneo, where for forty-two
days, the men are busied in repairing, calking, and furnishing the
vessels. The journey is resumed back toward Paragua, the governor of a
district of that island being captured on the way; with whom, however,
they enter into friendly relations. Thence the ships cruise along
between Cagayan, Joló, and Mindanao, capturing a native boat from
Maingdanao of the latter island, from the captive occupants of which
they learn news of the Moluccas. Pushing on amid stormy weather, they
anchor at the island of Sarangani, just south of Mindanao; and thence
proceed in a generally southerly direction amid many islands until the
Moluccas are reached, and they enter the harbor of Tidore on Friday,
November 8, 1521, after twenty-seven months, less two days, since their
departure from Spain.

At Tidore a warm welcome awaits them from the king, who is a powerful
astrologer and has been expecting their arrival. He promises them as
many cloves as they wish, even offering to go outside his island,
contrary to the practice of kings, to provide them the sooner; in
return for his services hoping for their aid in his designs for power
in the Moluccas, especially against the king of Ternate. There they
learn that Francisco Serrão, the great friend of Magalhães, has
perished some eight months previously from poison administered by the
king of Tidore, whom he had visited, because he had aided the king of
Ternate against Tidore. This Serrão, says Pigafetta, was the cause of
Magalhães undertaking his expedition, and he had been in the Moluccas
for ten years, for so long ago had Portugal discovered those islands.
The efforts of the Ternatans to gain the new strangers fail, for they
are already pledged to the king of Tidore. On November 12, a house is
built ashore and on the thirteenth the merchandise is carried there,
among it being that captured with the various junks at and near Borneo.
The sailors are somewhat careless of their bargains for they are in
haste to return to Spain. The king continues his kindness, and to humor
him, as he is a Mahometan, all the swine in the boats are killed. This
relation will be concluded in Vol. XXXIV.

[FIRST VOYAGE AROUND THE WORLD]


Antonio Pigafeta, [1] patrician of Venezia and knight of Rhodi [i.e.,
Rhodes], [2] to the most illustrious and excellent Lord, Philipo de
Villers Lisleadam, [3] renowned grand master of Rhoddi, his most
honored lord. [4]

Inasmuch as, most illustrious and excellent Lord, there are many
curious persons who not only take pleasure in knowing and hearing the
great and wonderful things which God has permitted me to see and suffer
during my long and dangerous voyage, hereto appended, but who also wish
to know the means and manners and paths that I have taken in making
that voyage [literally: “in going thither”]; and who do not lend
that entire faith to the end unless they have a perfect assurance of
the beginning: therefore, your most illustrious Lordship must know
that, finding myself, in the year of the nativity of our Savior
MCCCCCXIX in Spagnia, in the court of the most serene king of the
Romans, [5] with the reverend Monsignor, Francesco Chieregato, then
apostolic protonotary and nuncio of Pope Leo X of holy memory (and who
has since become bishop of Aprutino and prince of Teramo), [6] and
having learned many things from many books that I had read, as well as
from various persons, [7] who discussed the great and marvelous things
of the Ocean Sea with his Lordship, I determined, by the good favor of
his Cæsarean Majesty, and of his Lordship abovesaid, to experience and
to go to see those things for myself, so that I might be able thereby
to satisfy myself somewhat, and so that I might be able to gain some
renown for later posterity. [8] Having heard that a fleet composed of
five vessels had been fitted out in the city of Siviglia for the
purpose of going to discover the spicery in the islands of Maluco,
under command of Captain-general Fernando de Magaglianes, [9] a
Portuguese gentleman, comendador of the [Order of] Santo Jacobo de la
Spada [i.e., “St. James of the Sword”], [10] [who] had many times
traversed the Ocean Sea in various directions, whence he had acquired
great praise, I set out from the city of Barsalonna, where his Majesty
was then residing, bearing many letters in my favor. I went by ship as
far as Malega, where, taking the highroad, I went overland to Siviglia.
Having been there about three full months, waiting for the said fleet
to be set in order for the departure, [11] finally, as your most
excellent Lordship will learn below, we commenced our voyage under most
happy auspices. And inasmuch as when I was in Ytalia and going to see
his Holiness, Pope Clement, [12] you by your grace showed yourself very
kind and good to me at Monteroso, and told me that you would be greatly
pleased if I would write down for you all those things which I had seen
and suffered during my voyage; and although I have had little
opportunity, yet I have tried to satisfy your desire according to my
poor ability; therefore, I offer you, in this little book of mine, all
my vigils, hardships, and wanderings, begging you, although you are
busied with continual Rhodian cares, to deign to skim through it, by
which I shall be enabled to receive a not slight remuneration from your
most illustrious Lordship, to whose good favor I consign and commend
myself. [13]

The captain-general having resolved to make so long a voyage through
the Ocean Sea, where furious winds and great storms are always
reigning, but not desiring to make known to any of his men the voyage
that he was about to make, so that they might not be cast down at the
thought of doing so great and extraordinary a deed, as he did
accomplish with the aid of God (the captains who accompanied him, hated
him exceedingly, I know not why, unless because he was a Portuguese,
and they Spaniards), with the desire to conclude what he promised under
oath to the emperor, Don Carlo, king of Spagnia, prescribed the
following orders and gave them to all the pilots and masters of his
ships, so that the ships might not become separated from one another
during the storms and night. [14] These were [to the effect] that he
would always precede the other ships at night, and they were to follow
his ship which would have a large torch of wood, which they call farol.
[15] He always carried that farol set at the poop of his ship as a
signal so that they might always follow him. Another light was made by
means of a lantern or by means of a piece of wicking made from a rush
and called sparto rope [16] which is well beaten in the water, and then
dried in the sun or in the smoke—a most excellent material for such
use. They were to answer him so that he might know by that signal
whether all of the ships were coming together. If he showed two lights
besides that of the farol, they were to veer or take another tack,
[doing this] when the wind was not favorable or suitable for us to
continue on our way, or when he wished to sail slowly. If he showed
three lights, they were to lower away the bonnet-sail, which is a part
of the sail that is fastened below the mainsail, when the weather is
suitable for making better time. It is lowered so that it may be easier
to furl the mainsail when it is struck hastily during a sudden squall.
[17] If he showed four lights, they were to strike all the sails; [18]
after which he showed a signal by one light, [which meant] that he was
standing still. If he showed a greater number of lights, or fired a
mortar, it was a signal of land or of shoals. [19] Then he showed four
lights when he wished to have the sails set full, so that they might
always sail in his wake by the torch on the poop. When he desired to
set the bonnet-sail, he showed three lights. [20] When he desired to
alter his course, he showed two; [21] and then if he wished to
ascertain whether all the ships were following and whether they were
coming together, he showed one light, so that each one of the ships
might do the same and reply to him. Three watches were set nightly: the
first at the beginning of the night; the second, which is called the
midnight, [22] and the third at the end [of the night]. All of the men
in the ships were divided into three parts: the first was the division
of the captain or boatswain, those two alternating nightly; the second,
of either the pilot or boatswain’s mate; and the third, of the
master. [23] Thus did the captain-general order that all the ships
observe the above signals and watches, so that their voyage might be
more propitious. [24]

On Monday morning, August x, St. Lawrence’s day, in the year
abovesaid, the fleet, having been supplied with all the things
necessary for the sea, [25] (and counting those of every nationality,
we were two hundred and thirty-seven men), made ready to leave the
harbor of Siviglia. [26] Discharging many pieces of artillery, the
ships held their forestaysails to the wind, and descended the river
Betis, at present called Gadalcavir, passing by a village called Gioan
dal Farax, once a large Moorish settlement. In the midst of it was once
a bridge that crossed the said river, and led to Siviglia. Two columns
of that bridge have remained even to this day at the bottom of the
water, and when ships sail by there, they need men who know the
location of the columns thoroughly, so that the ships may not strike
against them. They must also be passed when the river is highest with
the tide; as must also many other villages along the river, which has
not sufficient depth [of itself] for ships that are laden and which are
not very large to pass. Then the ships reached another village called
Coria, and passed by many other villages along the river, until they
came to a castle of the duke of Medina Cidonia, called San Lucar, which
is a port by which to enter the Ocean Sea. [27] It is in an east and
west direction with the cape of Sanct Vincent, which lies in 37 degrees
of latitude, and x leguas from the said port. [28] From Siviglia to
this point [i.e., San Lucar], it is 17 or 20 leguas by river. [29] Some
days after, the captain-general, with his other captains, descended the
river in the small boats belonging to their ships. We remained there
for a considerable number of days in order to finish [30] [providing]
the fleet with some things that it needed. Every day we went ashore to
hear mass in a village called Nostra Dona de Baremeda [our Lady of
Barrameda], near San Lucar. Before the departure, the captain-general
wished all the men to confess, and would not allow any [31] woman to
sail in the fleet for the best of considerations.

We left that village, by name San Luchar, on Tuesday, September xx of
the same year, and took a southwest course. [32] On the 26th [33] of
the said month, we reached an island of the Great Canaria, called
Teneriphe, which lies in a latitude of 28 degrees, [landing there] in
order to get flesh, water, and wood. [34] We stayed there for three and
one-half days in order to furnish the fleet with the said supplies.
Then we went to a port of the same island called Monte Rosso [35] to
get pitch, [36] staying [there] two days. Your most illustrious
Lordship must know that there is a particular one of the islands of the
Great Canaria, where one can not find a single drop of water which
gushes up [from a spring]; [37] but that at noontide a cloud descends
from the sky and encircles a large tree which grows in the said island,
the leaves and branches of which distil a quantity of water. At the
foot of the said tree runs a trench which resembles a spring, where all
the water falls, and from which the people living there, and the
animals, both domestic and wild, fully satisfy themselves daily with
this water and no other. [38]

At midnight of Monday, October three, the sails were trimmed toward the
south, [39] and we took to the open Ocean Sea, passing between Cape
Verde and its islands in 14 and one-half degrees. Thus for many days
did we sail along the coast of Ghinea, or Ethiopia, where there is a
mountain called Siera Leona, which lies in 8 degrees of latitude, with
contrary winds, calms, and rains without wind, until we reached the
equinoctial line, having sixty days of continual rain. [40] Contrary to
the opinion of the ancients, [41] before we reached the line many
furious squalls of wind, and currents of water struck us head on in 14
degrees. As we could not advance, and in order that the ships might not
be wrecked, [42] all the sails were struck; and in this manner did we
wander hither and yon on the sea, waiting for the tempest to cease, for
it was very furious. [43] When it rained there was no wind. When the
sun shone, it was calm. Certain large fishes called tiburoni [i.e.,
sharks] came to the side of the ships. They have terrible teeth, and
whenever they find men in the sea they devour them. We caught many of
them with iron hooks, [44] although they are not good to eat unless
they are small, and even then they are not very good. During those
storms the holy body, that is to say St. Elmo, appeared to us many
times, in light—among other times on an exceedingly dark night, [45]
with the brightness of a blazing torch, on the maintop, where he stayed
for about two hours or more, to our consolation, for we were weeping.
When that blessed light was about to leave us, so dazzling was the
brightness that it cast into our eyes, that we all remained for more
than an eighth of an hour [46] blinded and calling for mercy. And truly
when we thought that we were dead men, the sea suddenly grew calm. [47]

I saw many kinds of birds, among them one that had no anus; and
another, [which] when the female wishes to lay its eggs, it does so on
the back of the male and there they are hatched. The latter bird has no
feet, and always lives in the sea. [There is] another kind which live
on the ordure of the other birds, and in no other manner; for I often
saw this bird, which is called Cagassela, fly behind the other birds,
until they are constrained to drop their ordure, which the former
seizes immediately and abandons the latter bird. I also saw many flying
fish, and many others collected together, so that they resembled an
island. [48]

After we had passed the equinoctial line going south, we lost the north
star, and hence we sailed south south-west [49] until [we reached] a
land called the land of Verzin [50] which lies in 23½ degrees of the
Antarctic Pole [i.e., south latitude]. It is the land extending from
the cape of Santo Augustino, which lies in 8 degrees of the same pole.
There we got a plentiful refreshment of fowls, potatoes [batate], many
sweet pine-apples—in truth the most delicious fruit that can be
found—the flesh of the anta, [51] which resembles beef, sugarcane,
and innumerable other things, which I shall not mention in order not to
be prolix. For one fishhook or one knife, those people gave 5 or 6
chickens; for one comb, a brace of geese; for one mirror or one pair of
scissors, as many fish as would be sufficient for x men; for a bell or
one leather lace, one basketful of potatoes [batate]. These potatoes
resemble chestnuts in taste, and are as long as turnips. [52] For a
king of diamonds [danari], [53] which is a playing card, they gave me 6
[54] fowls and thought that they had even cheated me. We entered that
port on St. Lucy’s day, and on that day had the sun on the zenith;
[55] and we were subjected to greater heat on that day and on the other
days when we had the sun on the zenith, than when we were under the
equinoctial line. [56]

That land of Verzin is wealthier and larger than Spagnia, Fransa, and
Italia, [57] put together, and belongs to the king of Portugalo. The
people of that land are not Christians, and have no manner of worship.
They live according to the dictates of nature, [58] and reach an age of
one hundred and twenty-five and one hundred and forty years. [59] They
go naked, both men and women. They live in certain long houses which
they call boii [60] and sleep in cotton hammocks called amache, which
are fastened in those houses by each end to large beams. A fire is
built on the ground under those hammocks. In each one of those boii,
there are one hundred men with their wives and children, [61] and they
make a great racket. They have boats called canoes made of one single
huge tree, [62] hollowed out by the use of stone hatchets. Those people
employ stones as we do iron, as they have no iron. Thirty or forty men
occupy one of those boats. They paddle with blades like the shovels of
a furnace, and thus, black, naked, and shaven, they resemble, when
paddling, the inhabitants of the Stygian marsh. [63] Men and women are
as well proportioned as we. They eat the human flesh of their enemies,
not because it is good, but because it is a certain established custom.
That custom, which is mutual, was begun by an old woman, [64] who had
but one son who was killed by his enemies. In return some days later,
that old woman’s friends captured one of the company who had killed
her son, and brought him to the place of her abode. She seeing him, and
remembering her son, ran upon him like an infuriated bitch, and bit him
on one shoulder. Shortly afterward he escaped to his own people, whom
he told that they had tried to eat him, showing them [in proof] the
marks on his shoulder. Whomever the latter captured afterward at any
time from the former they ate, and the former did the same to the
latter, so that such a custom has sprung up in this way. They do not
eat the bodies all at once, but every one cuts off a piece, and carries
it to his house, where he smokes it. Then every week, [65] he cuts off
a small bit, which he eats thus smoked with his other food to remind
him of his enemies. The above was told me by the pilot, Johane
Carnagio, [66] who came with us, and who had lived in that land for
four years. Those people paint the whole body and the face in a
wonderful manner with fire in various fashions, as do the women also.
The men are [are: doublet in original manuscript] smooth shaven and
have no beard, for they pull it out. They clothe themselves in a dress
made of parrot feathers, with large round arrangements at their
buttocks made from the largest feathers, and it is a ridiculous sight.
Almost all the people, except the women and children, [67] have three
holes pierced in the lower lip, where they carry round stones, one
finger or thereabouts in length and hanging down outside. Those people
are not entirely black, but of a dark brown color. They keep the
privies uncovered, and the body is without hair, [68] while both men
and women always go naked. Their king is called cacich [i.e., cacique].
They have an infinite number of parrots, and gave us 8 or 10 for one
mirror: and little monkeys that look like lions, only [they are]
yellow, and very beautiful. [69] They make round white [loaves of]
bread from the marrowy substance of trees, which is not very good, and
is found between the wood and the bark and resembles buttermilk curds.
[70] They have swine which have their navels [lombelico] on their
backs, [71] and large birds with beaks like spoons and no tongues. [72]
The men gave us one or two of their young daughters as slaves for one
hatchet or one large knife, but they would not give us their wives in
exchange for anything at all. The women will not shame their husbands
under any considerations whatever, and as was told us, refuse to
consent to their husbands by day, but only by night. [73] The women
cultivate the fields, and carry all their food from the mountains in
panniers or baskets on the head or fastened to the head. [74] But they
are always accompanied by their husbands, who are armed only with a bow
of brazil-wood or of black palm-wood, and a bundle of cane arrows,
doing this because they are jealous [of their wives]. The women carry
their children hanging in a cotton net from their necks. I omit other
particulars, in order not to be tedious. Mass was said twice on shore,
during which those people remained on their knees with so great
contrition and with clasped hands raised aloft, that it was an
exceeding great pleasure [75] to behold them. They built us a house as
they thought that we were going to stay with them for some time, and at
our departure they cut a great quantity of brazil-wood [verzin] to give
us. [76] It had been about two months since it had rained in that land,
and when we reached that port, it happened to rain, whereupon they said
that we came from the sky and that we had brought the rain with us.
[77] Those people could be converted easily to the faith of Jesus
Christ.

At first those people thought that the small boats were the children of
the ships, and that the latter gave birth to them when they were
lowered into the sea from the ships, and when they were lying so
alongside the ships (as is the custom), they believed that the ships
were nursing them. [78] One day a beautiful young woman came to the
flagship, where I was, for no other purpose than to seek what chance
might offer. While there and waiting, she cast her eyes upon the
master’s room, and saw a nail longer than one’s finger. Picking it
up very delightedly and neatly, she thrust it through the lips of her
vagina [natura], and bending down low immediately departed, the
captain-general and I having seen that action. [79]

Some words of those people of Verzin [80]


             For Millet     maiz
             for Flour      hui
             for Fishhook   pinda
             for Knife      tacse
             for Comb       chigap

             for Bell       itanmaraca
             Good, better   tum maragathum


We remained in that land for 13 days. Then proceeding, on our way, we
went as far as 34 and one-third degrees [81] toward the Antarctic Pole,
where we found people at a freshwater river, called Canibali [i.e.,
cannibals], who eat human flesh. One of them, in stature almost a
giant, came to the flagship in order to assure [the safety of] the
others his friends. [82] He had a voice like a bull. While he was in
the ship, the others carried away their possessions from the place
where they were living into the interior, for fear of us. Seeing that,
we landed one hundred men in order to have speech and converse with
them, or to capture one of them by force. They fled, and in fleeing
they took so large a step that we although running could not gain on
their steps. There are seven islands in that river, in the largest of
which precious gems are found. That place is called the cape of Santa
Maria, and it was formerly thought that one passed thence to the sea of
Sur, that is to say the South Sea, but nothing further was ever
discovered. Now the name is not [given to] a cape, but [to] a river,
with a mouth 17 leguas in width. [83] A Spanish captain, called Johan
de Solis and sixty men, who were going to discover lands like us, were
formerly eaten at that river by those cannibals because of too great
confidence. [84]

Then proceeding on the same course toward the Antarctic Pole, coasting
along the land, we came to anchor at two islands full of geese and
sea-wolves. [85] Truly, the great number of those geese cannot be
reckoned; in one hour we loaded the five ships [with them]. Those geese
are black and have all their feathers alike both on body and wings.
They do not fly, and live on fish. They were so fat that it was not
necessary to pluck them but to skin them. Their beak is like that of a
crow. Those sea-wolves are of various colors, and as large as a calf,
with a head like that of a calf, ears small and round, and large teeth.
They have no legs but only feet with small nails attached to the body,
which resemble our hands, and between their fingers the same kind of
skin as the geese. They would be very fierce if they could run. They
swim, and live on fish. At that place the ships suffered a very great
storm, during which the three holy bodies appeared to us many times,
that is to say, St. Elmo, St. Nicholas, and St. Clara, whereupon the
storm quickly ceased.

Leaving that place, we finally reached 49 and one-half degrees toward
the Antarctic Pole. As it was winter, the ships entered a safe port to
winter. [86] We passed two months in that place without seeing anyone.
One day we suddenly saw a naked man of giant stature on the shore of
the port, dancing, [87] singing, and throwing dust on his head. The
captain-general sent one of our men to the giant so that he might
perform the same, actions as a sign of peace. Having done that, the man
led the giant to an islet into the presence of the captain-general.
When the giant was in the captain-general’s and our presence, he
marveled greatly, [88] and made signs with one finger raised upward,
believing that we had come from the sky. He was so tall that we reached
only to his waist, and he was well proportioned. His face was large and
painted red all over while about his eyes he was painted yellow; and he
had two hearts painted on the middle of his cheeks. His scanty hair was
painted white. [89] He was dressed in the skins of animals skilfully
sewn together. That animal has a head and ears as large as those of a
mule, a neck and body like those of a camel, the legs of a deer, and
the tail of a horse, like which it neighs, and that land has very many
of them. [90] His feet were shod with the same kind of skins which
covered his feet in the manner of shoes. [91] In his hand he carried a
short, heavy bow, with a cord somewhat thicker than those of the lute,
[92] and made from the intestines of the same animal, and a bundle of
rather short cane arrows feathered like ours, and with points of white
and black flint stones in the manner of Turkish arrows, instead of
iron. Those points were fashioned by means of another stone. [93] The
captain-general had the giant given something to eat and drink, and
among other things which were shown to him was a large steel mirror.
When he saw his face, he was greatly terrified, and jumped back
throwing three or four [94] of our men to the ground. After that he was
given some bells, a mirror, a comb, and certain Pater Nosters. The
captain-general sent him ashore with 4 armed men. When one of his
companions, who would never come to the ships, saw him coming with our
men, he ran to the place where the others were, who came [down to the
shore] all naked one after the other. When our men reached them, they
began to dance and to sing, lifting one finger to the sky. They showed
our men some white powder made from the roots of an herb, which they
kept in earthen pots, and which they ate because they had nothing else.
Our men made signs inviting them to the ships, and that they would help
them carry their possessions. Thereupon, those men quickly took only
their bows, while their women laden like asses carried everything. The
latter are not so tall as the men but are very much fatter. When we saw
them we were greatly surprised. Their breasts are one-half braza long,
and they are painted and clothed like their husbands, except that
before their privies [natura] they have a small skin which covers them.
They led four of those young animals, fastened with thongs like a
halter. When those people wish to catch some of those animals, they tie
one of these young ones to a thornbush. Thereupon, the large ones come
to play with the little ones; and those people kill them with their
arrows from their place of concealment. Our men led eighteen of those
people, counting men and women, to the ships, and they were distributed
on the two sides of the port so that they might catch some of the said
animals.

Six days after the above, a giant painted [95] and clothed in the same
manner was seen by some [of our men] who were cutting wood. He had a
bow and arrows in his hand. When our men approached him, he first
touched his head, face, [96] and body, and then did the same to our
men, afterward lifting his hands toward the sky. When the
captain-general was informed of it, he ordered him to be brought in the
small boat. He was taken to that island in the port where our men had
built a house for the smiths [97] and for the storage of some things
from the ships. That man was even taller and better built than the
others and as tractable and amiable. Jumping up and down, he danced,
and when he danced, at every leap, his feet sank a palmo into the
earth. He remained with us for a considerable number of days, so long
that we baptized him, calling him Johanni. He uttered [the words]
“Jesu,” “Pater Noster,” “Ave Maria” and “Jovani” [i.e.,
John97 as distinctly as we, but with an exceedingly loud voice. Then
the captain-general gave him a shirt, a woolen jerkin [camisota de
panno], cloth breeches, a cap, a mirror, a comb, bells, and other
things, and sent him away like his companions. He left us very joyous
and happy. The following day he brought one of those large animals to
the captain-general, in return for which many things were given to him,
so that he might bring some more to us; but we did not see him again.
We thought that his companions had killed him because he had conversed
with us.

A fortnight later we saw four of those giants without their arms for
they had hidden them in certain bushes as the two whom we captured
showed us. Each one was painted differently. The captain-general kept
two of them—the youngest and best proportioned—by means of a very
cunning trick, in order to take them to Spagnia. [98] Had he used any
other means [than those he employed], they could easily have killed
some of us. [99] The trick that he employed in keeping them was as
follows. He gave them many knives, scissors, mirrors, bells, and glass
beads; and those two having their hands filled with the said articles,
the captain-general had two pairs of iron manacles brought, such as are
fastened on the feet. [100] He made motions that he would give them to
the giants, whereat they were very pleased since those manacles were of
iron, but they did not know how to carry them. They were grieved at
leaving them behind, but they had no place to put those gifts; for they
had to hold the skin wrapped about them with their hands. [101] The
other two giants wished to help them, but the captain refused. Seeing
that they were loth to leave those manacles behind, the captain made
them a sign that he would put them on their feet, and that they could
carry them away. They nodded assent with the head. Immediately, the
captain had the manacles put on both of them at the same time. When our
men were driving home the cross bolt, the giants began to suspect
something, but the captain assuring them, however, they stood still.
When they saw later that they were tricked, they raged like bulls,
calling loudly for Setebos [102] to aid them. With difficulty could we
bind the hands of the other two, whom we sent ashore with nine of our
men, in order that the giants might guide them to the place where the
wife of one of the two whom we had captured [103] was; for the latter
expressed his great grief at leaving her by signs so that we understood
[that he meant] her. While they were on their way, one of the giants
freed his hands, and took to his heels with such swiftness that our men
lost sight of him. He went to the place where his associates were, but
he did not find [there] one of his companions, who had remained behind
with the women, and who had gone hunting. He immediately went in search
of the latter, and told him all that had happened. [104] The other
giant endeavored so hard to free himself from his bonds, that our men
struck him, wounding him slightly on the head, whereat he raging led
them to where the women were. Gioan Cavagio, the pilot and commander of
those men, refused to bring back the woman [105] that night, but
determined to sleep there, for night was approaching. The other two
giants came, and seeing their companion wounded, hesitated, [106] but
said nothing then. But with the dawn, they spoke [107] to the women,
[whereupon] they immediately ran away (and the smaller ones ran faster
than the taller), leaving all their possessions behind them. Two of
them turned aside to shoot their arrows at our men. The other was
leading away those small animals of theirs in order to hunt. [108] Thus
fighting, one of them pierced the thigh of one of our men with an
arrow, and the latter died immediately. When the giants saw that, they
ran away quickly. Our men had muskets and crossbows, but they could
never hit any of the giants, [for] when the latter fought, they never
stood still, but leaped hither and thither. Our men buried their dead
companion, and burned all the possessions left behind by the giants. Of
a truth those giants run swifter than horses and are exceedingly
jealous of their wives.

When those people feel sick at the stomach, instead of purging
themselves, [109] they thrust an arrow down their throat for two palmos
or more [110] and vomit [substance of a] green color mixed with blood,
for they eat a certain kind of thistle. When they have a headache, they
cut themselves across the forehead; and they do the same on the arms or
on the legs and in any part of the body, letting a quantity of blood.
One of those whom we had captured, and whom we kept in our ship, said
that the blood refused to stay there [i.e., in the place of the pain],
and consequently causes them suffering. They wear their hair cut with
the tonsure, like friars, but it is left longer; [111] and they have a
cotton cord wrapped about the head, to which they fasten their arrows
when they go hunting. They bind their privies close to their bodies
because of the exceeding great cold. [112] When one of those people
die, x or twelve demons all painted appear to them and dance very
joyfully about the corpse. They notice that one of those demons is much
taller than the others, and he cries out and rejoices more. [113] They
paint themselves exactly in the same manner as the demon appears to
them painted. They call the larger demon Setebos, [114] and the others
Cheleulle. That giant also told us by signs that he had seen the demons
with two horns on their heads, and long hair which hung to the feet
belching forth fire from mouth and buttocks. The captain-general called
those people Patagoni. [115] They all clothe themselves in the skins of
that animal above mentioned; and they have no houses except those made
from the skin of the same animal, and they wander hither and thither
with those houses just as the Cingani [116] do. They live on raw flesh
and on a sweet root which they call chapae. [117] Each of the two whom
we captured ate a basketful of biscuit, and drank one-half pailful of
water at a gulp. They also ate rats without skinning them.

In that port which we called the port of Santo Julianno, we remained
about five months. [118] Many things happened there. In order that your
most illustrious Lordship may know some of them, it happened that as
soon as we had entered the port, the captains of the other four ships
plotted treason in order that they might kill the captain-general.
Those conspirators consisted of the overseer of the fleet, one Johan de
Cartagena, the treasurer, Alouise de Mendosa, the accountant, Anthonio
Cocha, and Gaspar de Cazada. The overseer of the men having been
quartered, the treasurer was killed by dagger blows, for the treason
was discovered. Some days after that, Gaspar de Casada, was banished
with a priest in that land of Patagonia. The captain-general did not
wish to have him killed, because the emperor, Don Carlo, had appointed
him captain. [119] A ship called “Sancto Jacobo” was wrecked in an
expedition made to explore the coast. All the men were saved as by a
miracle, not even getting wet. Two of them came to the ships after
suffering great hardships, and reported the whole occurrence to us.
Consequently, the captain-general sent some men with bags full of
biscuits [sufficient to last] for two months. It was necessary for us
to carry them the food, for daily pieces of the ship [that was wrecked]
were found. The way thither was long, [being] 24 leguas, [120] or one
hundred millas, and the path was very rough and full of thorns. The men
were 4 days on the road, sleeping at night in the bushes. They found no
drinking water, but only ice, which caused them the greatest hardship.
[121] There were very many long shellfish which are called missiglioni
[122] in that port [of Santo Julianno]. They have pearls, although
small ones in the middle, but could not be eaten. Incense, ostriches,
[123] foxes, sparrows, and rabbits much smaller than ours were also
found. We erected a cross on the top of the highest summit there, as a
sign in that land that it belonged to the king of Spagnia; and we
called that summit Monte de Christo [i.e., Mount of Christ].

Leaving that place, we found, in 51 degrees less one-third [124]
degree, toward the Antarctic Pole, a river of fresh water. There the
ships almost perished because of the furious winds; but God and the
holy bodies [125] aided them. We stayed about two months in that river
in order to supply the ships with water, wood, and fish, [the latter
being] one braccio in length and more, and covered with scales. They
were very good although small. [126] Before leaving that river, the
captain-general and all of us confessed and received communion as true
Christians. [127]

Then going to fifty-two degrees toward the same pole, [128] we found a
strait on the day of the [feast of the] [129] eleven thousand virgins
[i.e. October 21], whose head is called Capo de le Undici Millia
Vergine [i.e., cape of the Eleven Thousand Virgins] because of that
very great miracle. That strait is one hundred and ten leguas or 440
millas long, and it is one-half legua broad, more or less. [130] It
leads to another sea called the Pacific Sea, and is surrounded by very
lofty mountains laden with snow. There it was impossible to find bottom
[for anchoring], but [it was necessary to fasten] the moorings [131] on
land 25 or 30 brazas away. Had it not been for the captain-general, we
would not have found that strait, for we all thought and said that it
was closed on all sides. But the captain-general who knew where to sail
to find a well-hidden strait, which he saw depicted on a map in the
treasury of the king of Portugal, which was made by that excellent man,
Martin de Boemia, sent two ships, the “Santo Anthonio” and the
“Conceptione” (for thus they were called), to discover what was
inside the cape de la Baia [i.e., of the Bay]. [132] We, with the other
two ships, [namely], the flagship, called “Trinitade,” and the
other the “Victoria,” stayed inside the bay to await them. [133] A
great storm struck us that night, which lasted until the middle of next
day, which necessitated our lifting anchor, and letting ourselves drift
hither and thither about the bay. The other two ships suffered a
headwind and could not double a cape [134] formed by the bay almost at
its end, as they were trying to return to join us; so that they thought
that they would have to run aground. But on approaching the end of the
bay, and thinking that they were lost, they saw a small opening which
did not [exceed: crossed out in original MS.] appear to be an opening,
but a sharp turn [cantone]. [135] Like desperate men they hauled into
it, and thus they discovered the strait by chance. Seeing that it was
not a sharp turn, but a strait with land, they proceeded farther, and
found a bay. [136] And then farther on they found another strait and
another bay larger than the first two. [137] Very joyful they
immediately turned back to inform the captain-general. We thought that
they had been wrecked, first, by reason of the violent storm, and
second, because two days had passed and they had not appeared, and also
because of certain [signals with] smoke made by two of their men who
had been sent ashore to advise us. [138] And so, while in suspense, we
saw the two ships with sails full and banners flying to the wind,
coming toward us. When they neared us in this manner, they suddenly
discharged a number of mortars, and burst into cheers. [139] Then all
together thanking God and the Virgin Mary, we went to seek [the strait]
farther on.

After entering that strait, we found two openings, one to the
southeast, and the other to the southwest. [140] The captain-general
sent the ship “Sancto Anthonio” together with the “Concitione”
to ascertain whether that opening which was toward the southeast had an
exit into the Pacific Sea. The ship “Sancto Anthonio” would not
await the “Conceptione,” because it intended to flee and return to
Spagnia—which it did. The pilot of that ship was one Stefan Gomes,
[141] and he hated the captain-general exceedingly, because before that
fleet was fitted out, the emperor had ordered that he be given some
caravels with which to discover lands, but his Majesty did not give
them to him because of the coming of the captain-general. On that
account he conspired with certain Spaniards, and next night they
captured the captain of their ship, a cousin [142] of the
captain-general, one Alvaro de Meschita, whom they wounded and put in
irons, and in this condition took to Spagnia. The other giant whom we
had captured was in that ship, but he died when the heat came on. The
“Conceptione,” as it could not follow that ship, waited for it,
sailing about hither and thither. The “Sancto Anthonio” turned back
at night and fled along the same [port: crossed out in original MS.]
strait. [143] We had gone to explore the other opening toward the
southwest. Finding, however, the same [port: crossed out in original
MS.] strait continuously, we came upon a river which we called the
river of Sardine [i.e., Sardines], because there were many sardines
near it. [144] So we stayed there for four days in order to await the
two ships. During that period we sent a well-equipped boat to explore
the cape of the other sea. The men returned within three days, and
reported that they had seen the cape and the open sea. The
captain-general wept for joy, and called that cape, Cape Dezeado [i.e.,
Desire], [145] for we had been desiring it for a long time. We turned
back to look for the two ships, [146] but we found only the
“Conceptione.” Upon asking them where the other one was, Johan
Seranno, [147] who was captain and pilot of the former ship (and also
of that ship that had been wrecked) replied that he did not know, and
that he had never seen it after it had entered the opening. We sought
it in all parts of the strait, as far as that opening whence it had
fled, and the captain-general sent the ship “Victoria” back to the
entrance of the strait to ascertain whether the ship was there. Orders
were given them, if they did not find it, to plant a banner on the
summit of some small hill with a letter in an earthen pot buried in the
earth near the banner, so that if the banner were seen the letter might
be found, and the ship might learn the course that we were sailing. For
this was the arrangement made between us in case that we went astray
one from the other. [148] Two banners were planted with their
letters—one on a little eminence in the first bay, and the other in
an islet in the third bay [149] where there were many sea-wolves and
large birds. The captain-general waited for the ship with his other
ship near he river of Isleo, [150] and he had a cross set up in an
islet near that river, which flowed between high mountains covered with
snow and emptied into the sea near the river of Sardine. Had we not
discovered that strait, the captain-general had determined to go as far
as seventy-five degrees toward the Antarctic Pole. There in that
latitude, during the summer season, there is no night, or if there is
any night it is but short, and so in the winter with the day. In order
that your most illustrious Lordship may believe it, when we were in
that strait, the nights were only three hours long, and it was then the
month of October. [151] The land on the left-hand side of that strait
turned toward the southeast [152] and was low. We called that strait
the strait of Patagonia. One finds the safest of ports every half legua
in it, [153] water, the finest of wood (but not of cedar), fish,
sardines, and missiglioni, while smallage, [154] a sweet herb (although
there is also some that is bitter) grows around the springs. We ate of
it for many days as we had nothing else. I believe that there is not a
more beautiful or better strait in the world than that one. [155] In
that Ocean Sea one sees a very amusing fish hunt. The fish [that hunt]
are of three sorts, and are one braza and more in length, and are
called dorado, albicore, and bonito. [156] Those fish follow the flying
fish called colondrini, [157] which are one palmo and more [158] in
length and very good to eat. When the above three kinds [of fish] find
any of those flying fish, the latter immediately leap from the water
and fly as long as their wings are wet—more than a crossbow’s
flight. While they are flying, the others run along back of them under
the water following the shadow of the flying fish. The latter have no
sooner fallen into the water than the others immediately seize and eat
them. It is in fine a very amusing thing to watch.

All the above words are pronounced in the throat, for such is their
method of pronunciation. [161]

That giant whom we had in our ship told me those words; for when he,
upon asking me for capac, [162] that is to say, bread, as they call
that root which they use as bread, and oli, that is to say, water, saw
me write those words quickly, and afterward when I, with pen in hand,
asked him for other words, he understood me. Once I made the sign of
the cross, and, showing it to him, kissed it. He immediately cried out
“Setebos,” and made me a sign that if I made the sign of the cross
again, Setebos would enter into my body and cause it to burst. When
that giant was sick, he asked for the cross, and embracing it and
kissing it many times, desired to become a Christian before his death.
We called him Paulo. When those people wish to make a fire, they rub a
sharpened piece of wood against another piece until the fire catches in
the pith of a certain tree, which is placed between those two sticks.
[163]

Wednesday, November 28, 1520, we debouched from that strait, engulfing
ourselves in the Pacific Sea. [164] We were three months and twenty
days without getting any kind of fresh food. We ate biscuit, which was
no longer biscuit, but powder of biscuits swarming with worms, for they
had eaten the good. It stank strongly of the urine of rats. [165] We
drank yellow water that had been putrid for many days. We also ate some
ox hides that covered the top of the mainyard to prevent the yard from
chafing the shrouds, and which had become exceedingly hard because of
the sun, rain, and wind. [166] We left them in the sea for four or five
days, and then placed them for a few moments on top of the embers, and
so ate them; and often we ate sawdust from boards. Rats were sold for
one-half ducado apiece, and even then we could not get them. [167] But
above all the other misfortunes the following was the worst. The gums
of both the lower and upper teeth of some of our men swelled, so that
they could not eat under any circumstances and therefore died. [168]
Nineteen men died from that sickness, and the giant together with an
Indian from the country of Verzin. Twenty-five or thirty men fell sick
[during that time], in the arms, legs, or in another place, so that but
few remained well. However, I, by the grace of God, suffered no
sickness. We sailed about four thousand leguas during those three
months and twenty days through an open stretch in that Pacific Sea.
[169] In truth it is very pacific, [170] for during that time we did
not suffer any storm. We saw no land except two desert islets, where we
found nothing but birds and trees, for which we called them the Ysolle
Infortunate [i.e., the Unfortunate Isles]. They are two hundred leguas
apart. We found no anchorage, [but] near them saw many sharks. [171]
The first islet lies in fifteen degrees of south latitude, and the
other in nine. Daily we made runs of fifty, sixty, or seventy leguas at
the catena or at the stern. [172] Had not God and His blessed mother
given us so good weather we would all have died of hunger in that
exceeding vast sea. Of a verity I believe no such voyage will ever be
made [again].

When we left that strait, if we had sailed continuously westward we
would have circumnavigated the world without finding other land than
the cape of the xi thousand Virgins. [173] The latter is a cape of that
strait at the Ocean Sea, straight east and west with Cape Deseado of
the Pacific Sea. Both of those capes lie in a latitude of exactly
fifty-two degrees toward the Antarctic Pole.

The Antarctic Pole is not so starry as the Arctic. Many small stars
clustered together are seen, which have the appearance of two clouds of
mist. There is but little distance between them, and they are somewhat
dim. In the midst of them are two large and not very luminous stars,
which move only slightly. Those two stars are the Antarctic Pole. Our
loadstone, although it moved hither and thither, always pointed toward
its own Arctic Pole, although it did not have so much strength as on
its own side. And on that account when we were in that open expanse,
the captain-general, asking all the pilots whether they were always
sailing forward in the course which we had laid down on the maps, all
replied: “By your course exactly as laid down.” He answered them
that they were pointing wrongly—which was a fact—and that it would
be fitting to adjust the needle of navigation, for it was not receiving
so much force from its side. When we were in the midst of that open
expanse, we saw a cross with five extremely bright stars straight
toward the west, those stars being exactly placed with regard to one
another. [174]

During those days [175] we sailed west northwest, northwest by west,
and northwest, until we reached the equinoctial line at the distance of
one hundred and twenty-two degrees from the line of demarcation. The
line of demarcation is thirty degrees from the meridian, and the
meridian is three degrees eastward from Capo Verde. [176] We passed
while on that course, a short distance from two exceedingly rich
islands, one in twenty degrees of the latitude of the Antarctic Pole,
by name Cipangu, and the other in fifteen degrees, by name Sumbdit
Pradit. [177] After we had passed the equinoctial line we sailed west
northwest, and west by north, and then for two hundred leguas toward
the west, changing our course to west by south until we reached
thirteen degrees toward the Arctic Pole in order that we might approach
nearer to the land of cape Gaticara. That cape (with the pardon of
cosmographers, for they have not seen it), is not found where it is
imagined to be, but to the north in twelve degrees or thereabouts.
[178]

About seventy [179] leguas on the above course, and lying in twelve
degrees of latitude and 146 in longitude, we discovered on Wednesday,
March 6, a small island to the northwest, and two others toward the
southwest, one of which was higher and larger than the other two. The
captain-general wished to stop at the large island and get some fresh
food, but he was unable to do so because the inhabitants of that island
entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on, so
that we could not protect ourselves. The men were about to strike the
sails so that we could go ashore, but the natives very deftly stole
from us the small boat [180] that was fastened to the poop of the
flagship. Thereupon, the captain-general in wrath went ashore with
forty armed men, who burned some forty or fifty houses together with
many boats, and killed seven men. [181] He recovered the small boat,
and we departed immediately pursuing the same course. Before we landed,
some of our sick men begged us if we should kill any man or woman to
bring the entrails to them, as they would recover immediately. [182]

When we wounded any of those people with our crossbow-shafts, which
passed completely through their loins from one side to the other, they,
looking at it, pulled on the shaft now on this and now on that side,
[183] and then drew it out, with great astonishment, and so died.
Others who were wounded in the breast did the same, which moved us to
great compassion. Those people seeing us departing followed us with
more than one hundred [184] boats for more than one legua. They
approached the ships showing us fish, feigning that they would give
them to us; but then threw stones at us and fled. And although the
ships were under full sail, they passed between them and the small
boats [fastened astern], very adroitly in those small boats of theirs.
We saw some women in their boats who were crying out and tearing their
hair, for love, I believe, of those whom we had killed. [185]

Each one of those people lives according to his own will, for they have
no seignior. [186] They go naked, and some are bearded and have black
hair that reaches to the waist. They wear small palmleaf hats, as do
the Albanians. They are as tall as we, and well built. They have no
worship. They are tawny, but are born white. Their teeth are red and
black, for they think that is most beautiful. The women go naked except
that they wear a narrow strip of bark as thin as paper, which grows
between the tree and the bark of the palm, before their privies. They
are goodlooking and delicately formed, and lighter complexioned than
the men; and wear their hair which is exceedingly black, loose and
hanging quite down to the ground. The women do not work in the fields
but stay in the house, weaving mats, [187] baskets [casse: literally
boxes], and other things needed in their houses, from palm leaves. They
eat cocoanuts, camotes [batate], [188] birds, figs one palmo in length
[i.e., bananas], sugarcane, and flying fish, besides other things. They
[189] anoint the body and the hair with cocoanut and beneseed oil.
Their houses are all built of wood covered with planks and thatched
with leaves of the fig-tree [i.e., banana-tree] two brazas long; and
they have floors and windows. The rooms and the beds are all furnished
with the most beautiful palmleaf mats. [190] They sleep on palm straw
which is very soft and fine. They use no weapons, except a kind of a
spear pointed with a fishbone at the end. Those people are poor, but
ingenious and very thievish, on account of which we called those three
islands the islands of Ladroni [i.e., of thieves]. [191] Their
amusement, men and women, is to plough the seas with those small boats
of theirs. [192] Those boats resemble fucelere, [193] but are narrower,
and some are black, [some] white, and others red. At the side opposite
the sail, they have a large piece of wood pointed at the top, with
poles laid across it and resting on the water, in order that the boats
may sail more safely. The sail is made from palmleaves sewn together
and is shaped like a lateen sail. For rudders they use a certain blade
resembling a hearth shovel which have a piece of wood at the end. They
can change stern and bow at will [literally: they make the stern, bow,
and the bow, stern], [194] and those boats resemble the dolphins which
leap in the water from wave to wave. Those Ladroni [i.e., robbers]
thought, according to the signs which they made, that there were no
other people in the world but themselves. [195]

At dawn on Saturday, March sixteen, [196] 1521, we came upon a high
land at a distance of three hundred leguas from the islands of
Latroni—an island named Zamal [i.e., Samar]. The following day, the
captain-general desired to land on another island which was uninhabited
and lay to the right of the abovementioned island, in order to be more
secure, and to get water and have some rest. He had two tents set up on
the shore for the sick and had a sow killed for them. On Monday
afternoon, March 18, we saw a boat coming toward us with nine men in
it. Therefore, the captain-general ordered that no one should move or
say a word without his permission. When those men reached the shore,
their chief went immediately to the captain-general, giving signs of
joy because of our arrival. Five of the most ornately adorned of them
remained with us, while the rest went to get some others who were
fishing, and so they all came. The captain-general seeing that they
were reasonable men, ordered food to be set before them, and gave them
red caps, mirrors, combs, bells, ivory, bocasine, [197] and other
things. When they saw the captain’s courtesy, they presented fish, a
jar of palm wine, which they call uraca [i.e., arrack], figs more than
one palmo long [i.e., bananas], [198] and others which were smaller and
more delicate, and two cocoanuts. They had nothing else then, but made
us signs with their hands that they would bring umay or rice, [199] and
cocoanuts and many other articles of food within four days.

Cocoanuts are the fruit of the palmtree. [200] Just as we have bread,
wine, oil, and milk, so those people get everything from that tree.
They get wine in the following manner. They bore a hole into the heart
of the said palm at the top called palmito [i.e., stalk], from which
distils a liquor [201] which resembles white must. That liquor is sweet
but somewhat tart, and [is gathered] in canes [of bamboo] as thick as
the leg and thicker. They fasten the bamboo to the tree at evening for
the morning, and in the morning for the evening. That palm bears a
fruit, namely, the cocoanut, which is as large as the head or
thereabouts. Its outside husk is green and thicker than two fingers.
Certain filaments are found in that husk, whence is made cord for
binding together their boats. Under that husk there is a hard shell,
much thicker than the shell of the walnut, which they burn and make
therefrom a powder that is useful to them. [202] Under that shell there
is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness, which they eat
fresh with meat and fish as we do bread; and it has a taste resembling
the almond. It could be dried and made into bread. There is a clear,
sweet water in the middle of that marrowy substance which is very
refreshing. When that water stands for a while after having been
collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. When the natives wish
to make oil, they take that cocoanut, and allow the marrowy substance
and the water to putrefy. Then they boil it and it becomes oil like
butter. When they wish to make vinegar, they allow only the water to
putrefy, and then place it in the sun, and a vinegar results like [that
made from] white wine. Milk can also be made from it for we made some.
We scraped that marrowy substance and then mixed the scrapings with its
own water which we strained through a cloth, and so obtained milk like
goat’s milk. Those palms resemble date-palms, but although not smooth
they are less knotty than the latter. A family of x persons can be
supported on two trees, by utilizing them week about for the wine; for
if they did otherwise, the trees would dry up. They last a century.
[203]

Those people became very familiar with us. They told us many things,
their names and those of some of the islands that could be seen from
that place. Their own island was called Zuluan and it is not very
large. [204] We took great pleasure with them, for they were very
pleasant and conversable. In order to show them greater honor, the
captain-general [205] took them to his ship and showed them all his
merchandise—cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, mace, gold, and
all the things in the ship. He had some mortars fired for them, whereat
they exhibited great fear, and tried to jump out of the ship. [206]
They made signs to us that the abovesaid articles grew in that place
where we were going. When they were about to retire they took their
leave very gracefully and neatly, saying that they would return
according to their promise. The island where we were is called Humunu;
but inasmuch as we found two springs there of the clearest water, we
called it Acquada da li buoni Segnialli [i.e., “the Watering-place of
good Signs”], for there were the first signs of gold which we found
in those districts. [207] We found a great quantity of white coral
there, and large trees with fruit a trifle smaller than the almond and
resembling pine seeds. There are also many palms, some of them good and
others bad. There are many islands in that district, and therefore we
called them the archipelago of San Lazaro, as they were discovered on
the Sabbath of St. Lazurus. [208] They lie in x degrees of latitude
toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-one
degrees from the line of demarcation.

At noon on Friday, March 22, those men came as they had promised us in
two boats with cocoanuts, sweet oranges, a jar of palm-wine, and a
cock, [209] in order to show us that there were fowls in that district.
They exhibited great signs of pleasure at seeing us. [210] We purchased
all those articles from them. Their seignior was an old man who was
painted [i.e., tattooed]. He wore two gold earrings [schione] in his
ears, [211] and the others many gold armlets on their arms and
kerchiefs about their heads. We stayed there one week, and during that
time our captain went ashore daily to visit the sick, and [212] every
morning gave them cocoanut water from his own hand, which comforted
them greatly. There are people living near that island [213] who have
holes in their ears so large that they can pass their arms through
them. Those people are caphri, [214] that is to say, heathen. They go
naked, with a cloth woven from the bark of a tree about their privies,
except some of the chiefs who wear cotton cloth embroidered with silk
at the ends by means of a needle. They are dark, fat, and painted. They
anoint themselves with cocoanut and with beneseed oil, as a protection
against sun and wind. They have very black hair that falls to the
waist, and use daggers, knives, and spears [215] ornamented with gold,
large shields, fascines, [216] javelins, and fishing nets that resemble
rizali; [217] and their boats are like ours.

On the afternoon of holy Monday, the day of our Lady, March
twenty-five, while we were on the point of weighing anchor, I went to
the side of the ship to fish, and putting my feet upon a yard leading
down into the storeroom, they slipped, for it was rainy, and
consequently I fell into the sea, so that no one saw me. When I was all
but under, my left hand happened to catch hold of the clew-garnet of
the mainsail, which was dangling [ascosa] in the water. I held on
tightly, and began to cry out so lustily that I was rescued by the
small boat. I was aided, not, I believe, indeed, through my merits, but
through the mercy of that font of charity [i.e., of the Virgin]. That
same day we shaped our course toward the west southwest between four
small islands, namely, Cenalo, Hiunanghan, [218] Ibusson, and Abarien.

On Thursday morning, March twenty-eight, as we had seen a fire on an
island the night before, we anchored near it. [219] We saw a small boat
which the natives call boloto with eight men in it, approaching the
flagship. A slave belonging to the captain-general, who was a native of
Zamatra [i.e., Sumatra], which was formerly called Traprobana, spoke to
them. They immediately understood him, came alongside the ship,
unwilling to enter but taking a position at some little distance. [220]
The captain seeing that they would not trust us, threw them out a red
cap and other things tied to a bit of wood. They received them very
gladly, and went away quickly to advise their king. About two hours
later we saw two balanghai coming. They are large boats and are so
called [by those people]. They were full of men, and their king was in
the larger of them, being seated under an awning of mats. When the king
came near the flagship, the slave spoke to him. The king understood
him, for in those districts the kings know more languages than the
other people. He ordered some of his men to enter the ships, but he
always remained in his balanghai, at some little distance from the ship
until his own men returned; and as soon as they returned he departed.
The captain-general showed great honor to the men who entered the ship,
and gave them some presents, for which the king wished before his
departure to give the captain a large bar [221] of gold and a basketful
of ginger. The latter, however, thanked the king heartily but would not
accept it. In the afternoon we went in the ships [and anchored] near
the dwellings of the king.

Next day, holy Friday, the captain-general sent his slave, who acted as
our interpreter, ashore in a small boat to ask the king if he had any
food to have it carried to the ships; [222] and to say that they would
be well satisfied with us, for he [and his men] had come to the island
as friends and not as enemies. The king came with six or eight men
[223] in the same boat and entered the ship. He embraced the
captain-general to whom he gave three porcelain jars covered with
leaves and full of raw rice, two very large orade, [224] and other
things. The captain-general gave the king a garment of red and yellow
cloth made in the Turkish fashion, and a fine red cap; and to the
others (the king’s men), to some knives and to others mirrors. Then
the captain-general had a collation spread for them, and had the king
told through the slave that he desired to be casi casi [225] with him,
that is to say, brother. The king replied that he also wished to enter
the same relations with the captain-general. Then the captain showed
him cloth of various colors, linen, coral [ornaments], and many other
articles of merchandise, and all the artillery, some of which he had
discharged for him, whereat the natives were greatly frightened. Then
the captain-general had a man armed as a soldier, [226] and placed him
in the midst of three men armed with swords and daggers, who struck him
on all parts of the body. Thereby was the king rendered almost
speechless. The captain-general told him through the slave that one of
those armed men was worth one hundred of his own men. The king answered
that that was a fact. The captain-general said that he had two hundred
men in each ship who were armed in that manner. [227] He showed the
king cuirasses, swords, and bucklers, and had a review made for him.
[228] Then he led the king to the deck of the ship, that is located
above at the stern; and had his sea-chart and compass brought. [229] He
told the king through the interpreter how he had found the strait in
order to voyage thither, and how many moons he had been without seeing
land, whereat the king was astonished. Lastly, he told the king that he
would like, if it were pleasing to him, to send two of his men with him
so that he might show them some of his things. The king replied that he
was agreeable, and I went in company with one of the other men. [230]

When I reached shore, the king raised his hands toward the sky and then
turned toward us two. We did the same toward him [231] as did all the
others. The king took me by the hand; one of his chiefs took my
companion; and thus they led us under a bamboo covering, where there
was a balanghai, [232] as long as eighty of my palm lengths, and
resembling a fusta. We sat down upon the stern of that balanghai,
constantly conversing with signs. The king’s men stood about us in a
circle with swords, daggers, spears, and bucklers. [233] The king had a
plate of pork brought in and a large jar filled with wine. At every
mouthful, we drank a cup of wine. The wine that was left [in the cup]
at any time, although that happened but rarely, was put into a jar by
itself. The king’s cup was always kept covered and no one else drank
from it but he and I. Before the king took the cup to drink, he raised
his clasped hands toward the sky, and then toward me; and when he was
about to drink, he extended the fist of his left hand toward me (at
first I thought that he was about to strike me) and then drank. I did
the same toward the king. They all make those signs one toward another
when they drink. We ate with such ceremonies and with other signs of
friendship. I ate meat on holy Friday, for I could not help myself.
Before the supper hour I gave the king many things which I had brought.
I wrote down the names of many things in their language. When the king
and the others saw me writing, and when I told them their words, they
were all astonished. [234] While engaged in that the supper hour was
announced. Two large porcelain dishes were brought in, one full of rice
and the other of pork with its gravy. We ate with the same signs and
ceremonies, after which we went to the palace of the king which was
built like a hayloft and was thatched with fig [i.e., banana] and palm
leaves. It was built up high from the ground on huge posts of wood and
it was necessary to ascend to it by means of ladders. [235] The king
made us sit down there on a bamboo mat with our feet drawn up like
tailors. After a half-hour a platter of roast fish cut in pieces was
brought in, and ginger freshly gathered, and wine. The king’s eldest
son, who was the prince, came over to us, whereupon the king told him
to sit down near us, and he accordingly did so. Then two platters were
brought in (one with fish and its sauce, and the other with rice), so
that we might eat with the prince. My companion became intoxicated as a
consequence of so much drinking and eating. They used the gum of a tree
called anime wrapped in palm or fig [i.e., banana] leaves for lights.
The king made us a sign that he was going to go to sleep. He left the
prince with us, and we slept with the latter on a bamboo mat with
pillows made of leaves. When day dawned the king came and took me by
the hand, and in that manner we went to where we had had supper, in
order to partake of refreshments, but the boat came to get us. Before
we left, the king kissed our hands with great joy, and we his. One of
his brothers, the king of another island, and three men came with us.
The captain-general kept him to dine with us, and gave him many things.
[236]

Pieces of gold, of the size of walnuts and eggs are found by sifting
the earth in the island of that king who came to our ships. All the
dishes of that king are of gold and also some portion of his house, as
we were told by that king himself. According to their customs he was
very grandly decked out [molto in ordine], [237] and the finest looking
man that we saw among those people. His hair was exceedingly black, and
hung to his shoulders. He had a covering of silk oh his head, and wore
two large golden earrings fastened in his ears. He wore a cotton cloth
all embroidered with silk, which covered him from the waist to the
knees. At his side hung a dagger, the haft of which was somewhat long
and all of gold, and its scabbard of carved wood. He had three spots of
gold on every tooth, and his teeth appeared as if bound with gold.
[238] He was perfumed with storax and benzoin. He was tawny and painted
[i.e., tattooed] all over. That island of his was called Butuan and
Calagan. [239] When those kings wished to see one another, they both
went to hunt in that island where we were. The name of the first king
is Raia Colambu, and the second Raia Siaui. [240]

Early on the morning of Sunday, the last of March, and Easter-day, the
captain-general sent the priest with some men to prepare the place
where mass was to be said; [241] together with the interpreter to tell
the king that we were not going to land in order to dine with him, but
to say mass. Therefore the king sent us two swine that he had had
killed. When the hour for mass arrived, we landed with about fifty men,
without our body armor, but carrying our other arms, and dressed in our
best clothes. [242] Before we reached the shore with our boats, six
pieces were discharged as a sign of peace. We landed; the two kings
embraced the captain-general, and placed him between them. We went in
marching order to the place consecrated, which was not far from the
shore. Before the commencement of mass, the captain sprinkled the
entire bodies of the two kings with musk water.” [243] The mass was
offered up. The kings went forward to kiss the cross as we did, but
they did not offer the sacrifice. [244] When the body of our Lord was
elevated, they remained on their knees and worshiped Him with clasped
hands. The ships fired all their artillery at once when the body of
Christ was elevated, the signal having been given from the shore with
muskets. After the conclusion of mass, some of our men took communion.
[245] The captain-general arranged a fencing tournament, [246] at which
the kings were greatly pleased. Then he had a cross carried in and the
nails and a crown, to which immediate reverence was made. [247] He told
the kings through the interpreter that they were the standards given to
him by the emperor his sovereign, so that wherever he might go he might
set up those his tokens. [He said] that he wished to set it up in that
place for their benefit, for whenever any of our ships came, [248] they
would know that we had been there by that cross, and would do nothing
to displease them or harm their property [property: doublet in original
MS.]. If any of their men were captured, they would be set free
immediately on that sign being shown. It was necessary to set that
cross on the summit of the highest mountain, so that on seeing it every
morning, they might adore it; and if they did that, neither thunder,
lightning, nor storms would harm them in the least. They thanked him
heartily and [said] that they would do everything willingly. The
captain-general also had them asked whether they were Moros or heathen,
or what was their belief. They replied that they worshiped nothing, but
that they raised their clasped hands and their face to the sky; and
that they called their god “Abba.” [249] Thereat the captain was
very glad, and seeing that, the first king raised his hands to the sky,
and said that he wished that it were possible for him to make the
captain see his love for him. The interpreter asked the king why there
was so little to eat there. The latter replied that he did not live in
that place except when he went hunting and to see his brother, but that
he lived in another island where all his family were. The
captain-general had him asked to declare whether he had any enemies, so
that he might go with his ships to destroy them and to render them
obedient to him. [250] The king thanked him and said that he did indeed
have two islands hostile to him, but that it was not then the season to
go there. The captain told him that if God would again allow him to
return to those districts, he would bring so many men that he would
make the king’s enemies subject to him by force. He said that he was
about to go to dinner, and that he would return afterward to have the
cross set up on the summit of the mountain. They replied that they were
satisfied, and then forming in battalion and firing the muskets, and
the captain having embraced the two kings, we took our leave.

After dinner we all returned clad in our doublets, and that afternoon
[251] went together with the two kings to the summit of the highest
mountain there. When we reached the summit, the captain-general told
them that he esteemed highly having sweated for them, for since the
cross was there, it could not but be of great use to them. On asking
them which port was the best to get food, they replied that there were
three, namely, Ceylon, Zubu, and Calaghann, but that Zubu was the
largest and the one with most trade. They offered of their own accord
to give us pilots to show us the way. The captain-general thanked them,
and determined to go there, for so did his unhappy fate will. After the
cross was erected in position, each of us repeated a Pater Noster and
an Ave Maria, and adored the cross; and the kings did the same. Then we
descended through their cultivated fields, and went to the place where
the balanghai was. [252] The kings had some cocoanuts brought in so
that we might refresh ourselves. The captain asked the kings for the
pilots for he intended to depart the following morning, and [said] that
he would treat them as if they were the kings themselves, and would
leave one of us as hostage. The kings replied that every hour he wished
the pilots were at his command, but that night the first king changed
his mind, and in the morning when we were about to depart, sent word to
the captain-general, asking him for love of him to wait two days until
he should have his rice harvested, and other trifles attended to. He
asked the captain-general to send him some men to help him, so that it
might be done sooner; and said that he intended to act as our pilot
himself. The captain sent him some men, but the kings ate and drank so
much that they slept all the day. Some said to excuse them that they
were slightly sick. Our men did nothing on that day, but they worked
the next two days. [253]

One of those people brought us about a porringer full of rice and also
eight or ten figs [i.e., bananas] fastened together to barter them for
a knife which at the most was worth three catrini. [254] The captain
seeing that that native cared for nothing but a knife, called him to
look at other things. He put his hand in his purse and wished to give
him one real for those things, but the native refused it. The captain
showed him a ducado but he would not accept that either. Finally the
captain tried to give him a doppione [255] worth two ducados, but he
would take nothing but a knife; and accordingly the captain had one
given to him. When one of our men went ashore for water, one of those
people wanted to give him a pointed crown of massy gold, of the size of
a colona [256] for six strings of glass beads, but the captain refused
to let him barter, so that the natives should learn at the very
beginning that we prized our merchandise more than their gold. [257]

Those people are heathens, [258] and go naked and painted. They wear a
piece of cloth woven from a tree about their privies. [259] They are
very heavy drinkers. [260] Their women are clad in tree cloth from
their waist down, and their hair is black and reaches to the ground.
They have holes pierced in their ears which are filled with gold. Those
people are constantly chewing a fruit which they call areca, and which
resembles a pear. They cut that fruit into four parts, and then wrap it
in the leaves of their tree which they call betre [i.e., betel]. Those
leaves resemble the leaves of the mulberry. They mix it with a little
lime, and when they have chewed it thoroughly, they spit it out. [261]
It makes the mouth exceedingly red. All the people in those parts of
the world use it, for it is very cooling to the heart, and if they
ceased to use it they would die. There are dogs, cats, swine, fowls,
goats, rice, ginger, cocoanuts, figs [i.e., bananas], oranges, lemons,
millet, panicum, sorgo, [262] wax, and a quantity of gold in that
island. It lies in a latitude of nine and two-thirds degrees toward the
Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-two degrees
from the line of demarcation. It is twenty-five from the Acquada, and
is called Mazaua. [263]

We remained there seven days, after which we laid our course toward the
northwest, passing among [264] five islands, namely, Ceylon, Bohol,
Canighan, Baybai, and Gatighan. [265] In the last-named island of
Gatigan, there are bats as large as eagles. As it was late we killed
one of them, [266] which resembled chicken in taste. There are doves,
turtledoves, [267] parrots, and certain black birds as large as
domestic chickens, which have a long tail. The last mentioned birds lay
eggs as large as the goose, and bury them under the sand, through the
great heat of which they hatch out. When the chicks are born, they push
up the sand, and come out. Those eggs are good to eat. There is a
distance of twenty leguas from Mazaua to Gatighan. We set out westward
from Gatighan, but the king of Mazaua could not follow us [closely],
and consequently, we awaited him near three islands, namely, Polo,
Ticobon, and Pozon. [268] When he caught up with us he was greatly
astonished at the rapidity with which we sailed. The captain-general
had him come into his ship with several of his chiefs at which they
were pleased. Thus did we go to Zubu from Gatighan, the distance to
Zubu being fifteen leguas. [269]

At noon on Sunday, April seven, we entered the port of Zubu, passing by
many villages, where we saw many houses built upon logs. On approaching
the city, the captain-general ordered the ships to fling their banners.
The sails were lowered and arranged as if for battle, and all the
artillery was fired, an action which caused great fear to those people.
The captain sent a foster-son of his as ambassador to the king of Zubo
with the interpreter. When they reached the city, they found a vast
crowd of people together with the king, all of whom had been frightened
by the mortars. The interpreter told them [270] that that was our
custom when entering into such places, as a sign of peace and
friendship, and that we had discharged all our mortars to honor the
king of the village. The king and all of his men were reassured, and
the king had us asked by his governor what we wanted. The interpreter
replied that his master was a captain of the greatest king and prince
in the world, and that he was going to discover Malucho; [271] but that
he had come solely to visit the king because of the good report which
he had heard of him from the king of Mazaua, and to buy food with his
merchandise. The king told him that he was welcome [literally: he had
come at a good time], but that it was their custom for all ships that
entered their ports to pay tribute, and that it was but four days since
a junk from Ciama [i.e., Siam] laden with gold and slaves had paid him
tribute. As proof of his statement the king pointed out to the
interpreter a merchant from Ciama, who had remained to trade the gold
and slaves. The interpreter told the king that, since his master was
the captain of so great a king, he did not pay tribute to any seignior
in the world, and that if the king wished peace he would have peace,
but if war instead, war. Thereupon, the Moro merchant said to the king
Cata raia chita that is to say, [272] “Look well, sire.” “These
men are the same who have conquered Calicut, Malaca, and all India
Magiore [i.e., India Major]. [273] If they are treated well, they will
give good treatment, but if they are treated evil, evil and worse
treatment, as they have done to Calicut and Malaca.” The interpreter
understood it all and told the king that his master’s king was more
powerful in men and ships than the king of Portogalo, that he was the
king of Spagnia and emperor of all the Christians, and that if the king
did not care to be his friend [274] he would next time send so many men
that they would destroy him. The Moro related everything to the king,
[275] who said thereupon that he would deliberate with his men, and
would answer the captain on the following day. Then he had refreshments
of many dishes, all made from meat and contained in porcelain platters,
besides many jars of wine brought in. After our men had refreshed
themselves, they returned and told us everything. The king of Mazaua,
[276] who was the most influential after that king and the seignior of
a number of islands, went ashore to speak to the king of the great
courtesy of our captain-general.

Monday morning, our notary, together with the interpreter, went to
Zubu. The king, accompanied by his chiefs, came to the open square
where he had our men sit down near him. He asked the notary whether
there were more than one captain in that company, and whether that
captain wished him to pay tribute to the emperor his master. The notary
replied in the negative, but that the captain wished only to trade with
him and with no others. The king said that he was satisfied, and that
if the captain wished to become his friend, he should send him a drop
of blood from his right arm, and he himself would do the same [to him]
as a sign of the most sincere friendship. [277] The notary answered
that the captain would do it. Thereupon, the king told him that all the
captains who came to that place, were wont to give presents one to the
other [i.e., mutual presents between the king and the captain], and
asked whether our captain or he ought to commence. [278] The
interpreter told the king that since he desired to maintain the custom,
he should commence, and so he did. [279]

Tuesday morning the king of Mazaua came to the ships with the Moro. He
saluted the captain-general in behalf of the king [of Zubu], and said
that the king of Zubu was collecting as much food as possible to give
to him, and that after dinner he would send one of his nephews and two
others of his chief men to make peace. The captain-general had one of
his men armed with his own arms, and had the Moro told that we all
fought in that manner. The Moro was greatly frightened, but the captain
told him not to be frightened for our arms were soft toward our friends
and harsh toward our enemies; and as handkerchiefs wipe off the sweat
so did our arms overthrow and destroy all our adversaries, and those
who hate our faith. [280] The captain did that so that the Moro who
seemed more intelligent than the others, might tell it to the king.

After dinner the king’s nephew, who was the prince, came to the ships
with the king of Mazaua, the Moro, the governor, the chief constable,
and eight chiefs, to make peace with us. The captain-general was seated
in a red velvet chair, the principal men [281] on leather chairs, and
the others on mats upon the floor. The captain-general asked them
through the interpreter whether it were their custom to speak in secret
or in public, and whether that prince and the king of Mazaua had
authority to make peace. [282] They answered that they spoke in public,
and that they were empowered to make peace. The captain-general said
many things concerning peace, and that he prayed God to confirm it in
heaven. They said that they had never heard any one speak such words,
but that they took great pleasure in hearing them. The captain seeing
that they listened and answered willingly, began to advance arguments
to induce them to accept the faith. Asking them who would succeed to
the seigniory after the death of the king, he was answered that the
king had no sons but only daughters, the eldest of whom was the wife of
that nephew of his, who therefore was the prince. [They said that] when
the fathers and mothers grew old, they received no further honor, but
their children commanded them. The captain told them that God made the
sky, the earth, the sea, and everything else, and that He had commanded
us to honor our fathers and mothers, and that whoever did otherwise was
condemned to eternal fire; that we are all descended from Adam and Eva,
our first parents; that we have an immortal spirit; [283] and many
other things pertaining to the faith. All joyfully entreated the
captain to leave them two men, or at least one, [284] to instruct them
in the faith, and [said] that they would show them great honor. The
captain replied to them that he could not leave them any men then, but
that if they wished to become Christians, our priest would baptize
them, and that he would next time bring priests and friars who would
instruct them in our faith. They answered that they would first speak
to their king, and that then they would become Christians, [whereat] we
all wept with great joy. The captain-general told them that they should
not become Christians for fear or to please us, but of their own free
wills; [285] and that he would not cause any displeasure to those who
wished to live according to their own law, but that the Christians
would be better regarded and treated than the others. All cried out
with one voice that they were not becoming Christians through fear or
to please us, but of their own free will. Then the captain told them
that if they became Christians, he would leave a suit of armor, [286]
for so had his king commanded him; that we could not have intercourse
with their women without committing a very great, sin, since they were
pagans; and that he assured them that if they became Christians, the
devil would no longer appear to them except in the last moment at their
death. [287] They said that they could not answer the beautiful words
of the captain, but that they placed themselves in his hands, and that
he should treat them as his most faithful servants. The captain
embraced them weeping, and clasping one of the prince’s hands and one
of the king’s between his own, said to them that, by his faith in God
and to his sovereign, the emperor, and by the habit which he wore,
[288] he promised them that he would give them perpetual peace with the
king of Spagnia. They answered that they promised the same. After the
conclusion of the peace, the captain had refreshments served to them.
Then the prince and the king [of Mazaua] presented some baskets of
rice, swine, goats, and fowls to the captain-general on behalf of their
king, and asked him to pardon them, for such things were but little [to
give] to one such as he. The captain gave the prince a white cloth of
the finest linen, a red cap, some strings of glass beads, and a gilded
glass drinking cup. Those glasses are greatly appreciated in those
districts. He did not give any present to the king of Mazaua, for he
had already given him a robe of Cambaya, besides other articles. [289]
To the others he gave now one thing and now another. Then he sent to
the king of Zubu through me and one other a yellow and violet silk
robe, made in Turkish style, a fine red cap, some strings of glass
beads, all in a silver dish, and two gilt drinking cups in our hands.
[290] When we reached the city we found the king in his palace
surrounded by many people. He was seated on a palm mat on the ground,
with only a cotton cloth before his privies, and a scarf embroidered
with the needle about his head, a necklace of great value hanging from
his neck, and two large gold earrings fastened in his ears set round
with precious gems. He was fat and short, and tattooed with fire [291]
in various designs. From another mat on the ground he was eating turtle
eggs which were in two porcelain dishes, and he had four jars full of
palm wine in front of him covered with sweet-smelling herbs and
arranged with four small reeds in each jar by means of which he drank.
[292] Having duly made reverence to him, the interpreter told the king
that his master thanked him very warmly for his present, and that he
sent this present not in return for his present but for the intrinsic
love which he bore him. [293] We dressed him in the robe, placed the
cap on his head, and gave him the other things; then kissing the beads
and putting them upon his head, I presented them to him. He doing the
same [i.e., kissing them] accepted them. Then the king had us eat some
of those eggs and drink through those slender reeds. The others, his
men, told him in that place, the words of the captain concerning peace
and his exhortation to them to become Christians. The king wished to
have us stay to supper with him, but we told him that we could not stay
then. Having taken our leave of him, the prince took us with him to his
house, where four young girls were playing [instruments]—one, on a
drum like ours, but resting on the ground; the second was striking two
suspended gongs alternately with a stick wrapped somewhat thickly at
the end with palm cloth; the third, one large gong in the same manner;
and the last, two small gongs held in her hand, by striking one against
the other, which gave forth a sweet sound. They played so harmoniously
that one would believe they possessed good musical sense. Those girls
were very beautiful and almost as white as our girls and as large. They
were naked except for tree cloth hanging from the waist and reaching to
the knees. Some were quite naked and had large holes in their ears with
a small round piece of wood in the hole, which keeps the hole round and
large. They have long black hair, and wear a short cloth about the
head, and are always barefoot. The prince had three quite naked girls
dance for us. We took refreshments and then went to the ships. Those
gongs are made of brass [metalo] and are manufactured in the regions
about the Signio Magno [294] which is called China. They are used in
those regions as we use bells and are called aghon. [295]

On Wednesday morning, as one of our men had died during the previous
night, the interpreter and I [296] went to ask the king where we could
bury him. We found the king surrounded by many men, of whom, after the
due reverence was made, I asked it. [297] He replied, “If I and my
vassals all belong to your sovereign, how much more ought the land.”
I told the king that we would like to consecrate the place, [298] and
to set up a cross there. He replied that he was quite satisfied, and
that he wished to adore the cross as did we. The deceased was buried in
the square with as much pomp as possible, in order to furnish a good
example. Then we consecrated the place, and in the evening buried
another man. We carried a quantity of merchandise ashore which we
stored in a house. The king took it under his care as well as four men
who were left to trade the goods by wholesale. [299] Those people live
in accordance with justice, and have weights and measures. They love
peace, ease, and quiet. They have wooden balances, the bar of which has
a cord in the middle by which it is held. At one end is a bit of lead,
and at the other marks like quarter-libras, third-libras, and libras.
When they wish to weigh they take the scales which has three wires like
ours, and place it above the marks, and so weigh accurately. [300] They
have very large measures without any bottom. [301] The youth play on
pipes made like ours which they call subin. Their houses are
constructed of wood, and are built of planks and bamboo, raised high
from the ground on large logs, and one must enter them by means of
ladders. They have rooms like ours; and under the house they keep their
swine, goats, and fowls. Large sea snails [corniolli], beautiful to the
sight, are found there which kill whales. For the whale swallows them
alive, and when they are in the whale’s body, they come out of their
shells and eat the whale’s heart. Those people afterward find them
alive near the dead whale’s heart. Those creatures have black teeth
and skin and a white shell, and the flesh is good to eat. They are
called laghan. [302]

On Friday we showed those people a shop full of our merchandise, [303]
at which they were very much surprised. For metals, iron, and other
large merchandise they gave us gold. For the other smaller articles
they gave us rice, swine, goats, and other food. Those people gave us x
pieces of gold for xiiii libras of iron [304] (one piece being worth
about one and one-half ducados). The captain-general did not wish to
take too much gold, for there would have been some sailors who would
have given all that they owned for a small amount of gold, and would
have spoiled the trade for ever. [305] On Saturday, as the captain had
promised the king to make him a Christian on Sunday, a platform was
built in the consecrated square, which was adorned with hangings and
palm branches for his baptism. The captain-general sent men to tell the
king not to be afraid of the pieces that would be discharged in the
morning, for it was our custom to discharge them at our greatest feasts
without loading with stones. [306]

On Sunday morning, April fourteen, forty men of us went ashore, two of
whom were completely armed and preceded the royal banner. [307] When we
reached land all the artillery was fired. [308] Those people followed
us hither and thither. The captain and the king embraced. The captain
told the king that the royal banner was not taken ashore except with
fifty men armed as were those two, and with fifty musketeers; but so
great was his love for him that he had thus brought the banner. [309]
Then we all approached the platform joyfully. The captain and the king
sat down in chairs of red and violet velvet, [310] the chiefs on
cushions, and the others on mats. [311] The captain told the king
through the interpreter that he thanked God for inspiring him to became
a Christian; and that [now] he would more easily conquer his enemies
than before. The king replied that he wished to become a Christian, but
that some of his chiefs did not wish to obey, because they said that
they were as good men as he. Then our captain had all the chiefs of the
king called, and told them that, unless they obeyed the king as their
king, he would have them killed, and would give their possessions to
the king. They replied that they would obey him. The captain told the
king that he was going to Spagnia, but that he would return again with
so many forces that he would make him the greatest king of those
regions, as he had been the first to express a determination to become
a Christian. The king, lifting his hands to the sky, thanked the
captain, and requested him to let some of his men remain [with him], so
that he and his people might be better instructed in the faith. The
captain replied that he would leave two men to satisfy him, but that he
would like to take two of the children of the chiefs with him, so that
they might learn our language, who afterward on their return would be
able to tell the others the wonders [cose] of Spagnia. A large cross
was set up in the middle of the square. The captain told them that if
they wished to become Christians as they had declared on the previous
days, that they must burn all their idols and set up a cross in their
place. They were to adore that cross daily with clasped hands, and
every morning after their [i.e., the Spaniards’] custom, they were to
make the sign of the cross (which the captain showed them how to make);
and they ought to come hourly, at least in the morning, to that cross,
and adore it kneeling. The intention that they had already declared,
they were to confirm with good works. The king and all the others
wished to confirm it thoroughly. The captain-general told the king that
he was clad all in white to demonstrate his sincere love toward them.
They replied that they could not respond to his sweet words. The
captain led the king by the hand to the platform while speaking these
good words in order to baptize him. He told the king that he would call
him Don Carlo, after his sovereign the emperor; the prince, Don
Fernando, after the emperor’s brother; the king of Mazaua, Johanni; a
chief, Fernando, after our chief, that is to say, the captain; the
Moro, Christoforo; and then the others, now one name, and now another.
Five hundred men were baptized before mass. After the conclusion of
mass, the captain invited the king and some of the other chiefs to
dinner, but they refused, accompanying us, however, to the shore. The
ships discharged all the mortars; and embracing, the king and chiefs
and the captain took leave of one another. [312]

After dinner the priest and some of the others went ashore to baptize
the queen, who came with forty women. We conducted her to the platform,
and she was made to sit down upon a cushion, and the other women near
her, until the priest should be ready. She was shown an image of our
Lady, a very beautiful wooden child Jesus, and a cross. Thereupon, she
was overcome with contrition, and asked for baptism amid her tears.
[313] We named her Johanna, after the emperor’s mother; her daughter,
the wife of the prince, Catherina; the queen of Mazaua, Lisabeta; and
the others, each their [distinctive] name. Counting men, women, and
children, we baptized eight hundred souls. [314] The queen was young
and beautiful, and was entirely covered with a white and black cloth.
Her mouth and nails were very red, while on her head she wore a large
hat of palm leaves in the manner of a parasol, [315] with a crown about
it of the same leaves, like the tiara of the pope; and she never goes
any place without such a one. [316] She asked us to give her the little
child Jesus to keep in place of her idols; [317] and then she went
away. In the afternoon, [318] the king and queen, accompanied by
numerous persons, came to the shore. Thereupon, the captain had many
trombs of fire and large mortars discharged, by which they were most
highly delighted. [319] The captain and the king called one another
brothers. That king’s name was Raia Humabon. Before that week had
gone, all the persons of that island, and some from the other island,
were baptized. We burned one hamlet which was located in a neighboring
island, because it refused to obey the king or us. We set up the cross
there for those people were heathen. Had they been Moros, we would have
erected a column there as a token of greater hardness, for the Moros
are much harder to convert than the heathen.

The captain-general went ashore daily during those days to hear mass,
and told the king many things regarding the faith. [320] One day the
queen came with great pomp to hear mass. Three girls preceded her with
three of her hats in their hands. [321] She was dressed in black and
white with a large silk scarf, crossed with gold stripes thrown over
her head, which covered her shoulders; and she had on her hat. A great
number of women accompanied her, who were all naked and barefoot,
except that they had a small covering of palm-tree cloth before their
privies, and a small scarf upon the head, and all with hair flowing
free. The queen, having made the due reverence to the altar, seated
herself on a silk embroidered cushion. Before the commencement of the
mass, the captain sprayed her and some of her women with musk
rosewater, for they delighted exceedingly in such perfumes. The captain
knowing that the queen was very much pleased with the child Jesus, gave
it to her, telling her to keep it in place of her idols, for it was in
memory [322] of the son of God. Thanking him heartily she accepted it.

Before mass one day, the captain-general had the king come clad in his
silk robe, and the chief men of the city, [to wit], the king’s
brother and prince’s father, whose name was Bendara; another of the
king’s brothers, Cadaio; and certain ones called Simiut, Sibuaia,
Sisacai, Maghalibe, and many others whom I shall not name in order not
to be tedious. [323] The captain made them all swear to be obedient to
their king, and they kissed the latter’s hand. Then the captain had
the king declare that he would always be obedient and faithful to the
king of Spagnia, and the king so swore. [324] Thereupon, the captain
drew his Sword before the image of our Lady, and told the king that
when anyone so swore, he should prefer to die rather than to break such
an oath, [325] if he swore by that image, by the life of the emperor
his sovereign, and by his habit to be ever faithful. After the
conclusion of that the captain gave the king a red velvet chair,
telling him that wherever he went he should always have it carried
before him by one of his nearest relatives; and he showed him how it
ought to be carried. The king responded that he would do that willingly
for love of him, and he told the captain that he was making a jewel to
give to him, namely, two large earrings of gold to fasten [326] in his
ears, two armlets to put on his arms, above the elbows, and two other
rings for the feet above the ankles, besides other precious gems to
adorn [327] the ears. Those are the most beautiful ornaments which the
kings of those districts can wear. They always go barefoot, and wear a
cloth garment that hangs from the waist to the knees.

One day the captain-general asked the king and the other people why
they did not burn their idols as they had promised when they became
Christians; and why they sacrificed so much flesh to them. They replied
that what they were doing was not for themselves, but for a sick man
who had not spoken now for four days, so that the idols might give him
health. He was the prince’s brother, and the bravest and wisest man
in the island. The captain told them to burn their idols and to believe
in Christ, and that if the sick man were baptized, he would quickly
recover; and if that did not so happen they could behead him [i.e., the
captain] then and there. Thereupon, the king replied that he would do
it, for he truly believed in Christ. We made a procession from the
square to the house of the sick man with as much pomp as possible.
There we found him in such condition that he could neither speak nor
move. We baptized him and his two wives, and x girls. Then the captain
had him asked how he felt. He spoke immediately and said that by the
grace of our Lord he felt very well. That was a most manifest miracle
[that happened] in our times. When the captain heard him speak, he
thanked God fervently. Then he made the sick man drink some almond
milk, which he had already had made for him. Afterward he sent him a
mattress, a pair of sheets, a coverlet of yellow cloth, and a pillow.
Until he recovered his health, the captain sent him almond milk,
rosewater, oil of roses, and some sweet preserves. Before five days the
sick man began to walk. He had an idol that certain old women had
concealed in his house burned in the presence of the king and all the
people. He had many shrines along the seashore destroyed, [328] in
which the consecrated meat was eaten. The people themselves cried out
“Castiglia! Castiglia!” and destroyed [329] those shrines. They
said that if God would lend them life, they would burn all the idols
that they could find, even if they were in the king’s house. Those
idols are made of wood, and are hollow, and lack the back parts. Their
arms are open and their feet turned up under them with the legs open.
They have a large face with four huge tusks like those of the wild
boar; and are painted all over.

There are many villages in that island. Their names, those of their
inhabitants, and of their chiefs are as follows: Cinghapola, and its
chiefs, Cilaton, Ciguibucan, Cimaningha, Cimatichat, and Cicanbul; one,
Mandaui, and its chief, Apanoaan; one Lalan, and its chief, Theteu;
one, Lalutan, and its chief, Tapan; one Cilumai; and one, Lubucun.
[330] All those villages rendered obedience to us, and gave us food and
tribute. Near that island of Zubu was an island called Matan, which
formed the port where we were anchored. The name of its village was
Matan, and its chiefs were Zula and Cilapulapu. That city which we
burned was in that island and was called Bulaia.

In order that your most illustrious Lordship may know the ceremonies
that those people use in consecrating the swine, they first sound those
large gongs. [331] Then three large dishes are brought in; two with
roses and with cakes of rice and millet, baked and wrapped in leaves,
and roast fish; the other with cloth of Cambaia [332] and two standards
made of palm-tree cloth. One bit of cloth of Cambaia is spread on the
ground. Then two very old women come, each of whom has a bamboo trumpet
in her hand. When they have stepped upon the cloth they make obeisance
to the sun. Then they wrap the cloths about themselves. One of them
puts a kerchief with two horns on her forehead, and takes another
kerchief in her hands, and dancing and blowing upon her trumpet, she
thereby calls out to the sun. The other takes one of the standards and
dances and blows on her trumpet. They dance and call out thus for a
little space, saying many things between themselves to the sun. She
with the kerchief takes the other standard, and lets the kerchief drop,
and both blowing on their trumpets for a long time, dance about the
bound hog. She with the horns always speaks covertly to the sun, and
the other answers her. A cup of wine is presented to her of the horns,
and she dancing and repeating certain words, while the other answers
her, and making pretense four or five times of drinking the wine,
sprinkles it upon the heart of the hog. Then she immediately begins to
dance again. A lance is given to the same woman. She shaking it and
repeating certain words, while both of them continue to dance, and
making motions four or five times of thrusting the lance through the
heart of the hog, with a sudden and quick stroke, thrusts it through
from one side to the other. The wound is quickly stopped [333] with
grass. The one who has killed the hog, taking in her mouth a lighted
torch, which has been lighted throughout that ceremony, extinguishes
it. [334] The other one dipping the end of her trumpet in the blood of
the hog, goes around marking with blood with her finger first the
foreheads of their husbands, and then the others; but they never came
to us. Then they divest themselves and go to eat the contents of those
dishes, and they invite only women [to eat with them]. The hair is
removed from the hog by means of fire. Thus no one but old women
consecrate the flesh of the hog, and they do not eat it unless it is
killed in this way. [335]

Those people go naked, wearing but one piece of palm-tree cloth about
[336] their privies. The males, large and small, have their penis
pierced from one side to the other near the head, with a gold or tin
bolt as large as a goose quill. In both ends of the same bolt, some
have what resembles a spur, with points upon the ends; others are like
the head of a cart nail. I very often asked many, both old and young,
to see their penis, because I could not credit it. In the middle of the
bolt is a hole, through which they urinate. The bolt and the spurs
always hold firm. They say that their women wish it so, and that if
they did otherwise they would not have communication with them. When
the men wish to have communication with their women, the latter
themselves take the penis not in the regular way and commence very
gently to introduce it [into their vagina], with the spur on top first,
and then the other part. When it is inside it takes its regular
position; and thus the penis always stays inside until it gets soft,
for otherwise they could not pull it out. Those people make use of that
device because they are of a weak nature. They have as many wives as
they wish, but one of them is the principal wife. [337] Whenever any of
our men went ashore, both by day and by night, every one invited him to
eat and to drink. Their viands are half cooked and very salty. They
drink frequently and copiously from the jars [338] through those small
reeds, and one of their meals lasts for five or six hours. The women
loved us very much more than their own men. All of the women from the
age of six years and upward, have their vaginas [natura] gradually
opened because of the men’s penises. [339]

They practice the following ceremonies when one of their chiefs dies.
First all the chief [340] women of the place go to the house of the
deceased. The deceased is placed in the middle of the house in a box.
Ropes are placed about the box in the manner of a palisade, to which
many branches of trees are attached. In the middle of each branch hangs
a cotton cloth like a curtained canopy. The most principal women sit
under those hangings, and are all covered with white cotton cloth, each
one by a girl who fans her with a palm-leaf fan. The other women sit
about the room sadly. [341] Then there is one woman who cuts off the
hair of the deceased very slowly with a knife. Another who was the
principal wife of the deceased, lies down upon him, and places her
mouth, her hands, and her feet upon those of the deceased. When the
former is cutting off the hair, the latter weeps; and when the former
finishes the cutting, the latter sings. There are many porcelain jars
containing fire about the room, and myrrh, storax, and bezoin, which
make a strong odor through the house, are put on the fire. They keep
the body in the house for five or six days during those ceremonies. I
believe that the body is anointed with camphor. Then they bury the body
and the same box which is shut in a log by means of wooden nails and
covered and enclosed by logs of wood. [342] Every night about midnight
in that city, a jet black bird as large as a crow was wont to come, and
no sooner had it thus reached the houses than it began to screech, so
that all the dogs began to howl; and that screeching and howling would
last for four or five hours, [343] but those people would never tell us
the reason of it.

On Friday, April twenty-six, Zula, a chief of the island of Matan,
[344] sent one of his sons to present two goats to the captain-general,
and to say that he would send him all that he had promised, but that he
had not been able to send it to him because of the other chief
Cilapulapu, who refused to obey the king of Spagnia. He requested the
captain to send him only one boatload of men on the next night, so that
they might help him and fight against the other chief. The
captain-general decided to go thither with three boatloads. We begged
him repeatedly not to go, but he, like a good shepherd, refused to
abandon his flock. At midnight, sixty men of us set out armed with
corselets and helmets, together with the Christian king, the prince,
some of the chief men, and twenty or thirty balanguais. We reached
Matan three hours before dawn. The captain did not wish to fight then,
but sent a message to the natives by the Moro to the effect that if
they would obey the king of Spagnia, recognize the Christian king as
their sovereign, and pay us our tribute, he would be their friend; but
that if they wished otherwise, they should wait to see how our lances
wounded. [345] They replied that if we had lances they had lances of
bamboo and stakes hardened with fire. [They asked us] not to proceed to
attack them at once, but to wait until morning, so that they might have
more men. They said that in order to induce us to go in search of them;
for they had dug certain pitholes between the houses in order that we
might fall into them. When morning came forty-nine of us leaped into
the water up to our thighs, and walked through water for more than two
crossbow flights before we could reach the shore. The boats could not
approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water. The other eleven
men remained behind to guard the boats. When we reached land, those men
had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand
five hundred persons. When they saw us, they charged down upon us with
exceeding loud cries, two divisions on our flanks and the other on our
front. When the captain saw that, he formed us into two divisions, and
thus did we begin to fight. The musketeers and crossbowmen shot from a
distance for about a half-hour, but uselessly; for the shots only
passed through the shields which were made of thin wood and the arms
[of the bearers]. The captain cried to them, “Cease firing! cease
firing!” but his order was not at all heeded. When the natives saw
that we were shooting our muskets to no purpose, crying out they
determined to stand firm, but they redoubled their shouts. When our
muskets were discharged, the natives would never stand still, but
leaped hither and thither, covering themselves with their shields. They
shot so many arrows at us and hurled so many bamboo spears (some of
them tipped with iron) at the captain-general, besides pointed stakes
hardened with fire, stones, and mud, that we could scarcely defend
ourselves. Seeing that the captain-general sent some men to burn their
houses in order to terrify them. When they saw their houses burning,
they were roused to greater fury. Two of our men were killed near the
houses, while we burned twenty or thirty houses. So many of them
charged down upon us that they shot the captain through the right leg
with a poisoned arrow. On that account, he ordered us to retire slowly,
but the men took to flight, except six or eight of us who remained with
the captain. The natives shot only at our legs, for the latter were
bare; and so many were the spears and stones that they hurled at us,
that we could offer no resistance. The mortars in the boats could not
aid us as they were too far away. So we continued to retire for more
than a good crossbow flight from the shore always fighting up to our
knees in the water. The natives continued to pursue us, and picking up
the same spear four or six times, hurled it at us again and again.
Recognizing the captain, so many turned upon him that they knocked his
helmet off his head twice, but he always stood firmly like a good
knight, together with some others. Thus did we fight for more than one
hour, refusing to retire farther. An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into
the captain’s face, but the latter immediately killed him with his
lance, which he left in the Indian’s body. Then, trying to lay hand
on sword, he could draw it out but halfway, because he had been wounded
in the arm with a bamboo spear. When the natives saw that, they all
hurled themselves upon him. One of them wounded him on the left leg
with a large cutlass, [346] which resembles a scimitar, only being
larger. That caused the captain to fall face downward, when immediately
they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their
cutlasses, until they killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and
our true guide. When they wounded him, he turned back many times to see
whether we were all in the boats. Thereupon, beholding him dead, we,
wounded, retreated, as best we could, to the boats, which were already
pulling off. The Christian king would have aided us, but the captain
charged him before we landed, not to leave his balanghai, but to stay
to see how we fought. When the king learned that the captain was dead,
he wept. Had it not been for that unfortunate captain, not a single one
of us would have been saved in the boats, for while he was fighting the
others retired to the boats. I hope through [the efforts of] your most
illustrious Lordship that the fame of so noble a captain will not
become effaced in our times. Among the other virtues which he
possessed, he was more constant than ever any one else in the greatest
of adversity. He endured hunger better than all the others, and more
accurately than any man in the world did he understand sea charts [347]
and navigation. And that this was the truth was seen openly, for no
other had had so much natural talent nor the boldness to learn how to
circumnavigate the world, as he had almost done. That battle was fought
on Saturday, April twenty-seven, 1521. [348] The captain desired to
fight on Saturday, because it was the day especially holy to him. Eight
of our men were killed with him in that battle, [349] and four Indians,
who had become Christians and who had come afterward to aid us were
killed by the mortars of the boats. Of the enemy, only fifteen were
killed, while many of us were wounded.

In the afternoon the Christian king sent a message with our consent to
the people of Matan, to the effect that if they would give us the
captain and the other men who had been killed, we would give them as
much merchandise as they wished. They answered that they would not give
up such a man, as we imagined [they would do], and that they would not
give him for all the riches in the world, but that they intended to
keep him as a memorial. [350]

On Saturday, the day on which the captain was killed, the four men who
had remained in the city to trade, had our merchandise carried to the
ships. Then we chose two commanders, namely, Duarte Barboza, [351] a
Portuguese and a relative of the captain, and Johan Seranno, a
Spaniard. [352] As our interpreter, Henrich by name, was wounded
slightly, he would not go ashore any more to attend to our necessary
affairs, but always kept his bed. On that account, Duarte Barboza, the
commander of the flagship, cried out to him and told him, that although
his master, the captain, was dead, he was not therefore free; on the
contrary he [i.e., Barboza] would see to it that when we should reach
Espagnia, he should still be the slave of Doña Beatrice, the wife of
the captain-general. [353] And threatening the slave that if he did go
ashore, he would be flogged, the latter arose, and, feigning to take no
heed to those words, went ashore to tell the Christian king [354] that
we were about to leave very soon, but that if he would follow his
advice, he could gain the ships and all our merchandise. Accordingly
they arranged a plot, and the slave returned to the ship, where he
showed that he was more cunning [355] than before.

On Wednesday morning, the first of May, the Christian king sent word to
the commanders that the jewels [356] which he had promised to send to
the king of Spagnia were ready, and that he begged them and their other
companions to come to dine with him that morning, when he would give
them the jewels. Twenty-four men went ashore, among whom was our
astrologer, San Martín de Sivilla. I could not go because I was all
swollen up by a wound from a poisoned arrow which I had received in my
face. Jovan Carvaio and the constable [357] returned, and told us that
they saw the man who had been cured by a miracle take the priest to his
house. [358] Consequently, they had left that place, because they
suspected some evil. Scarcely had they spoken those words when we heard
loud cries and lamentations. We immediately weighed anchor and
discharging many mortars into the houses, drew in nearer to the shore.
While thus discharging [our pieces] we saw Johan Seranno in his shirt
bound and wounded, crying to us not to fire any more, for the natives
would kill him. [359] We asked him whether all the others and the
interpreter were dead. He said that they were all dead except the
interpreter. He begged us earnestly to redeem him with some of the
merchandise; but Johan Carvaio, his boon companion, [and others] would
not allow the boat to go ashore so that they might remain masters of
the ships. [360] But although Johan Serrano weeping asked us not to set
sail so quickly, for they would kill him, and said that he prayed God
to ask his soul of Johan Carvaio, his comrade, in the day of judgment,
we immediately departed. I do not know whether he is dead or alive.
[361]

In that island are found dogs, cats, rice, millet, panicum, sorgo,
ginger, figs [i.e., bananas], oranges, lemons, sugarcane, garlic,
honey, cocoanuts, nangcas, [362] gourds, flesh of many kinds, palm
wine, and gold. [363] It is a large island, and has a good port with
two entrances—one to the west and the other to the east northeast.
[364] It lies in x degrees [365] of latitude toward the Arctic Pole,
and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-four [366] degrees from the
line of demarcation. Its name is Zubu. We heard of Malucho there before
the death of the captain-general. Those people play a violin with
copper strings.

In the midst of that archipelago, [377] at a distance of eighteen
leguas from that island of Zzubu, at the head of the other island
called Bohol, we burned the ship “Conceptione,” for too few men of
us were left [to work it]. [378] We stowed the best of its contents in
the other two ships, and the laid our course toward the south
southwest, coasting along the island called Panilongon, [379] where
black men like those in Etiopia live. Then we came to a large island
[Mindanao], whose king in order to make peace with us, drew blood from
his left hand marking his body, face, and the tip of his tongue with it
as a token of the closest friendship, and we did the same. I went
ashore alone with the king in order to see that island. We had no
sooner entered a river than many fishermen offered fish to the king.
Then the king removed the cloths which covered his privies, as did some
of his chiefs; and began to row while singing past many dwellings which
were upon the river. Two hours after nightfall we reached the king’s
house. The distance from the beginning of the river where our ships
were to the king’s house, was two leguas. When we entered the house,
we came upon many torches of cane and palm leaves, [380] which were of
the anime, of which mention was made above. Until the supper was
brought in, the king with two of his chiefs and two of his beautiful
women drank the contents of a large jar of palm wine without eating
anything. I, excusing myself as I had supped, would only drink but
once. In drinking they observed all the same ceremonies that the king
of Mazaua did. Then the supper, which consisted of rice and very salt
[381] fish, and was contained in porcelain dishes, was brought in. They
ate their rice as if it were bread, and cook it after the following
manner. They first put in an earthen jar like our jars, a large leaf
which lines all of the jar. Then they add the water and the rice, and
after covering it allow it to boil until the rice becomes as hard as
bread, when it is taken out in pieces. Rice is cooked in the same way
throughout those districts. [382] When we had eaten, the king had a
reed mat and another of palm leaves, and a leaf pillow brought in so
that I might sleep on them. The king and his two women went to sleep in
a separate place, while I slept with one of his chiefs. [383] When day
came and until the dinner was brought in, I walked about that island. I
saw many articles of gold in those houses [384] but little food. After
that we dined on rice and fish, and at the conclusion of dinner, I
asked the king by signs whether I could see the queen. He replied that
he was willing, and we went together to the summit of a lofty hill,
where the queen’s house was located. When I entered the house, I made
a bow to the queen, and she did the same to me, whereupon I sat down
beside her. She was making a sleeping mat of palm leaves. In the house
there was hanging a number of porcelain jars and four metal gongs—one
of which was larger than the second, while the other two were still
smaller—for playing upon. There were many male and female slaves who
served her. Those houses are constructed like those already mentioned.
Having taken our leave, we returned to the king’s house, where the
king had us immediately served with refreshments of sugarcane. The most
abundant product of that island is gold. They showed me certain large
valleys, [385] making me a sign that the gold there was as abundant as
the hairs of their heads, but they have no iron with which to dig it,
and they do not dare to go to the trouble [to get it]. [386] That part
of the island belongs to the same land as Butuan and Calaghan, and lies
toward Bohol, and is bounded by Mazaua. As we shall return to that
island again, I shall say nothing further [now]. The afternoon having
waned, I desired to return to the ships. The king and the other chief
men wished to accompany me, and therefore we went in the same
balanghai. [387] As we were returning along the river, I saw, on the
summit of a hill at the right, three men suspended from one tree, the
branches of which had been cut away. I asked the king what was the
reason for that, and he replied that they were malefactors and robbers.
Those people go naked as do the others above mentioned. The king’s
name is Raia Calanao. [388] The harbor is an excellent one. Rice,
ginger, swine, goats, fowls, and other things are to be found there.
That port lies in a latitude of eight degrees toward the Arctic Pole,
and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-seven degrees [389] from
the line of demarcation. It is fifty leguas from Zubu, and is called
Chipit. [390] Two days’ journey thence to the northwest is found a
large island called Lozon, [391] where six or eight junks belonging to
the Lequian people go yearly. [392]

Leaving there and laying our course west southwest, we cast anchor at
an island not very large and almost uninhabited. The people of that
island are Moros and were banished from an island called Burne. They go
naked as do the others. They have blowpipes and small quivers at their
side, full of arrows and a poisonous herb. They have daggers whose
hafts are adorned with gold and precious gems, spears, bucklers, and
small cuirasses of buffalo horn. [393] They called us holy beings.
Little food was to be found in that island, but [there were] immense
trees. It lies in a latitude of seven and one-half degrees toward the
Arctic Pole, and is forty-three leguas [394] from Chippit. Its name is
Caghaian. [395]

About twenty-five leguas to the west northwest from the above island we
found a large island, where rice, ginger, swine, goats, fowls, figs
one-half braza long and as thick as the arm [i.e., bananas] (they are
excellent; and certain others are one palmo and less in length, and are
much better than all the others), cocoanuts, camotes [batate],
sugarcane, and roots resembling turnips in taste, are found. Rice is
cooked there under the fire in bamboos or in wood; and it lasts better
than that cooked in earthen pots. We called that land the land of
promise, because we suffered great hunger before we found it. We were
often on the point of abandoning the ships and going ashore in order
that we might not die of hunger. [396] The king made peace with us by
gashing himself slightly in the breast with one of our knives, and upon
bleeding, touching the tip of his tongue and his forehead in token of
the truest peace, and we did the same. That island lies in a latitude
of nine and one-third degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and a longitude
of one hundred and seventy-one and one-third [397] degrees from the
line of demarcation. [It is called] Pulaoan. [398]

Those people of Polaoan go naked as do the others. Almost all [399] of
them cultivate their fields. They have blowpipes with thick wooden
arrows more than one palmo long, with harpoon points, and others tipped
with fishbones, and poisoned with an herb; while others are tipped with
points of bamboo like harpoons and are poisoned. [400] At the end of
the arrow they attach a little piece of soft wood, instead of feathers.
At the end of their blowpipes they fasten a bit of iron like a spear
head; [401] and when they have shot all their arrows they fight with
that. They place a value on brass rings and chains, bells, knives, and
still more on copper wire for binding their fishhooks. They have large
and very tame cocks, which they do not eat because of a certain
veneration that they have for them. Sometimes they make them fight with
one another, and each one puts up a certain amount on his cock, and the
prize goes to him whose cock is the victor. They have distilled rice
wine which is stronger and better than that made from the palm. [402]

Ten leguas southwest of that island, we came to an island, which, as we
coasted by, seemed to us to be going upward. After entering the port,
the holy body [i.e., St. Elmo’s fire] appeared to us through the
pitchy darkness. There is a distance of fifty leguas [403] from the
beginning of that island to the port. On the following day, July nine,
the king of that island sent a very beautiful prau to us, whose bow and
stern were worked in gold. At the bow flew a white and blue banner
surmounted with peacock feathers. Some men were playing on musical
instruments [cinphonie] and drums. Two almadies [404] came with that
prau. Praus resemble fustas, while the almadies are their small fishing
boats. Eight old men, who were chiefs, entered the ships and took seats
in the stern upon a carpet. They presented us with a painted wooden jar
full of betel and areca (the fruit which they chew continually), and
jessamine [405] and orange blossoms, a covering of yellow silk cloth,
two cages full of fowls, a couple of goats, three jarsful of distilled
rice wine, and some bundles of sugarcane. They did the same to the
other ship, and embracing us took their leave. The rice wine is as
clear as water, but so strong that it intoxicated many of our men. It
is called arach [i.e., arrack].

Six days later the king again sent three praus with great pomp, which
encircled the ships with musical instruments [cinphonie] playing and
drums and brass gongs beating. They saluted us with their peculiar
cloth caps which cover only the top of their heads. We saluted them by
firing our mortars without [loading with] stones. Then they gave us a
present of various kinds of food, made only of rice. Some were wrapped
in leaves and were made in somewhat longish pieces, some resembled
sugar-loaves, while others were made in the manner of tarts with eggs
and honey. They told us that their king was willing to let us get water
and wood, and to trade at our pleasure. Upon hearing that seven [406]
of us entered their prau bearing a present to their king, which
consisted of a green velvet robe made in the Turkish manner, a violet
velvet chair, five brazas of red cloth, a cap, [407] a gilded drinking
glass, a covered glass vase, three writing-books of paper, and a gilded
writing-case. To the queen [we took] three brazas of [red: crossed out
in original MS.] yellow cloth, a pair of silvered shoes, and a silvered
needle-case full of needles. [We took] three brazas of red cloth, a
cap, and a gilded drinking-glass to the governor. To the herald who
came in the prau we gave a robe of red and green cloth, made in the
Turkish fashion, a cap, and a writing book of paper; and to the other
seven chief men, to one a bit of cloth, and to another a cap, and to
all of them a writing book of paper. Then we immediately departed [for
the land].

When we reached the city, we remained about two hours in the prau,
until the arrival of two elephants with silk trappings, and twelve men
each of whom carried a porcelain jar covered with silk in which to
carry our presents. Thereupon, we mounted the elephants while those
twelve men preceded us afoot with the presents in the jars. In this way
we went to the house of the governor, where we were given a supper of
many kinds of food. During the night we slept on cotton mattresses,
[408] whose lining was of taffeta, and the sheets of Cambaia. Next day
we stayed in the house until noon. Then we went to the king’s palace
upon elephants, with our presents in front as on the preceding day. All
the streets from the governor’s to the king’s house were full of
men with swords, spears, and shields, for such were the king’s
orders. We entered the courtyard of the palace mounted on the
elephants. We went up a ladder accompanied by the governor and other
chiefs, and entered a large hall full of many nobles, [409] where we
sat down upon a carpet with the presents in the jars near us. At the
end of that hall there is another hall higher but somewhat smaller. It
was all adorned with silk hangings, and two windows, through which
light entered the hall and hung with two brocade curtains, opened from
it. There were three hundred footsoldiers with naked rapiers at their
thighs in that hall to guard the king. [410] At the end of the small
hall was a large window from which a brocade curtain was drawn aside so
that we could see within it the king seated at a table with one of his
young sons chewing betel. [411] No one but women were behind him. Then
a chief told us that we could not speak to the king, and that if we
wished anything, we were to tell it to him, so that he could
communicate it to one of higher rank. The latter would communicate it
to a brother of the governor who was stationed in the smaller hall, and
this man would communicate it by means of a speaking-tube through a
hole in the wall to one who was inside with the king. The chief taught
us the manner of making three obeisances to the king with our hands
clasped above the head, raising first one foot and then the other and
then kissing the hands toward him, and we did so, that being the method
of the royal obeisance. We told the king that we came from the king of
Spagnia, and that the latter desired to make peace with him and asked
only for permission to trade. The king had us told that since the king
of Spagnia desired to be his friend, he was very willing to be his, and
said that we could take water and wood, and trade at our pleasure. Then
we gave him the presents, on receiving each of which he nodded
slightly. To each one of us was given some brocaded and gold cloth and
silk, which were placed upon our left shoulders, where they were left
but a moment. [412] They presented us with refreshments of cloves and
cinnamon, after which the curtains were drawn to and the windows
closed. The men in the palace were all attired in cloth of gold and
silk which covered their privies, and carried daggers with gold hafts
adorned with pearls and precious gems, and they had many rings on their
hands. We returned upon the elephants to the governor’s house, seven
men carrying the king’s presents to us and always preceding us. When
we reached the house, they gave each one of us his present, placing
them upon our left shoulders. We gave each of those men a couple of
knives for his trouble. Nine men came to the governor’s house with a
like number of large wooden trays from the king. Each tray contained
ten or twelve porcelain dishes full of veal, capons, chickens,
peacocks, and other animals, and fish. We supped on the ground upon a
palm mat from thirty or thirty-two different kinds of meat besides the
fish and other things. At each mouthful of food we drank a small cupful
of their distilled wine from a porcelain cup the size of an egg. We ate
rice and other sweet food with gold spoons like ours. In our sleeping
quarters there during those two nights, two torches of white wax were
kept constantly alight in two rather tall silver candlesticks, and two
large lamps full of oil with four wicks apiece and two men to snuff
them continually. We went elephant-back to the seashore, where we found
two praus which took us back to the ships. That city [413] is entirely
built in salt water, except the houses of the king and certain chiefs.
It contains twenty-five thousand fires [i.e., families]. [414] The
houses are all constructed of wood and built up from the ground on tall
pillars. When the tide is high the women go in boats through the
settlement [tera] selling the articles necessary to maintain life.
There is a large brick wall in front of the king’s house with towers
like a fort, in which were mounted fifty-six bronze [metalo] pieces,
and six of iron. During the two days of our stay there, many pieces
were discharged. That king is a Moro and his name is Raia Siripada. He
was forty years old and corpulent. No one serves him except women who
are the daughters [415] of chiefs. He never goes outside of his palace,
unless when he goes hunting, and no one is allowed to talk with him
except through the speaking tube. He has x scribes, called Xiritoles,
[416] who write down his deeds on very thin tree bark.

On Monday morning, July twenty-nine, we saw more than one hundred praus
divided into three squadrons and a like number of tunguli  [417] (which
are their small boats) coming toward us. Upon catching sight of them,
imagining that there was some trickery afoot, we hoisted our sails as
quickly as possible, abandoning an anchor in our haste. We expected
especially that we were to be captured in between certain junks which
had anchored behind us on the preceding day. We immediately turned upon
the latter, capturing four of them and killing many persons. Three or
four of the junks sought flight by beaching. In one of the junks which
we captured was the son of the king of the island of Lozon. He was the
captain-general of the king of Burne, and came with those junks from a
large city named Laoe, [418] which is located at the end of that island
[i.e., Borneo] toward Java Major. He had destroyed and sacked that city
because it refused to obey the king [of Burne], but the king of Java
Major instead. Giovan Carvaio, our pilot, allowed that captain and the
junks to go without our consent, for a certain sum of gold, as we
learned afterward. Had the pilot not given up the captain to the king,
the latter would have given us whatever we had asked, for that captain
was exceedingly feared throughout those regions, especially by the
heathens, as the latter are very hostile to that Moro king. In that
same port there is another city inhabited by heathens, which is larger
than that of the Moros, and built like the latter in salt water. On
that account the two peoples have daily combats together in that same
harbor. The heathen king is as powerful as the Moro king, but is not so
haughty, and could be converted easily to the Christian faith. When the
Moro king heard how we had treated the junks, he sent us a message by
one of our men who was ashore to the effect that the praus were not
coming to do us any harm, but that they were going to attack the
heathens. As a proof of that statement, the Moros showed him some heads
of men who had been killed, which they declared to be the heads of
heathens. We sent a message to the king, asking him to please allow two
of our men who were in the city for purposes of trade and the son of
Johan Carvaio, who had been born in the country of Verzin, to come to
us, but the king refused. That was the consequences of Johan Carvaio
letting the above captain go. We kept sixteen of the chiefest men [of
the captured junks] to take them to Spagnia, and three women in the
queen’s name, but Johan Carvaio usurped the latter for himself. [419]

Junks are their ships and are made in the following manner. The bottom
part is built about two palmos above the water and is of planks
fastened with wooden pegs, which are very well made; above that they
are entirely made of very large bamboos. They have a bamboo as a
counterweight. One of those junks carries as much cargo as a ship.
Their masts are of bamboo, and the sails of the bark of trees. [420]
Their porcelain is a sort of exceedingly white earth which is left for
fifty years under the earth before it is worked, for otherwise it would
not be fine. The father buries it for the son. If [poison] is placed in
a dish made of fine porcelain, the dish immediately breaks. [421] The
money made by the Moros in those regions is of bronze [metalo] pierced
in the middle in order that it may be strung. On only one side of it
are four characters, which are letters of the great king of Chiina. We
call that money picis. [422] They gave us six porcelain dishes for one
cathil [423] (which is equivalent to two of our libras) of quicksilver;
one hundred picis for one book of writing paper; one small porcelain
vase for one hundred and sixty cathils of bronze [metalo]; one
porcelain vase for three knives; one bahar (which is equivalent to two
hundred and three cathils), of wax for 160 cathils of bronze [metalo];
one bahar of salt for eighty cathils of bronze [metalo]; one bahar of
anime to calk the ships (for no pitch is found in those regions) for
forty cathils of bronze [metalo]. [424] Twenty tahils make one cathil.
At that place the people highly esteem bronze [metalo], quicksilver,
glass, cinnabar, [425] wool cloth, linens, and all our other
merchandise, although iron and spectacles [426] more than all the rest.
Those Moros go naked as do the other peoples [of those regions]. They
drink quicksilver—the sick man drinks it to cleanse himself, and the
well man to preserve his health.

The king of Burne has two pearls as large as two hen’s eggs. They are
so round that they will not stand still on a table. I know that for a
fact, for when we carried the king’s presents to him, signs were made
for him to show them to us, but he said that he would show them next
day. Afterward some chiefs said that they had seen them.

Those Moros worship Mahomet. The latter’s law orders them not to eat
pork; as they wash the buttocks with the left hand, not to use that
hand in eating; [427] not to cut anything with the right hand; to sit
down to urinate; not to kill fowls or goats without first addressing
the sun; to cut off the tops of the wings with the little bits of skin
that stick up from under and the feet of fowls; then to split them in
twain; to wash the face with the right hand, but not to cleanse the
teeth with the fingers; and not to eat anything that has been killed
unless it be by themselves. [428] They are circumcised like the Jews.

Camphor, a kind of balsam, is produced in that island. It exudes
between the wood and the bark, and the drops are as small as [grains
of] wheat bran. [429] If it is exposed it gradually evaporates
[literally: becomes nothing]. Those people call it capor. Cinnamon,
ginger, mirabolans, oranges, lemons, nangcas, watermelons, cucumbers,
gourds, turnips, cabbages, scallions, cows, buffaloes, swine, goats,
chickens, geese, deer, elephants, horses, and other things are found
there. [430] That island is so large that it takes three months to sail
round it in a prau. It lies in a latitude of five and one-fourth
degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and
seventy-six and two-thirds degrees from the line of demarcation, and
its name is Burne. [431]

Leaving that island, we turned back in order to find a suitable place
to calk the ships, for they were leaking. One ship ran on to some
shoals of an island called Bibalon, [432] because of the carelessness
of its pilot, but by the help of God we freed it. A sailor of that ship
incautiously snuffed a candle into a barrel full of gunpowder, but he
quickly snatched it out without any harm. [433] Then pursuing our
course, we captured a prau laden with cocoanuts on its way to Burne.
Its crew sought refuge on an islet, until we captured it. [434] Three
other praus escaped behind certain islets.

At the head of Burne between it and an island called Cimbonbon, which
lies in [a latitude of] eight degrees and seven minutes, [435] is a
perfect port for repairing ships. Consequently, we entered it; but as
we lacked many things for repairing the ships, we delayed there for
forty-two days. During that time, each one of us labored hard, one at
one thing and one at another. Our greatest fatigue however was to go
barefoot to the woods for wood. In that island there are wild boars, of
which we killed one which was going by water from one island to another
[by pursuing it] with the small boat. Its head was two and one-half
palmos long, [436] and its teeth were large. There are found large
crocodiles, both on land and sea, oysters and shellfish of various
kinds. Among the last named we found two, the flesh of one of which
weighed twenty-six libras, and the other forty-four. [437] We caught a
fish, which had a head like that of a hog and two horns. Its body
consisted entirely of one bone, and on its back it resembled a saddle;
and it was small. [438] Trees are also found there which produce leaves
which are alive when they fall, and walk. Those leaves are quite like
those of the mulberry, but are not so long. On both sides near the
stem, which is short and pointed, they have two feet. They have no
blood, but if one touches [439] them they run away. I kept one of them
for nine days in a box. When I opened the box, that leaf went round and
round it. [440] I believe those leaves live on nothing but air.

Having left that island, [441] that is, the port, we met at the head of
the island of Pulaoan a junk which was coming from Burne, on which was
the governor of Pulaoan. We made them a signal to haul in their sails,
and as they refused to haul them in, we captured the junk by force, and
sacked it. [We told] the governor [that] if [he] wished his freedom, he
was to give us, inside of seven days, four hundred measures of rice,
twenty swine, twenty goats, and one hundred and fifty fowls. After that
he presented us with cocoanuts, figs [i.e., bananas], sugarcanes, jars
full of palm wine, and other things. Seeing his liberality, we returned
some of his daggers and arquebuses to him, giving him in addition, a
flag, a yellow damask robe, and xv brazas of cloth; to his son, a cloak
of blue cloth; to a brother of the governor, a robe of green cloth and
other things; and we parted from them as friends. We turned our course
back between the island of Cagaian and the port of Cippit, and laid our
course east by south in order that we might find the islands of
Malucho. We passed by certain reefs [literally: small elevations] near
which we found the sea to be full of grass, although the depth was very
great. When we passed through them, it seemed as though we were
entering another sea. Leaving Chipit to the east, we found two island,
Zolo and Taghima, [442] which lie toward the west, and near which
pearls are found. [443] The two pearls of the king of Burne were found
there, and the king got them, as was told us, in the following manner.
That king took to wife a daughter of the king of Zolo, who told him
that her father had those two pearls. The king determined to get
possession of them by hook or by crook. Going one night with five
hundred praus, [444] he captured the king and two of his sons, and took
them to Burne with him. [He told] the king of Zolo that if he wished
freedom, he must surrender the two pearls to him.

Then we laid our course east by north between two settlements called
Cauit and Subanin, and an inhabited island called Monoripa, located x
leguas from the reefs. [445] The people of that island make their
dwellings in boats and do not live otherwise. In those two settlements
of Cavit and Subanin, which are located in the island of Butuan and
Calaghan, is found the best cinnamon that grows. Had we stayed there
two days, those people would have laden our ships for us, but as we had
a wind favorable for passing a point and certain islets which were near
that island, we did not wish to delay. While under sail we bartered two
large knives which we had taken from the governor of Pulaoan for
seventeen libras [of cinnamon]. The cinnamon tree grows to a height of
three or four cubits, and as thick as the fingers of the hand. It has
but three or four small branches and its leaves resemble those of the
laurel. Its bark is the cinnamon, and it is gathered twice per year.
The wood and leaves are as strong as the cinnamon when they are green.
Those people call it caiu mana. Caiu means wood, and mana, sweet,
hence, “sweet wood.” [446]

Laying our course toward the northeast, and going to a large city
called Maingdanao, which is located in the island of Butuan and
Calaghan, so that we might gather information concerning Maluco, we
captured by force a bigniday, [447] a vessel resembling a prau, and
killed seven men. It contained only eighteen men, and they were as well
built as any whom we had seen in those regions. [448] All were chiefs
of Maingdanao, among them being one who told us that he was a brother
of the king of Maingdanao, and that he knew the location of Malucho.
Through his directions we discontinued our course toward the northeast,
and took that toward the southeast. At a cape of that island of Butuan
and Caleghan, and near a river, are found shaggy men who are
exceedingly great fighters and archers. They use swords one palmo in
length, and eat only raw human hearts with the juice of oranges or
lemons. [449] Those shaggy people are called Benaian. When we took our
course toward the southeast, we lay in a latitude of six degrees and
seven minutes toward the Arctic Pole, and thirty [450] leguas from
Cavit. [451]

Sailing toward the southeast, we found four islands, [namely], Ciboco,
Biraham Batolach, [452] Sarangani, and Candighar. [453] One Saturday
night, October twenty-six, while coasting by Birahan Batolach, we
encountered a most furious storm. Thereupon, praying God, we lowered
all the sails. Immediately our three saints appeared to us and
dissipated all the darkness. [454] St. Elmo remained for more than two
hours on the maintop, like a torch; St. Nicholas on the mizzentop; and
St. Clara on the foretop. We promised a slave to St. Elmo, St.
Nicholas, and St. Clara, and gave alms to each one. Then continuing our
voyage, we entered a harbor between the two islands of Saranghani and
Candighar, and anchored to the eastward near a settlement of Sarangani,
where gold and pearls are found. Those people are heathens and go naked
as do the others. That harbor lies in a latitude of five degrees nine
minutes, and is fifty leguas from Cavit.

Remaining one day in that harbor, we captured two pilots by force, in
order that they might show us where Malucho lay. [455] Then laying our
course south southwest, we passed among eight inhabited and desert
islands, which were situated in the manner of a street. Their names are
Cheaua, Cauiao, Cabiao, Camanuca, Cabaluzao, Cheai, Lipan, and Nuza.
[456] Finally we came to an island at their end, which was very
beautiful to look at. As we had a contrary wind, so that we could not
double a point of that island, we sailed hither and thither near it.
Consequently, one of the men whom we had captured at Saranghai, and the
brother of the king of Maingdanao who took with him his small son,
escaped during the night by swimming to that island. But the boy was
drowned, for he was unable to hold tightly to his father’s shoulder.
Being unable to double the said point, we passed below the island where
there were many islets. That island has four kings, [namely], Raia
Matandatu, Raia Lalagha, Raía Bapti, and Raia Parabu. The people are
heathens. The island lies in a latitude of three and one-half degrees
toward the Arctic Pole and is 27 leguas from Saranghany. Its name is
Sanghir. [457]

Continuing the same course, we passed near six islands, [namely],
Cheama, Carachita, Para, Zanghalura, Ciau (which is ten leguas from
Sanghir, and has a high but not large mountain, and whose king is
called Raia Ponto), and Paghinzara. [458] The latter is located eight
leguas from Ciau, and has three high mountains. The name of its king is
Raia Babintan. [459] [Then we found the island] Talaut; and we found
twelve leguas to the east of Paghinzara two islands, not very large,
but inhabited, called Zoar and Meau. [460] After passing those two
islands, on Wednesday, the sixth of November, we discovered four lofty
islands fourteen leguas east of the two [abovementioned islands]. The
pilot who still remained with us told us that those four islands were
Maluco. Therefore, we thanked God and as an expression of our joy
discharged all our artillery. It was no wonder that we were so glad,
for we had passed twenty-seven months less two days in our search for
Malucho. [461] Among all those islands [among all those islands:
doublet in original MS.], even to Malucho, the shallowest bottom that
we found was at a depth of one or two hundred brazas, notwithstanding
the assertion of the Portuguese that that region could not be navigated
because of the numerous shoals and the dark sky as they have imagined.
[462]

Three hours before sunset on Friday, November eight, 1521, [463] we
entered into a harbor of an island called Tadore, and anchoring near
the shore in twenty brazas we fired all our artillery. Next day the
king came to the ships in a prau, and circled about them once. We
immediately went to meet him with the small boat, in order to show him
honor. He made us enter his prau and seat ourselves near him. He was
seated under a silk awning which sheltered him on all sides. In front
of him was one of his sons with the royal scepter, and two persons with
two gold jars to pour water on his hands, and two others with two
gilded caskets filled with their betel. The king told us that we were
welcome there, and that he had dreamt some time ago that some ships
were coming to Malucho from remote parts; and that for more assurance
he had determined to consult the moon, [464] whereupon he had seen the
ships were coming, and that we were they. Upon the king entering our
ships all kissed his hand and then we led him to the stern. When he
entered inside there, he would not stoop, but entered from above. [465]
Causing him to sit down in a red velvet chair, we clothed him in a
yellow velvet robe made in the Turkish fashion. In order to show him
greater honor, we sat down on the ground near him. Then when all were
seated, the king began to speak and said that he and all his people
desired ever to be the most loyal friends and vassals to our king of
Spagnia. He received us as his children, and we could go ashore as if
in our own houses, for from that time thenceforth, his island was to be
called no more Tadore but Castiglia, because of the great love which he
bore to our king, his sovereign. We made him a present which consisted
of the robe, the chair, a piece of delicate linen, four brazas of
scarlet cloth, a piece of brocaded silk, a piece of yellow damask, some
Indian cloth embroidered with gold and silk, a piece of berania (the
white linen of Cambaia), two caps, six strings of glass beads, twelve
knives, three large mirrors, six pairs of scissors, six combs, some
gilded drinking-cups, [466] and other articles. To his son we gave an
Indian cloth of gold and silk, a large mirror, a cap, and two knives;
[467] and to each of nine others—all of them his chiefs—a silk
cloth, caps, and two knives; and to many others caps or knives. We kept
giving presents until the king bade us desist. After that he declared
to us that he had nothing else except his own life to send to the king
his sovereign. We were to approach nearer to the city, and whoever came
to the ships at night, we were to kill with our muskets. In leaving the
stern, the king would never bend his head. [468] When he took his leave
we discharged all the guns. That king is a Moro and about forty-five
years old. He is well built and has a royal presence, [469] and is an
excellent astrologer. At that time he was clad in a shirt of the most
delicate white stuff with the ends of the sleeves embroidered in gold,
and in a cloth that reached from his waist to the ground. He was
barefoot, and had a silk scarf wrapped about his head [his head,
doublet in original MS.], and above it a garland of flowers. His name
is Raia Sultan Manzor. [470]

On Sunday, November x, that king desired us to tell him how long it was
since we had left Spagnia, and what pay and quintalada [471] the king
gave to each of us. He requested us to give him a signature of the king
and a royal banner, for then and thenceforth, he would cause it that
his island and another called Tarenate (provided that he were able to
crown one of his [sons: crossed out in original MS.] grandsons, [472]
named Calonaghapi) would both belong to the king of Spagnia; and for
the honor of his king he was ready to fight to the death, and when he
could no longer resist, he would go to Spagnia with all his family in a
junk [473] which he was having built new, carrying the royal signature
and banner; and therefore he was the king’s servant for a long time.
He begged us to leave him some men so that he might constantly be
reminded of the king of Spagnia. He did not ask for merchandise because
the latter would not remain with him. [474] He told us that he would go
to an island called Bachian, in order sooner to furnish the ships with
cloves, for there were not enough dry cloves in his island to load the
two ships. As that day was Sunday, it was decided not to trade The
festive day of those people is our Friday.

In order that your most illustrious Lordship may know the islands where
cloves grow, they are five, [namely], Tarenatte, Tadore, Mutir,
Machian, and Bachian. Tarenate is the chief one, and when its king was
alive, he ruled nearly all the others. Tadore, the one where we were,
has a king. Mutir and Machian have no king but are ruled by the people,
and when the two kings of Tarenate and of Tadore engage in war, those
two islands furnish them with men. The last island is Bachian, and it
has a king. That entire province where cloves grow is called Malucho.
[475] At that time it was not eight months since one Francesco Seranno
[476] had died in Tarenate. [He was] a Portuguese and the
captain-general of the king of Tarenate and opposed the king of Tadore.
He did so well that he constrained the king of Tadore to give one of
his daughters to wife to the king of Tarenate, and almost all the sons
of the chiefs as hostages. The above mentioned grandson of the king of
Tadore was born to that daughter. Peace having been made between the
two kings, and when Francesco Seranno came one day to Tadore to trade
cloves, the king of Tadore had him poisoned with the said betel leaves.
He lived only four days. His king wished to have him buried according
to his law [i.e., with Mahometan rites], but three Christians who were
his servants would not consent to it. He left a son and a daughter,
both young, born by a woman whom he had taken to wife in Java Major,
and two hundred bahars of cloves. He was a close friend and a relative
of our royal captain-general, and was the cause of inciting the latter
to undertake that enterprise, for when our captain was at Malacha, he
had written to him several times that he was in Tarenate. As Don
Manuel, then king of Portugal, refused to increase our
captain-general’s pension by only a single testoon per month for his
merits, the latter went to Spagnia, where he had obtained everything
for which he could ask from his sacred Majesty. [477] Ten days after
the death of Francesco Seranno, the king of Tarenate, by name, Raya
Abuleis, having expelled his son-in-law, the king of Bachian, was
poisoned by his daughter, the wife of the latter king, under pretext of
trying to bring about peace between the two kings. The king lingered
but two days, and left nine principal sons, whose names are Chechili
Momuli, Jadore Vunighi, Chechili de Roix, Cili Manzur, Cili Pagi,
Chialin, Chechilin Cathara, Vaiechu Serich, and Calano Ghapi. [478]

On Monday, November xi, one of the sons of the king of Tarenate, [to
wit], Chechili de Roix, came to the ships clad in red velvet. He had
two praus and his men were playing upon the abovementioned gongs. He
refused to enter the ship at that time. He had [charge of] the wife and
children, and the other possessions of Francesco Seranno. When we found
out who he was, we sent a message to the king, asking him whether we
should receive Chechili de Roix, since we were in his port, and he
replied to us that we could do as we pleased. But the son of the king,
seeing that we were hesitating, moved off somewhat from the ships. We
went to him with the boat in order to present him an Indian cloth of
gold and silk, and some knives, mirrors, and scissors. He accepted them
somewhat haughtily, and immediately departed. He had a Christian Indian
with him named Manuel, the servant of one Petro Alfonso de Lorosa,
[479] a Portuguese who went from Bandan to Tarenate, after the death of
Francesco Seranno. As the servant knew how to talk Portuguese, he came
aboard our ship, and told us that, although the sons of the king of
Tarenate were at enmity with the king of Tadore, yet they were always
at the service of the king of Spagnia. We [480] sent a letter to Pietro
Alfonso de Lorosa, through his servant, [telling him] that he could
come without any hesitation.

Those kings have as many women as they wish, but only one chief wife,
whom all the others obey. The abovesaid king of Tadore had a large
house outside of the city, where two hundred of his chief women lived
with a like number of women to serve them. When the king eats, he sits
alone or with his chief wife in a high place like a gallery whence he
can see all the other women who sit about the gallery; and he orders
her who best pleases him to sleep with him that night. After the king
has finished eating, if he orders those women to eat together, they do
so, but if not, each one goes to eat in her own chamber. No one is
allowed to see those women without permission from the king, and if
anyone is found near the king’s house by day or by night, he is put
to death. Every family is obliged to give the king one or two of its
daughters. That king had twenty-six children, eight sons, and the rest
daughters. Lying next that island there is a very large island, called
Giailolo [i.e., Gilolo], which is inhabited by Moros and heathens. Two
kings are found there among the Moros, one of them, as we were told by
the king, having had six hundred children, and the other five hundred
and twenty-five. [481] The heathens do not have so many women; nor do
they live under so many superstitions, but adore for all that day the
first thing that they see in the morning when they go out of their
houses. The king of those heathens, called Raya Papua, is exceedingly
rich in gold, and lives in the interior of the island. Reeds as thick
around as the leg and filled with water that is very good to drink,
grow on the flinty rocks in the island of Giaiallo. [482] We bought
many of them from those people.

On Tuesday, November twelve, the king had a house built for us in the
city in one day for our merchandise. We carried almost all of our goods
thither, and left three of our men to guard them. We immediately began
to trade in the following manner. For x brazas of red cloth of very
good quality, they gave us one bahar of cloves, which is equivalent to
four quintals and six libras; for fifteen brazas of cloth of not very
good quality, one quintal and one hundred libras; for fifteen hatchets,
one bahar; for thirty-five glass drinking-cups, one bahar (the king
getting them all); for seventeen cathils of cinnabar, one bahar; for
seventeen cathils of quicksilver, one bahar; for twenty-six brazas of
linen, one bahar; for twenty-five brazas of finer linen, one bahar; for
one hundred and fifty knives, one bahar; for fifty pairs of scissors,
one bahar; for forty caps, one bahar; for x pieces of Guzerat cloth,
[483] one bahar; for three of those gongs of theirs, two bahars; [484]
for one quinta of bronze [metalo], one bahar. [Almost] all the mirrors
were broken, and the few good ones the king wished for himself. Many of
those things [that we traded] were from the abovementioned junks which
we had captured. Our haste to return to Spagnia made us dispose of our
merchandise at better bargains [to the natives] than we should have
done. [485] Daily so many boatloads of goats, fowls, figs [i.e.,
bananas], cocoanuts, and other kinds of food were brought to the ships,
that we were surprised. We supplied the ships with good water, which
issues forth hot [from the ground], but if it stands for the space of
an hour outside its spring, it becomes very cold, the reason therefor
being that it comes from the mountain of cloves. This is quite the
opposite from the assertion in Spagnia that water must be carried to
Maluco from distant parts. [486]

On Wednesday, the king sent his son, named Mossahap, to Mutir, so that
they might supply us more quickly. On that day we told the king that we
had captured certain Indians. The king thanked God heartily, and asked
us to do him the kindness to give him their persons, so that he might
send them back to their land, with five of his own men, in order that
they might make the king of Spagnia and his fame known. Then we gave
him the three women who had been captured in the queen’s name for the
reason already advanced. Next day, we gave the king all the prisoners,
except those from Burne, for which he thanked us fervently. Thereupon,
he asked us, in order thereby to show our love for him, to kill all the
swine that we had in the ships, in return for which he would give us an
equal number of goats and fowls. We killed them in order to show him a
pleasure, [487] and hung them up under the deck. When those people
happen to see any swine they cover their faces in order that they might
not look upon them or catch their odor.

[1] The greater part of the life of Antonio Pigafetta is shrouded in
darkness. The Pigafetta family, who resided at Venice, and was formerly
of Tuscan origin, dates back before him for several centuries. The
Pigafetta escutcheon was white above and black below with a white
transverse bar running from left to right. On the lower part were three
red roses, one of them on the bar. The old family house is still
standing and shows the motto Il nest rose sans espine, i.e., “No rose
without a thorn,” which was probably carved in 1481, when the house
was repaired, and not by Antonio Pigafetta after his return from his
voyage as some assert. Antonio Pigafetta was born toward the close of
the fifteenth century, but the date cannot be positively fixed, some
declaring it to be 1491; but Harrisse who follows Marzari, gives the
date as 1480. It is unknown who his parents were and some have asserted
that he was a natural child, although this is evidently unfounded, as
he was received into the military order of St. John. At an early age he
probably became familiar with the sea and developed his taste for
traveling. He went to Spain with the Roman ambassador Chieregato, in
1519, but in what capacity is unknown. Hearing details of
Magalhães’s intended voyage he contrived to accompany him. Navarrete
surmises that he is the Antonio Lombardo mentioned in the list of the
captain’s servants and volunteers who sailed on the expedition, so
called as his country was Lombardy. After the return of the
“Victoria,” he journeyed in Spain, Portugal, and France, and
returned to Italy probably in January, 1523. The relation presented by
him to Cárlos I was probably a draft of his notes taken daily
throughout the voyage. His Relation as we know it was undertaken at the
request of the marchioness of Mantova, but its composition was arrested
by an order from Clement VII to come to Rome, whither he went in
December, 1523, or January, 1524, meeting Villiers l’Isle-Adam on his
journey thither. He remained in the pope’s service but a short time,
for in April, 1524, he was back in Venice. That same year he was
granted a copyright on his Relation, which he intended to print, for
twenty years. Pozzo says that he was received into the Order of St.
John, October 3, 1524, but it was probably somewhat before that date.
Between the dates of August, 1524, and August, 1530, his work was
presented to Villiers l’Isle-Adam. Nothing further is known of him,
though some say that he fought against the Turks as late as 1536, while
others have placed his death in 1534 or 1535 and at Malta. In addition
to his Relation Pigafetta wrote a Treatise on the art of navigation,
which follows his Relation. This is not presented in the present
publication, notwithstanding its importance, as being outside of the
present scope. It is reproduced by Mosto. He has sometimes been
confused with Marcantonio Pigafetta (a Venetian gentleman), the author
of Itinerario da Vienna a Constantinopoli (London, 1585); and wrongly
called Vincenzo Antonio Pigafetta, the “Vincenzo” being an error
for “vicentino,” i.e., “Venetian.” See Mosto, Il primo viaggio
... di Antonio Pigafetta (Roma, 1894), pp. 13–30; Larousse’s
Dictionnaire; and La grande Encyclopédie (Paris).

[2] The Order of St. John of Jerusalem. See Vol. II, p. 26, note 2.
Throughout this Relation Pigafetta’s spelling of proper names is
retained.

[3] Philippe de Villiers l’Isle-Adam, the forty-third grand master of
the Order of the Knights of St. John (called Knights of Malta after
1530), was born of an old and distinguished family at Beauvais, in
1464, and died at Malta, August 21, 1534, at grief, some say, over the
dissensions in his order. He was elected grand master of his order in
1521 and in the following year occurred his heroic defense of Rhodes
with but four thousand five hundred soldiers against the huge fleet and
army of Soliman. After six months he was compelled to surrender his
stronghold in October, and refusing Soliman’s entreaties to remain
with him, went to Italy. In 1524 he was given the city of Viterbe by
Clement VII, where in June of 1527 he held a general chapter of his
order, at which it was decided to accept the island of Malta which had
been offered by Charles V. The gift was confirmed by the letters-patent
of Charles V in 1530, and Villiers l’Isle-Adam Adam went thither in
October of that year. He was always held in high esteem for his
bravery, prudence, and piety. See Moreri’s Dictionaire, and
Larousse’s Dictionnaire.

[4] The four MSS. of Pigafetta’s Relation are those known as the
Ambrosian or Italian, so called from its place of deposit, the
Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan; no. 5,650, conserved in the
Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, in French; no. 24,224, in the same
library, also in French; and the Nancy MS. (also French) so called
because it was conserved in Nancy, France, now owned by the heirs of
Sir Thomas Phillips, Cheltenham, England. The MSS. of the Bibliothèque
Nationale are both shorter than the Italian MS. The Nancy MS. is said
to be the most complete of the French manuscripts. The best
bibliographical account of these four MSS. that has yet appeared is by
Mosto ut supra. A full bibliographical account of both the MSS. and
printed books will be given in the volume on bibliography in this
series.

There are a number of radical differences between the Paris MS. no.
5,650 (which will be hereafter referred to simply as MS. 5,650) and the
Italian MS., these differences including paragraph structure and the
division of MS. 5,650 into various chapters, although the sequence is
on the whole identical. The most radical of the differences will be
shown in these notes. MS. 5,650 contains the following title on the
page immediately preceding the beginning of the relation proper:
“Navigation and discovery of Upper Indie, written by me, Anthoyne
Pigaphete, a Venetian, and knight of Rhodes.”

[5] The emperor Charles V; but he was not elected to that dignity until
June, 1519. Pigafetta writing after that date is not explicit.

[6] Francesco Chiericati was born in Venice, in one of the most ancient
and famous families of that city, at the end of the fifteenth century.
He attained preëminence at Sienna in both civil and ecclesiastical
law. Aided by Cardinal Matteo Lang, bishop of Sion, he was received
among the prelates of the apostolic palace. Later he conducted several
diplomatic missions with great skill. He left Rome for Spain in
December, 1518, on a private mission for the pope, and especially to
effect a crusade against the Turks who were then invading Egypt and
threatening Christianity. His house at Barcelona became the
meeting-place of the savants of that day who discussed literature and
science. See Mosto, p. 19, note 3.

[7] MS. 5,650 adds: “scholars and men of understanding.”

[8] MS. 5,650 reads: “so that I might satisfy the wish of the said
gentlemen and also my own desire, so that it could be said that I had
made the said voyage and indeed been an eyewitness of the things
hereafter written.”

[9] See Vol. I, p. 250, note 192 for sketch of Magalhães. The only
adequate life of Magalhães in English is that of Guillemard.

[10] That is, the Order of Santiago. See Vol. I, p. 145, note 171.
Magalhães and Falero were decorated with the cross of comendador of
the order by Cárlos I in the presence of the royal Council in July,
1518. See Guillemard’s Ferdinand Magellan, p. 114.

[11] See Vol. I for various documents during the period of the
preparation of the fleet; also Guillemard’s Magellan, pp. 114–116
and 130–134; and Stanley’s First Voyage, pp. xxxiv–xlvi.

[12] Pope Clement VII, who assumed the papacy November 19, 1523.
Pigafetta was summoned to Rome very soon after Clement’s election,
for he was in Rome either in December, 1523, or January, 1524.

[13] The Amoretti edition (Milan, 1800; a wofully garbled adaptation of
the Italian MS.) wrongly ascribes this desire to Clement VII, instead
of Villiers L’Isle-Adam. See Stanley, p. 36, note 3.

[14] MS. 5,650 reads: “Finally, most illustrious Lordship, after all
provisions had been made and the ships were in readiness, the
captain-general, a wise and virtuous man, and one mindful of his honor,
would not commence his voyage without first making some good and
suitable rules, such as it is the approved custom to make for those who
go to sea, although he did not entirely declare the voyage that he was
about to make lest those men, through astonishment and fear, should
refuse to accompany him on the so long voyage that he had determined
upon. In consideration of the furious and violent storms that reign on
the Ocean Sea where he was about to sail, and in consideration of
another reason also, namely, that the masters and captains of the other
ships in his fleet had no liking for him (the reason for which I know
not, unless because he, the captain-general, was a Portuguese, and they
Spaniards or Castilians, who have for a long while been biased and
ill-disposed toward one another, but who, in spite of that, rendered
him obedience), he made his rules such as follow, so that his ships
might not go astray or become separated from one another during storms
at sea. He published those rules and gave them in writing to every
master in the ships and ordered them to be inviolably observed and
kept, unless for urgent and legitimate excuse, and the proof that any
other action was impossible.”

[15] A Spanish word, meaning “lantern.”

[16] Mosto wrongly derives strengue from the Spanish trenza “braid”
or “twist.” Instead it is the Spanish word estrenque, which denotes
a large rope made from Spanish grass hemp (stipa)—known to the
Spaniards as esparto. MS. 5,650 reads: “Sometimes he set out a
lantern; at other times a thick rush cord which was lighted and was
called ‘trenche’ [i.e., ‘estrenque,’ ‘rope of Spanish grass
hemp’].” Barcio (Diccionario general etimológico) says that the
origin of estrenque is unknown.

[17] MS. 5,650 reads: “If he wished the other ships to haul in a
bonnet-sail, which was a part of the sail attached to the mainsail, he
showed three lights. Also by three lights notwithstanding that the
weather might be favorable for making better time, it was understood
that the bonnet-sail was to be hauled in, so that the mainsail might be
sooner and easier struck and furled when bad weather came suddenly in
any squall or otherwise.”

[18] MS. 5,650 adds: “which he had extinguished immediately after;”
and continues: “then showing a single light as a sign that he
intended to stop there and wait until the other ships should do as
he.”

[19] MS. 5,650 adds: “that is to say, a rock in the sea.”

[20] Stanley translates the following passage wrongly. Rightly
translated, it is: “Also when he desired the bonnet-sail to be
reattached to the sail, he showed three fires.”

[21] This passage is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[22] Hora de la modorra is in Spanish that part of the night
immediately preceding the dawn. Mosto, p. 52, note 8.

[23] Contra maestro (boatswain) corresponding to the French
contremaître and the Spanish contramaestre, was formerly the third
officer of a ship’s crew. Nochiero (French nocher) was the officer
next to contramaestre, although the name, according to Littré was
applied to the master or seacaptain of certain small craft. The maestro
(French maître) was a sub-officer in charge of all the crew. The pilot
was next to the captain in importance. The translator or adapter who
made MS. 5,650 confuses the above officers (see following note).

[24] The instructions pertaining to the different watches are as
follows in MS. 5,650: “In addition to the said rules for carrying on
the art of navigation as is fitting, and in order to avoid the dangers
that may come upon those who do not have watches set, the said captain,
who was skilled in the things required and in navigation, ordered three
watches to be set. The first was at the beginning of the night; the
second at midnight; and the third toward daybreak, which is commonly
called the ‘diane’ [i.e., ‘morn’] or otherwise ‘the star of
dawn.’ The abovenamed watches were changed nightly: that is to say,
that he who had stood first watch stood second the day following, while
he who had stood second, stood third; and thus did they continue to
change nightly. The said captain ordered that his rules, both those of
signals and of watches, be thoroughly observed, so that their voyage
might be made with the greatest of safety. The men of the said fleet
were divided into three divisions: the first was that of the captain;
the second that of the pilot or boatswain’s mate; and the third that
of the master. The above rules having been instituted, the
captain-general determined to depart, as follows.”

[25] See Guillemard’s Magellan, pp. 329–336, and Navarrete, Col. de
viages, iv, pp. 3–11, 162–188, for the stores and equipments of the
fleet and their cost. The stores carried consisted of wine, olive oil,
vinegar, fish, pork, peas and beans, flour, garlic, cheese, honey,
almonds, anchovies, raisins, prunes, figs, sugar, quince preserves,
capers, mustard, beef, and rice. The apothecary supplies were carried
in the “Trinidad,” and the ecclesiastical ornaments in that ship
and the “San Antonio.”

[26] The exact number of men who accompanied Magalhães is a matter of
doubt. A royal decree, dated Barcelona, May 5, 1519, conserved in the
papers of the India House of Trade in Archivo general de Indias at
Sevilla, with pressmark est. 41, caj. 6, leg. 2–25, orders that only
two hundred and thirty-five persons sail in the fleet. The same
archives contain various registers of the fleet (sec Llorens
Ascensio’s Primera vuelta al mundo, Madrid, 1903), one of which is
published by Medina in his Colección (i, p. 113). Guillemard
(Magellan, p. 326) says that at least two hundred and sixty-eight men
went as is shown by the official lists and “the casual occurrence of
names in the numerous and lengthy autos fiscales connected with the
expedition.” Guillemard conjectures that the total number must have
been between two hundred and seventy and two hundred and eighty. Mosto
(p. 53, note 2) says: “Castanheda and Barros say that the crews
amounted to 250 men, while Herrera says 234. Navarrete’s lists show a
total of 265 men. At least 37 were Portuguese, and in addition to them
and the Spaniards, the crews contained Genoese and Italians (thirty or
more), French (nineteen), Flemings, Germans, Sicilians, English,
Corfiotes, Malays, Negroes, Moors, Madeirans, and natives of the Azores
and Canary Islands. But seventeen are recorded from Seville, while
there are many Biscayans. (See Guillemard, ut supra, pp. 326–329.)
The registers of men as given by Navarrete (Col. de viages, iv, pp.
12–26) are as follows.

The total number of men for the ships as above given is 235. Navarrete
made his list from the list conserved in Archivo general de Indias, and
notes of Juan Bautista Muñoz, and various other sources. The obstacles
in the way of a correct register were the abbreviation of names and
places, the custom prevalent of naming people from their native town or
province, and the fact that the various registers were made between
1519 and 1525. From some of these registers, it appears that the
following men were also in the fleet.

In addition there were probably others, this list being still three
short of Guillemard’s figures, 268. Harrisse (Disc. of N. Amer.,
London and Paris, 1892, pp. 714 et seq.) gives a partial list.

[27] The Moorish name of Guadalquivir (from Arabic Wâd-al-Kebir,
“the great river”), superseded the Roman name of Bætis. The Romans
formed all Southern Spain into one province called Bætica after the
name of the Bætis. By the town Gioan dal Farax is meant San Juan de
Aznalfarache (from Moorish Hisn al-Faradj). Its Gothic name was Osset
and its Roman name Julia Constantia. It is a favorite resort of the
inhabitants of Sevilla. Coría was once a Roman potters’ town and is
still celebrated for its jars. San Lúcar de Barrameda was named in
honor of St. Luke. It was captured from the Moors in 1264 and granted
to the father of Guzman el Bueno. It attained importance after the
discovery of America because of its good harbor. The house of
Medina-Sidonia was founded by Alfonso Pérez de Guzman, a famous
captain.

[28] The original of this passage is obscure. The distance given (ten
leagues; and both MS. 5,650 and Eden agree substantially with it) is
far too short for the distance between San Lucar and Cape St. Vincent,
which is over one hundred miles. Pigafetta may have forgotten the
actual distance, or it may have been an error of his amanuensis. It is
possible to translate as follows: “which lies in 37 degrees of
latitude, [that parallel being] x leguas from the said port;” for
“longui” may be taken as agreeing with “gradi.” In all
rendering of distances, the Spanish form will be used in preference to
the Italian; and the same will apply to the names of Spanish coins.

[29] MS. 5,650 reads: “And after passing many small villages along
the said river, we at last reached a chateau belonging to the duke of
Medinacidonia, and called Sainct Lucar, where there is a port with an
entrance into the Ocean Sea. One enters that port by the east wind, and
leaves by the west. Nearby is the cape of Sainct Vincent, which,
according to cosmography, lies in a latitude of thirty-seven degrees at
a distance of twenty miles from the said port. From the said city [of
Sevilla] to the said port by the river abovesaid, the distance is
thirty-five or forty miles.” This passage might be cited as a proof
that Pigafetta did not translate or write the French version, but that
the work was done by another, who takes various liberties with his
original.

[30] MS. 5,650 reads: “furnish the fleet.”

[31] Ninguna in original, a Spanish word.

[32] MS. 5,650 adds: “otherwise called ‘labeiche.’” Labech
(Italian libeccio) is simply a name for the southwest wind. This is
another instance in which the French adapter adds an explanation to the
Italian, thus explaining the Italian term garbino, “southwest.”

[33] MS. 5,650 reads wrongly: “sixteenth.” The so-called Genoese
pilot (the author of the “Roteiro,” by which name his account will
be hereafter designated, and concerning whom, see Guillemard’s
Magellan, p. 145, and Mosto, p. 32, and note 4) gives the date of
departure as September 21 (with which Barros agrees) and the arrival at
Tenerife as the twenty-ninth (see Stanley, p. 1). Peter Martyr, Gomara,
and Oviedo agree with Pigafetta, while Castanheda makes the departure
in January, 1520. Hughes observes that if one keep in mind the
circumstance that the day of the arrival coincided with the day
dedicated by the Church to St. Michael, the date September 29 seems
more admissible. However, one may reconcile the two dates of the
arrival by observing that the ships stopped at Tenerife until October
2; while Herrera says that the ships fetched Montaña Roja (the Monte
rosso of the text) on September 29. See Mosto, p. 53, notes 4 and 5. It
should be noted that Gomara and Oviedo are not entirely trustworthy
authorities, and that many times they have simply copied from
authorities, such as Maximilianus Transylvanus, who is not always to be
relied upon.

[34] The Canaries were known to the ancients under the names of Islands
of the Blest, Fortunate Islands, and the Hesperides. The Moors knew of
them under the name of Islands of Khaledat, but had no practical
acquaintance with them. In the fourteenth century these islands began
to be known to Europeans, especially through the Portuguese. In 1402,
the Frenchman Jean de Bethencourt went there, and shortly after began
their conquest under the auspices of the crown of Castile. In
consequence of the settlements made by Bethencourt, the islands were
definitely ceded to Spain in 1481 (see Birch’s Alboquerque, London,
1875–1884, Hakluyt Society Publications, ii, p. vi). The inhabitants
of the islands were known as Guanches or Guanchinet, the latter meaning
“men of Tenerife.” The inhabitants of this island, holding out
longer than the others, were not subdued until 1496. See also Conquest
of Canaries (London, 1877); and History and Description of Africa
(London, 1896), i, pp. 99–101: both publications of the Hakluyt
Society. The island of Tenerife was formerly called Nivana and by some
the Island of Hell. Like all the other islands of the Canaries it is
volcanic in formation, and its peak, the Teyde, is one of the largest
volcanic cones known. Its latitude is 28° 15′.

[35] Guillemard conjectures that this is Punta Roxa, located at the
south end of Tenerife.

[36] MS. 5,650 adds: “which is a substance needed by ships.”
Herrera says that they waited three days at the port awaiting a caravel
that was laden with pitch for the fleet (Mosto, p. 53, note 8).

[37] MS. 5,650 reads: “water coming from spring or river.”

[38] Eden (p. 250) adds to this account which he greatly abridges:
“The lyke thynge is alſo ſcene in the Iland of ſaynt Thomas,
lyinge directly vnder the Equinoctiall lyne.” Of this island of
Hierro, Pory (History and description of Africa, Hakluyt Society
edition, p. 100) says: “Hierro hath neither spring nor well, but is
miraculously furnished with water by a cloud which over-spreadeth a
tree, from whence distilleth so much moisture, as sufficeth both for
men and cattel. This cloud ariseth an hower or two before the sunne,
and is dissolued two howers after sunne rising.” This is an old story
and is related by Pliny and founded upon fact “for both in Madeira
and the Canaries the laurel and other heavy-foliaged evergreens
condense abundant water from the daily mists” (Guillemard’s
Magellan, p. 149). Gregorio Chil y Naranio (Estudios históricos ... de
las islas Canarias, 1879) believes Pigafetta means here the island of
Palma, and that the first navigators visited only the coast and so did
not see the lake in the interior (Mosto, p. 53, note 9).

[39] MS. 5,650 adds: “which the sailors of the east call
‘Cyroc’” This is the Italian sirocco, which is the name for the
southeast wind instead of the south. Herrera says they left the port
October 2 (Mosto, p. 54, note 2).

[40] Eden (p. 250) reads incorrectly: “In this coaſt they had no
maner of contrary wynds but a great calme and fayre wether for the
ſpace of three ſcore and tenne dayes, in the which they came vnder
the Equinoctiall lyne.”

[41] MS. 5,650 adds: “and of those persons who have sailed there
often.”

[42] MS. 5,650 reads: “And in order that our ships might not be
wrecked or broach to (which often happens when the squalls come
together).”

[43] This last phrase, as well as the two following sentences are
missing in MS. 5,650. The third sentence following begins: “During
the calm weather, large fish called tiburoni,” etc. The word
tiburoni, “sharks” is from the Spanish tiburon, which comes from
the French tibéron (tiburin, tiburon).—Echagaray’s Diccionario
Etimológico (Madrid, 1889).

[44] MS. 5,650 reads: “The said fish are caught by means of a
contrivance which sailors call ‘hame’ which is an iron fishhook.”
Hame (ain) is the French form of the Italian Amo, meaning
“fishhook.”

[45] MS. 5,650 adds: “because of the bad weather.”

[46] MS. 5,650 reads “a quarter of an hour,” and the same duration
of time is given by Eden (p. 250).

[47] MS. 5,650 adds: “It is to be noted that whenever that fire that
represents the said Saint Anselme ascends and descends the mast of a
ship while in a storm at sea, that the said ship is never wrecked.”
Herrera (cited by Mosto, p. 54, note 5) says that St. Elmo appeared on
the masthead with a lighted candle and sometimes two during the storms
encountered along the coasts of Guinea, and that the sailors were
greatly comforted thereby, and saluted the saint as is the custom of
seamen. When he appeared, he remained a quarter of an hour; and at his
departure a great flash of light occurred which blinded all the men.
Eden (p. 250) calls it the fire of St. Helen. Continuing, Eden injects
into his abridgment of the first circumnavigation a description of St.
Elmo’s fire by Hieronimus Cardanus in the second book of De
Subtilitate. He says: “Of the kynde of trewe fyer, is the fyer baule
or ſtarre commonly cauled ſaynt Helen which is ſumtyme ſeene abowt
the maſtes of ſhyppes, beinge of ſuche fyery nature that it
ſumetyme melteth braſen veſſels, and is a token of drownyng,
foraſmuch as this chaunceth only in great tempeſtes. For the vapoure
or exhalation whereof this fyre is engendered, can not bee dryven
togyther or compacte in forme of fyre, but of a groſe vapoure and by a
great poure of wynde, and is therfore a token of imminent perell.”
The fires called after St. Peter and St. Nicholas are on the contrary,
he says, good omens, and are generally to be seen on the cables, after
a storm. Being little and swift moving they can do no damage as they
could do if massed and of slow movement. St. Elmo’s fire is the
popular name for the atmospheric electricity that gathers in the form
of a star or brush about the masthead of ships and on the rigging. It
was sometimes accompanied by a hissing noise and was considered as a
good omen by sailors. The Greeks who observed this phenomenon wove it
into the Castor and Pollux myth; and the French edition of
Pigafetta’s relation published by Simon de Colines has the passage
(see Mosto, p. 54): “They saw the fires called Sainct Eline and
Sainct Nicolas like blazing torches (whom the ancients called Castor
and Pollux).” “Elmo” is said by some to be a corruption of
“Helena,” the sister of Castor and Pollux, and the name
“Hellene” or “Helen” was often given to the fire when only one
light was visible. It is, however, more probably derived from St. Elmo,
bishop of Formine who died about 304, and who is invoked by sailors on
the Mediterranean. The phenomenon is also called fire of “St.
Elias,” “St. Clara,” “St. Nicolas,” and “composite,”
“composant,” and “corposant (i.e., corpus sanctum).”

[48] The second bird mentioned is the stormy petrel (of the family
Laridæ and genus Thalassidroma), which is found along all the Atlantic
coasts and on some of the Pacific. The tale of the text was current
among sailors (see Wilkes, U. S. Exploring Expedition, viii, pp. 402,
403). The cagassela (“cagaselo” in MS. 5,650) is the Stercorarius
parasiticus, called also the jaeger, and by sailors “boatswain,”
“teaser,” and “dung-hunter.” The last name arose from the
belief, long held even by scientists, that this bird fed on the dung of
gulls and terns. In reality it pursues the latter birds and compels
them to disgorge the fish that they have swallowed. The flying-fish is
either a species of Exocœtus, or the Scomberesox saurus of Europe and
America, both of which feed in large schools and jump from the water to
escape their enemies. See Riverside Natural History (Boston and New
York).

[49] MS. 5,650 adds: “which is the collateral wind between the south
and the west;” and below reads: “twenty-four and one-half
degrees;” while Eden (p. 250) reads: “xxii degrees and a halfe.”

[50] Verzino, the etymology of which is unknown (see Varthema’s
Travels, Hakluyt Society edition, p. lxxviii, note, and 205 note), is
the Italian name for brazil-wood, from which Brazil, which was first
visited by Vicente Pinzon, Diego Lope, Pedro Alvares Cabral, and
Amerigo Vespucci, was named. The first names of the country were Vera
Cruz and Santa Cruz. Cape Santo Agostinho, mentioned below, lies in 8°
21´ south latitude, and is the most eastern headland of South America.
It was the first land of that continent to be discovered, being sighted
at least as early as 1500 by Pinzon. Before sighting the above cape,
Magalhães arrested Juan de Cartagena for insubordination and gave the
command of the “San Antonio” to Antonio de Coca (see Guillemard’s
Magellan,  p. 153). Albo’s log begins slightly before the sighting of
the point, his first entry being November 29. See Burton’s
“Introduction” in his Captivity of Hans Stade (Hakluyt Society
publications, London, 1874).

[51] MS. 5,650 reads: “veal.” The anta is the tapir, once very
plentiful in South America, but now rare in the well civilized
districts. See Burton’s Captivity of Hans Stade, p. viii. Albo,
however, seems to designate the llama by this name, for he says when
speaking of the stay at Bay St. Julian: “and many Indians came there,
who are clad in certain skins of antas, which resemble camels without
the hump.” (Navarrete, Col. de viages, iv, p. 214).

[52] Stanley mistranslates the French phrase of MS. 5,650 et est de la
longueur dun naveau, “and is of the length of a shuttle,” confusing
naveau with navette, “shuttle.” Naveau here is equivalent to navet,
“turnip” or navette, “rape,” a plant of the turnip class, as is
proved by the Italian.

[53] MS. 5,650 reads: “And for a king of cards, of the kind which are
used to play with in Italy, they gave me five fowls.” The four suits
of Italian playing cards are called spade (“swords”), bastoni
(“clubs”), danari (literally: “money;” “diamonds”), and
coppe (“cups”).

[54] MS. 5,650 reads: “five.”

[55] MS. 5,650 adds: “which is an astrological term. That zenith is a
point in the sky, according to astrologers, but only in the
imagination, and is in a straight line over our head, as can be seen by
the treatise of the sphere, and in Aristotle, in the first book De
caelo et mondo.” By the treatise of the sphere is evidently meant the
treatise of Pigafetta which follows his relation, and which is not
reproduced here as being outside the scope of the present work. In the
flyleaf of the Italian original is the following: “Notices concerning
the new world, with the charts of the countries discovered, written by
Antonio Pigafeta, Venetian and knight of Rodi. At the end are added
some rules for finding the longitude and latitude of places east and
west.” In the Italian MS. this treatise occupies the last twelve
folios. Stanley translates Amoretti’s version of the Treatise, which
is greatly abridged. Mosto (p. 35) conjectures that the treatise is the
fruits of his three-years’ experience during the expedition.

[56] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 210) says that the fleet continued to
coast southwest from November 29 until arriving at St. Lucy’s bay on
December 13 (St. Lucy’s day). Of the coast he says: “The mountains
are peaked and have many reefs about them. There are many rivers and
ports in the said Brasil and San Tomé, and some six leguas down the
coast there are many bays running two leguas into the land. But the
coast runs northeast and southwest to Cape Frio, and has many islands
and rivers. Cape Frio is a very large river.... At the entrance of the
said bay is a very large bay, and at the mouth a very low island, and
inside it spreads out extensively and has many ports ... and is called
the bay of Santa Lucía.... In the said bay, one finds a well-disposed
and numerous race, who go naked and trade for fishhooks, mirrors, and
hawk’s bells with food.... We entered that place on the very day of
St. Lucy, and stayed there until the day of St. John, namely, the
twenty-seventh of the said month of December. On that day we went and
took our course west southwest, and found seven islands. To the right
of them is a bay called the bay of Los Reyes [i.e., the Kings] which
has a good entrance.” The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 1) says: “as
soon as they sighted the other coast of Brazil, he steered to the
south-east [sic] along the coast as far as Cabo-frio, which is in
twenty-three degrees south latitude; and from this cape he steered to
the west, a matter of thirty leagues, to make the Rio de Janeiro, which
is in the same latitude as Cabo-frio, and they entered the said river
on the day of St. Lucy, which was the 13th December, in which place
they took in wood, and they remained there until the first octave of
Christmas, which was the 26th of December of the same year.” Brito
(Navarrete, iv, p. 306) says: “Setting sail thence [i.e., from
Tenerife], the first land sighted was the cape of the shoals of Ambas.
They descended the coast as far as the river called Janeiro, where they
stayed 15 or 16 days.”

[57] Eden (p. 251) says: “bygger then all Spayne, Portugale, Fraunce,
and Italie.”

[58] MS. 5,650 adds: “more like beasts than anything else.”

[59] MS. 5,650 reads: “And some of those people live to the age of
one hundred, one hundred and twenty, one hundred and forty, or more.”
Eden (p. 251) says: “C.xx. and C.xl. yeares.” For description of
the Brazil Indians, and their manners and customs, see Captivity of
Hans Stade (Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 117–169.

[60] Wrongly transcribed by Stanley as “boy.”

[61] MS. 5,650 reads: “You must know that a family of one hundred
persons, who make a great racket, lives in each of those houses called
boii.” One of these houses (called Oca, in Tupi) is described by
Wilson (Transactions of Ethnological Society, new series, vol. i) as
being “60 or 70 feet long, divided into rooms for several families by
rush mats, and provided with a central fire whose smoke passed through
the roof. Some of them contained 200 head.” See Burton’s Captivity
of Hans Stade, pp. 59, 60, note. The Indians described by Pigafetta are
probably the Tamoyos of the Tupi or Guarani stock (Mosto, p. 56, note
1; see also Burton, ut supra, pp. lxi-lxxvi).

[62] Amoretti makes this passage read: “Their boats, called canoes,
are hollowed out from the single trunk of a huge tree;” understanding
maschize as massiccio “huge.” Mosto prefers to read maschize as two
words ma schize (notwithstanding that it is one word in the original),
for ma schiacciate, “but flattened.” Accepting this, the
translation would be: “They have boats made from one single tree,
only flattened.” Amoretti’s interpretation is to be preferred.

[63] MS. 5,650 reads: “and one would believe them to be enemies from
hell.”

[64] MS. 5,650 adds: “of the said country of Verzin.”

[65] MS. 5,650 reads: “daily.” Amerigo Vespucci says in a letter
(Mosto, p. 55, note 6): “I saw human flesh salted and suspended from
the beams, in the same way as we are wont to hang up bacon and
swine’s flesh.” See Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents
(Cleveland reissue), for instances of cannibalism among the North
American Indians. See also Captivity of Hans Stade (Hakluyt Society
edition), pp. 151, 155–159; and Dominguez’s Conquest of the River
Plate (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1891), pp. 129, 130.

[66] For Carvagio, as in MS. 5,650, and later in the Italian; an error
of the amanuensis. This was João Carvalho (the Juan Lopez Caraballo of
the register—see note 26, ante). Carvalho was a Portuguese, of none
too scrupulous morals, even in his age, as appears later in
Pigafetta’s narrative. After the fatal banquet in the island of
Cebú, he became the leader of the remaining men of the fleet, but was
later deposed (see post, note 441). He remained behind with the
ill-fated “Trinidad,” and never returned to Europe. His son, borne
to him by a native woman of Brazil, was left behind in Borneo. See
Stanley, pp. 252–255, for Correa’s account of the actions of
Carvalho after the death of Magalhães.

[67] The early French edition and the Italian edition of 1536 both
include the women and children.—Stanley.

[68] It is a widespread (perhaps universal) characteristic of the
American Indian to pull out the hair of the body. See Jesuit Relations
and Allied Documents (Cleveland reissue).

[69] Eden (p. 45), defines gatti mammoni as monkeys. Monkeys of the
genus Cebus are probably meant (Mosto, p. 55, note 8).

[70] MS. 5,650 reads: “fresh cheese.” Pigafetta may here refer to
the bread made from the casava or manioc root. See Burton’s Captivity
of Hans Stade, pp. 130–132, for a description of the method of
preparing this root.

[71] The swine mentioned by Pigafetta is the Tayasu (Tagaçu), or
peccari (Dicotyles torquatus), which has quills resembling those of the
porcupine, and is generally of a whitish color. It is tailless and very
fierce and difficult to domesticate. The flesh was eaten; and the teeth
were worn by some of the chiefs as necklaces. Burton (ut supra), p.
160, note.

[72] The Platalea ajaja or rosy spoonbill, belonging to the family of
the Plataleidæ, whose habitat extends through all of tropical and
subtropical America, including the West Indies, south to the Falkland
Islands, Patagonia and Chile, and north to the southern part of the
United States.

[73] Hans Stade (Burton, ut supra) testifies to the chastity of the
people of Eastern Brazil among whom he lived as a prisoner.

[74] MS. 5,650 reads: “The women attend to the outside affairs, and
carry everything necessary for their husband’s food in small panniers
on the head or fastened to the head.”

[75] MS. 5,650 adds: “and compassion.”

[76] MS. 5,650 reads: “When we departed they gave us a very great
quantity of verzin;” and adds: “That is a color which comes from
trees which grow in the said country, and so abundantly, that the
country is called Verzin from it.”

[77] MS. adds: “which was a piece of great simplicity.”

[78] This sentence is preceded by the following in MS. 5,650:
“Besides the abovesaid which proclaims their simplicity, the people
of the above place showed us another very simple thing.”

[79] This passage in Stanley reads as follows: “A beautiful young
girl came one day inside the ship of our captain, where I was, and did
not come except to seek for her luck: however, she directed her looks
to the cabin of the master, and saw a nail, of a finger’s length, and
went and took it as something valuable and new, and hid it in her hair,
for otherwise she would not have been able to conceal it, because she
was naked, and, bending forwards, she went away; and the captain and I
saw this mystery.” The matter between the words “length” and
“naked” is taken from MS. 24,224 (wrongly declared by Stanley to be
the copy of his travels presented to the regent Louise by Pigafetta,
the conclusion being based on the fact that some of the details are
softened down), as Stanley considered the incident as told in MS.
5,650, the Italian MS. and the first French edition, as unfit for
publication. Stanley cites the following (in the original) from the
edition of 1536 which omits the above story: “At the first land at
which we stopped, some female slaves whom we had brought in the ships
from other countries and who were heavy with child, were taken with the
pains of childbirth. Consequently, they went alone out of the ships,
went ashore, and after having given birth, returned immediately to the
ships with their infants in their arms.” He also cites the following
passage from the first French printed edition, which also narrates the
above story of the girl: “At the first coast that we passed, some
slave women gave birth. When they were in travail, they left the boat,
after which they immediately returned, and nursed their children.”
Stanley adds that this story of the slave women is improbable, as women
were not allowed to come aboard ship.

[80] MS. 5,650 gives the words of the Brazil as follows: “maiz, huy,
pinda, taesse, chignap, pirame, itenmaraca, tum maraghatom.” Amoretti
(see Stanley’s edition, p. 48) reads tacse as tarse and itanmaraca as
Hanmaraca. Stanley mistranslates the French forcette (“scissors”)
as “fork.”

[81] Eden says (p. 251): “xxxiiii. degree and a halfe toward the pole
Antartike.”

[82] MS. 5,650 reads: “and to ask whether the others might come.”

[83] MS. 5,650 reads: “That place was formerly called Cape Saincte
Marye and it was thought that one could pass thence to the sea of Sur,
that is to say the South Sea, but it has not been ascertained that any
ships have ever discovered anything farther on.” Eden (p. 251) reads:
“Abowt the mouth of this ryuer are ſeven ilandes, in the byggeſt
whereof, they founde certeyne precious ſtones, and cauled it the cape
of Saynt Marie. The Spanyardes thought that by this ryuer they might
haue paſſed into the ſouth ſea. But they were deceaued in theyr
opinion. For there was none other paſſage than by the ryuer which is
xvii. leagues large in the mouth.” This river was the Rio de la
Plata. The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 2) says that Magalhães left Rio
de Janeiro December 26, proceeding to the cape Santa María and the
river which was called St. Christopher. There they remained until
February 2, 1520. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 211) also mentions the river
which he calls the “river of Solís.” The ships sent to look for a
strait through the river were gone two days, and a careful exploration
of the mouth of the river was made. Brito (Navarrete, iv, pp. 306, 307)
says: “They left that place [i.e.,  Rio de Janeiro] and coasted along
shore until they reached the river called Solís, where Fernando
Magallanes thought that he could find a strait. They stayed there forty
days. Magallanes ordered the ship ‘Santiago’ to sail forward for
about 50 leguas to see whether there was any passage. Not finding a
passage, he crossed the river which is about 25 leguas wide and found
the [opposite] coast which runs northeast and southwest.” For early
history of this region, see Dominguez’s Conquest of the River Plata.

[84] Juan Diaz de Solis, a famous Spanish navigator, was born at
Lebrixa, in 1470. He is said, although without sufficient authority, to
have discovered Yucatan with Pinzon in 1506. He was appointed chief
pilot of Spain after the death of Amerigo Vespucci in 1512. In October,
1515, he sailed in command of an expedition in search of a southwest
passage to India. He discovered Rio de la Plata which he explored as
far as the region of the Charrua tribe, by whom he and some of his men
were killed and eaten before September, 1516. The remnant of the
expedition was conducted back to Spain by his brother-in-law.

[85] Eden adds (p. 251): “which ſum thynke to bee thoſe fyſſhes
that wee caule pikes.” Below, the sea-wolf is described as having a
head “of golden coloure.” They were probably some species of the
Otariidæ or fur-seals (Giullemard, p. 160, note). The “geese” were
penguins. Albo, Herrera, and others, also mention the “sea-wolves and
ducks.” Kohl (Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde, xi, 362)
says that this bay where the ships were laden with the seals and
penguins is probably Desvelos Bay, but it is more probably Puerto
Deseado (“Port Desire;” see Mosto, p. 57, note 2). Drake also
secured fresh provisions from these “sea-wolves,” calling the bay
where he secured them “Seale Bay.” See World Encompassed (Hakluyt
Society edition), pp. 54, 55.

[86] Port St. Julian. The “Roteiro” pilot (Stanley, p. 3) says that
they reached it on March 31, 1520, and places it in 49° 20´ south
latitude. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 214) says: “We went to a port
called San Julian, where we entered the last day of March, and where we
stayed until the day of St. Bartholomew. The said port lies in a
latitude of 49 and two-thirds degrees. We pitched the ships in that
port.” Other writers give slightly different locations (see Mosto, p.
57, note 5). Antonio Brito, the Portuguese, whose MS. is preserved in
the Torre do Tombo at Lisbon, writes in 1523 to the king of Portugal
certain news obtained from some of the men of the “Trinidad.” His
information as might be expected, is at times faulty. Of Port St.
Julian, he says: “They coasted along shore until they reached a river
called San Juan where they wintered for four months.”

[87] MS. 5,650 adds: “jumping up and down.” The only reference made
to the Patagonians by Albo is as follows: “Many Indians came there,
who dress in certain skins of the anta, which resemble camels without
the hump. They have certain bows made from cane, which are very small
and resemble turkish bows. The arrows also resemble Turkish arrows, and
are tipped with flint instead of iron. Those Indians are very prudent,
swift runners, and very well-built and well-appearing men.”
(Navarrete, iv, pp. 214, 215). Cf. with Pigafetta’s account that
given by Maximilianus Transylvanus, in Vol. I, pp. 303–337.

[88] MS. 5,650 reads: “he began to marvel and to be afraid.”

[89] Guillemard, who follows the Amoretti edition, translates (p. 180)
this passage: “His hair was short and colored white,” but this
translation is borne out by neither the Italian MS. nor MS. 5,650.
Guillemard presents a picture of a Patagonian, as does also Wilkes
(Narrative of U. S. Exploring Expedition, 1838–1842), i, facing p.
95. The latter describes Indians, whom the officers of the expedition
thought to be Patagonians, and who were taller than average Europeans,
as follows: “They had good figures and pleasant looking countenances,
low foreheads, and high cheekbones, with broad faces, the lower part
projecting; their hair was course and cut short on the crown leaving a
narrow border of hair hanging down; over this they wore a kind of cap
or band of skin or woolen yarn. The front teeth of all of them were
very much worn, more apparent, however, in the old than in the young.
On one foot they wore a rude skin sandal. Many of them had their faces
painted in red and black stripes, with clay, soot, and ashes. Their
whole appearance, together with their inflamed and sore eyes, was
filthy and disgusting.” They showed that they had had previous
communication with white men. Their food was fish and shellfish, and
they carried bows and arrows and had dogs. Brinton (American Race, New
York, 1891) says that “The Patagonians call themselves Chonek or
Tzoneca, or Inaken (men, people), and by their Pampean neighbors are
referred to as Tehuel-Che, southerners.” Many of them are “from six
to six feet four inches in height, and built in proportion. In color
they are a reddish brown, and have aquiline noses and good
foreheads.” Ramon Lista (Viage al pais de los Tehuel-Ches) gives the
average height of the Patagonians as 1.854 m., hence the early accounts
of their great stature are greatly exaggerated (Mosto, p. 57, note 6).
See also the description of the Patagonians in the “Roteiro”
(Stanley, p. 5); and World encompassed by Sir Francis Drake (Hakluyt
Society edition), pp. 40, 56–61 (where the origin of the name
“Patagonian” is wrongly given).

[90] The guanaco, a species of llama. See also Vol. II, p. 34, note 5*.

[91] Hence arose the name “Patagonians” or “men with big feet,”
given by Magalhães, because of the awkward appearance of the feet in
such coverings, which were stuffed with straw for greater warmth.

[92] The words “somewhat thicker than those of a lute” are lacking
in MS. 5,650.

[93] This sentence is omitted by MS. 5,650.

[94] Eden (p. 251) says “two,” and following says that Magalhaes
gave the giant “certeyne haukes belles and other great belles, with
alſo a lookynge glaſſe, a combe, and a payre of beades of
glaſſe.”

[95] MS. 5,650 adds: “on the face.”

[96] MS. 5,650 omits “face.”

[97] “For the smiths” is omitted by MS. 5,650.

[98] Maximilianus Transylvanus says that only one Patagonian was
captured, but that he died shortly from self-starvation (Vol. I, pp.
314, 315). The “Roteiro” says (Stanley, p. 5) that three or four
were captured, but all died except one, who went to Spain in the “San
Antonio.” Pigafetta’s account, as given by an eyewitness, is to be
preferred.

[99] MS. 5,650 reads: “for otherwise they could have caused some of
our men trouble.” Below Stanley (p. 53) again mistranslates the
French “forces” as “forks.”

[100] MS. 5,650 adds: “of malefactors,” and reads farther: “and
their faces lighted up at seeing those manacles.”

[101] MS. 5,650 reads: “and they were grieved that they could not
take the irons with their hands, for they were hindered by the other
things that they were holding.” Eden (p. 252) says at the end of his
account of the capture: “Being thus taken, they were immediately
ſeperate and put in ſundry ſhyppes.”

[102] MS. 5,650 adds: “that is, the big devil.”

Arber in his introduction to The first three English books on America
says that Shakespeare had access to The decades of the newe worlde of
Eden, and created the character of Caliban (who invokes Setebos) in the
Tempest from the description of the Patagonian giants. See also World
encompassed by Sir Francis Drake (Hakluyt Society edition), p. 48, for
mention of the god Settaboth.

[103] MS. 5,650 reads: “the wife of one of the giants who had
remained behind in irons.”

[104] MS. 5,650 makes this plural.

[105] See ante, note 103.

[106] This word is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[107] MS. 5,650 adds: “in their language.”

[108] MS. 5,650 omits this sentence.

[109] MS. 5,650 reads “instead of taking medicine.” See Jesuit
Relations and Allied Documents (Cleveland reissue) for examples of
medicine and surgery as practiced by the North American Indians.

[110] MS. 5,650 reads “two feet or so.”

[111] MS. 5,650 reads “cut short and shaven like religious.” Hans
Stade also notices the tonsure among the Indians who captured him (see
Captivity of Hans Stade, Hakluyt Society edition, pp. 136–138, and
note, from which it appears that this manner of wearing the hair, was
practiced among many Tupi tribes).

[112] Stanley (p. 55) does not translate this sentence, but gives the
original from MS. 5,650.

[113] In MS. 5,650 this sentence reads as follows: “They seem to be
painted, and one of those enemies is taller than the others, and makes
a greater noise and gives expression to greater joy than the others.”

[114] Mosto (p. 59) mistranscribes or misprints “Setebas.” Roncagli
(Da punta arenas a Santo Cruz, in “Bollettino della Società
geografica italiana,” 1884, p. 775) says that the Patagonians
sacrificed to an evil spirit called “Wallichu.” Brinton, ut supra,
p. 328, says: “They are not without some religious rites, and are
accustomed to salute the new moon, and at the beginning of any solemn
undertaking to puff the smoke of their pipes to the four cardinal
points, just as did the Algonquins and Iroquois.”

[115] See ante, note 91. Stanley mistranscribes “Pataghoni” of MS.
5,650 as “Palaghom.”

[116] A reference to the gypsies who had made their appearance in Italy
as early as 1422, where they practiced various deceptions upon the
credulous people. The name “Cingani” or Zingari, as they are
generally called in Italy, comes from the Greek word t>asigqanoi, by
which they were called by Byzantine writers of the ix–xii centuries;
the same name appearing also in slightly different forms in Turkey,
Bulgaria, Roumania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Germany. Their ancestral home
was probably in northwestern India, whence they emigrated in successive
waves. In many countries extreme and harsh measures were taken against
them, especially in Germany, where they had appeared as early as 1417.
They were never allowed a foothold in France, but have become a
significant part of the population in Russia, Hungary, and Spain. In
the latter country, where they are called Gitános (Egyptians), in
spite of many severe laws passed against them until the reign of
Cárlos III, they continued, more fortunate than the Jews, to thrive.
They are mentioned by Cervantes in his Don Quixote (pt. i, chap, xxx),
but the name Gitáno had first appeared in a Spanish document of 1499,
where their customs are described. The few in Italy have been allowed
to remain, and those in the Slavic countries and England were generally
treated kindly. Their language is Aryan and was highly inflected; and
while they have been given many names by the nations among whom they
have lived, their own appellation is “Rom” “the man.” See New
International Encyclopedia (New York, 1903).

[117] MS. 5,650 reads: “capae;” but Stanley has mistranscribed
“capac.”

[118] “Albo (Navarrete iv, p. 215), the “Roteiro” (Stanley, p.
4), Transylvanus and Oviedo (Mosto, p. 59, note 3) give the date of
departure from Port San Julian August 24, 1520; but the second errs in
giving 5½ instead of 4½ months for the period for which the fleet
remained there. Peter Martyr places the date of departure as August 21.
Castanheda, who gives the same date says that the name “St. Julian”
or “of the ducks” was given to that bay which he calls a river.
Barros gives the date of arrival as April 2, and says that the place
was called “river of Saõ Julião.” See Mosto, ut supra.

[119] A portion of the passage relating to the attempted mutiny reads
as follows in MS. 5,650: “However the treason was discovered, and as
a consequence the treasurer was killed by a dagger and then quartered.
Gaspar de Casada was beheaded and then quartered. The overseer trying
shortly after to lead another mutiny, was banished together with a
priest and set ashore on that land of Pathagonia.” The Italian MS. is
badly confused, while the above is more in accordance with the facts,
and shows the hand of the translator and adapter. Eden (p. 252) says of
the attempted mutiny: “They remayned fyue monethes in this porte of
Sainte Iulian, where certeyne of the vnder capitaynes conſpirynge the
death of theyr general, were hanged and quartered: Amonge whom the
treaſurer Luigo of Mendozza was one. Certeyne of the other
conſpirators, he left in the ſayd land of Patogoni.” See the short
account of the mutiny given by Transylvanus in Vol. I, p. 317, and the
account given in the same volume, pp. 297, 299. The Roteiro (Stanley,
p. 3) says that three of the ships revolted against Magalhães”
saying that they intended to take him to Castile in arrest, as he was
taking them all to destruction;” but Magalhães subdued the mutiny by
the aid of the foreigners with him. Mendoza was killed by Espinosa the
chief constable of the fleet, and Gaspar Quesada was beheaded and
quartered. Alvaro de Mesquita, Magalhães’s cousin, is wrongly
reported to have been given command of one of the ships of those
killed, but the command of the “San Antonio” that had previously
been given to Antonio de Coca, after Magalhães had deprived Cartagena
of it, had been given him before the real outbreak of the mutiny.

The narrative of the mutiny as given by Navarrete (Col. de viages, iv,
pp. 34–38) which was compiled mainly from documents presented in the
same volume and from Herrera, is as follows:

“March 31, the eve of Palm Sunday, Magallanes entered the port of San
Julian, where he intended to winter, and consequently ordered the
rations to be served by measure. In view of that and of the barrenness
and cold of the country, the men asked Magallanes by various arguments
to increase the rations or turn back, since there was no hope of
finding the end of that country or any strait. But Magallanes replied
that he would either die or accomplish what he had promised; that the
king had ordered the voyage which he was to accomplish; and that he had
to sail until he found that land or some strait which must surely
exist; that in regard to the food, they had no reason to complain,
since that bay had an abundance of good fish, good water, many game
birds, and quantities of wood, and that bread and wine had not failed
them, nor would fail them if they would abide by the rule regarding
rations. Among other observations, he exhorted and begged them not to
be found wanting in the valorous spirit which the Castilian nation had
manifested and showed daily in greater affairs; and offering them
corresponding rewards in the king’s name. By such means did he quiet
the men.

“April 1, Palm Sunday, Magallanes summoned all his captains,
officers, and pilots to go ashore to hear mass and afterward to dine in
his ship. Alvaro de la Mezquita, Antonio de Coca, and all the men went
to hear mass. Louis de Mendoza, Gaspar de Quesada, and Juan de
Cartagena (the latter because he was a prisoner in Quesada’s keeping)
did not go, however; and Alvaro de la Mezquita alone went to dine with
Magallanes.

“During the night, Gaspar de Quesada and Juan de Cartagena with about
thirty armed men of the ship ‘Concepcion’ went to the ‘San
Antonio,’ where Quesada requested that the captain, Alvaro de la
Mezquita, be surrendered to him, and told the crew of the ship to seize
it, as they had already done with the ‘Concepcion’ and
‘Victoria.’ [He said] that they already knew how Magallanes had
treated and was treating them, because they had asked him to fulfil the
king’s orders; that they were lost men; and that they should help him
make another request of Magallanes, and if necessary, seize him. Juan
de Elorriaga, the master of the ‘San Antonio,’ spoke in favor of
his captain, Alvaro de la Mezquita, saying to Gaspar de Quesada: ‘I
summon you, in God’s name and that of the king, Don Cárlos, to go to
your ship, for the present is no time to go through the ships with
armed men; and I also summon you to release our captain.’ Thereupon
Quesada replied: ‘Must our deed remain unaccomplished because of this
madman?’ and drawing his dagger stabbed him four times in the arm,
thus overawing the men. Mezquita was kept prisoner, Elorriaga was cared
for, Cartagena went to the ship ‘Concepcion,’ while Quesada
remained in the ‘San Antonio.’ Thus were Quesada, Cartagena, and
Mendoza masters of the three ships, ‘San Antonio,’
‘Concepcion,’ and ‘Victoria.’

“Thereupon, they sent a message to Magallanes to the effect that they
held three ships and the small boats of all five at their disposal in
order to require him to fulfil his Majesty’s provisions. They said
that they had done that in order that he might no longer illtreat them
as he had done thitherto. If he would agree to fulfil his Majesty’s
orders, they would obey his commands, and [said] that if they had
thitherto treated him as a superior, they would thenceforth treat him
as a master, and would be most respectful to him.

“Magallanes sent word to them to come to his ship, where he would
hear them and do what was proper. They answered that they did not dare
come lest he illtreat them, but that he should go to the ship ‘San
Antonio,’ where they would all assemble and decide definitely on what
the king’s orders commanded.

“Magallanes believing that boldness was more useful than meekness in
the face of such actions, determined to employ craft and force
together. He kept the small boat of the ship ‘San Antonio’ which
was used for those negotiations, at his ship; and sent the alguacil,
Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, in the skiff belonging to his ship, to the
‘Victoria,’ with six men armed secretly and a letter for the
treasurer, Luis de Mendoza, in which he told the latter to come to the
flagship. While the treasurer was reading the letter and smiling as if
to say ‘You don’t catch me that way,’ Espinosa stabbed him in the
throat, while another sailor stabbed him at the same instant on the
head so that he fell dead. Magallanes, being a man with foresight, sent
a boat under command of Duarte Barbosa, sobresaliente of the
‘Trinidad’ with fifteen armed men, who entering the ‘Victoria’
flung the banner to the breeze without any resistance. That happened on
April 2. Then the ‘Victoria’ approached the flagship, and they
together immediately approached the ‘Santiago.’

“On the following day, the ‘San Antonio’ and the ‘Concepcion’
which were held by Quesada and Cartagena tried to put to sea, but it
was necessary for them to pass close to the flagship which stood
farthest out. The ‘San Antonio’ raised two anchors, and being in
danger with one, Quesada determined to free Alvaro de la Mezquita, whom
he held a prisoner in his ship, in order to send him to Magallanes to
arrange peace between them. Mezquita, however, told him that nothing
would be obtained. Finally, they arranged that when they set sail,
Mezquita should station himself forward and ask Magallanes as they
approached his ship, not to fire and that they would anchor provided
affairs would be settled favorably.

“Before setting sail in the ‘San Antonio,’ where they were
endangered, as it was night and the crew were asleep, the ship dragged
and ran foul of the flagship. The latter discharged some large and
small shots and men leaped aboard the ‘San Antonio’ crying, ‘For
whom are you?’ they responding, ‘For the king, our sovereign, and
your Grace,’ surrendered to Magallanes. The latter seized Quesada,
the accountant, Antonio de Coca, and other sobresalientes who had gone
to the ‘San Antonio’ with Quesada. Then he sent to the
‘Concepcion’ for Juan de Cartagena and imprisoned him with them.

“Next day Magallanes ordered the body of Mendoza taken ashore and had
it quartered, and Mendoza cried as a traitor. On the seventh, he
ordered Gaspar de Quesada beheaded and quartered with a like cry. That
was done by Quesada’s own follower and sobresaliente, Luis de Molino,
in order to save himself from hanging, for that sentence had been
passed on him. Magallanes sentenced Juan de Cartagena and the lay
priest, Pedro Sanchez de la Reina, who had been active in causing the
men to mutiny, to be marooned in that country. He pardoned more than
forty men who merited death, as they were needed to work the ships, and
so that he might not excite hard feelings by the severity of the
punishment.”

Brito’s account of the mutiny (Navarrete, iv, p. 307) is very brief
and unsatisfactory: “In that port the captains began to ask him where
he was taking them, especially one Juan de Cartagena, who said that he
had a royal cedula naming him as associate with Magallanes, as Rui
Falero would also have been, had he been there. Then they tried to rise
against Magallanes and kill him, and go back to Castilla or to Rodas.
From that point they went to the river of Santa Cruz, where they
endeavored to put their plan in execution. But when Magallanes
discovered their ill-considered attempt, for the captains said that
they would kill him or take him prisoner, he ordered his ship armed and
Juan de Cartagena arrested. As soon as the other captains saw their
chief arrested they thought no longer of prosecuting their attempt.
Magallanes, however, seized them all, for most of the crew were in his
favor. He sent the merino or alguacil to kill Luis de Mendoza with his
dagger, for the latter refused to be arrested; while he had another
named Gaspar Quesada beheaded. When they set sail, he left Juan de
Cartagena together with a secular priest ashore at a place where there
were no inhabitants.”

Correa (Stanley, pp. 247–250) gives a different and imperfect account
of the meeting.

Cf. with these accounts the one given by Guillemard (Magellan), pp.
162–174. When the “San Antonio” deserted, Esteban Gomez is said
to have rescued Cartagena and the priest. João Serrão (after the loss
of the “Santiago”) was given command of the “Concepcion,”
Mesquita of the “San Antonio,” and Duarte Barbosa of the
“Victoria,” all Portuguese (Guillemard, ut supra, p. 179). It is
rather singular that Sir Francis Drake should also have faced a mutiny
in this same port, where Thomas Doughty was executed. That the history
of Magalhães’s expedition was generally known is evident from the
following: “The next day after, being the twentieth of June, wee
harboured ourselues againe in a very good harborough, called by
Magellan Port S. Julian, where we found a gibbet standing upon the
maine, which we supposed to be the place where Magellan did execution
upon some of his disobedient and rebellious company.” World
encompassed (Hakluyt Society edition), p. 234.

[120] MS. 5,650 reads: “twenty-five leagues.”

[121] Instead of this last phrase, MS. 5,650 reads: “and very little
of that.” The account of the shipwreck and rescue as given here is
very confusing and inadequate. Cf. Guillemard, ut supra, pp. 175–179,
and Navarrete, iv, pp. 38, 39. One man was lost, namely, the negro
slave of João Serrão. The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 4) gives the
briefest mention of it. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 307) says: “After
this [i.e., the mutiny], they wintered for three months; and Magallanes
again ordered the ship ‘Santiago’ to go ahead in order to explore.
The ship was wrecked but all of its crew were saved.” Correa’s
account (Stanley, p. 250) is very short, and mentions that only the
hull of the vessel was lost.

[122] Mosto (p. 60, note 3) derives this word from the Spanish
mejillon, a variety of cockle, which he thinks may be the Mytilus or
common mussel.

[123] See Vol. II, p. 34, note 5*.

[124] Eden (p. 252) says: “52. degree ... lackynge a thyrde parte.”

[125] MS. 5,650 omits: “and the holy bodies,” and has in its place:
“by His grace.”

[126] MS. 5,650 omits these last two words. The Italian form braccio is
retained in view of these words; for the Spanish braza is a measure
about equivalent to the English fathom, while the braccio, although
varying in different cities, is near three palmos (spans) in length.
The term is, however, translated brasse (“fathom”) in MS. 5,650.
Mosto (p. 60, note 8), conjectures this fish to be the Eliginus
maclovinus. Of this fish, Theodore Gill, the well-known ichthyologist,
says in a letter of May 22, 1905: “The Italian editor gave a shrewd
guess in the suggestion that the fish in question was what was formerly
called Eliginus maclovinus. The only vulgar name that I have been able
to find for it is ‘robalo,’ and this name is applied to it by the
Spanish-speaking people of both sides of South America. Like most
popular names, however, it is very misleading. ‘Robalo’ is the
Spanish name for the European bass, which is nearly related to our
striped bass or rock bass. To that fish the robalo of South America has
no affinity or real resemblance, and belongs to a very different family
peculiar to the southern hemisphere—the Nototheniids. The so-called
Eliginus maclovinus (properly, Eliginops maclovinus) is the most common
and widely distributed species and probably the one obtained by the
fleet of Magalhães.”

[127] Of the river Santa Cruz and the stay there, Albo (Navarrete, iv,
p. 215) says: “We left that place [i.e., Port San Julian] on the 24th
of the said month [of August] and coasted along to the southwest by
west. About 30 leguas farther on, we found a river named Santa Cruz,
which we entered on the 26th of the same month. We stayed there until
the day of San Lucas, the 18th of the month of October. We caught many
fish there and got wood and water. That coast extends northeast by east
and southwest by west, and is an excellent coast with good
indentations.” The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 4) places the river
Santa Cruz twenty leagues from San Julian and in about 50°. That
narrative says that the four remaining boats continued to pick up the
wreckage of the “Santiago” until September 18. The name Santa Cruz
was said to have been given to the river because they entered it on
September 14, the day of the exaltation of the holy cross (see Stanley,
p. 4, note 4, and Mosto, p. 60, note 7), but Kohl (Mosto, ut supra)
attributes the name to João Serrão who was near that river on May 3,
1520, the day on which the church celebrates the feast of the finding
of the holy cross. Navarrete (iv, p. 41) cites Herrera as authority for
an eclipse of the sun that happened while at this river on October 11,
1520. Guillemard (ut supra, pp. 187, 188) is disinclined to believe the
report, although he mentions an annular eclipse of the sun on October
20, 1520, which was however not visible in Patagonia. Navarrete (ut
supra) says that Magalhães gave instructions to his captains here
“saying that he would follow those coasts until finding a strait or
the end of that continent, even if he had to go to a latitude of 75°;
that before abandoning that enterprise, the ships might be twice
unrigged; and that after that he would go in search of Maluco toward
the east and east northeast, by way of the cape of Buena Esperanza and
the island of San Lorenzo.”

A new chapter begins at this point in MS. 5,650, being simply headed
“chapter.”

[128] The anonymous Portuguese who accompanied Duarte Barbosa says 53°
30´; Barros, 52° 56´; Elcano, 54°; and Albo, 52° 30´. Mosto, p.
60, note 9.

[129] MS. 5.650 has the words in brackets.

[130] Eden (p. 252) says of the strait: “they founde the ſtraight
nowe cauled the ſtraight of Magellanus, beinge in ſum place C.x.
leagues in length: and in breadth ſumwhere very large and in other
places lyttle more than halfe a league in bredth.” Stanley (p. 57) is
uncertain of the French et quasi autant de largeur moins de demye
lieue, which is (translated freely) simply “something like almost a
half-league wide.” The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 7) says that the
channel “at some places has a width of three leagues, and two, and
one, and in some places half a league.” Transylvanus (Vol. I, p. 320)
gives the width as two, three, five, or ten Italian miles; Gomara, two
leagues or so; Barros, one league at the mouth, and the strait, from a
musket or cannon shot to one and one and one-half leagues; Castanheda,
at the mouth as wide as two ships close together, then opening up to
one league; Peter Martyr, a sling-shot’s distance in places. (Mosto,
p. 61, note 2.)

[131] Proise or Proi (proy, proic) is an ancient Catalonian word
meaning the “bow moorings;” Cf. Jal, Glossaire nautìque (Mosto, p.
61, note 3). The old Spanish word is “proís,” which signifies both
the thing to which the ship is moored ashore, and the rope by which it
is moored to the shore.

[132] This passage is as follows in MS. 5,650: “The said strait was a
circular place surrounded with mountains (as I have said), and the
majority of the sailors thought that there was no exit from it into the
said Pacific Sea. But the captain-general declared that there was
another strait which led out, and that he knew that well, for he had
seen it on a marine chart of the king of Portugal. That map had been
made by a renowned sailor and pilot, named Martin de Boesme. The said
captain sent two of his ships forward—one named the ‘Sainct
Anthoine,’ and the other the ‘Conception’—in order that they
might look for and discover the exit from the said strait, which was
called the cape de la Baya.”

Martin de Behaim (Beham, Behem, Behemira, Behen, Bœhem), Bhm) was
born about 1459 (some say also in 1430 or 1436) of a family originally
from Bohemia, in Nuremberg, Germany, and died at Lisbon, July 29, 1506.
He was a draper in Flanders, 1477–1479, after which he went to Lisbon
(1480) where he became acquainted with Columbus. In 1484 he was chosen
geographer of Diego Cam’s expedition to Western Africa. On his
return, he received the order of knighthood in the military order of
Christ of Portugal; after which he went to the island of Fayal in the
Azores where he became interested in colonization and agriculture, and
married the daughter of the governor. In 1491 he returned to Germany,
where he lived at Nuremberg until 1493, and where, at the request of
his townsmen, he constructed an immense globe on the information of
Ptolemy, Strabo, and others, which contains many errors (see facsimile
in Guillemard), In 1493 he returned to Lisbon, and in 1494 to Fayal,
where he remained until 1506, when he went to Lisbon. Many myths sprung
up about him, such that he had visited America before Columbus and the
straits of Magellan before Magalhães, the latter of whom he may have
known at Lisbon. See Rose, New Biographical Dictionary (London, 1848);
Grande Encyclopédie (Paris, Lamirault et Cie.); and Guillemard, pp.
73, 74.

See Guillemard (ut supra, pp. 189–198) for a discussion of knowledge
regarding the existence of a strait to the south of the American
continent, prior to Magalhães’s discovery and passage of it.
Guillemard, after weighing the evidence for and against, decides that
there may have been a “more or less inexact knowledge of the
existence of some antarctic break “that would allow access to the
eastern world.

[133] Possession Bay, according to Mosto, p. 61, note 5, but Guillemard
(pp. 199, 200) thinks it may have been Lomas Bay.

[134] Probably Anegada Point to the northwest of Cape Orange.

[135] The “First Narrows” or Primera Garganta, just beyond Anegada
Point.

[136] Lago de los Estrechos, St. Philip’s Bay, or Boucant Bay.

[137] The “Second Narrows” and Broad Reach.

[138] MS. 5,650 does not mention the smoke signals.

[139] MS. 5,650 reads: “When near us they suddenly discharged a
number of guns, whereat we very joyously saluted them with artillery
and cries.”

[140] The first is the passage east of Dawson Island, which extends to
the northeast into Useless Bay and to the southeast into Admiralty
Sound. The second opening was the passage between the western side of
Dawson Island and Brunswick Peninsula.

[141] Esteban Gomez was an experienced Portuguese navigator and pilot
with ambitions only less than those of Magalhães, his kinsman
(Guillemard, p. 203). His desertion occurred probably in the first part
of November, and was perhaps directly due to pique at what he
considered lack of appreciation from Magalhães. Conspiring with
Gerónimo Guerra, the notary, who was elected captain of the “San
Antonio” they made off with that ship, and after imprisoning Alvaro
de Mezquita, returned to Spain, anchoring at Sevilla May 6, 1521. There
Gomez was imprisoned after the return of the “Victoria,” but was
liberated, and in 1524 proposed an expedition to discover a northwest
passage. An expedition having been fitted out by Cárlos I, he coasted
Florida and the eastern coast, as far as Cape Cod, and returned to
Spain in 1525. See Grande Encyclopédie; Navarrete, iv, pp. 42–45,
and 201–208; and Guillemard, ut supra, pp. 203–205.

Brito’s story of the exploration of the strait and the loss of the
“San Antonio” (Navarrete, iv, pp. 307, 308) is as follows: “They
left that place [i.e., the river of Santa Cruz] on October 20, and went
to enter a strait of which they had no knowledge. The entrance of the
strait extends for about 15 leguas; and after they had entered, it
seemed to them that it was all land-locked, and they accordingly
anchored there. Magallanes sent a Portuguese pilot named Juan Carballo
ashore with orders to ascend a mountain in order to ascertain whether
there was any outlet. Carballo returned saying that it appeared
land-locked to him. Thereupon Magallanes ordered the ships ‘San
Antonio’ and the ‘Concepcion’ to go in advance in order to
explore the strait. After having gone ahead for about 30 leguas, they
returned to tell Magallanes that the river went farther but that they
could not tell where it would take them. Upon receiving that
information Magallanes weighed anchor with all three ships, and
advanced along the strait until reaching the point to which the others
had explored. Then he ordered the ‘San Antonio’ of which Alvaro de
Mezquito, his cousin, was captain, and Esteban Gomez, a Portuguese
pilot, to go ahead and explore a southern channel that opened in the
strait. That ship did not return to the others and it is not known
whether it returned to Castilla or whether it was wrecked. Magallanes
proceeded with his remaining ships until he found an exit.”
Correa’s account of the desertion of the “San Antonio” is as
usual with him, inadequate, and evidently based on hearsay evidence
(see Stanley, p. 250).

[142] Literally “brother;” but to be understood probably as the
expression cugino germano, “cousin german.”

[143] MS. 5,650 begins this sentence as follows: “But that ship lost
its time, for the other.”

[144] Guillemard (p. 206) conjectures from the records of Albo,
Pigafetta, and Herrera that the river of Sardines is Port Gallant which
is located on the Brunswick Peninsula, opposite the Charles Islands.
Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 215) says that after taking the course to the
northwest they sailed about 15 leagues before anchoring.

[145] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 216) says that the two capes at the exit
of the strait were called Fermosa and Deseado, this latter being Cape
Pillar (see Guillemard, map facing p. 198).

[146] MS. 5,650 adds: “which were on the other side.”

[147] João Serrão, the brother of Magalhães’s staunchest friend
Francisco Serrão, and a firm supporter of the great navigator.
Pigafetta errs in calling him a Spaniard (see p. 183), though he may
have become a naturalized Spaniard, since the register speaks of him as
a citizen of Sevilla. One document (Navarrete, iv, p. 155) calls him a
Portuguese pilot, and Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) a Castilian. He was
an experienced navigator and captain, and had served under Vasco da
Gama, Almeida, and Albuquerque. Vasco da Gama (on his second voyage,
1502–1503) made him captain of the ship “Pomposa” which was built
in Mozambique where he was left to attend to Portuguese affairs. On
this expedition he saw the coast of Brazil for the first time, for
Vasco da Gama’s fleet, ere doubling the Cape of Good Hope, crossed to
the Brazilian coast, which they followed as far as Cape Santo
Agostinho. He fought bravely in the battle of Cananor under Almeida
(March 16, 1506, in which Magalhães also participated). He was chief
captain of three caravels in August, 1510, in Eastern water, and was in
the Java seas in 1512, but must have returned to Portugal soon after
that, for he was there in 1513; although he seems to have been
appointed clerk at the fortress of Calicut in the latter year. He
embarked with Magalhães as captain and pilot of the “Santiago,”
but after the wreck of that vessel near port San Julian was given
command of the “Concepcion,” in which he later explored the strait.
Failing to dissuade Magalhães from attacking the natives of Matan, he
became commander, with Duarte Barbosa, of the fleet at Magalhães’s
death, and was murdered by the Cebuans after the treacherous banquet
given by them to the fleet. See Guillemard (ut supra), and Stanley’s
Three voyages of Vasco da Gama (Hakluyt Society publications, London,
1869).

[148] MS. 5,650 reads as follows: “Such was the method ordered by the
captain from the beginning, in order that the ship that happened to
become separated from the others might rejoin the fleet.” Then it
adds: “Thereupon the crew of the said ship did what the captain had
ordered them and more, for they set two banners with their letters,”
etc.

[149] “The island of Santa Magdalena (Mosto, p. 62, note 11).

[150] According to Guillemard the river of Isleo (or “of Islands”)
is located on Brunswick Peninsula, and is identified with the port of
San Miguel, just east of the “River of Sardines;” the island where
the cross was planted would be one of the Charles Islands.

[151] The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 3) mentions that the day at the
port of San Julian was about seven hours long; while the anonymous
Portuguese (Stanley, p. 30) says that the sun only appeared for some
“four hours each day” in June and July. Transylvanus says the
nights in the strait were not longer than five hours.

[152] MS. 5,650 adds: “which is the collateral wind between the east
and south.”

[153] MS. 5,650 adds: “and anchorages.”

[154] Various kinds of these umbelliferous parsley plants are still to
be found in Patagonia, where they are highly esteemed (Mosto, p. 63,
note 3).

[155] MS. 5,650 reads: “I do not believe that there is a more
beautiful country or a better strait than that.” See Albo’s
description of the strait, in Vol. I, pp. 264–265; that of
Transylvanus, Vol. I, pp. 319–321; and that in World encompassed
(Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 236, 237 (this last account also
mentioning the difficulty of finding water sufficiently shallow for
anchoring). The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) says that the
strait was called the “Strait of Victoria, because the ship
‘Victoria’ was the first that had seen it: some called it the
Strait of Magalhaens because our captain was named Fernando de
Magalhaens.” Castanheda says that Magalhães gave it the name of
“bay of All Saints” because it was discovered on November 1; and
San Martin in his reply to Magalhães’s request for opinions
regarding the continuance of the expedition calls it “channel of All
Saints:” but this name was first applied to only one gulf or one
branch and later extended to the entire channel. This name is found in
the instructions given for the expedition of Sebastian Cabot in 1527,
and in the map made that same year at Sevilla by the Englishman Robert
Thorne. Sarmiento de Gamboa petitioned Felipe II that it be called
“strait of the Mother of God.” It was also called “strait of
Martin Behaim.” The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) says that
the strait is 400 miles long. The “Roterio” (Stanley, pp. 7, 8)
says that it is 100 leagues in length, and that in traversing it, they
“sailed as long as it was daylight, and anchored when it was
night.” Transylvanus (Vol. I, p. 320) gives the length as 100 Spanish
miles; Oviedo, 100 or 110 leagues; Herrera, 100 leagues, and twenty
days to navigate; Gomara, 110 to 120 leagues; Peter Martyr, 110
leagues. See Mosto, p. 60, note 10, and p. 62, note 2; and ante, note
130.

[156] These fish are: a species of Coryphæna; the Thymnus albacora,
and the Thymnus plamys.

[157] From the Spanish golondrina, the sapphirine gurnard or tubfish
(Trigla hirundo).

[158] MS. 5,650 reads: “one foot or more.”

[159] At this point in the original Italian MS., which ends a page,
occurs the heading of the following page Sequitur Vocabuli pataghoni,
that is, “Continuation of Patagonian words.”

[160] Literally: “for the nature of women.”

[161] MS. 5,650 presents the following differences in the list of
Patagonian words from the Italian MS.


       Eyes                    ather
       Eyelashes               occhechl

       Ship                    theu
       To run                  haim
       Ostrich eggs            jan

       Red cloth               terechai
       Black                   amel

       A goose                 chache
       Their little devils     Cheleult


In the above list, chen corresponds in the Italian MS. to ehen, the
equivalent of “no;” theu is “ship” in the above, and “snow”
in the Italian; courire (the equivalent of covrire or coprire, “to
cover”) in the Italian, becomes courir (“to run”) in MS. 5,650.
All are to be regarded as errors of the French. Certain words are left
in Italian in MS. 5,650, which are as follows: la copa; alcalcagno;
(Italian MS. al calcagno); homo squerzo (Italian MS. sguerco); a la
pignate (Italian MS. pigniata); alstruzzo vcelo (Italian MS. al seruzo
ucelo); and alcocinare (Italian MS. al coçinare). Stanley offers this
as proof that MS. 5,650 was written by Pigafetta, and not translated
from his Italian, but it furnishes no evidence that Pigafetta even saw
the French version of his relation. It must be remembered that Stanley
did not himself see the Italian MS. but only the Amoretti mutilation of
it (from which, and from MS. 5,650, he reproduces the vocabulary,
without English translation); and hence bases his observations on that
and the conjectures of its editor. Stanley points out the fact that
Amoretti has omitted several words of this list, but they are all in
the Italian MS. A sad blunder has been made by Stanley in his
transcription of La pouldre dherbe qui mangent whose Patagonian
equivalent is capac. He transcribes as follows: la pouldre d’herbe
with Patagonian equivalent qui (which it is to be noted is only the
wrong form of the French relative), and mangent with Patagonian
equivalent capac, explaining mangent in a footnote as “Food, the root
used as bread.” Stanley also makes the following mistranscriptions:
orescho for oresche (“nostrils”); canneghin for caimeghin (“palm
of the hand”); ochy for ochii (“bosom”); scancos for scaneos
(“testicles”); hou for hoii (“buttocks”); ohoy for ohon
(“pulse”); cartschem for cartscheni (“sole of the foot”); chol
for thol (“heart”); om for oni (“wind”); aschame for aschanie
(“earthen pot”); oamaghei for oamaghce (“to fight”); amet for
amel (“black”); and ixecoles for jrocoles (“to cook”). Amoretti
has also made many errors (see Stanley’s First Voyage, pp. 62, 63).
Mosto, who is on the whole a faithful transcriber, has sacancos as the
Patagonian equivalent of a li testiculi; om jani for a li sui, the
correct forms of the latter being jani and a li sui oui; and tcrechai
for the equivalent of “red cloth.” Eden (p. 252) gives only the
following words: “breade, Capar: water, Oli: redde clothe, Cherecai:
red colour, Cheiche: blacke colour, Amel.”

Mosto (p. 63, note 8) gives the following words from the vocabulary of
the Tehuel-ches compiled by the second lieutenant of the ship
“Roncagli,” which correspond almost exactly with those given by
Pigafetta.


             English   Roncagli   Pigafetta
             Nose      or         or
             eye       óthel      other
             hand      tzén       chene
             ear       sha        sane
             ostrich   óyue       hoi hoi


Brinton (American Race, p. 328) cites Ramon Lista (Mis exploraciones y
descubrìmientos en Patagonia, Buenos Ayres, 1880) in proof that the
language of the Patagonians has undergone but slight change since the
time of Pigafetta. See also lists of words in Brinton (ut supra), p.
364, from the Patagonian and Fuegian languages. The vocabularies given
by Horatio Hale (Wilkes’s U. S. Exploring Expedition, 1838–1842,
Philadelphia, 1846, viii, pp. 651–656) bear no resemblance to
Pigafetta’s vocabulary. Hale says that guttural sounds are frequent
among the Indians of the Patagonian district.

[162] MS. 5,650 reads: “capae.”

[163] Cf. with the methods of fire-making used by the North American
Indians in Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents (Cleveland reissue);
see also Captivity of Hans Stade (Hakluyt Society edition), p. 126.

At this point (folio 14a) in the original Italian MS. occurs the first
chart, representing the straits of Magellan (see p. 86). The cardinal
points in all of Pigafetta’s charts are the reverse of the ordinary,
the north being below and the south above. MS. 5,650 precedes this
chart (which there occupies folio 21a) by the words: “Below is
depicted the strait of Patagonie.” Immediately following this chart
in the Italian MS. (folio 15a) is the chart of the Ysole Infortunate
(“Unfortunate Isles;” see p. 92). These islands are shown in MS.
5,650 on folio 23a, with the following notice: “Here are shown the
two islands called ‘Unfortunate Islands.’” The charts in the
Italian MS. are brown or dull black on a blue ground.

[164] The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 9) says that Magalhães left the
strait November 26 (having entered it October 21); the anonymous
Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) and Peter Martyr (Mosto, p. 65, note 1),
November 27.

[165] MS. 5,650 reads: “And we ate only biscuits that had fallen to
powder, which was quite full of worms, and stank from the filth of the
urine of rats that covered it, and of which the good had been eaten.”
Eden (p. 252) reads: “And hauynge in this tyme conſumed all theyr
byſket and other vyttales, they fell into ſuche neceſſitie that
they were inforced to eate the pouder that remayned therof beinge nowe
full of woormes and ſtynkynge lyke pyſſe by reaſon of the ſalte
water,” Herrera (Navarrete, iv, p. 51) says that the rice was cooked
with salt water.

[166] A curious coincidence in view of Magalhães’s answer to Esteban
Gomez at a council called in the strait to discuss the continuance of
the voyage that “although he had to eat the cowhide wrappings of the
yardarms, he would still persevere and discover what he had promised
the emperor” (Navarrete, iv, p. 43; cited from Herrera). At that
council André de San Martin, pilot in the “San Antonio,” advised
that they continue explorations until the middle of January, 1521, and
then return to Spain; and urged that no farther southward descent be
made, and that navigation along so dangerous coasts be only by day, in
order that the crew might have some rest (Navarrete, iv, pp. 45–49).

[167] MS. 5,650 reads: “enough of them.”

[168] This was the scurvy. Navarrete (iv, p. 54) following a document
conserved in Archivo general de Indias, says that only eleven men died
of scurvy during the voyage from the strait to the Ladrones.

[169] The anonymous Portuguese says (Stanley, p. 31) that after sailing
west and northwest for 9,858 miles, the equator was reached. At the
line (“Roteiro,” Stanley, p. 9), Magalhães changed the course in
order to strike land north of the Moluccas, as “he had information
that there were no provisions” there.

[170] MS. 5,650 reads: “It is well named Pacific.”

[171] MS. 5,650 adds: “which is a large fish called tiburoni.” The
anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31), says that the Unfortunate
Islands were met before the line was reached and were eight hundred
miles distant from one another. One was called St. Peter (in 18°) and
the other the island of Tiburones (in 14°). Transylvanus (Vol. I, p.
321), Herrera, and Oviedo, say that the three vessels stopped two days
at those islands for supplies, but Albo’s journal (Navarrete, iv, p.
218) indicates that no stop was made there. The “Roteiro” (Stanley,
p. 9), gives the latitude of these islands as 18° or 19° and 13° or
14°. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 218) says that the first was discovered
January 24 in 16° 15´, and was called San Pablo, because that was the
date of St. Paul’s conversion; and the island of Tiburones was
discovered February 4, in 10° 40´, at a distance of 9° (sic) from
the former. Eden (p. 253) says that the second island lay in 5°. These
two islands were probably Puka-puka (the Honden Eyland of the Dutch
atlases) of the Tuamotu group, located in latitude 14° 45´ south, and
longitude 138° 48´ west; and Flint Island of the Manihiki group,
located in latitude 11° 20´ south and longitude 151° 48´ west. The
latter is still uninhabited, but the former contains a population of
over four hundred. See ante, note 163. See Guillemard, p. 220, and
Mosto, p. 65, note 6.

[172] MS. 5,650 reads: “now at the stern, now at the windward side,
or otherwise.” Amoretti changes this passage completely, reading:
“According to our measurement of the distance that we made with the
chain astern, we ran from sixty to seventy leagues daily.” Many
basing themselves on this passage of Amoretti, have believed that the
log was in use at the time of the first circumnavigation. Dr. Breusing
(Die Catena a poppa bei Pigafetta und die Logge, in “Zeitschrift der
Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin,” 1869, iv, pp. 107–115)
believes that the “stern chain (catena poppa) is not the log properly
so-called, but an instrument for determining the angle of the ship’s
leeway, an opinion accepted also by Gelcich in his La scoperta
d’America e Cristoforo Colombo nella letteratura moderna (Gorizia,
1890). L’Vzielle (Studi bibliogr. e biogr. sulla storia della geogr.
in Italia, Roma, 1875, part ii, introduction, pp. 294–296), combats
that opinion, as well as the idea that the log is meant. The difficulty
of the passage, he says, hinges on the word ho and whether it is
interpreted as a verb or a conjunction. If it be a conjunction then the
passage, means “estimating by sight, the rate of the ship from the
‘bow catena,’ or at the stern” (‘catena’ being a beam
perpendicular to the ship’s axis at the point near the bow where it
begins to curve inward; that is, at such a point that from that place
to the stern, the direction of the apparent way is parallel to the
longitudinal axis of the ship) his ship made fifty, sixty, or seventy
leagues.” One might suppose, if ho be regarded as a verb, that
Pigafetta called catena a cross beam of the stern (the passage reading
“the catena that was at the stern”); or that the disjunctive ho,
“or” is used in place of e, “and,” and that Pigafetta, dividing
the distance between the stern and the bow catena by the time necessary
for a fixed point of the sea to pass from the elevation of the bow to
that of the stern, thus deduced the ship’s rate. See Mosto, p. 66,
note 1. L’Vzielli’s opinion is the most probable, for although the
log is mentioned by Purchas as early as 1607, its use did not become
general until 1620. An instrument used to measure the rates of vessels
is mentioned as early as 1577, but it was very deficient.

[173] The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 6) says that this cape, which he
calls “cape of the virgins” was discovered on October 21, 1520, and
lay in latitude about 52° south. Barros says that it was discovered on
October 20; and Transylvanus and Oviedo, on November 27. See Mosto, p.
61, note 1.

[174] Regarding the reckonings Eden says: “In ſo much that it was
neceſſarie to helpe the needle with the lode ſtone (commonly cauled
the adamant) before they could ſaile therwith, bycauſe it moued not
as it doothe when it is in theſe owre partes.” Eden also gives a cut
of the “ſtarres abowt the pole Antartike.” The same author also
(pp. 277–280) compiles from Amerigo Vespucci and Andreas de Corsali a
treatise entitled “Of the Pole Antartike and the stars abowt the same
and of the qualitie of the regions and disposition of the Elementes
abowt the Equinoctiall line. Alſo certeyne ſecreates touching the
arte of ſaylynge.” The former says: “The pole Antartike hath
nother the great beare nor the lyttle as is ſeene abowte owre pole.
But hath foure ſtarres whiche compaſſe it abowt in forme of a
quadrangle. When these are hydden, there is ſeene on the lefte ſyde a
bryght Canopus of three ſtarres of notable greatneſſe, whiche beinge
in the myddeſt of heauen, repreſenteth this figure.” The latter
says: “Here we ſawe a marueylous order of ſtarres, ſo that in the
parte of heauen contrary to owre northe pole, to knowe in what place
and degree the ſouth pole was, we tooke the day with the ſoonne, and
obſerued the nyght with the aſtrolabie, and ſaw manifeſtly twoo
clowdes of reaſonable bygneſſe mouynge abowt the place of the pole
continually nowe ryſynge and nowe faulynge, ſo keepynge theyr
continuall courſe in circular mouynge, with a ſtarre euer in the
myddeſt which is turned abowt with them abowte. xi. degrees frome the
pole. Aboue theſe appeareth a marueylous croſſe in the myddeſt of
fyue notable ſtarres which compaſſe it abowt.... This croſſe is so
fayre and bewtiful, that none other heuenly gne may be compared to
it....” These are the Magallanic clouds (Nuebecula major and Nubecula
minor) and the constellation of the Southern Cross or Crux. The
Magellanic clouds resemble portions of the milky way, Nubecula major
being visible to the naked eye in strong moonlight and covering about
two hundred times the moon’s surface, while the Nubecula minor,
although visible to the naked eye, disappears in full moonlight, and
covers an area only one-fourth that of the former. They were first
observed by the Arabians. The Portuguese pilots probably called them at
first “clouds of the cape.” (Mosto, p. 66, note 2). The Southern
Cross, which resembles a lute rather than a cross, was first erected
into a constellation by Royer in 1679, although often spoken of before
as a cross. Only one of its five principal stars belongs to the first
magnitude. The cross is only 6° in extent north and south and less
than that east and west.

The second chart of the plate at p. 92 represents the Ladrones Islands
and occurs in the Italian MS. at this point (folio 16b). This chart is
found on folio 25b in MS. 5,650, and is preceded by the inscription:
“The island of the robbers and the style of their boats.”

[175] MS. 5,650 reads: “During that time of two months and twelve
days.”

[176] Amoretti reads: “three degrees east of Capo Verde.” If the
cape is meant, the correction is proper, but if the islands, the MS. is
correct. See Mosto, p. 67, note 4.

[177] Cipangu is Japan, while Sumbdit Pradit may be the island of
Antilia, called “Septe citade” on Martin Behaim’s globe (Mosto,
p. 67, note 5). The locations given by Pigafetta prove that they did
not see them, but that he writes only from vague reports. Europe first
learned of Japan, near the end of the thirteenth century, through Marco
Polo, who had been told in China fabulous tales of the wealth of
Zipangu. This word is derived by Marco Polo from the Chinese
Dschi-pen-Kuë or Dschi-pon, which the Japanese have transformed into
Nippon or Nihon. See Travels of Marco Polo, book iii, ch. ii; and
Rein’s Japan, p. 4.

[178] See Vol. I, pp. 208, 209, 210, 312, 336.

[179] MS. 5,650 reads: “sixty.” Transylvanus (Vol. I, p. 322) names
two islands of the Ladrones Inuagana and Acacan, but says that both
were uninhabited. Guillemard (ut supra, p. 223) conjectures these names
to be identical with Agana in Guam and Sosan in Rota. Hugues (Mosto, p.
67, note 7) believes the first island visited to have been Guam, and
his conjecture is undoubtedly correct.

[180] MS. 5,650 adds: “called skiff.”

[181] MS. 5,650 adds: “of the said island.”

[182] MS. 5,650 has a new unnumbered chapter heading before the
following paragraph.

[183] This phrase is omitted in MS. 5,650, as is also all the following
sentence; but that MS. adds: “We left the said island immediately
afterward, and continued our course.” This was on March 9, on which
day the only Englishman in the fleet, “Master Andrew” of Bristol,
died (Guillemard, ut supra, p. 226).

[184] Eden (p. 254) says: “two hundreth of theyr boates.”

[185] MS. 5,650 has a new chapter at this point, although the chapter
is unnumbered.

When Loaisa’s expedition reached the Ladrones, they found still alive
a Galician, one of three deserters from Espinosa’s ship (see Vol. II,
pp. 30, 34, 35, 110). See the reception accorded Legazpi, and a
description of one of those islands in 1565, Vol. II, pp. 109–113.
The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 9) says that the expedition reached the
Ladrones, March 6, 1521 (with which Albo, Navarrete, iv, p. 219
agrees); and that after the theft of the skiff, Magellan landed with
fifty or sixty men, burned the whole village, killed seven or eight
persons, both men and women; and that supplies were taken aboard. The
anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) says that the Ladrones (which lay
in 10°–12° north latitude, were 2,046 miles by the course traveled
from the equator. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) says: “Thence [i.e.,
the Unfortunate Islands] they laid their course westward, and after
sailing 500 leguas came to certain islands where they found a
considerable number of savages. So many of the latter boarded the
vessels that when the men tried to restore order in them, they were
unable to get rid of the savages except by lance-thrusts. They killed
many savages, who laughed as if it were a cause for rejoicing.”

[186] MS. 5,650 adds: “or superior.”

[187] MS. 5,650 reads: “cloth.”

[188] At this point, MS. 5,650 begins a new sentence, thus: “There
are found in that place.”

[189] MS. 5,650 reads: “Those women.”

[190] MS. 5,650 makes use of the Italian word store for stuoje or stoje
meaning “mats,” and explains by adding: “which we call mats.”

[191] They also (according to Herrera) received the name Las Velas,
“the sails” from the lateen-rigged vessels that the natives used
(Mosto, p. 67, note 7). See also Vol. XVI, pp. 200–202.

[192] In MS. 5,650 this sentence reads as follows: “The pastime of
the men and women of the said place and their sport, is to go in their
boats to catch those flying fish with fishhooks made of fishbone.”

[193] Mosto (p. 68, note 5) says that these boats were the fisolere,
which were small and very swift oared-vessels, used in winter on the
Venetian lakes by the Venetian nobles for hunting with bows and arrows
and guns. Amoretti conjectures that Pigafetta means the fusiniere,
boats named after Fusine whence people are ferried to Venice.

[194] MS. 5,650 reads: “The said boats have no difference between
stern and bow.” Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 219), in speaking of the
boats of the Chamorros, uses almost identically the same expression:
“They went both ways, for they could make the stern, bow, and the
bow, stern, whenever they wished.” The apparatus described by
Pigafetta as belonging to these boats is the outrigger, common to many
of the boats of the eastern islands.

[195] In the Italian MS., the chart of Aguada ly boni segnaly
(“Watering-place of good signs”), Zzamal (Samar), Abarien, Humunu,
Hyunagan, Zuluam, Cenalo, and Ybusson (q.v., p. 102) follows at this
point. It is found on folio 29b of MS. 5,650 and is preceded by the
following: “Here is shown the island of Good Signs, and the four
islands, Cenalo, Humanghar, Ibusson, and Abarien, and several
others.”

[196] “The tenth of March” in Eden, and the distance of Zamal from
the Ladrones is given as “xxx. leagues.” Albo (Navarrete, iv, p.
220) says that the first land seen was called Yunagan, “which
extended north and had many bays;” and that going south from there
they anchored at a small island called Suluan. At the former “we saw
some canoes, and went thither, but they fled. That island lies in 9°
40´ north latitude.” The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 10) says that
the first land seen was in “barely eleven degrees,” and that the
fleet “went to touch at another further on, which appeared first.”
Two praus approached a boat sent ashore, whereupon the latter was
ordered back, and the praus fled. Thereupon the fleet went to another
nearby island “which lies in ten degrees, to which they gave the name
of the ‘Island of Good Signs,’ because they found some gold in
it.”

[197] This word is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[198] MS. 5,650 reads: “more than one foot long.”

[199] Since rice is an important staple among all the eastern islands,
it is natural that there are different and distinctive names for that
grain in the various languages and dialects for all stages of its
growth and all its modes of preparation. Thus the Tagálog has words
for “green rice,” “rice with small heads,” “dirty and partly
rotten rice,” “early rice,” “late rice,” “cooked rice,”
and many others. See also U. S. Philippine Gazetteer, pp. 70, 71.

[200] MS. 5,650 reads: “In order to explain what manner of fruit is
that above named, one must know that what is called ‘cochi’ is the
fruit borne by the palm-tree. Just as we have bread, wine, oil, and
vinegar, which are obtained from different things, so those people get
the above named substances from those palm-trees alone.” See
Delgado’s Historia, pp. 634–659, for description of the useful
cocoa palm; also, U. S. Philippine Gazetteer, pp. 72, 73, 75.

[201] MS. 5,650 reads: “along the tree.” Practically the method
used today to gather the cocoanut wine. See U. S. Philippine Gazetteer,
p. 75.

[202] In describing the cocoanut palm and fruit, Eden (p. 254) reads:
“Vnder this rynde, there is a thicke ſhell whiche they burne and
make pouder thereof and vſe it as a remedie for certeyne
diſeaſes.” He says lower, that the cocoanut milk on congealing
“lyeth within the ſhell lyke an egge.”

[203] MS. 5,650 reads: “By so doing they last a century.”

[204] Called “Suluan” by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 220). It is a
small island southeast of Samar. See ante, note 196. Dr. David P.
Barrows (Census of the Philippines, Washington, 1905, i, p. 413), says
that the men from Suluan “were perhaps not typical of the rest of the
population which Magellan found sparsely scattered about the coasts of
the central islands, but ... were almost certainly of the same stock
from which the present Visayan people are in the main descended.”
These natives had probably come, he says, “in successively extending
settlements, up the west coast of Mindanao from the Sulu archipelago.
‘Sulúan’ itself means ‘Where there are Suluges,’ that is, men
of Sulu or Joló.”

[205] MS. adds: “seeing that they were thus well dispositioned.”

[206] MS. 5,650 adds: “into the sea.”

[207] Albo calls it (Navarrete, iv, p. 220) the island of Gada (i.e.,
Aguada, “watering-place”) “where we took on water and wood, that
island being very free of shoals” (see ante, note 196). This island
is now called Homonhón, Jomonjol, or Malhón. Its greatest dimensions
are ten miles from northwest to southeast, and five miles from
northeast to southwest. It is eleven miles southwest from the nearest
point in Samar. It is called “Buenas Señas” on Murillo Velarde’s
map.

[208] The “Roteiro” (Stanley p. 11) says that the archipelago was
also called “Vall Sem Periguo,” or “Valley without Peril.” The
name “Filipinas” was not applied to them until 1542 by Villalobos
(see Vol. II, p. 48).

[209] Probably the jungle-fowl (Gallus bankiva) which is caught and
tamed in large numbers by the natives of the Philippines and still used
for crossing with the domestic fowl. See Guillemard (ut supra, p. 228,
note 1).

[210] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[211] MS. 5,650 reads: “In his ears he wore pendants of gold jewels,
which they call ‘schione.’”

[212] MS. adds: “whom he had put ashore on that island that they
might recruit their strength.”

[213] MS. 5,650 reads: “There is another island near the above
island, inhabited by people.” Mosto says (p. 70, note 6) that picheti
is from the Spanish piquete, “a small hole made with a sharp pointed
instrument.” This custom of piercing the ears is quite general among
savage, barbarous, and semi-barbarous peoples.

[214] Eden (p. 254) reads: “caphranita that is gentyles.” See Vol.
III, p. 93, note 29.

[215] This word is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[216] Our transcript reads facine, and MS. 5,650 fascine, both of which
translate “fascines.” Mosto reads focine, which is amended by
Amoretti to foscine. This latter is probably the same word as fiocina,
a “harpoon” or “eel-spear,” and hence here a “dart.”

[217] Stanley failed to decipher this word in MS. 5,650, which is the
same as the word in the Italian MS. Mosto, citing Boerio (Dizion.
veneziano), says of rizali: “Rizzagio or rizzagno, ‘sweepnet’ a
fine thickly woven net, which when thrown into rivers by the fisherman,
opens, and when near the bottom, closes, and covers and encloses the
fish. Rizzagio is also called that contrivance or net, made in the
manner of an inverted cone, with a barrel hoop attached to the
circumference as a selvage. It has a hole underneath, through which if
the eels in the ponds slyly enter the net, there is no danger of their
escape.”

Fish are caught in the Philippines by various devices—in favorable
situations by traps, weirs, corrals of bamboo set along the shore in
shallow waters. Various kinds of nets and seines, the hook and line,
and also the spear, are also used. See Census of the Philippine Islands
(Washington, 1905), iv, p. 533.

[218] MS. 5,650 reads: “Hiunanghar.” Stanley has mistranscribed
“Huinanghar.” It is difficult to identify the four islands of
Cenalo, Hiunanghan, Ibusson, and Abarien with certainty. Mosto (p. 71,
notes) suggests that they may be Dinagat, Cabugan, Gibuson, and
Cabalarián. The first three are evidently correct, as those islands
would naturally be sighted in the course followed. The last island is
shown in Pigafetta’s chart to be north of Malhón, and the
probability is that he names and locates it merely from hearsay, and
that they did not see it. Its position seems to indicate Manicani
rather than Cabalarián.

After this paragraph in the Italian MS. (folio 21a) follows the chart
of the islands of Pozzon, Ticobon, Polon, Baibai and Ceilon (together
forming the island of Leyte), Gatighan, Bohol, and Mazzana (sic) (q.v.,
p. 112). This chart in MS. 5,650 (on folio 36a) is preceded by:
“Below is shown the cape of Gatighan and many other islands
surrounding it.”

[219] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 220) says: “We departed thence [i.e.,
from Malhón] and went toward the west in order to strike a large
island called Seilani [i.e., Leyte] which is inhabited and has gold in
it. We coasted along it and took our course to the west southwest in
order to strike a small island, which is inhabited and called Mazava.
The people there are very friendly. We erected a cross on a mountain in
that island. Three islands lying to the west southwest were pointed out
to us from that island, which are said to possess gold in abundance.
They showed us how it was obtained. They found pieces as large as
chickpeas and beans. Masava lies in latitude 9 and two-thirds degrees
north.” The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 11) says: “They ran on to
another island twenty leagues from that from which they sailed [i.e.,
Malhón], and came to anchor at another island, which is named Macangor
[i.e., Masaua], which is nine degrees; and in this island they were
very well received, and they placed a cross in it.” See also Vol. I,
pp. 322, 323.

[220] MS. 5,650 reads: “But they moved off immediately and would not
enter the ship through distrust of us.” The slave who acted as
interpreter is the Henrique de Malaca of Navarrete’s list.

[221] Bara: the Spanish word barra.

[222] MS. 5,650 reads: “to ask him to give him some food for his
ships in exchange for his money.”

[223] MS. 5,650 reads: “The king hearing that came with seven or
eight men.”

[224] For dorade, i.e., the dorado. MS. 5,650 adds: “which are very
large fish of the kind abovesaid.”

[225] The ceremony of blood brotherhood. Casicasi means “intimate
friends.” See Trumbull’s Blood Covenant (Philadelphia, 1898), which
shows how widespread was the covenant or friendship typified by blood.

[226] MS. 5,650 reads: “After that the said captain had one of his
men-at-arms armed in offensive armor.” Stanley has translated harnois
blanc literally as “white armor.”

[227] This passage may be translated: “Thereby was the king rendered
almost speechless, and told the captain, through the slave, that one of
those armed men was worth a hundred of his own men. The captain
answered that that was a fact, and that he had brought two hundred men
in each ship, who were armed in that manner.” Eden so understood it,
and reads: “whereat the Kynge marualed greatly, and ſayde to th[e]
interpretoure (who was a ſlaue borne in Malacha) that one of thoſe
armed men was able to encounter with a hundreth of his men.” MS.
5,650 agrees with the translation of the text.

[228] Instead of this last phrase MS. 5,650 has: “and he made two of
his men engage in sword-play before the king.”

[229] MS. 5,650 says only: “Then he showed the king the sea-chart,
and the navigation compass.” Eden says (p. 348) that the first to use
the compass was one “Flauius of Malpha, a citie in the kingdom of
Naples.... Next vnto Flauius, the chiefe commendation is dew to the
Spanyardes and Portugales by whoſe daylye experience, the ſame is
brought to further perfection, and the vſe thereof better knowen;
althowghe hytherto no man knoweth the cauſe why the iren touched with
the lode ſtone, turneth euer towarde the north ſtarre, as playnely
appeareth in euery common dyall.” He also says: “As touchynge the
needle of the compaſſe, I haue redde in the Portugales nauigations
that ſaylynge as farre ſouth as Cap. de Bona Speranza, the poynt of
the needle ſtyll reſpected the northe as it dyd on this ſyde the
Equinoctiall, ſauynge that it ſumwhat trembeled and declyned a
lyttle, whereby the force ſeemed ſumwhat to be diminiſſhed, ſo
that they were fayne to helpe it with the lode ſtone.” (See ante, p.
93). The compass was known in a rough form to the Chinese at early as
2634 B.C., and first applied to navigation in the third or fourth
century A.D., or perhaps earlier. It was probably introduced into
Europe through the Arabs who learned of it from the Chinese. It is
first referred to in European literature by Alexander Neckam in the
twelfth century in De Utensilibus. The variations from the true north
were observed as early as 1269.

[230] Stanley says that the Amoretti edition represents the king as
making this request and Magalhães as assenting thereto; but the
Italian MS. reads as distinctly as MS. 5,650, that Magalhães made the
request.

[231] MS. 5,650 omits the remainder of this sentence.

[232] MS. 5,650 adds: “that is, a boat.”

[233] The following passage relating to the meal reads thus in MS.
5,650: “Then the king had a plate of pork and some wine brought in.
Their fashion of drinking is as follows. First they lift their hands
toward the sky, and then take with the right hand the vessel from which
they drink, while extending the fist of the left hand toward the
people. The king did that to me, and extended his fist toward me, so
that I thought that he was going to strike me. But I did the same to
him, and in such wise did we banquet and afterwards sup with him using
that ceremony and others.” See Spencer’s Ceremonial Institutions,
especially chapter I.

[234] Eden reads (p. 255): “When the kynge ſawe Antonie Pigafetta
write the names of many thinges, and afterwarde rehearſe them ageyne,
he marualed yet more, makynge ſygnes that ſuche men deſcended from
heauen.” Continuing he confuses the eldest son of the first king with
the latter’s brother, the second king.

[235] A tolerably good description of the native houses of the present
day in the Philippines. Cf. Morga’s description, Vol. XVI, pp.
117–119.

[236] MS. 5,650 begins a new unnumbered chapter at this point.

[237] This sentence to this point in MS. 5,650, is wrongly made to
refer to the house of the king. The passage there reads: “All the
dishes with which he is served, and also a part of his house, which was
well furnished according to the custom of the country, were of gold.”

[238] MS. 5,650 omits this sentence.

[239] Butuan and Caraga in the northeastern part of Mindanao.

[240] This name is variously rendered: Mosto, Siain; MS. 5,650, Siaui;
Stanley, Siani; and Amoretti and Eden, Siagu.

[241] MS. 5,650 reads: “the captain sent the chaplain ashore to
celebrate mass.”

[242] MS. 5,650 says that they took only their swords; but the Italian
MS. says distinctly that a signal was given to the ships from the shore
by means of muskets, and again that the musketry was fired when the
kings and Magalhães separated, both of which references are omitted by
MS. 5,650. Eden reads: “The Captaine came alande with fyftie of his
men in theyr beſt apparel withowte weapons or harneſſe, and all the
reſydue well armed.”

[243] In Eden (p. 255): “damaſke water.”

[244] MS. 5,650 reads: “but they offered nothing.”

[245] MS. 5,650 says: “every one did his duties as a Christian and
received our Lord.”

[246] MS. 5,650 adds: “for the people.”

[247] The Italian MS. reads literally and somewhat ambiguously: “they
made immediate reverence;” MS. 5,650 says “to which these kings
made reverence,” which is scarcely likely, as the latter would, until
told by Magalhães, see nothing in the ceremony. Rather it was the
Spaniards who made the reverence.

[248] MS. 5,650 reads: “whenever any ships came from Spain.”

[249] Cf. Morga, Vol. XVI, p. 132.

[250] MS. 5,650 reads: “men and ships to render them obedient to
him.”

[251] MS. 5,650 reads: “to the middle of the highest mountain,”
evidently confusing mezo di (“afternoon”) of the Italian MS. with
mezo (mezzo; “middle”); for the cross was set up on the summit of
the mountain. The passage in MS. 5,650 continues: “Then those two
kings and the captain rested, and while conversing, the latter had them
asked [not “I had them asked” as in Stanley, who mistranscribes jl
(il) as je] where the best port was for getting food. They replied that
there were three, namely, Ceylom, Zzubu, and Galaghan, but that Zzeubu
was the largest and the best trading place.” These are the islands of
Leyte (the Seilani of Albo, Navarrete, iv, p. 20; and the Selani of
Transylvanus, Vol. I, p. 322), Cebú, and Mindanao (the Caraga
district).

[252] 5,650 reads simply: “Then we descended to the place where their
boats were.”

[253] This account is very much shortened in MS. 5,650, where it reads
as follows: “As the captain intended to leave next morning, he asked
the king for pilots in order that they might conduct him to the ports
abovesaid. He promised the king to treat those pilots as he would them
themselves, and that he would leave one of his men as a hostage. In
reply the first king said that he would go himself to guide the captain
to those ports and that he would be his pilot, but asked him to wait
two days until he should gather his rice, and do some other things
which he had to do. He asked the captain to lend him some of his men,
so that he could accomplish it sooner, and the captain agreed to it.”
At this point MS. 5,650 begins a new unnumbered chapter.

[254] The billon and afterward copper coin quattrino, which was struck
in the mints of Venice, Rome, Florence, Reggio, the Two Sicilies, etc.
The quattrino of the popes was often distinguished as “quattrino
Romano.” The Venetian copper quattrino was first struck in the reign
of Francesco Foscari (1423–57). See W. C. Hazlitt’s Coinage of
European Continent (London and New York, 1893), p. 226.

[255] Doppione: a gold coin struck by Louis XII of France during his
occupation of the Milanese (1500–1512). Hazlitt, ut supra, p. 196.

[256] Colona: possibly the name of some coin of the period.

[257] This entire paragraph is omitted in MS. 5,650. That MS. has
another chapter division at this point.

[258] Stanley mistranslates the French gentilz as “gentle.”

[259] Probably the abacá, although it may be the cloth made from the
palm. See Morga’s description of the Visayans, Vol. XVI, p. 112.

[260] Cf. Morga’s Sucesos, Vol. XVI, pp. 80, 81.

[261] MS. 5,650 greatly abridges this account, reading as follows:
“They cut that fruit into four parts, and after they have chewed it a
long time, they spit it out and throw it away.” Cf. the account in
Morga’s Sucesos, Vol. XVI, pp. 97–99.

[262] MS. 5,650 omits this product. Cf. Morga’s Sucesos, Vol. XVI,
pp. 84–97.

[263] In MS. 5,650, “Mazzaua;” in Eden, “Meſſana;” in Mosto,
“Mazana,” while in the chart it appears as “Mazzana;”
Transylvanus, “Massana;” and Albo, “Masava.” It is now called
the island of Limasaua, and has an area of about ten and one-half
square miles.

[264] Mosto mistranscribes the Italian word for “among” fra as
prima “first.” The error arises through the abbreviation used,
namely fa, Mosto mistaking it for pa, which would be prima.

[265] Stanley mistranscribes “Gatighan” from MS. 5,650 as
“Satighan.” The names of the five islands as given by Eden are:
“Zeilon, Bohol, Canghu, Barbai, and Catighan.” These are the
islands of Leite, Bohol, Canigao (west of Leyte), the northern part of
Leyte (today the name of a town, hamlet and inlet in Leyte), and
possibly Apit or Himuquitan, or one of the other nearby islands on the
west coast of Leyte. See chart of these islands on p. 112.

Albo (Navarrete, iv, pp. 220, 221) says: “We left Mazava and went
north toward the island of Seilani, after which we ran along the said
island to the northwest as far as 10 degrees. There we saw three rocky
islands, and turned our course west for about 10 leguas where we came
upon two islets. We stayed there that night and in the morning went
toward the south southwest for about 12 leguas, as far as 10 and
one-third degrees. At that point we entered a channel between two
islands, one of which is called Matan and the other Subu. Subu, as well
as the islands of Mazava and Suluan extend north by east and south by
west. Between Subu and Seilani we spied a very lofty land lying to the
north, which is called Baibai. It is said to contain considerable gold
and to be well stocked with food, and so great an extent of land that
its limits are unknown. From Mazava, Seilani, and Subu, on the course
followed toward the south, look out for the many shoals, which are very
bad. On that account a canoe which was guiding us along that course,
refused to go ahead. From the beginning of the channel of Subu and
Matan, we turned west by a middle channel and reached the city of Subu.
There we anchored and made peace, and the people there gave us rice,
millet, and meat. We stayed there for a considerable time. The king and
queen of that place and many of the inhabitants readily became
Christians.” The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 11) says that the king of
Macangar (i.e., Mazaua) conducted the Spaniards “a matter of thirty
leagues to another island named Cabo [i.e., Cebú], which is in ten
degrees, and in this island Fernando de Magalhães did what he pleased
with the consent of the country.” Brito says merely (Navarrete, iv,
p. 308): “After that, after passing amid many islands, they reached
one called Mazaba, which lies in 9 degrees. The king of Mazaba
conducted them to another large island called Zubó.”

[266] MS. 5,650 reads: “only one of them.” Barbastili is a Venetian
word for pipistrelli. These bats are the Pteropi or “flying foxes,”
the large fruit-eating bats of which so many species inhabit the Malay
Archipelago. Bats are especially found in Guimarás, Siquijor, and
Cebú, and the skins of some are used as fur. See Guillemard (ut supra,
p. 235). See also Delgado’s Historia, pp. 842, 843; and U. S.
Philippine Gazetteer.

[267] Stanley mistranslates as “tortoises.” The “black birds with
the long tail” are the tabón “mound-building Megapodes,
gallinacious birds peculiar to the Austro-Malayan subregion”
(Guillemard’s Magellan, p. 235). See also Vol. V, p. 167, note 14,
and Vol. XVI, page 198, note 43; also Vol. XVI, p. 81, note 84.

[268] These are the Camotes, which lie west of Leyte, and their names
are Poro, Pasijan, and Pansón. See Pigafetta’s chart showing these
islands on p. 112.

[269] Following this point in the Italian MS. (folio 26a) is the chart
of the islands of Bohol, Mattam, and Zzubu (q.v., p. 136).

MS. 5,650 presents this chart on folio 51a, preceded by the words:
“Below are shown the islands of Zzubu, Mattan, and Bohól.”

[270] MS. 5,650 reads: “But the interpreter reassured them by telling
them.”

[271] MS. 5,650 reads: “and he was going, by the orders of the said
sovereign, to discover the islands of Mallucque.”

[272] MS. 5,650 reads: “Thereupon the abovesaid merchant said to the
king in their language,” etc., without giving the original Malay
words. Eden gives the phrase as catacaia chita.

[273] Calicut, properly Kálíkot (said to be derived from two words
meaning cock-crow, because the territory granted to the first king of
Kálíkot was limited to the extent over which a cock could be heard to
crow; or from Káli, one of the names of the goddess Gauri) is the name
of a district and city on the Malabar coast. The king of all the
Malabar coast from Goa to Cape Comorin, Samari Perymal, having adopted
the Mahometan faith divided his kingdom into the kingdoms of Calicut,
Cochin, Cananor, and Coulão, and gave them to his friends, on
condition that the king of Calicut be termed “Zamorim” or
“Samorim,” i.e., “Supreme emperor and God upon earth” (although
the proper form is said to be “Tamurin” which is conjectured by
some to be a modification of the Sanskrit “Samunri,” “seaking.”
The city of Kálíkot, a noted emporium of trade, was built perhaps as
early as 805 A.D., although the date 1300 A.D. is also given as that of
its founding; and is described by Ibn Batuta in 1342 as one of the
finest ports in the world. It was visited by Covilham in 1486, and
Vasco da Gama’s ships were freighted there in 1498. The latter
attacked the city in 1503 and 1510, and the Portuguese built a
fortified factory there in 1513 which was destroyed by the governor in
1525 to avoid its falling into the enemy’s hands. The English
established a factory in the city in 1616, which was captured in 1766
by Haidar Ali; but after a further series of capture and recapture, the
city and district was permanently turned over to the British (1792).
See Stanley’s Vasco da Gama (Hakluyt Society publications, London,
1869); Birch’s Alboquerque (Hakluyt Society publications, London,
1875–1884); Jones and Badger’s Ludovico di Varthema (Hakluyt
Society publications, London, 1863), pp. 135–177; also Grey’s
Travels of Pietro della Valle (Hakluyt Society publications, London,
1892), pp. 344, 345, note.

Malacca, or more correctly Mâlaka is the name of an ancient territory
and city, which was probably first settled by Javanese, and is possibly
derived from “Malayu” meaning in Javanese “to run” or
“fugitive.” At an early period Malacca fell under the sway of the
Siamese. The city, located on both sides of the Malacca River, and only
one hundred and thirty miles northwest of Singapore (which has usurped
the great volume of trade once centering at Malacca) was founded about
1250 A.D. The first European to visit the city was Varthema, about the
year 1505. It was captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511,
and they held it (1580–1640 under Spanish control) until 1641 when it
was captured by the Dutch, who had unsuccessfully besieged it, with the
aid of the king of Jahor, in 1606. The English obtained possession of
it in 1795, and still hold it, although the Dutch possessed it from
1818–1825. For descriptions and history of Malacca, see the following
Hakluyt Society publications: Stanley’s East Africa and Malabar
(London, 1866), pp. 190–195; Birch’s Alboquerque, iii, pp. 71–90
(and other citations); Burnell and Tiele’s Linschoten (London, 1885),
i, pp. 104–106; Gray’s Voyage of François Pyrard (London, 1888),
part i, p. ii. Also see Crawfurd’s Dictionary, pp. 238–249.

The terms India Major (Greater India) and India Minor (Lesser India)
are differently applied by different authors. Schiltbergen applied the
term Lesser India to the northern portion of the peninsula on this side
of the Ganges, while the southern portion of the peninsula was termed
Greater India. Marco Polo’s Lesser India extended from Makran to and
including the Coromandel coast, and his Greater India extended from the
Coromandel coast to Cochin China, while Middle India was Abyssinia.
Mosto wrongly identifies India Major with the present Indian empire.
See Telfer’s Johann Schiltberger (Hakluyt Society publications,
1879). Friar Jordanus (Wonders of the East, Hakluyt Society edition,
London, 1863), describes (pp. 11–45) India the Less, India the
Greater, and India Tertia. Yule points out that Jordanus’s Lesser
India embraces Sindh, and probably Mekran, and India along the coast as
far as some point immediately north of Malabar. Greater India extends
from Malabar very indefinitely to the eastward, for he makes it include
Champa. India Tertia is the east of Africa below Abyssinia. Thus
Jordanus just reverses the Lesser and Greater Indias of Marco Polo.
Ramusio who gives the Summary of Kingdoms of an old Portuguese
geographer, ends First India at Mangalore, and Second India at the
Ganges. Benjamin of Tudela speaks of “Middle India which is called
Aden.” Conti divides India into three parts: the first extending from
Persia to the Indus, the second from the Indus to the Ganges, and the
third all the land beyond. Pliny discusses whether Mekran and other
lands belonged to India or Ariana.

[274] MS. 5,650 adds: “and treat his subjects well.”

[275] This phrase is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[276] MS. 5,650 adds: “who was in the captain’s ship.”

[277] MS. 5,650 reads: “Thereupon the king told them that he was
willing, and that as a greater token of his love, he would send the
captain a drop of his blood from his right arm, and [asked] the captain
to do the same.”

[278] MS. 5,650 reads: “Consequently they should ask their captain
whether he intended to observe the custom.”

[279] MS. 5.650 reads: “he should commence by giving a present,
whereupon the captain would do his duty.” This MS. begins another
chapter at this point.

[280] MS. 5,650 reads: “so do our arms destroy the enemies of our
faith.”

[281] MS. 5,650 adds: “of the ships.”

[282] MS. 5,650 reads: “and whether that prince who had come with
them, was empowered to make peace.”

[283] MS. 5,650 omits these last two clauses.

[284] This phrase is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[285] MS. 5,650 adds: “and for love toward God.”

[286] MS. 5,650: “he would leave them the arms that the Christians
use.”

[287] These last two clauses are omitted in MS. 5,650.

[288] MS. 5,650 adds: “of Sainct Jacques [i.e., Santiago].”

[289] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[290] Called “drynking glaſſes of Venice woorke” in Eden (p.
257).

[291] MS. 5,650 reads: “He had his face painted with fire in various
designs.” Eden reads: “and had the residue of his body paynted with
dyuers coloures whereof ſum were lyke vnto flamynge fyre.”

[292] MS. 5,650 reads: “he had four jars full of palm-wine, which he
was drinking through reed pipes.”

[293] MS. 5,650 reads: “We made the due reverence to him while
presenting to him the present sent him by the captain, and told him
through the mouth of the interpreter that it was not to be regarded as
a recompense for his present which he had made to the captain, but for
the love which the captain bore him.” This MS. omits the following
three sentences.

[294] The “Sinus Magnus” of Ptolemy, today the Chinese Gulf (Mosto,
p. 76, note 3).

[295] This passage is considerably abbreviated in MS. 5,650, where it
reads as follows: “The prince, the king’s nephew, took us to his
house, where he showed us four girls who were playing on four very
strange and very sweet instruments, and their manner of playing was
somewhat musical. Afterward he had us dance with them. Those girls were
naked except that they wore a garment made of the said palm-tree cloth
before their privies and which hung from the waist to the knee,
although some were quite naked. We were given refreshments there, and
then we returned to the ships.” These gongs are used in many parts of
the Orient.

[296] MS. 5,650 adds: “by the captain’s order.”

[297] MS. 5,650 reads: “we told him of the death of our man, and that
our captain requested that he might be buried.”

[298] MS. 5,650 adds: “according to our manner.”

[299] MS. 5,650 reads: “The king took it under his charge, and
promised that no trickery or wrong would be done the king. Four of our
men were chosen to despatch and to sell the said merchandise.”

[300] MS. 5,650 reads: “They have wooden balances like those of
Pardeca to weigh their merchandise.” Pardeca, as Stanley points out,
is for par de ça de Loire which is equivalent to Langue d’oil, and
denotes the region in France north of the Loire. Par de la meant
Languedoc. This passage was adapted to the French understanding by the
person who translated and adapted the Italian manuscript.

[301] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650. As Mosto points out the
measure here mentioned would be one of capacity, and must have been the
common measure for rice, perhaps the ganta.

[302] Lagan is a shellfish found in the Philippines which has a shell
resembling that of the Nautilus pompilius that is used for holding
incense or as a drinking vessel. This shell is very white inside, while
the exterior is spotted a pale yellow color. It resembles
mother-of-pearl, and is very common. Delgado says that most of the
shellfish, are indigestible but highly esteemed. See Delgado’s
Historia, p. 928.

[303] MS. 5,650 adds: “Which was of various strange kinds.”

[304] Eden says: “xvi. poundes weyght of iren.”

[305] MS. 5,650 reads: “The captain-general did not wish to take too
great a quantity of gold, so that the sailors might not sell their
share in the merchandise too cheaply, because of their lust for gold,
and so that on that account he should not be constrained to do the same
with his merchandise, for he wished to sell it at as high a price as
possible.”

[306] MS. 5,650 adds: “or any other balls”

[307] MS. 5,650 makes the two armed men follow instead of precede the
royal banner.

[308] MS. 5,650 adds: “and the natives of the country for their fear
of it, fled hither and thither,” which is in place of the following
sentence.

[309] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[310] MS. 5,650 reads: “One covered with red and the other with
velvet.”

[311] MS. 5,650 adds: “in the manner of the country.”

[312] The account of the baptism of the king is considerably abridged
in MS. 5,650 where it reads as follows: “Then the captain began to
address the king through the interpreter, in order that he might incite
him to the faith of Jesus Christ. He told him that if he wished to
become a good Christian (as he had signified on the preceding day),
that he must have all the idols of his country burned and set up a
cross in their place, which they were all to adore daily on both knees,
with hands clasped and raised toward the heaven. The captain showed the
king how he was to make the sign of the cross daily. In reply the king
and all his men said that they would obey the captain’s commandment,
and do all that he told them. The captain took the king by the hand,
and they walked to the platform. At his baptism the captain told the
king that he would call him Dom Charles, after the emperor his
sovereign. He named the prince Dom Fernand, after the brother of the
said emperor, and the king of Mazzaua, Jehan. He gave the name of
Christofle to the Moro, while he called each of the others by names
according to his fancy. Thus before the mass fifty men [sic: but an
error of the French adapter for five hundred] were baptized. At the
conclusion of mass, the captain invited the king and the others of his
chief men to dine with him, but he would not accept. However, he
accompanied the captain to the shore, where, at his arrival, the ships
discharged all the artillery. Then embracing they took leave of one
another.” Eden gives the number baptized as five hundred men.

[313] MS. 5,650 reads: “On seeing that, she expressed the greatest
desire to became a Christian, and asking for baptism, she was baptized
and given the name of Jehanne, after the emperor’s mother.”

[314] There are many cases of this wholesale baptism in the history of
the Catholic missions in various countries, and it cannot be condemned
entirely and regarded as devoid of good effects, for many instances
reveal the contrary. See Jesuit Relations (Cleveland reissue).

[315] Those last six words are omitted in MS. 5,650. Mosto conjectures
that solana means solecchio or solicchio signifying an apparatus to
protect one from the sun. Pigafetta may have misapplied the Spanish
word solana, which signifies a place bathed by the noontide sun or a
place in which to take the sun.

[316] This last clause is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[317] MS. 5,650 adds: “and we gave it to her.” This was the image
found by one of Legazpi’s soldiers in Cebú in 1565 (see Vol. II, pp.
120, 121, 128, 216, 217; and Vol. V, p. 41). Encarnación (Dic.
bisaya-español, Manila, 1851), says: “The Cebuan Indians, both past
and present, give the name of Bathála [God] to the image of the Holy
Child, which is supposed to have been left by the celebrated
Magallanes.”

[318] MS. 5,650 reads: “evening.”

[319] MS. 5,650 mentions only the artillery. The “tromb” or
“trunk” was a kind of hand rocket-tube made of wood and hooped with
iron, and was used for discharging wild-fire or Greek-fire (see
Corbett’s Spanish War, 1585–87 [London], 1898, p. 335). At this
point Stanley discontinues the narrative of MS. 5,650, and translates
from Amoretti’s version of the Italian MS.

[320] MS. 5,650 reads: “to better instruct and confirm him in the
faith.”

[321] Eden says the queen was preceded by “three younge damoſelles
and three men with theyr cappes in theyr handes.”

[322] MS. 5,650 adds: “and presentation.”

[323] MS. 5,650 reads simply for this last clause: “and several
others,” omitting all the names.

[324] MS. 5,650 reads: “and they all so swore.”

[325] MS. 5,650 reads from this point: “Then they swore, and thus the
captain caused the king to swear by that image, by the life of the
emperor his sovereign, and by his habit, to ever remain faithful and
subject to the emperor,” thus ascribing this oath to the king instead
of to Magalhães. The words “by his habit” can refer only to
Magalhães, who wore that of Santiago, and not to any habit worn by the
barbaric ruler of Cebú.

[326] MS. 5,650 adds: “and hang.”

[327] MS. 5,650 adds: “and deck.”

[328] MS. 5,650 adds: “and demolished.”

[329] MS. 5,650 adds: “and overthrew.”

[330] There is a strange difference between the Italian MS. and MS.
5,650 in regard to these names. The latter reads to this point:
“There are a number of villages in that island, whose names and those
of their chiefs are as follows: Cinghapola, Cilaton, Ciguibucan,
Cimaningha, Cimaticat, and Cicambul; another, Mandaui, and its chief
and seignior, Lambuzzan; another Cot-cot, and its chief, Acibagalen;
another, Puzzo, and its chief, Apanoan; another, Lalan, and its chief,
Theteu; another, Lulutan, and its chief, Tapan [Amoretti, followed by
Stanley, says Japau, and Mosto, Iapan]; another Cilumay; and also
Lubucun.” Amoretti, who places this list after the disastrous battle
and consequent treachery of the Cebuans, and Stanley, have “Lubucin:
its chief is Cilumai.” Mandaui is Mandaue; Lalan may be Liloan;
Cot-cot is on the east coast; Lubucun may be Lubú, but Mosto (p. 78,
note 3) conjectures it to be Lambusan. An examination of the Nancy MS.
may reveal the source of this difference.

[331] MS. 5,650 adds after the word borchies: “instruments so
called.”

[332] Probably cotton cloth. See Stanley’s East African and Malabar
Coasts, p. 65: “They make there [i.e., in Cambay] many cloths of
white cotton, fine and coarse, and other woven and colored fabrics, of
all kinds and colours.”

[333] MS. 5,650 adds: “and closed.”

[334] MS. 5,650 reads: “She who has killed the hog, puts a lighted
torch in her mouth, which she extinguishes, and which she holds
constantly alight with her teeth during that ceremony.”

[335] Cf. the ceremonies of the baylanes described by Loarca, Vol. V,
pp. 131, 133, and by Chirino, Vol. XII, p. 270.

[336] Otorno: Mosto, p. 79, mistranscribes otoro, and queries Attorno
in a note.

[337] MS. 5,650 omits the description of this custom, giving only the
first and last sentence to this point. Stanley omits the translation to
this point. See Vol. V, p. 117, and Vol. XVI, p. 130, where Loarca and
Morga describe this custom.

[338] Valzi: Mosto queries vasi, “jars,” which appears probable.

[339] MS. 5,650 adds: “made in the manner abovesaid;” but this was
crossed out, showing that the writer or adapter of that MS. had at
first intended to narrate the custom that is given in the Italian MS.

[340] This word is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[341] MS. 5,650 reads: “The other women sit about the dead chamber
sadly and in tears.”

[342] Pigafetta uses the present and imperfect tenses rather
indiscriminately throughout this narration, but we have translated
uniformly in the present. Cf. Loarca’s description of burial and
mourning customs among the Visayans, Vol. V, pp. 129, 135, 137–141;
Plasencia’s description among the Tagálogs, Vol. VII, pp. 194, 195;
and Morga, Vol. XVI, p. 133.

[343] MS. 5,650 reads: “five or six hours.”

[344] Eden in describing the island of Matan confuses the Pigafetta
narrative. He says: “Not farre from this Ilande of Zubut, is the Hand
of Mathan, whoſe inhabitauntes vſe maruelous ceremonies in theyr
ſacrifices to the ſoone and burying the deade. They were rynges of
gold abowt theyr priuie members.” In the description of the battle in
Matan, Eden says that each of the three divisions of the islanders
contained “two thouſand and fiftie men armed with bowes, arrowes,
dartes and iauelins hardened at the poyntes with fyer.”

[345] To this point the Italian MS. and MS. 5,650 agree approximately.
The story of the battle in the latter MS., however, is much abridged
and much less graphic. It is as follows: “They replied that they had
bamboo spears and stakes burned and hardened in the fire, and that we
could attack them when we wished. At daybreak, forty-nine of us leaped
into the water, in the place whither we had thus gone, at a distance of
more than three [sic] crossbow flights before we could reach shore, for
the boats could not approach nearer because of the rocks and reefs
which were in the water. Thus we reached land, and attacked them. They
were arranged in three divisions, of more than one thousand five
hundred persons. We shot many arrows at them from a distance, but it
was in vain, for they received them on their shields. They leaped
hither and thither in such a way that scarce could we wound one of
them. On the other hand, our artillery in the boats was so far away
from us that it could not aid us. Those people seeing that, and that
the captain had had some of their houses burned in order to inspire
them with terror, and having become more enraged, threw so many iron
pointed spears at us, and shot so many arrows even at the captain
himself that we could defend ourselves with difficulty. Finally, having
been driven by them quite down to the shore, and while our captain was
fighting bravely although wounded in the leg with an arrow, one of
those Indians hurled a poisoned bamboo lance into his face which laid
him stiff and dead. Then they pressed upon us so closely that we were
forced to retire to our boats and to leave the dead body of the
captain-general, with our other killed.” The eulogy on the dead
commander is approximately the same in both MSS., except at the end,
where MS. 5,650 reads: “Eight of our men died there with him, and
four Indians, who had become Christians. Of the enemy fifteen were
killed by the artillery of the ships, which had at last come to our
aid, while many of us were wounded.”

Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) says of the stay at Cebú and the death
of Magalhães: “They stayed there about one month, and the majority
of the people and the king became Christians. The king of Zubó ordered
the kings of the other islands to come to him, but inasmuch as two of
them refused to come, Magallanes, as soon as he learned it, resolved to
go to fight with them, and went to an island called Mathá. He set fire
to a village, and not content with that, set out for a large
settlement, where he, his servant, and five Castilians were killed in
combat with the savages. The others, seeing their captain dead, went
back to their boats.”

[346] Terciado: a Spanish word.

[347] Carteava: a Spanish word.

[348] The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 12) dates the battle April 28. The
account of the battle is as follows: “Fernan de Magalhães desired
that the other kings, neighbours to this one, should become subject to
this who had become Christian: and these did not choose to yield such
obedience. Fernan de Magalhães seeing that, got ready one night with
his boats, and burned the villages of those who would not yield the
said obedience; and a matter of ten or twelve days after this was done,
he sent to a village about half a league from that which he had burned,
which is named Matam, and which is also an island, and ordered them to
send him at once three goats, three pigs, three loads of rice, and
three loads of millet for provisions for the ships; they replied that
for each article which he sent to ask them three of, they would send to
him by twos, and if he was satisfied with this they would at once
comply, if not, it might be as he pleased, but that they would not give
it. Because they did not choose to grant what he demanded of them,
Fernan de Magalhães ordered three boats to be equipped with a matter
of fifty or sixty men, and went against the said place, which was on
the 28th day of April, in the morning; there they found many people,
who might well be as many as three thousand or four thousand men, who
fought with such a good will that the said Fernan de Magalhães was
killed there, with six of his men, in the year 1521.”

[349] Navarrete (iv, pp. 65, 66) gives the names of the men killed with
Magalhães on April 27 as follows: Christóbal Rabelo, then captain of
the “Victoria;” Francisco Espinosa, a sailor; Anton Gallego, a
common seaman; Juan de Torres, sobresaliente and soldier; Rodrigo
Nieto, servant of Juan de Cartagena; Pedro Gomez, servant of Gonzalo
Espinosa; and Anton de Escovar, sobresaliente, wounded but died April
29.

[350] See Vol. I, pp. 325, 326, note 215*.

[351] MS. 5,650 gives this name as Duart Bobase, although lower it is
spelled Barbase. Duarte or Odoardo Barbosa, the son of Diogo Barbosa,
who after serving in Portugal, became alcaide of the Sevilla arsenal,
was born at Lisbon at the end of the fifteenth century. He spent the
years 1501–1516 in the Orient, the result of that stay being his
Livro emque dà relação do que viu e ouviu no Oriente, which was
first published at Lisbon in 1813 in vol. vii of Collecçao de noticias
para a historia et geographia das nações ultramarinas, and its
translation by Stanley, A description of the coasts of East Africa and
Malabar (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1866). He became a clerk
in the Portuguese factory at Cananor under his uncle Gil Fernandez
Barbosa, and became so expert in the Malabar language that he was said
to speak it even better than the natives. On account of his facility in
the language he had been appointed commissioner by Nuno da Cunha to
negotiate peace with the Zamorin. He was commissioned in 1515 to
oversee the construction of some galleys by Alboquerque. While at
Sevilla, Magalhães lived in the household of Diogo Barbosa, where he
married Duarte’s sister Beatriz. Duarte embarked on the
“Trinidad” as a sobresaliente, and it was he who captured the
“Victoria” from the mutineers at Port St. Julian, after which he
became captain of that vessel. Failing to recover Magalhães body from
the natives of Mactán, he was himself slain at Cebú at the fatal
banquet May 1, 1521. Besides the above book, which is a most valuable
contribution to early Oriental affairs, there is extant in the Torre do
Tombo a letter written by him from Cananor, January 12, 1513,
complaining of the Portuguese excesses. See Guillemard’s Magellan;
Stanley’s Vasco da Gama; Birch’s Alboquerque; and Hoefer’s
Nouvelle Biographie Générale (Paris, 1855)

[352] See ante, note 147.

[353] Magalhães married Beatriz Barbosa, daughter of Diogo Barbosa in
Sevilla, probably in the year 1517. One son Rodrigo was born of the
union, who was about six months old at the time of the departure.
Rodrigo died in September, 1521, and in the March following Beatriz
died. See Guillemard, ut supra, pp. 89–91, 322.

[354] MS. 5,650 adds: “and to advise the Christian king.”

[355] Mosto transcribes this word wrongly as facente, “busy.” MS.
5,650 reads: “wiser and more affectionate than before.”

[356] MS. 5,650 adds: “and presents.”

[357] The constable was Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, who was left behind
with the “Trinidad” and was one of the four survivors of that
ill-fated vessel, returning to Spain long after.

[358] This sentence is confused in MS. 5,650, reading: jehan Caruaie
auecques le bariſel ſen retournerẽt qui nous dirent comment jlz
auoyent veu mener celluy quy fut guery par miracle et le preſtre a ſa
maiſon et que pour cela jlz ſen eſtoyent partiz eulx doubtans de
quelque male aduanture. By dropping the first et this becomes
equivalent to the text.

[359] MS. 5,650 reads: “for we would kill him.”

[360] MS. 5,650 reads: “But Jehan Carvaie, his comrade, and others
refused, for fear lest they would not remain masters there if the boat
went ashore.”

In regard to João Serrão’s death, Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309)
says: “As soon as the men in the ships saw that slaughter, they
hoisted their anchors, and tried to set sail in order to return to
Burneo. At that juncture, the savages brought Juan Serrano, one of
those whom they wished to ransom, and asked two guns and two bahars of
copper for him, besides some Brittanias or linens such as they carried
in the ships as merchandise of trade and barter. Serrano told them to
take him to the ship and he would give them what they asked, but they,
on the contrary, insisted that those things be taken ashore. But [the
men in the ships] fearing another act of treachery like the past, set
sail, and abandoned that man there, and nothing more was heard of
him.”

[361] The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 13) says nothing about the
banquet, but says that the men, twenty-eight in number, counting the
two captains, went ashore to ask pilots to Borneo, whereupon the
natives, who had determined upon their course of action attacked and
killed them. Peter Martyr (Mosto, p. 81, note 5) asserts that the
violation of the women by the sailors was the cause of the massacre.
Concerning the number killed, Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that
thirty-five or thirty-six men went ashore, and Castanheda and Gomara
say thirty, the last asserting that a like number were made slaves, of
whom eight were sold in China. Peter Martyr places the number of the
slain at twelve. Navarrete (iv, pp. 66, 67) gives the names of those
massacred as follows:


    Duarte Barbosa            captain of the “Trinidad”
    Juan Serrano              captain of the “Concepcion”
    Luis Alfonso de Gois      captain of the “Victoria”
    Andres de S. Martin       pilot of his Majesty
    Sancho de Heredia         notary
    Leon de Ezpeleta          notary
    Pedro de Valderrama       priest
    Francisco Martin          cooper
    Simon de la Rochela       calker
    Cristóbal Rodriguez       steward
    Francisco de Madrid       sobresaliente and soldier
    Hernando de Aguilar       servant of Luis de Mendoza
    Guillermo Fenesi or
      Tanaguì                 gunner of the “Trinidad”
    Anton Rodriguez           sailor
    Juan Sigura               sailor
    Francisco Picora          sailor
    Francisco Martin          sailor
    Anton de Goa              common seaman
    Rodrigo de Hurrira        common seaman
    Pedro Herrero             sobresaliente
    Hartiga                   sobresaliente
    Juan de Silva, Portuguese sobresaliente
    Nuño                      servant of Magallanes
    Henrique, from Málaca     servant of Magallanes and interpreter
    Peti Juan, French         servant of Magallanes
    Francisco de la Mezquita  servant of Magallanes
    Francisco                 son-in-law of Juan Serrano


All of these names are to be found in Navarrete’s list. See ante,
note 26.

[362] Chiacare: the nangca; see Vol. XXXIV, p. 107, where Pigafetta
describes and names this fruit. Mosto confuses it with the durio
xibethenus, which is abundant in the western islands of the Indian
archipelagoes, Mindanao being the only one of the Philippines where it
is found (Crawfurd, Dictionary); but it is the Artocarpus integrifolia
(see Vol. XVI, p. 88, note 72). MS. 5,650 makes this “capers.”

[363] MS. 5,650 omits mention of the panicum, sorgo, garlic, and
nangcas.

[364] MS. 5,650 reads: “one to the east northeast, and the other to
the west southwest.”

[365] MS. 5,650 adds: “and eleven minutes.”

[366] Stanley says wrongly 154°.

[367] This word ends a page in the original Italian MS. On the
following page is a repetition of the title: Vocabili deli populi
gentilli, that is “Words of those heathen peoples.” MS. 5,650 does
not contain this list, and it is also omitted by Stanley.

[368] See ante, note 160.

[369] Bassag bassag does not correspond to “shin,” but to “basket
for holding clothes, etc.,” or “cartilage of the nose;” or
possibly to basac basac, “the sound made by falling water.”

[370] The equivalent of Pigafetta’s dana is daoa or daua,
“millet.” Mais, probably the equivalent of humas is the word for
“panicum.”

[371] Tahil is found in the Tagálog dictionaries, and is the name of a
specific weight, not weight in general. It is the Chinese weight called
“tael,” which was introduced by the Chinese into the East Indies,
whence it spread throughout the various archipelagoes. See Crawfurd’s
Dictionary; and Vols. III, p. 192, note 57; IV, p. 100, note 11; and
VII, p. 88.

[372] See Note 582, post.

[373] Tinapay (used also by the Bicols to denote any kind of bread)
denotes a kind of cake or loaf made with flour and baked about the size
of a chocolate-cup saucer. Two of these are put together before baking
with some sugar between. The word is extended also to wheat bread and
to the hosts. See Encarnación’s Diccionario.

[374] Amoretti’s conjectured reading of sonaglio
(“hawk’s-bell”) for conaglio (see Mosto, p. 83), proves correct
from the Visayan dictionaries.

[375] Baloto signifies a canoe dug out of a single log. One of twenty
varas in length is termed bilis, while the hull alone is called
dalámas.

[376] Most of the words of Pigafetta’s Visayan vocabulary can be
distinguished in the dictionaries of that language, although it is
necessary to make allowance at times for Pigafetta’s Italian phonetic
rendering. Following is a list of the words that can be distinguished
from Diccionario bisaya-español y español-bisaya (Manila, 1885), by
Juan Félix de la Encarnación, O.S.A. (Recollect); and Diccionario
Hispano-bisaya y bisaya-español (Manila, 1895) by Antonio Sanchez de
la Rosa, O.S.F. See also Pocket dictionary of the English, Spanish and
Visayan languages (Cebu, 1900) by H. M. Cohen; and Mallat’s Les
Philippines (Paris, 1846), ii, pp. 175–238. The words queried in the
following list are simply offered as conjectural equivalents.

Some of the words present difficulties however, due probably to error
on Pigafetta’s part and the obstacles in the method of communication
between peoples the genius of whose respective languages is entirely
distinct. The general Visayan word for “man” is tao or tauo,
although Mallat gives a form dala, which may correspond to the lac of
Pigafetta (but see Vol. V, p. 123, where the origin of the words lalac,
“man,” and babaye, “woman,” are given by Loarca). Babaye
(babae) is the general word for “woman” or “married woman;”
while binibini is given by Mallat as the Tagálog equivalent of
“girl,” and by Santos in his Vocabulario de la lengua tagala
(Manila, 1835) as the equivalent of “influential woman.” Liog is
used for both “throat” and “neck.” Tian is properly
“belly,” and the mistake would arise naturally in Pigafetta
pointing to himself when desiring the word for “body,” which would
be construed by the natives to that particular part toward which he
happened to point. Boto is used for both the male and female generative
organs, especially the latter, as well as for the testicles. Britiis
corresponds to both “shin” and “calf of the leg.” Iro denotes
also the civet cat. Bulan the equivalent of Pigafetta’s bolon is the
word for “moon” instead of “star.” The occurrence of what are
today Tagálog forms in Pigafetta’s list shows how the various
dialects shade into one another and how the one has retained words that
have sunk into disuse in the other.

[377] Preceding this paragraph in the Italian MS. (folio 38b) is the
chart of the island of Panilonghon (Panisonghon; q.v., p. 202). It is
given on folio 51a of MS. 5,650, preceded by the words: “Below is
shown the islands of Panilonghon.”

[378] The “Roteiro” (Stanley, pp. 13, 14) says that the captains
elected in place of those killed at Cebú were “Joam Lopez
[Carvalho], who was the chief treasurer” to “be captain-major of
the fleet, and the chief constable of the fleet” to “be captain of
one of the ships; he was named Gonzalo Vaz Despinosa.” Pigafetta
makes no mention at all of Elcano, who brought the “Victoria” home;
both the above captains remaining with the “Trinidad.” When the
“Concepcion” was burned, only one hundred and fifteen men were left
for the working of the two ships (see Guillemard, ut supra, p. 267),
although the “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 14) says one hundred and eight
men, and Barros, one hundred and eighty.

[379] In Eden: “Pauiloghon, where they founde blacke men lyke vnto
the Saraſins.” This is the island of Panglao and the “black men”
are the Negritos. See W. A. Reed’s Negritos of Zambales, published by
Department of the Interior “Ethnological Survey Publications” ii,
part i (Manila, 1904), which says (p. 20) that the only large islands,
besides Luzón, inhabited at present by Negritos are Panay, Negros,
Mindanao, and Paragua, although they do inhabit some of the smaller
islands. The pure type is decreasing through marriage with the Bukidnon
or mountain Visayans; and (p. 22) “so far there is no evidence that
Negritos exist on Cebu, Bohol, Samar, and Leyte. The Negrito population
of the Philippines is probably not in excess of 25,000. The U. S.
census report of 1900 gives to Panglao a population of 14,347, all
civilized. See also Census of the Philippines, i, pp. 411, 415, 436,
468, 478, 532, 533.

[380] MS. 5,650 reads: “When entering that house, we were preceded by
many reed and palmleaf torches.”

[381] These two words are omitted in MS. 5,650.

[382] See Crawfurd’s Dictionary, pp. 368, 369, on the origin and use
of rice in the eastern islands, and the etymology of the native names
for that grain; and Census of the Philippines, iv.

[383] Instead of this last clause, MS. 5,650 reads: “where he slept
with his principal wife.”

[384] MS. 5,650 reads: “in the houses of the king.”

[385] MS. 5,650 reads: “little valleys.”

[386] Cf. Vol. III, pp. 56, 57.

[387] MS. 5,650 reads: “boat.”

[388] MS. 5,650 reads: “Calanoa;” and Eden: “Calauar.”

[389] MS. 5,650 reads: “one hundred and sixty-six;” and Eden:
“170.”

[390] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 221) reads as follows when relating the
course of the ships on leaving Cebú: “We left Subu and sailed
southwest to a latitude of 9 and three-fourths degrees, between the end
of Subu and an island called Bohol. Toward the western end of Subu lies
another island, by name, Panilongo, which is inhabited by blacks. That
island and Subu contain gold and considerable ginger. The former lies
in 9 and one-third degrees and Subu in 10 and one-third degrees.
Accordingly we left that channel and went 10 leguas south and anchored
in the island of Bohol. There we made two ships of the three, burning
the third, because we had no men. The last-named island lies in 9 and
one-half degrees. We left Bohol and sailed southwest toward Quipit, and
anchored at that settlement on the right hand side of a river. On the
northwest and open side are two islets which lie in 8 and one-half
degrees. We could get no food there, for the people had none, but we
made peace with them. That island of Quipit contains a quantity of
gold, ginger, and cinnamon. Accordingly, we determined to go in search
of food. The distance from the headland of Quipit to the first islands
is about 112 leguas. It and the islands lie in an east by north and
south by west direction; and this island [i.e., Mindanao] extends quite
generally east and west.”

The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 14) calls the port of Quipit (which is
located on the northeastern coast of Mindanao) Capyam or Quype.
Carvalho gave the boat of the burned ship to the inhabitants of that
place. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that they learned the
location of Borneo at Mindanao. Quipit becomes Gibith in Transylvanus,
Chipico in Peter Martyr, and Quepindo in Barros (see Mosto, p. 84, note
2).

[391] The first European mention of the island of Luzón. Luzón is
derived from the Malay lâsung (Tagalog, losong), “mortar.” See
Crawfurd’s Dictionary, pp. 222, 223.

[392] Pigafetta evidently means the Chinese by the Lequians who are
known to have carried on trade for many years with the Philippines, and
who indeed, once owned them.

Following this paragraph in the Italian MS. (folio 40a) is the chart of
Caghaiam (q.v., p. 202). This chart is shown on folio 53b in MS. 5,650,
preceded by the words: “Below is shown the island of Caghaian.”

[393] MS. 5,650 does not mention the cuirasses.

[394] Eden reads: “40. leagues.”

[395] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 221) says: “We left that place [i.e.,
Quipit] and sailed west southwest, southwest, and west, until we came
to an island containing very few inhabitants and called Quagayan. We
anchored in the northern part of that island, where we asked for the
location of the island of Poluan, in order to get provisions of rice,
for that island contains it in abundance, and many ships are laden
there for other districts. Accordingly we sailed west northwest and
came across the headland of the island of Poluan.” The “Roteiro”
(Stanley, p. 14) calls Cagaiam, Caram. It is the island of Cagayan
Sulu, which lies northeast of Borneo.

[396] The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 15) says that the ships contained
only sufficient provisions for a week.

[397] Eden reads: “C.lxxix. degrees and a third parte.” MS. 5,650
reads: “one hundred and sixty-one and one-third degrees.”

[398] Occurrences at Palawan are given as follows by Albo (Navarrete,
iv, pp. 221, 222): “Then we sailed north by east along the coast [of
Palawan] until we reached a village called Saocao, where we made peace.
Its inhabitants were Moros. We went to another village of Cafres, where
we bartered for a considerable quantity of rice, and consequently laid
in a good supply of provisions. That coast extends northeast and
southwest. The headland of its northeastern part lies in 9 and
one-third degrees, and that of the southwestern part in 8 and one-third
degrees. Then on returning to the southwest quite to the headland of
this island, we found an island near which is a bay. In this course and
along Poluan many shoals are found. This headland lies east and west
with Quipit and northeast by east and southwest by west with
Quagayan.”

The “Roteiro” (Stanley, pp. 15–17) gives a fuller account of
occurrences at Palawan. At the first settlement at which they attempt
to land, the natives prove hostile, whereupon they go toward another
island, but contrary weather compelling them to anchor near Palawan,
they are invited ashore on that island by the people of another
village. There one of the soldiers, Joam de Campos, lands alone in
order to get provisions. Being received kindly at this port, named
Dyguasam (perhaps Puerto Princesa), the people set about preparing
provisions for the strangers. Then going to another nearby village,
where Carvalho makes peace with the chief, provisions of rice, goats,
and swine are bought. At the latter village, a Portuguese-speaking
negro who has been baptized at the Moluccas, is met, who promises to
guide them to Borneo, but he fails them at the last moment. Capturing a
prau and three Moros near the former village, they are guided to
Borneo. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that the two ships remained
a month in Palawan, “a rich country, where they got new directions
about Burneo, and captured two men to guide them there.”

At this point in the Italian MS. (folio 41a) follows the chart of
Sundan and Pulaoam (q.v., p. 210). MS. 5,650 shows it on folio 54b,
where it is preceded by the words: “Chart of the island of Pulaoan
and the port of Tegozzao.”

[399] MS. 5,650 reads: “all.”

[400] This passage is defective in MS. 5,650, where it reads as
follows: “They have bows with wooden arrows more than one palmo long,
some of which are pointed with long sharp fishbones, poisoned with
poisonous herbs, while others are tipped with poisoned bamboo.”

[401] MS. 5,650 reads: “mace.” Jannetone as pointed out by Mosto
(p. 85, note 4) was a missile weapon.

[402] Cockfighting is still the great diversion of the Malays and
Malasian peoples. See Wallace’s Malay Archipelago (New York, 1869),
p. 477; and Bowring’s Visit to Philippine Isles (London, 1859). pp.
149–153.

[403] Eden reads: “fyue leaques.”

[404] From the Spanish word almadia, (a sort of canoe used by the
inhabitants of the East Indies; also a boat used by the Portuguese and
their slaves in the East Indies: generally of one single tree, although
there are various kinds, to one of which is given the name coche,
“carriage”) which is derived from the Arabic al-madia or almadiya,
from the root adar, “to cross,” so called because those vessels are
used in crossing rivers.—Echegaray’s Dic. etimológico (Madrid,
1887).

[405] This word is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[406] Gomara says there were eight (Mosto, p. 86, note 1).

[407] MS. 5,650 reads: “a red cap.”

[408] MS. 5,650 omits the remainder of this sentence.

[409] MS. 5,650 adds “and seigniors.”

[410] Stanley makes the unhappy translation “with naked daggers in
their hands, which they held on their thighs.”

[411] Cf. the account of the reception accorded the captain of a
Portuguese vessel in Borneo in 1578, Vol. IV, pp. 222, 223, where the
king is found playing chess.

[412] This clause is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[413] The city of Brunei or Brunai. See Guillemard’s Magellan, pp.
269–373. See also descriptions of Bornean villages in Wallace’s
Malay Archipelago; and Forest’s account of Brunai quoted by Crawfurd
(Dictionary, p. 70), who mentions the boat-markets held by the women.

[414] MS. 5,650 reads: “twenty or twenty-five thousand.” Crawfurd
(Dictionary, p. 70) thinks that Pigafetta overstates the population,
and that he probably gained his information from a Malay courtier.

[415] MS. 5,650 reads: “the women and daughters.”

[416] Cherita-tulis, “writers of narratives” (Stanley, p. 114);
jurutulis, “adepts in writing” (Crawfurd’s Dictionary, p. 61).

[417] MS. 5,650 reads: “timghuly.”

[418] Ortelius (Theatrum orbis terrarum) calls this region “Lao”
(see also chart on p. 210) and Mercatore (Atlas sive cosmographicae
meditationes) “Lave.” It may possibly be the modern island of Laut
off the southeast of Borneo. (See Mosto, p. 87, note 3). Crawfurd
(Dictionary, p. 72) conjectures that it is some place in Banjarmasin.

[419] The journey to Borneo, events there, and a description of Borneo
are thus described by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 222): “We sailed from
Poluan to Borney. Coasting the above named island [i.e., Poluan] to its
southwest headland, we discovered an island with a shoal on its eastern
side, and which lies in 7 and one-half degrees, so that we had to
deviate to the west for about fifteen leguas. Then we sailed southwest
coasting along the island of Borney to a city of the same name. You
must needs know that the land must be approached closely, for there are
many shoals outside, and one must keep the sounding line in constant
use, for it is a harsh coast. Borney is a large city with a very large
bay. Both inside and outside of it are many shoals, so that a native
pilot of that place is necessary. We remained there for a considerable
number of days, and commenced to trade there and made firm friendship.
But later, many canoes, in number 260, were equipped to capture us and
came upon us. When we saw them, we left hurriedly, and sailed out of
the bay, whereupon we saw some junks coming. We went to them and
captured one, in which was a son of the king of Luzon. The latter is a
very large island. The captain afterward let him go [i.e., the prince
of Luzón] without asking advice of anyone. Borney it a large island
which yields cinnamon, mirabolans, and camphor, the last named of which
is much esteemed in these lands, and it is said that when people die
they are embalmed with it. Borney (that is, the port of Borney) lies in
a latitude of 5 degrees and 25 minutes, and a longitude of 201 degrees
and 5 minutes from the line of demarcation.”

The “Roteiro” (Stanley, pp. 17–20) says that while on the way to
Borneo, the ships anchor at islands which they call the islets of St.
Paul (now, the Mantanani Islands—Guillemard, Magellan, p. 269) at a
distance of two and one-half or three leagues from Borneo. Proceeding
past a lofty mountain (Kina Balu—Guillemard) in Borneo, they coast
that island to the port of Borneo. Anchoring in that port, the Moro
pilots captured at Palawan are sent ashore with one of the crew, and on
reaching the city of Borneo, they are taken before the Shahbender of
Borneo. The two ships draw in closer to the city and establish trade
with the natives. Gonzalo Gomez Espinosa is chosen ambassador to the
king to whom he takes a present. After a stay of twenty-three days in
Borneo, the men in the ships fearing treachery from the evolutions of a
number of praus and junks, attack and capture one of the latter with
twenty-seven men. Next morning the junk commanded by the son of the
king of Luzon and ninety men, are captured. Of the seven men ashore the
king sends two to the ships, but retains the others, whereupon the
ships leave, taking with them fourteen men and three women of those
captured in the junks. While sailing back over their downward course,
the “Trinidad” grounds on a point of the island of Borneo, where it
remains for four hours until swung clear by the tide.

Brito in his account (Navarrete, iv, pp. 309, 310) says that the
Borneans fear at first lest the strangers be Portuguese and that their
object is conquest, but finally being reassured by Espinosa who takes a
present to the king, pilots are promised as far as Mindanao. During
their stay of a month at Borneo, two Greeks desert the ships. Three
others, among them Carvalho’s son, are ashore when the fear of attack
instigated by the two Greeks leads the two ships to attack the
Borneans, and the five men are left behind on the island.

The island of Borneo, the largest island (properly so-called) in the
world, is mentioned first by Varthema (Travels, Hakluyt Society
edition), pp. 246–248. See also Crawfurd’s Dictionary, pp. 57–66.
See also Henry Ling Roth’s Natives of Sarawak and British North
Borneo (London, 1896) in two volumes, which is an excellent work on
modern conditions in Borneo.

[420] The word “junk” is probably derived from the Malay Jong or
Ajong “a great ship.” For a description of these ships, see
Yule’s Cathay (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1866), ii, pp.
417, 418.

[421] MS. 5,650 reads: “If venom or poison be put in a vase of fine
porcelain, it breaks immediately.” In accordance with this reading we
have added in brackets in the Italian the word veleno, i.e.,
“poison,” which seems to have been omitted by the amanuensis. Mosto
(p. 88, note 3) quotes the following from Marcantonio Pigafetta’s
Itinerario da Vienna a Constantinopoli (p. 208), when speaking of the
present brought to Sultan Selim II by the Persian ambassador which
consisted of “eight dishes [piati firuarii] which break if any one
puts poison in them. Those piati firuarii are made of the substance
which we call porcelain, and are made in China, the province situated
in the extreme outskirts of the Orient. They are made of earth, which
is kept for more than fifty years buried in the earth, in order to
refine it, and which is buried by the father for his son. Thus it
passes from hand to hand.” See also Yule’s Cathay, ii, p. 478; and
Burnell and Tiele’s Linschoten (Hakluyt Society publications), i, pp.
129, 130.

[422] The small brass, copper, tin, and zinc coins common throughout
the eastern islands were called “pichis” or “pitis,” which was
the name of the ancient Javanese coin, now used as a frequent
appellative for money in general. Chinese coins were early in general
use throughout the southern islands of the eastern archipelagoes. See
Crawfurd’s Dictionary, pp. 285–288.

[423] The cate or catty. See Vol. XVIII, p. 141, note 32.

[424] MS. 5,650 mentions only the six porcelain dishes, the wax, and
the pitch, for the last eighty, instead of forty, cathils, of bronze
being traded. The bahar of the Italian MS. becomes “barrel” or
“cask” in the French. The anime (pitch) may have been one of the
numerous resins yielded by various trees in the Philippines (see Report
of Philippine Commission, 1900, iii, 282, 283).

[425] MS. 5,650 omits this word.

[426] Spectacles were invented in the thirteenth century; and the
credit for the invention is assigned to Alessandro dì Spina, a
Florentine monk, or to Roger Bacon.

[427] MS. 5,650 reads: “not to wash the buttocks with the left hand;
not to eat with it.”

[428] Stanley (p. 116) omits a portion of this paragraph. He says that
had Pigafetta been a Spaniard or Portuguese, he would not have written
as he did concerning the Mahometan laws, as he would have been better
informed. Notwithstanding the fact that Stanley was a convert to
Islamism and a student of that faith, some of these practices may have
been introduced into Borneo, as the rites there being far from their
center, may have become vitiated or imperfectly learned in the first
place. For instance, that the law was not strictly observed there is
seen from the fact recorded by Pigafetta that they used the intoxicant
arrack.

[429] MS. 5,650 says simply that the camphor exudes in small drops. The
Malay camphor tree (dipterocarpus or Dryabalanops camphora) is
confined, so far as known, to a few parts of the islands of Sumatra and
Borneo, where it is very abundant. The oil (both fluid and solid) is
found in the body of the tree where the sap should be, but not in all
trees. The Malay name for camphor is a slight corruption of the
Sanskrit one “karpura,” and to distinguish it from the camphor of
China and Japan, the word Barus is annexed (the name of the seaport of
the western coast of Sumatra, whence camphor was chiefly exported from
that island). The Malay variety is higher priced than the Chinese. See
Crawfurd’s Dictionary, p. 81.

[430] MS. 5,650 omits mention of the turnips and cabbages, and adds:
“hinds.”

[431] Immediately following this paragraph in the Italian MS. are three
charts: 1. On folio 45b, the chart of Burne (q.v., p. 210), at the
lower (i.e., northern) end of which is a scroll reading “Here are
found the living leaves;” found on folio 60b of MS. 5,650, preceded
by the words “Chart of the island of Burne and the place where the
living leaves are found.” 2. On folio 46b, the chart of Mindanao,
which is divided into the districts of Cippit, Butuam, Maingdanao,
Calagan, and Benaiam (q.v., p. 230); found on folio 63a of MS. 5,650,
preceded by the words “Chart of five islands—Benaian.” 3. On
folio 47a, the chart of the islands of Zzolo [i.e., Joló], Tagima, and
Chauit and Subanìn, (q.v., p. 230), accompanied by a scroll reading
“Where pearls are produced;” found on folio 63b of MS. 5,650,
preceded by the words “Chart of the islands of Zzolo, Cauit, Tagima,
and others.”

[432] Cape Sampanmangio (Guillemard, p. 274). See ante, note 418.

[433] MS. 5,650 omits this sentence.

[434] The “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 20) also narrates the capture of
this junk.

[435] In Eden: “Cimbubon, beinge. viii. degrees aboue the
Equinoctiall lyne. Here they remayned. xl. to calke theyr ſhyppes and
furnyſſe them with freſſhe water and fuell.” Cimbonbon is
probably Banguey or one of the neighboring islets between Borneo and
Palawan. It is called in the “Roteiro” (Stanley, p. 21), port Samta
Maria de Agosto, (St. Mary of August) because it was reached on the
fifteenth of August, the day of our Lady of August. It is assigned a
latitude of fully seven degrees. Herrera says that the ships were
overhauled on Borneo itself. Guillemard (p. 274) interprets Pigafetta
wrongly by saying that he assigns the careening place as Palawan or
Paragua.

[436] MS. 5,650 reads: “two and one-half feet long.”

[437] Cf. Transylvanus, Vol. I, pp. 330, 331. The Tridacna gigas,
described by Delgado, Historia, p. 929, under the name of taclobo.
Colin asserts that he saw one of the shells which was used as a
watering-trough and another as a holy-water font. The shells sometimes
attain a length of five or six feet, and weigh hundreds of pounds. The
natives burn them for lime. See Official Handbook of Philippines
(Manila, 1903), p. 152.

[438] Mosto (p. 89, note 8) conjectures this to be a fish of the family
of the Squamipen, perhaps of the genus Heniochus.

[439] Coca: An Italian word formed from the Spanish word “chocar”
“to jostle” (Mosto, p. 89, note 9). The living leaves, were the
insects of the genus of Phyllium of the order of the Orthoptera. They
are known as walking leaves from their resemblance to a leaf.

[440] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650. Eden says that Pigafetta
kept the leaf “for the ſpace of viii. dayes.”

[441] The date of the departure was September 27, 1521. At this place
João Carvalho was deposed from the chief command for his high-handed
measures and non-observance of royal orders, and retook his old
position as chief pilot. Espinosa was elected in his place and Elcano
was chosen captain of the “Victoria.” See Navarrete, iv, pp. 73,
289, 292, 294.

[442] Basilan; see Vol. III, p. 168, note 44.

[443] The true pearl oysters of the Philippine Islands are found along
the coasts of Paragua, Mindanao, and in the Sulu Archipelago,
especially in the last named, where many very valuable pearls are
found. These fisheries are said to rank with the famous fisheries of
Ceylon and the Persian Gulf. The mother-of-pearl of the shells is more
valuable than the pearls. The Sultan of Joló claims the fisheries as
his own and rents them out, but always has trouble with the lessees,
and his ownership is disputed by the datos. The pearl fishery has
figured in a treaty between that sultan and the United States
government. See Affairs of Philippines, Hearing before U. S. Senate
Committee (Washington, 1902), part i, p. 18; Official Handbook of
Philippines (Manila, 1903), p. 153; and Census of Philippine Islands
(Washington, 1905), pp. 534–536. An early interesting account of
pearl-fishing is given by Eden (Arber’s edition), pp. 213, 214.

[444] MS. 5,650 reads: “fifty.”

[445] Cáuit is a point and bay on the west coast of Zamboanga,
Mindanao; Subanin refers to a portion of Zamboanga; and the island of
Monoripa is perhaps the island of Saccol, located at the southeastern
end of the Zamboanga province. “Subanim” says Dr. Barrows (Census
of the Philippines, i, p. 416) “suggests a settlement of the present
aborigines of that part of Mindanao, who are known as Subanon. Here,
too, they saw the notorious ‘sea-gypsies,’ the Bajau or Sámal
Laut, whose wandering boats, then as now, shifted their stations with
the changing of the Monsoon.”

[446] Crawfurd (Dictionary, p. 100) says that the cinnamon of Mindanao
is not very strong or valuable; but the Official Handbook of
Philippines (Manila, 1903) says (p. 114) that a cinnamon of stronger
taste and fragrance is found in Zamboanga, Caraga, and the mountain
districts of Misamis, than that of Ceylon, although containing a bitter
element that depreciates its value, but which can be eliminated by
cultivation. Many of the old writers describe the plant and its
cultivation, one of the earliest being Varthema (Hakluyt Society
edition), p. 191. Pigafetta’s etymology of the Malay word is correct.

[447] Mosto (p. 90) mistranscribes biguiday, and Stanley has (p. 121),
bignaday. Perhaps it is the biniray, a boat resembling a large banca,
or the binitan (see Pastells’s Colin, i, p. 25).

[448] MS. 5,650 reads: “seventeen men seemingly as bold and ready as
any others whom we had seen in those districts.”

[449] Stanley says (p. 122) that this was attributed by a newspaper of
1874 to the Battas of Sumatra. Semper found the custom of eating the
heart or liver of their slain enemies among the Manobos in eastern
Mindanao (Mosto, p. 91, note 2). Tribes of Malayan origin living in
northern Luzón are said to have ceremonial cannibalism (Official
Handbook of Philippines, p. 158).

[450] MS. 5,650 reads: “twenty.”

[451] At this point in the Italian MS. (folio 50a) is found the chart
of Ciboco, Biraban Batolach, Sarangani, and Candigar (q.v., p. 238).
This chart is shown on folio 65a of MS. 5,650, preceded by the words:
“Chart of the four islands of Ciboco, etc.”

[452] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 223) calls these two islands Sibuco and
Virano Batolaque, the first of which Mosto (p. 91, note 3) conjectures
to be Sibago, and the second (note 4), part of the southern portion of
Mindanao. The first conjecture is probably correct if we take Albo’s
word that the two ships turned to the southeast after passing the
island Sibuco; and the fact that the main west coast east of Zamboanga
is remarkably free of islands, lends color to the second.

[453] The islands of Balut and Sarangani, just south of the most
southern point of Mindanao.

[454] MS. adds: “who are St. Elmo. St. Nicholas, and St. Clara.”

[455] It is just such acts as this bit of lawlessness, together with
the unprovoked capture of inoffensive vessels, that show that the
discipline of the ships had in great measure disappeared with the loss
of Magalhães. Such acts amounted to nothing less than piracy.

[456] These islands are of the Carcaralong or Karkaralong group south
of Mindanao. Mosto conjectures Cabaluzao (Cabulazao on the chart) to be
the island of Kabalusu, and that of Lipan, to be Lipang. Valentyn’s
Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien (Dordrecht and Amsterdam; 1724), i, between
pp. 36 and 37, shows a group of islands at about this location with the
names Lirong (Lipan ?), Karkelang, Cabroewang Noessa (Nuza ?),
Karkarotang, and Karotta.

[457] At this point in the Italian MS. occur two charts: 1. On folio
51a, the islands of Cauiao, Cabiao, Cabulazao, Lipan, Cheava, Camanuca,
Cheai, Nuza, and Sanghir (q.v., p. 242); in MS. 5,650 shown on folio
65b, preceded by the words: “Chart of the islands of Sanghir etc.”
2. On folio 51b, the islands of Cheama, Carachita, Para, Zangalura,
Ciau, Paghinzara, Talaut, Zoar, and Meau (q.v. p. 246); in MS. 5,650,
on folio 66b, preceded by the words: “Chart of the islands of Meau,
etc.”

Sanghir (now Sanguir) is called Sanguin by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p.
223), and by Castanheda (Mosto, p. 92, note 1).

[458] Of these islands (some of them in the Talantse group) Cheama is
Kima; Carachita is Karakitang; Para still retains that name, or is
called Pala; Zanghalura is Sangalong or Sangaluan; Ciau is Siao or
Sian; Paghinzara (so called by Albo, ut supra) figures on Valentyn’s
map (ut supra, note 457) as Pangasare, though the same island seems
also to be called Tagulanda, so that Guillemard is right in his
identification of this island; it is identified with the island of
Roang by the British Admiralty map of 1890, while Mosto conjectures
that it may be the island of Biaro. See Guillemard’s Magellan, map,
facing p. 226; and Mosto, p. 92, notes 2–7.

[459] MS. 5,650 gives this name as “Babintau.” That MS. adds:
“All those islands are inhabited by heathens,” and continuing,
reads: “There is an island called Talant east of Cheama.”

[460] Talaut is evidently one of the Tulur islands east of Sanguir.
Zoar (called Suar by Albo) and Meau may be the islands of Meyo and
Tifore. See Guillemard (ut supra), and Mosto, p. 92, notes 8–10. The
geography of the islands of the East India groups has not yet been set
forth in a detailed and masterly manner, or definite proportions given
to it, although it is a subject that merits enthusiastic research and
labor.

[461] Eden reads (p. 259): “the ſyxte daye of Nouember and the.
xxvii. monethe after theyr departure owt of Spayne.”

[462] MS. 5,650 adds: “by which they were deceived.”

Albo’s narrative (Navarrete, iv, pp. 222–224) of the events of the
two ships from the time they leave Borneo to the arrival at the
Moluccas is as follows: “We left Borney, and returned by the road
whence we had come, and consequently took the channel between the
headland of the island of Borney and Poluan. Turning west [sic] we went
toward the island of Quagayan, and thus we went by that same route in
search of the island of Quipit toward the south. On this course between
Quipit and Cagayan, we saw to the southward an island called Solo,
where many very large pearls are to be found. The king of that island
is said to have a pearl as large as an egg. That island lies in a
latitude of 6 degrees. While on that course, we came across three small
islets and farther on we met an island called Tagima, where many pearls
are said to be found. The latter island lies northeast by east and
southwest by west with Solo. Tagima lies in a latitude of 6 and
five-sixths degrees, and is located opposite the headland of Quipit.
Many islets lie between those two islands, and one must take to the
open as he approaches Quipit. The abovenamed headland lies in 7 and
one-fourth degrees, and extends southeast and west northwest with
Poluan.

“Thence we coasted the island of Quipit going toward the south.
Turning east by south we sailed toward certain rocky islets. Along the
coast many settlements are passed, where considerable excellent
cinnamon grows, and for which we traded. That coast also produces a
quantity of ginger. Then we sailed northeast until we saw a gulf,
whereupon we turned southeast until we saw a large island. There is a
very large settlement extending from that point to the eastern headland
of the island of Quipit, and at the headland of the said island.
Considerable gold is obtained there from a very large river. That
headland lies 91 and one-half degrees from the meridian.

“We left Quipit for Maluco and turned southeast, where we saw an
island called Sibuco. Then we turned south southeast, where we saw
another island called Viramo Batolaque, continuing along that same
course to the head of that island. Then we saw another island called
Candicar, and sailed eastward between the two islands until we reached
a point some distance ahead, and at that place we entered a channel
between Candicar and another island called Sarangani. We anchored at
the latter island and took a pilot for Maluco. Those two islands lie in
4 and two-thirds degrees, while the headland of Quipit lies in 7 and
one-fourth degrees, the headland of Sibuco in 6 degrees south latitude,
and the headland of Virano Batolaque in 5 degrees. From the headland of
Quipit and Candicar, the course is north northwest and south southeast
without meeting any headland.

“We left Sarangani and sailed south by east until we reached the
right side of an island called Sanguin. Between the two islands lie a
number of islets lying toward the west. Sanguin lies in 3 and
two-thirds degrees.

“From Sanguin we sailed south by east to an island called Sian.
Between those islands lie many rocky islets. The latter island lies in
exactly 3 degrees.

“We sailed south by west to an island called Paginsara, which lies in
10 and one-sixth degrees. The course from that island to Sarangani is
north by east and south by west and all those islands are sighted.

“From Paginsara we sailed south by east until we reached a position
midway between two islets which lie northeast and southwest from one
another. The one to the northeast is called Suar and the other Mean.
The first lies in 1 degree 45 minutes and the other in 1 and one-half
degrees.

“We sailed south southeast from Mean, until we sighted the islands of
the Malucos. Then we turned east and entered a channel between Mare and
Tidori, where we anchored. We were received there with the utmost
friendliness and established a firm peace. We built a house ashore in
order to trade with those people, and abode there many days until the
ships were laden.”

The “Roteiro” (Stanley, pp. 20–23) says that after leaving
Borneo, a small junk laden with cocoanuts was overhauled and captured,
and that shortly after the ships were careened for repairs in the port
of St. Mary of August (see ante, note 435). Steering southwest on again
setting sail, they come to the island of Fagajam (Cagayan) and that of
Seloque (Solo or Joló), where they learn that pearls are abundant.
Next they reach Quipe (Quipit), running between it and the island of
Tamgym (Tagima). “And always running along the coast of the said
island, and going thus, they fell in with a parao laden with sago in
loaves, which is bread made of a tree which is named cajare, which the
people of that country eat as bread. This parao carried twenty-one men,
and the chief of them had been in Maluco in the house of Francisco
Serram, and having gone further along this island they arrived in sight
of some islands which are named Semrryn.” A guide to Maluco is
bargained for, but after arrangements are concluded he attempts to play
false, whereupon he and some others are captured. The natives attempt
pursuit but are unable to overtake the two ships. Next day sighting an
island, and a calm coming upon them, while the currents drew the
vessels in toward shore, the old pilot escapes. Continuing they sight
“three high mountains belonging to a nation of people whom they call
the Salabos [Celebes?],” and shortly after desiring to take water at
a small island, they are deterred by one of their native pilots, who
assures them that the people are hostile. “While still in this
neighborhood, they saw the islands themselves of Maluco, and for
rejoicing they fired all the artillery, and they arrived at the island
on the 8th of November of 1521, so that they spent from Seville to
Maluco two years, two months and twenty-eight days, for they sailed on
the 10th of August of 1519.”

The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) places the distance from the
Ladrones to the Moluccas at 1,000 miles, the archipelago of St. Lazarus
“where there occur many islands” intervening.

At this point in the Italian MS. are found two charts, as follows: 1.
On folio 52b, a chart of the islands of Hiri, Tarenate, Mastara, and
Giailonlo (q.v., p. 250), with the inscription “All the islands shown
in this book are in the other hemisphere, at the antipodes;” probably
the same chart appears on folio 73b of MS. 5,650 preceded by the words
(in a different hand than most of that MS.): “Here follow the
cloves.” 2. On folio 53a, a chart entitled “Maluco,” showing the
islands Tadore, Mare, Pulongha, Mutir, and Machiam (q.v., Vol. XXXIV,
p. 72), with a tree bearing the inscription “Caui gomode, that is,
cloves;” shown on folio 74a of MS. 5,650, preceded by the words:
“Description of the clove trees; how they grow; season for gathering;
method of finding the best; and also of nutmegs.”

[463] Eden (p. 259) says that they entered port “before the ryſinge
of the ſoone.”

[464] MS. 5,650 adds: “by astrology.”

[465] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[466] MS. 5,650 omits the drinking-cups.

[467] From this point this sentence reads as follows in MS. 5,650:
“To some others we gave either silk cloth or some knives, or caps.”

[468] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650.

[469] MS. 5,650 reads: “a royal presence and eloquence.”

[470] “Mauzor” in Eden (p. 259).

[471] MS. 5,650 does not mention the “quintalada.” The quintalada
was a per cent of the freight or of the lading space of the ship
allowed the officers and crew of sailing vessels. The amount allowed to
each of the officers and crews of Magalhães’s fleet was specified in
section 74 of the instructions given by Cárlos I to Magalhães and
Falero at Barcelona, May 8, 1519. The amounts (see Navarrete, iv, pp.
150–152) are as follows:

    Following are declared the quintaladas which shall be laden in the
    ships about to sail to the spice regions, and the amount which each
    one shall lade, from which he will pay the twenty-fourth part to
    his Highness.


                                                        Quintaladas
First, Fernando de Magallanes and Falero,                        60
captains-general of the said fleet will be allowed sixty
quintals of cabin space [cámara] apiece
Item: of quintalada, and twenty quintals apiece, these           20
twenty to be stowed below decks, and the cabin space
above decks
The other three captains shall each be allowed forty             40
quintals of cabin space, ten of them quintalada
Treasurer, twenty quintals of cabin space, and one               22
quintalada below decks

and one quintalada
The other gunners, one and one-half quintaladas apiece            2½
Carpenters, one and one-half quintaladas                          2½
Calkers, the same                                                 2½

[472] Not nephew, as translated by Stanley (p. 126), as is shown later
by the context. MS. 5,650 spells his name “Calanoghapi.”

[473] The remainder of this sentence is not in MS. 5,650.

[474] In MS. 5,650 this is changed considerably, reading: “And
because he did not have enough merchandise to furnish our ships, he
told us that he would go to an island called Bacchian,” etc.

[475] Leonardo de Argensola (Vol. XVI, p. 221) derives Maluco from the
word “Moloc” meaning “the capital.” Crawfurd says that the
derivation and meaning of the word is unknown, although said to be that
of a people and place in Gilolo. It has been applied as a collective
name to all the islands of their district, but it is correct of only
the five mentioned by Pigafetta (for whose ancient names, see Vol. XVI,
p. 221). Varthema (Travels, Hakluyt Society edition, pp. 245, 246),
gives a slight account of the district under the name of the “island
of Monoch, where the cloves grow,” which Magalhães showed to Cárlos
I (Guillemard’s Magellan, p. 102). Barbosa gives the first authentic
account of the five Moluccas (which he names) in his East African and
Malabar Coasts (Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 201, 202, 219, 220. See
also Crawfurd’s Dictionary, pp. 283–285.

[476] Francisco Serrão, brother of João Serrão, was Magalhães’s
most intimate friend, and they had been close companions in the
stirring years of early Portuguese operations in far eastern waters. In
1509, Serrão sailed on the fleet sent by Almeida to reconnoiter
Malacca. Having been sent ashore with a large force, he was attacked by
the Malays and only the prompt assistance headed by Magalhães saved
him. In January, 1510, while returning from the expedition, he suffered
shipwreck. In 1511 he was sent as captain of one of three ships under
Antonio d’ Abreu to the Moluccas for purposes of exploration and
trade, but the expedition failed to reach the islands, going only as
far as the islands of Banda. On this expedition, Serrão’s ship was
abandoned as unseaworthy, and the junk bought in its stead was wrecked
on an island. Here pirates landing, Serrão and his men took possession
of their boats and thus reached Amboina in safety. The opportunity
offering, Serrão went to Ternate, where he espoused the cause of that
king against the king of Tidore, by the latter of whom he was finally
poisoned about the time of Magalhães’s death. A number of letters
passed between Magalhães and Serrão, during the years spent by the
latter in Ternate, and Magalhães made use of them to persuade Cárlos
I to undertake the expedition. See Guillemard’s Magellan.

[477] See Navarrete, iv, and Guillemard’s Magellan for details
regarding Magalhães’s negotiations with Manoel of Portugal and his
subsequent denaturalization. The testoon (tostão, tostões) is a
Portuguese silver coin. It was first struck in the fifteenth century
(Hazlitt’s Coinage of European Continent).

[478] It is impossible to be sure of the correct form of these names.
MS. 5,650 gives them as follows: “Checchily Momoly, Tadore Vimghi,
Checchily de Roix, Cili Manzur, Cilli Paggi, Chialin, Checchilin
Catara, Vaiechuserich, and Colano Ghappi.” Amoretti (followed by
Stanley) makes these names “Chechili-Momuli, Jadore Vunghi,
Chechilideroix, Cilimanzur, Cilipagi, Chialinchechilin, Cataravajecu,
Serich, and Calanopagi.” Mosto gives the names as in the present
edition with the exception of the sixth and seventh which he gives as
“Chialin Chechilin” and “Cathara.” Checheli (Chechelin) and
possibly Cili, denotes the title Cachil (“noble”).

[479] Called by Barros “João de Lourosa, a man disloyal to his
country (Mosto, p. 94, note 5). The “Roteiro” (Stanley, pp. 23,
24), says that this man was found in the island of Targatell (Ternate)
and that letters were sent him, asking him “to come and speak with
them, to which he replied that he did not dare, because the king of the
country forbade it.” However, permission is secured from the king and
Lorosa comes to the ships. An extract from a letter from the Indies
(Vol. I, p. 299) says that Lorosa was taken prisoner. Brito (Navarrete,
iv, p. 305) merely mentions the fact that he had left with the
Spaniards. He remained with the “Trinidad,” and was promptly
executed by the Portuguese when he fell into their hands (see
Guillemard’s Magellan, p. 303).

[480] MS. 5,650 adds: “hearing that.”

[481] In Eden: “ſixe hundreth and fiftie.” The native name of
Gilolo is Bato-tsima (also called Almahera), and the island belongs to
the Netherlands, being included in the residency of Ternate. The
population, estimated at 120,000, consists of Malays and Alfuros
(pagans; a word apparently formed from the Arabic article al and fora,
“without,” and applied by the Portuguese to natives outside of
their authority) the latter probably representing the pre-Malayan
populations, and inhabiting the central portion of the island.

[482] Eden (p. 227), translating from Oviedo, mentions canes “as
bygge as a mans legge in the knee and three ſpannes in length frome
ioynt to ioynt or more.... Theyr canes are full of moſte cleare water
without any maner of taſt or ſauore eyther of the canes or of any
other thynge: And ſuche as yf it were taken owte of the freſſheſte
ſprynge in the worlde.” Pigafetta probably refers to some species of
bamboo.

[483] MS. 5,650 reads: “for ten aunes of cloth [dyed with]
munjeet.” Guzerati or Guzerat (Gujerat, Gugerat, Goojerat, Gujrat)
one of the old provinces of India, of which the Kattywar peninsula
forms the western part, was a dependency of the Affghân or Ghôri
empire of Hindostan until the end of the fourteenth century. It became
an independent kingdom in 1408. See Badger’s introduction to
Varthema’s Travels (Hakluyt Society edition), p. lviii. Foster’s
Embassy of Sir Thomas Roe (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1899),
says of Guzerat (pp. 539, 540): “Guzratt. A goodly Kingdom enclosing
the bay of Cambaya. The Cheefe Citty is Amadavaz [Ahmadábád]. It
Conteynes the Citty and Gouerment of Cambaya, the bewty of India, the
Territorie and Citty of Surat, and Barooch [Broach]. It is watered with
many goodly Riuers, as that of Cambaya [the Máhi], falsely supposed to
be Indus, the Riuer of Narbadah, falling into the Sea at Barooch, that
of Suratt, and diuers others. It trades to the Red Sea, to Achyn, and
many places.” Its ports were important centers of trade.

[484] This item is missing in MS. 5,650, and in Eden.

[485] Cf. with the prices of various oriental products in Barbosa’s
East African and Malabar Coasts (Hakluyt Society edition), pp.
221–223.

[486] Probably it was because of this belief that the ships intended to
take in water near Celebes, “because they feared that in Maluco they
would not be allowed to take it in” (see the “Roteiro,” Stanley,
p. 22).

[487] MS. 5,650 omits the remainder of this paragraph.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
