Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop a model to analyze the              
              determinants of household energy conservation decisions.                       
              Conservation investment decisions are modeled in the presence of               
              energy price uncertainty, and the actual patterns of household                 
              investments during the 1970's and early 1980's are analyzed. The               
              irreversibility of energy related investments creates an option                
              value in postponing investment, given the possibility that future              
              energy prices could fall sufficiently to make the investment                   
              economically unattractive.  It is quite possible that the existence            
              of this option value can help explain the low rate of investment in            
              energy conservation measures recorded during the past two decades.             
                                                                                             
              Using the model developed in the project, investment simulations               
              calibrated to aggregate data will be carried out to explore the                
              pattern of energy conservation investment, and then to investigate             
              empirically the impact of tax incentives on investment behavior.               
              The empirical work will use a large panel data set of individual               
              tax returns followed over a three year period.  In addition,                   
              different investment patterns by energy conservation category will             
              be analyzed.
