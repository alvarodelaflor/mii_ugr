Abstract    :
              This project involves a detailed investigation of oxygen isotope               
              variations in volcanic rocks of the Comstock Lode.  A remarkable               
              and perhaps unique opportunity exists to combine oxygen data on                
              surface samples with data on samples from mine workings and drill              
              cores in order to construct the first detailed 3-dimensional image             
              of a hydrothermal system in an important mining district.  This                
              work will include examination of   18  variations down several                 
              1-km-deep vertical mine shafts as well as the preparation of an                
              isotopic cross-section of the famous Con Virginia bonanza.  The                
              research will disclose critical relationships between circulation              
              patterns and geologic factors that will advance understanding of               
              these systems and may prove to be invaluable guides to ore                     
              deposits.
