Abstract    :
                   This award is in support of one element of paleoclimatology               
              from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE).  Arctic lakes are                      
              recognized as valuable repositories of paleoenvironmental proxy                
              information (e.g. fossil pollen, sediment chemistry) that is                   
              important for paleoclimatological studies.  However, beyond the                
              usual 30-40 ka limit of radiocarbon dating, dating control needed              
              form the interpretation of such fossil pollen records is presently             
              unavailable.  Preliminary, single-analysis thermoluminescence (TL              
              dating results have been obtained for one Arctic lake core                     
              (Squirrel Lake) to test the capability of TL dating for such Arctic            
              sediments, but some results are ambiguous.  This award outlines TL             
              dating and other tests(e.g. measurement of TL emission spectra)                
              designed to assess the cause of these ambiguous, preliminary                   
              results for some samples for the Squirrel Lake core.  The proposed             
              dating experiments will refine the limitations and usefulness of TL            
              sediment dating procedures for Arctic lake sediments, provide the              
              first "radiometrically" dated record beyond 30-40 ka for Arctic                
              lakes, and provide a firmer basis for future application of TL                 
              dating to long-core (0-200 ka) sediment records for circumpolar                
              Arctic lakes.
