INTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book aims to give in brief space the principal requirements of\r\nplain English style. It aims to lighten the task of instructor and\r\nstudent by concentrating attention (in Chapters II and III) on a few\r\nessentials, the rules of usage and principles of composition most\r\ncommonly violated. In accordance with this plan it lays down three rules\r\nfor the use of the comma, instead of a score or more, and one for the\r\nuse of the semicolon, in the belief that these four rules provide for\r\nall the internal punctuation that is required by nineteen sentences out\r\nof twenty. Similarly, it gives in Chapter\xc2\xa0III only those principles of\r\nthe paragraph and the sentence which are of the widest application. The\r\nbook thus covers only a small portion of the field of English style. The\r\nexperience of its writer has been that once past the essentials,\r\nstudents profit most by individual instruction based on the problems of\r\ntheir own work, and that each instructor has his own body of theory,\r\nwhich he may prefer to that offered by any textbook.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the sections may be used as references in correcting\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nThe writer\'s colleagues in the Department of English in Cornell\r\nUniversity have greatly helped him in the preparation of his manuscript.\r\nMr. George McLane Wood has kindly consented to the inclusion under\r\nRule\xc2\xa010 of some material from his _Suggestions to Authors_.\r\n\r\nThe following books are recommended for reference or further study: in\r\nconnection with Chapters II and IV, F. Howard Collins, _Author and\r\nPrinter_ (Henry Frowde); Chicago University Press, _Manual of Style_;\r\nT.\xc2\xa0L. De Vinne, _Correct Composition_ (The Century Company); Horace\r\nHart, _Rules for Compositors and Printers_ (Oxford University Press);\r\nGeorge McLane Wood, _Extracts from the Style-Book of the Government\r\nPrinting Office_ (United States Geological Survey); in connection with\r\nChapters III and V, _The King\'s English_ (Oxford University Press); Sir\r\nArthur Quiller-Couch, _The Art of Writing_ (Putnam), especially the\r\nchapter, Interlude on Jargon; George McLane Wood, _Suggestions to\r\nAuthors_ (United States Geological Survey); John Lesslie Hall, _English\r\nUsage_ (Scott, Foresman and Co.); James P. Kelley, _Workmanship in\r\nWords_ (Little, Brown and Co.). In these will be found full discussions\r\nof many points here briefly treated and an abundant store of\r\nillustrations to supplement those given in this book.\r\n\r\nIt is an old observation that the best writers sometimes disregard the\r\nrules of rhetoric. When they do so, however, the reader will usually\r\nfind in the sentence some compensating merit, attained at the cost of\r\nthe violation. Unless he is certain of doing as well, he will probably\r\ndo best to follow the rules. After he has learned, by their guidance, to\r\nwrite plain English adequate for everyday uses, let him look, for the\r\nsecrets of style, to the study of the masters of literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ELEMENTARY RULES OF USAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding \'s.\r\n\r\nFollow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write,\r\n\r\n  Charles\'s friend\r\n\r\n  Burns\'s poems\r\n\r\n  the witch\'s malice\r\n\r\nThis is the usage of the United States Government Printing Office and of\r\nthe Oxford University Press.\r\n\r\nExceptions are the possessive of ancient proper names in _-es_ and\r\n_-is_, the possessive _Jesus\'_, and such forms as _for conscience\'\r\nsake_, _for righteousness\' sake_. But such forms as _Achilles\' heel_,\r\n_Moses\' laws_, _Isis\' temple_ are commonly replaced by\r\n\r\n  the heel of Achilles\r\n\r\n  the laws of Moses\r\n\r\n  the temple of Isis\r\n\r\nThe pronominal possessives _hers_, _its_, _theirs_, _yours_, and\r\n_oneself_ have no apostrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a\r\ncomma after each term except the last.\r\n\r\nThus write,\r\n\r\n  red, white, and blue\r\n\r\n  gold, silver, or copper\r\n\r\n  He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents.\r\n\r\nThis is also the usage of the Government Printing Office and of the\r\nOxford University Press.\r\n\r\nIn the names of business firms the last comma is omitted, as,\r\n\r\n  Brown, Shipley & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.\r\n\r\n  The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to\r\n  travel on foot.\r\n\r\nThis rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether\r\na single word, such as _however_, or a brief phrase, is or is not\r\nparenthetic. If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but\r\nslight, the writer may safely omit the commas. But whether the\r\ninterruption be slight or considerable, he must never insert one comma\r\nand omit the other. Such punctuation as\r\n\r\n  Marjorie\'s husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday,\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health,\r\n\r\nis indefensible.\r\n\r\nIf a parenthetic expression is preceded by a conjunction, place the\r\nfirst comma before the conjunction, not after it.\r\n\r\n  He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his treachery,\r\n  greeted us with a smile.\r\n\r\nAlways to be regarded as parenthetic and to be enclosed between commas\r\n(or, at the end of the sentence, between comma and period) are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(1) the year, when forming part of a date, and the day of the month,\r\nwhen following the day of the week:\r\n\r\n  February to July, 1916.\r\n\r\n  April 6, 1917.\r\n\r\n  Monday, November 11, 1918.\r\n\r\n(2) the abbreviations _etc._ and _jr._\r\n\r\n(3) non-restrictive relative clauses, that is, those which do not serve\r\nto identify or define the antecedent noun, and similar clauses\r\nintroduced by conjunctions indicating time or place.\r\n\r\n  The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and\r\n  more interested.\r\n\r\nIn this sentence the clause introduced by _which_ does not serve to tell\r\nwhich of several possible audiences is meant; what audience is in\r\nquestion is supposed to be already known. The clause adds,\r\nparenthetically, a statement supplementing that in the main clause. The\r\nsentence is virtually a combination of two statements which might have\r\nbeen made independently:\r\n\r\n  The audience had at first been indifferent. It became more and more\r\n  interested.\r\n\r\nCompare the restrictive relative clause, not set off by commas, in the\r\nsentence,\r\n\r\n  The candidate who best meets these requirements will obtain the place.\r\n\r\nHere the clause introduced by _who_ does serve to tell which of several\r\npossible candidates is meant; the sentence cannot be split up into two\r\nindependent statements.\r\n\r\nThe difference in punctuation in the two sentences following is based on\r\nthe same principle:\r\n\r\n  Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote _The Rime of the Ancient\r\n  Mariner_, is a few miles from Bridgewater.\r\n\r\n  The day will come when you will admit your mistake.\r\n\r\nNether Stowey is completely identified by its name; the statement about\r\nColeridge is therefore supplementary and parenthetic. The _day_ spoken\r\nof is identified only by the dependent clause, which is therefore\r\nrestrictive.\r\n\r\nSimilar in principle to the enclosing of parenthetic expressions between\r\ncommas is the setting off by commas of phrases or dependent clauses\r\npreceding or following the main clause of a sentence.\r\n\r\n  Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged\r\n  their dominions to the east, and rose to royal rank with the\r\n  possession of Sicily, exchanged afterwards for Sardinia.\r\n\r\nOther illustrations may be found in sentences quoted under Rules 4, 5,\r\n6, 7, 16, and 18.\r\n\r\nThe writer should be careful not to set off independent clauses by\r\ncommas: see under Rule\xc2\xa05.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing a co-ordinate clause.\r\n\r\n  The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its\r\n  first years can no longer be reconstructed.\r\n\r\n  The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.\r\n\r\nSentences of this type, isolated from their context, may seem to be in\r\nneed of rewriting. As they make complete sense when the comma is\r\nreached, the second clause has the appearance of an afterthought.\r\nFurther, _and_ is the least specific of connectives. Used between\r\nindependent clauses, it indicates only that a relation exists between\r\nthem without defining that relation. In the example above, the relation\r\nis that of cause and result. The two sentences might be rewritten:\r\n\r\n  As the early records of the city have disappeared, the story of its\r\n  first years can no longer be reconstructed.\r\n\r\n  Although the situation is perilous, there is still one chance of\r\n  escape.\r\n\r\nOr the subordinate clauses might be replaced by phrases:\r\n\r\n  Owing to the disappearance of the early records of the city, the story\r\n  of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.\r\n\r\n  In this perilous situation, there is still one chance of escape.\r\n\r\nBut a writer may err by making his sentences too uniformly compact and\r\nperiodic, and an occasional loose sentence prevents the style from\r\nbecoming too formal and gives the reader a certain relief. Consequently,\r\nloose sentences of the type first quoted are common in easy, unstudied\r\nwriting. But a writer should be careful not to construct too many of his\r\nsentences after this pattern (see Rule\xc2\xa014).\r\n\r\nTwo-part sentences of which the second member is introduced by _as_ (in\r\nthe sense of _because_), _for_, _or_, _nor_, and _while_ (in the sense\r\nof _and at the same time_) likewise require a comma before the\r\nconjunction.\r\n\r\nIf the second member is introduced by an adverb, a semicolon, not a\r\ncomma, is required (see Rule\xc2\xa05). The connectives _so_ and _yet_ may be\r\nused either as adverbs or as conjunctions, accordingly as the second\r\nclause is felt to be co-ordinate or subordinate; consequently either\r\nmark of punctuation may be justified. But these uses of _so_ (equivalent\r\nto _accordingly_ or to _so that_) are somewhat colloquial and should, as\r\na rule, be avoided in writing. A simple correction, usually serviceable,\r\nis to omit the word _so_ and begin the first clause with _as_ or\r\n_since_:\r\n\r\n  I had never been in the place before; so I had difficulty in finding\r\n  my way about.\r\n\r\n    As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in finding\r\n    my way about.\r\n\r\nIf a dependent clause, or an introductory phrase requiring to be set off\r\nby a comma, precedes the second independent clause, no comma is needed\r\nafter the conjunction.\r\n\r\n  The situation is perilous, but if we are prepared to act promptly,\r\n  there is still one chance of escape.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject is the same for both clauses and is expressed only\r\nonce, a comma is required if the connective is _but_. If the connective\r\nis _and_, the comma should be omitted if the relation between the two\r\nstatements is close or immediate.\r\n\r\n  I have heard his arguments, but am still unconvinced.\r\n\r\n  He has had several years\' experience and is thoroughly competent.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Do not join independent clauses by a comma.\r\n\r\nIf two or more clauses, grammatically complete and not joined by a\r\nconjunction, are to form a single compound sentence, the proper mark of\r\npunctuation is a semicolon.\r\n\r\n  Stevenson\'s romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting\r\n  adventures.\r\n\r\n  It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.\r\n\r\nIt is of course equally correct to write the above as two sentences\r\neach, replacing the semicolons by periods.\r\n\r\n  Stevenson\'s romances are entertaining. They are full of exciting\r\n  adventures.\r\n\r\n  It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark.\r\n\r\nIf a conjunction is inserted the proper mark is a comma (Rule\xc2\xa04).\r\n\r\n  Stevenson\'s romances are entertaining, for they are full of exciting\r\n  adventures.\r\n\r\n  It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the three forms given above will show clearly the\r\nadvantage of the first. It is, at least in the examples given, better\r\nthan the second form, because it suggests the close relationship between\r\nthe two statements in a way that the second does not attempt, and better\r\nthan the third, because briefer and therefore more forcible. Indeed it\r\nmay be said that this simple method of indicating relationship between\r\nstatements is one of the most useful devices of composition. The\r\nrelationship, as above, is commonly one of cause or of consequence.\r\n\r\nNote that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as\r\n_accordingly_, _besides_, _then_, _therefore_, or _thus_, and not by a\r\nconjunction, the semicolon is still required.\r\n\r\nTwo exceptions to the rule may be admitted. If the clauses are very\r\nshort, and are alike in form, a comma is usually permissible:\r\n\r\n  Man proposes, God disposes.\r\n\r\n  The gate swung apart, the bridge fell, the portcullis was drawn up.\r\n\r\nNote that in these examples the relation is not one of cause or\r\nconsequence. Also in the colloquial form of expression,\r\n\r\n  I hardly knew him, he was so changed,\r\n\r\na comma, not a semicolon, is required. But this form of expression is\r\ninappropriate in writing, except in the dialogue of a story or play, or\r\nperhaps in a familiar letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Do not break sentences in two.\r\n\r\nIn other words, do not use periods for commas.\r\n\r\n  I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from\r\n  Liverpool to New York.\r\n\r\n  He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over the\r\n  world and lived in half a dozen countries.\r\n\r\nIn both these examples, the first period should be replaced by a comma,\r\nand the following word begun with a small letter.\r\n\r\nIt is permissible to make an emphatic word or expression serve the\r\npurpose of a sentence and to punctuate it accordingly:\r\n\r\n  Again and again he called out. No reply.\r\n\r\nThe writer must, however, be certain that the emphasis is warranted, and\r\nthat he will not be suspected of a mere blunder in syntax or in\r\npunctuation.\r\n\r\nRules 3, 4, 5, and 6 cover the most important principles in the\r\npunctuation of ordinary sentences; they should be so thoroughly mastered\r\nthat their application becomes second nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the\r\ngrammatical subject.\r\n\r\n  Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two\r\n  children.\r\n\r\nThe word _walking_ refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the\r\nwoman. If the writer wishes to make it refer to the woman, he must\r\nrecast the sentence:\r\n\r\n  He saw a woman accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the\r\n  road.\r\n\r\nParticipial phrases preceded by a conjunction or by a preposition, nouns\r\nin apposition, adjectives, and adjective phrases come under the same\r\nrule if they begin the sentence.\r\n\r\n  On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.\r\n\r\n    When he arrived (or, On his arrival) in Chicago, his friends met him\r\n    at the station.\r\n\r\n  A soldier of proved valor, they entrusted him with the defence of the\r\n  city.\r\n\r\n    A soldier of proved valor, he was entrusted with the defence of the\r\n    city.\r\n\r\n  Young and inexperienced, the task seemed easy to me.\r\n\r\n    Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy.\r\n\r\n  Without a friend to counsel him, the temptation proved irresistible.\r\n\r\n    Without a friend to counsel him, he found the temptation\r\n    irresistible.\r\n\r\nSentences violating this rule are often ludicrous.\r\n\r\n  Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very\r\n  cheap.\r\n\r\n  Wondering irresolutely what to do next, the clock struck twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF COMPOSITION\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\nIf the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or if you\r\nintend to treat it very briefly, there may be no need of subdividing it\r\ninto topics. Thus a brief description, a brief summary of a literary\r\nwork, a brief account of a single incident, a narrative merely outlining\r\nan action, the setting forth of a single idea, any one of these is best\r\nwritten in a single paragraph. After the paragraph has been written,\r\nexamine it to see whether subdivision will not improve it.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, however, a subject requires subdivision into topics, each of\r\nwhich should be made the subject of a paragraph. The object of treating\r\neach topic in a paragraph by itself is, of course, to aid the reader.\r\nThe beginning of each paragraph is a signal to him that a new step in\r\nthe development of the subject has been reached.\r\n\r\nThe extent of subdivision will vary with the length of the composition.\r\nFor example, a short notice of a book or poem might consist of a single\r\nparagraph. One slightly longer might consist of two paragraphs:\r\n\r\n  A. Account of the work.\r\n  B. Critical discussion.\r\n\r\nA report on a poem, written for a class in literature, might consist of\r\nseven paragraphs:\r\n\r\n  A. Facts of composition and publication.\r\n  B. Kind of poem; metrical form.\r\n  C. Subject.\r\n  D. Treatment of subject.\r\n  E. For what chiefly remarkable.\r\n  F. Wherein characteristic of the writer.\r\n  G. Relationship to other works.\r\n\r\nThe contents of paragraphs C and D would vary with the poem. Usually,\r\nparagraph C would indicate the actual or imagined circumstances of the\r\npoem (the situation), if these call for explanation, and would then\r\nstate the subject and outline its development. If the poem is a\r\nnarrative in the third person throughout, paragraph C need contain no\r\nmore than a concise summary of the action. Paragraph D would indicate\r\nthe leading ideas and show how they are made prominent, or would\r\nindicate what points in the narrative are chiefly emphasized.\r\n\r\nA novel might be discussed under the heads:\r\n\r\n  A. Setting.\r\n  B. Plot.\r\n  C. Characters.\r\n  D. Purpose.\r\n\r\nAn historical event might be discussed under the heads:\r\n\r\n  A. What led up to the event.\r\n  B. Account of the event.\r\n  C. What the event led up to.\r\n\r\nIn treating either of these last two subjects, the writer would probably\r\nfind it necessary to subdivide one or more of the topics here given.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as\r\nparagraphs. An exception may be made of sentences of transition,\r\nindicating the relation between the parts of an exposition or argument.\r\nFrequent exceptions are also necessary in textbooks, guidebooks, and\r\nother works in which many topics are treated briefly.\r\n\r\nIn dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is a paragraph by\r\nitself; that is, a new paragraph begins with each change of speaker. The\r\napplication of this rule, when dialogue and narrative are combined, is\r\nbest learned from examples in well-printed works of fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence, end it in\r\nconformity with the beginning.\r\n\r\nAgain, the object is to aid the reader. The practice here recommended\r\nenables him to discover the purpose of each paragraph as he begins to\r\nread it, and to retain this purpose in mind as he ends it. For this\r\nreason, the most generally useful kind of paragraph, particularly in\r\nexposition and argument, is that in which\r\n\r\n(a) the topic sentence comes at or near the beginning;\r\n\r\n(b) the succeeding sentences explain or establish or develop the\r\nstatement made in the topic sentence; and\r\n\r\n(c) the final sentence either emphasizes the thought of the topic\r\nsentence or states some important consequence.\r\n\r\nEnding with a digression, or with an unimportant detail, is particularly\r\nto be avoided.\r\n\r\nIf the paragraph forms part of a larger composition, its relation to\r\nwhat precedes, or its function as a part of the whole, may need to be\r\nexpressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word or phrase (_again_;\r\n_therefore_; _for the same reason_) in the topic sentence. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, it is expedient to precede the topic sentence by one or more\r\nsentences of introduction or transition. If more than one such sentence\r\nis required, it is generally better to set apart the transitional\r\nsentences as a separate paragraph.\r\n\r\nAccording to the writer\'s purpose, he may, as indicated above, relate\r\nthe body of the paragraph to the topic sentence in one or more of\r\nseveral different ways. He may make the meaning of the topic sentence\r\nclearer by restating it in other forms, by defining its terms, by\r\ndenying the contrary, by giving illustrations or specific instances; he\r\nmay establish it by proofs; or he may develop it by showing its\r\nimplications and consequences. In a long paragraph, he may carry out\r\nseveral of these processes.\r\n\r\n  1 Now, to be properly enjoyed, a walking tour should be gone upon\r\n  alone. 2 If you go in a company, or even in pairs, it is no longer a\r\n  walking tour in anything but name; it is something else and more in\r\n  the nature of a picnic. 3 A walking tour should be gone upon alone,\r\n  because freedom is of the essence; because you should be able to stop\r\n  and go on, and follow this way or that, as the freak takes you; and\r\n  because you must have your own pace, and neither trot alongside a\r\n  champion walker, nor mince in time with a girl. 4 And you must be open\r\n  to all impressions and let your thoughts take colour from what you\r\n  see. 5 You should be as a pipe for any wind to play upon. 6 "I cannot\r\n  see the wit," says Hazlitt, "of walking and talking at the same time.\r\n  7 When I am in the country, I wish to vegetate like the country,"\r\n  which is the gist of all that can be said upon the matter. 8 There\r\n  should be no cackle of voices at your elbow, to jar on the meditative\r\n  silence of the morning. 9 And so long as a man is reasoning he cannot\r\n  surrender himself to that fine intoxication that comes of much motion\r\n  in the open air, that begins in a sort of dazzle and sluggishness of\r\n  the brain, and ends in a peace that passes comprehension.--Stevenson,\r\n  _Walking Tours_.\r\n\r\n  1 Topic sentence. 2 The meaning made clearer by denial of the\r\n  contrary. 3 The topic sentence repeated, in abridged form, and\r\n  supported by three reasons; the meaning of the third ("you must have\r\n  your own pace") made clearer by denying the contrary. 4 A fourth\r\n  reason, stated in two forms. 5 The same reason, stated in still\r\n  another form. 6-7 The same reason as stated by Hazlitt. 8 Repetition,\r\n  in paraphrase, of the quotation from Hazlitt. 9 Final statement of the\r\n  fourth reason, in language amplified and heightened to form a strong\r\n  conclusion.\r\n\r\n  1 It was chiefly in the eighteenth century that a very different\r\n  conception of history grew up. 2 Historians then came to believe that\r\n  their task was not so much to paint a picture as to solve a problem;\r\n  to explain or illustrate the successive phases of national growth,\r\n  prosperity, and adversity. 3 The history of morals, of industry, of\r\n  intellect, and of art; the changes that take place in manners or\r\n  beliefs; the dominant ideas that prevailed in successive periods; the\r\n  rise, fall, and modification of political constitutions; in a word,\r\n  all the conditions of national well-being became the subject of their\r\n  works. 4 They sought rather to write a history of peoples than a\r\n  history of kings. 5 They looked especially in history for the chain of\r\n  causes and effects. 6 They undertook to study in the past the\r\n  physiology of nations, and hoped by applying the experimental method\r\n  on a large scale to deduce some lessons of real value about the\r\n  conditions on which the welfare of society mainly depend.--Lecky, _The\r\n  Political Value of History_.\r\n\r\n  1 Topic sentence. 2 The meaning of the topic sentence made clearer;\r\n  the new conception of history defined. 3 The definition expanded. 4\r\n  The definition explained by contrast. 5 The definition supplemented:\r\n  another element in the new conception of history. 6 Conclusion: an\r\n  important consequence of the new conception of history.\r\n\r\nIn narration and description the paragraph sometimes begins with a\r\nconcise, comprehensive statement serving to hold together the details\r\nthat follow.\r\n\r\n  The breeze served us admirably.\r\n\r\n  The campaign opened with a series of reverses.\r\n\r\n  The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious set of\r\n  entries.\r\n\r\nBut this device, if too often used, would become a mannerism. More\r\ncommonly the opening sentence simply indicates by its subject with what\r\nthe paragraph is to be principally concerned.\r\n\r\n  At length I thought I might return towards the stockade.\r\n\r\n  He picked up the heavy lamp from the table and began to explore.\r\n\r\n  Another flight of steps, and they emerged on the roof.\r\n\r\nThe brief paragraphs of animated narrative, however, are often without\r\neven this semblance of a topic sentence. The break between them serves\r\nthe purpose of a rhetorical pause, throwing into prominence some detail\r\nof the action.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Use the active voice.\r\n\r\nThe active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive:\r\n\r\n  I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.\r\n\r\nThis is much better than\r\n\r\n  My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.\r\n\r\nThe latter sentence is less direct, less bold, and less concise. If the\r\nwriter tries to make it more concise by omitting "by me,"\r\n\r\n  My first visit to Boston will always be remembered,\r\n\r\nit becomes indefinite: is it the writer, or some person undisclosed, or\r\nthe world at large, that will always remember this visit?\r\n\r\nThis rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely\r\ndiscard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n  The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed to-day.\r\n\r\n  Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the\r\n  Restoration.\r\n\r\nThe first would be the right form in a paragraph on the dramatists of\r\nthe Restoration; the second, in a paragraph on the tastes of modern\r\nreaders. The need of making a particular word the subject of the\r\nsentence will often, as in these examples, determine which voice is to\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, avoid making one passive depend directly upon another.\r\n\r\n  Gold was not allowed to be exported.\r\n\r\n    It was forbidden to export gold (The export of gold was prohibited).\r\n\r\n  He has been proved to have been seen entering the building.\r\n\r\n    It has been proved that he was seen to enter the building.\r\n\r\nIn both the examples above, before correction, the word properly related\r\nto the second passive is made the subject of the first.\r\n\r\nA common fault is to use as the subject of a passive construction a noun\r\nwhich expresses the entire action, leaving to the verb no function\r\nbeyond that of completing the sentence.\r\n\r\n  A survey of this region was made in 1900.\r\n\r\n    This region was surveyed in 1900.\r\n\r\n  Mobilization of the army was rapidly effected.\r\n\r\n    The army was rapidly mobilized.\r\n\r\n  Confirmation of these reports cannot be obtained.\r\n\r\n    These reports cannot be confirmed.\r\n\r\nCompare the sentence, "The export of gold was prohibited," in which the\r\npredicate "was prohibited" expresses something not implied in "export."\r\n\r\nThe habitual use of the active voice makes for forcible writing. This is\r\ntrue not only in narrative principally concerned with action, but in\r\nwriting of any kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition\r\ncan be made lively and emphatic by substituting a verb in the active\r\nvoice for some such perfunctory expression as _there is_, or _could be\r\nheard_.\r\n\r\n  There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.\r\n\r\n    Dead leaves covered the ground.\r\n\r\n  The sound of a guitar somewhere in the house could be heard.\r\n\r\n    Somewhere in the house a guitar hummed sleepily.\r\n\r\n  The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired.\r\n\r\n    Failing health compelled him to leave college.\r\n\r\n  It was not long before he was very sorry that he had said what he had.\r\n\r\n    He soon repented his words.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Put statements in positive form.\r\n\r\nMake definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating,\r\nnon-committal language. Use the word _not_ as a means of denial or in\r\nantithesis, never as a means of evasion.\r\n\r\n  He was not very often on time.\r\n\r\n    He usually came late.\r\n\r\n  He did not think that studying Latin was much use.\r\n\r\n    He thought the study of Latin useless.\r\n\r\n  _The Taming of the Shrew_ is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare does\r\n  not portray Katharine as a very admirable character, nor does Bianca\r\n  remain long in memory as an important character in Shakespeare\'s works.\r\n\r\n    The women in _The Taming of the Shrew_ are unattractive. Katharine\r\n    is disagreeable, Bianca insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe last example, before correction, is indefinite as well as negative.\r\nThe corrected version, consequently, is simply a guess at the writer\'s\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nAll three examples show the weakness inherent in the word _not_.\r\nConsciously or unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being told\r\nonly what is not; he wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a rule, it is\r\nbetter to express even a negative in positive form.\r\n\r\n  not honest\r\n\r\n    dishonest\r\n\r\n  not important\r\n\r\n    trifling\r\n\r\n  did not remember\r\n\r\n    forgot\r\n\r\n  did not pay any attention to\r\n\r\n    ignored\r\n\r\n  did not have much confidence in\r\n\r\n    distrusted\r\n\r\nThe antithesis of negative and positive is strong:\r\n\r\n  Not charity, but simple justice.\r\n\r\n  Not that I loved Caesar less, but Rome the more.\r\n\r\nNegative words other than _not_ are usually strong:\r\n\r\n  The sun never sets upon the British flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Use definite, specific, concrete language.\r\n\r\nPrefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the\r\nconcrete to the abstract.\r\n\r\n  A period of unfavorable weather set in.\r\n\r\n    It rained every day for a week.\r\n\r\n  He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned\r\n  reward.\r\n\r\n    He grinned as he pocketed the coin.\r\n\r\n  There is a general agreement among those who have enjoyed the\r\n  experience that surf-riding is productive of great exhilaration.\r\n\r\n    All who have tried surf-riding agree that it is most exhilarating.\r\n\r\nIf those who have studied the art of writing are in accord on any one\r\npoint, it is on this, that the surest method of arousing and holding the\r\nattention of the reader is by being specific, definite, and concrete.\r\nCritics have pointed out how much of the effectiveness of the greatest\r\nwriters, Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, results from their constant\r\ndefiniteness and concreteness. Browning, to cite a more modern author,\r\naffords many striking examples. Take, for instance, the lines from _My\r\nLast Duchess_,\r\n\r\n  Sir, \'twas all one! My favour at her breast,\r\n  The dropping of the daylight in the west,\r\n  The bough of cherries some officious fool\r\n  Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule\r\n  She rode with round the terrace--all and each\r\n  Would draw from her alike the approving speech,\r\n  Or blush, at least,\r\n\r\nand those which end the poem,\r\n\r\n      Notice Neptune, though,\r\n  Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,\r\n  Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me.\r\n\r\nThese words call up pictures. Recall how in _The Bishop Orders his Tomb\r\nin St. Praxed\'s Church_ "the Renaissance spirit--its worldliness,\r\ninconsistency, pride, hypocrisy, ignorance of itself, love of art, of\r\nluxury, of good Latin," to quote Ruskin\'s comment on the poem, is made\r\nmanifest in specific details and in concrete terms.\r\n\r\nProse, in particular narrative and descriptive prose, is made vivid by\r\nthe same means. If the experiences of Jim Hawkins and of David Balfour,\r\nof Kim, of Nostromo, have seemed for the moment real to countless\r\nreaders, if in reading Carlyle we have almost the sense of being\r\nphysically present at the taking of the Bastille, it is because of the\r\ndefiniteness of the details and the concreteness of the terms used. It\r\nis not that every detail is given; that would be impossible, as well as\r\nto no purpose; but that all the significant details are given, and not\r\nvaguely, but with such definiteness that the reader, in imagination, can\r\nproject himself into the scene.\r\n\r\nIn exposition and in argument, the writer must likewise never lose his\r\nhold upon the concrete, and even when he is dealing with general\r\nprinciples, he must give particular instances of their application.\r\n\r\n"This superiority of specific expressions is clearly due to the effort\r\nrequired to translate words into thoughts. As we do not think in\r\ngenerals, but in particulars--as whenever any class of things is\r\nreferred to, we represent it to ourselves by calling to mind individual\r\nmembers of it, it follows that when an abstract word is used, the hearer\r\nor reader has to choose, from his stock of images, one or more by which\r\nhe may figure to himself the genus mentioned. In doing this, some delay\r\nmust arise, some force be expended; and if by employing a specific term\r\nan appropriate image can be at once suggested, an economy is achieved,\r\nand a more vivid impression produced."\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer, from whose _Philosophy of Style_ the preceding\r\nparagraph is quoted, illustrates the principle by the sentences:\r\n\r\n  In proportion as the manners, customs, and amusements of a nation are\r\n  cruel and barbarous, the regulations of their penal code will be\r\n  severe.\r\n\r\n    In proportion as men delight in battles, bull-fights, and combats of\r\n    gladiators, will they punish by hanging, burning, and the rack.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Omit needless words.\r\n\r\nVigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary\r\nwords, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a\r\ndrawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary\r\nparts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short,\r\nor that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but\r\nthat he make every word tell.\r\n\r\nMany expressions in common use violate this principle:\r\n\r\n  the question as to whether\r\n\r\n    whether (the question whether)\r\n\r\n  there is no doubt but that\r\n\r\n    no doubt (doubtless)\r\n\r\n  used for fuel purposes\r\n\r\n    used for fuel\r\n\r\n  he is a man who\r\n\r\n    he\r\n\r\n  in a hasty manner\r\n\r\n    hastily\r\n\r\n  this is a subject which\r\n\r\n    this subject\r\n\r\n  His story is a strange one.\r\n\r\n    His story is strange.\r\n\r\nIn especial the expression _the fact that_ should be revised out of\r\nevery sentence in which it occurs.\r\n\r\n  owing to the fact that\r\n\r\n    since (because)\r\n\r\n  in spite of the fact that\r\n\r\n    though (although)\r\n\r\n  call your attention to the fact that\r\n\r\n    remind you (notify you)\r\n\r\n  I was unaware of the fact that\r\n\r\n    I was unaware that (did not know)\r\n\r\n  the fact that he had not succeeded\r\n\r\n    his failure\r\n\r\n  the fact that I had arrived\r\n\r\n    my arrival\r\n\r\nSee also under _case_, _character_, _nature_, _system_ in Chapter\xc2\xa0V.\r\n\r\n_Who is_, _which was_, and the like are often superfluous.\r\n\r\n  His brother, who is a member of the same firm\r\n\r\n    His brother, a member of the same firm\r\n\r\n  Trafalgar, which was Nelson\'s last battle\r\n\r\n    Trafalgar, Nelson\'s last battle\r\n\r\nAs positive statement is more concise than negative, and the active\r\nvoice more concise than the passive, many of the examples given under\r\nRules 11 and 12 illustrate this rule as well.\r\n\r\nA common violation of conciseness is the presentation of a single\r\ncomplex idea, step by step, in a series of sentences or independent\r\nclauses which might to advantage be combined into one.\r\n\r\n  Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king of\r\n  Scotland. The witches told him that this wish of his would come true.\r\n  The king of Scotland at this time was Duncan. Encouraged by his wife,\r\n  Macbeth murdered Duncan. He was thus enabled to succeed Duncan as\r\n  king. (51 words.)\r\n\r\n    Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized\r\n    the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king\r\n    of Scotland in his place. (26 words.)\r\n\r\n  There were several less important courses, but these were the most\r\n  important, and although they did not come every day, they came often\r\n  enough to keep you in such a state of mind that you never knew what\r\n  your next move would be. (43 words.)\r\n\r\n    These, the most important courses of all, came, if not daily, at\r\n    least often enough to keep one under constant strain. (21 words.)\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Avoid a succession of loose sentences:\r\n\r\nThis rule refers especially to loose sentences of a particular type,\r\nthose consisting of two co-ordinate clauses, the second introduced by a\r\nconjunction or relative. Although single sentences of this type may be\r\nunexceptionable (see under Rule\xc2\xa04), a series soon becomes monotonous and\r\ntedious.\r\n\r\nAn unskilful writer will sometimes construct a whole paragraph of\r\nsentences of this kind, using as connectives _and_, _but_, _so_, and\r\nless frequently, _who_, _which_, _when_, _where_, and _while_, these\r\nlast in non-restrictive senses (see under Rule\xc2\xa03).\r\n\r\n  The third concert of the subscription series was given last evening,\r\n  and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Edward Appleton was the\r\n  soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the instrumental\r\n  music. The former showed himself to be an artist of the first rank,\r\n  while the latter proved itself fully deserving of its high reputation.\r\n  The interest aroused by the series has been very gratifying to the\r\n  Committee, and it is planned to give a similar series annually\r\n  hereafter. The fourth concert will be given on Tuesday, May 10, when\r\n  an equally attractive programme will be presented.\r\n\r\nApart from its triteness and emptiness, the paragraph above is weak\r\nbecause of the structure of its sentences, with their mechanical\r\nsymmetry and sing-song. Contrast with them the sentences in the\r\nparagraphs quoted under Rule\xc2\xa09, or in any piece of good English prose,\r\nas the preface (Before the Curtain) to _Vanity Fair_.\r\n\r\nIf the writer finds that he has written a series of sentences of the\r\ntype described, he should recast enough of them to remove the monotony,\r\nreplacing them by simple sentences, by sentences of two clauses joined\r\nby a semicolon, by periodic sentences of two clauses, by sentences,\r\nloose or periodic, of three clauses--whichever best represent the real\r\nrelations of the thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.\r\n\r\nThis principle, that of parallel construction, requires that expressions\r\nof similar content and function should be outwardly similar. The\r\nlikeness of form enables the reader to recognize more readily the\r\nlikeness of content and function. Familiar instances from the Bible are\r\nthe Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes, and the petitions of the Lord\'s\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\nThe unskillful writer often violates this principle, from a mistaken\r\nbelief that he should constantly vary the form of his expressions. It is\r\ntrue that in repeating a statement in order to emphasize it he may have\r\nneed to vary its form. For illustration, see the paragraph from\r\nStevenson quoted under Rule\xc2\xa09. But apart from this, he should follow the\r\nprinciple of parallel construction.\r\n\r\n  Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the\r\n  laboratory method is employed.\r\n\r\n    Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is\r\n    taught by the laboratory method.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand version gives the impression that the writer is undecided\r\nor timid; he seems unable or afraid to choose one form of expression and\r\nhold to it. The right-hand version shows that the writer has at least\r\nmade his choice and abided by it.\r\n\r\nBy this principle, an article or a preposition applying to all the\r\nmembers of a series must either be used only before the first term or\r\nelse be repeated before each term.\r\n\r\n  The French, the Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese\r\n\r\n    The French, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Portuguese\r\n\r\n  In spring, summer, or in winter\r\n\r\n    In spring, summer, or winter (In spring, in summer, or in winter)\r\n\r\nCorrelative expressions (_both, and_; _not, but_; _not only, but also_;\r\n_either, or_; _first, second, third_; and the like) should be followed\r\nby the same grammatical construction, that is, virtually, by the same\r\npart of speech. (Such combinations as "both Henry and I," "not silk, but\r\na cheap substitute," are obviously within the rule.) Many violations of\r\nthis rule (as the first three below) arise from faulty arrangement;\r\nothers (as the last) from the use of unlike constructions.\r\n\r\n  It was both a long ceremony and very tedious.\r\n\r\n    The ceremony was both long and tedious.\r\n\r\n  A time not for words, but action.\r\n\r\n    A time not for words, but for action.\r\n\r\n  Either you must grant his request or incur his ill will.\r\n\r\n    You must either grant his request or incur his ill will.\r\n\r\n  My objections are, first, the injustice of the measure; second, that\r\n  it is unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n    My objections are, first, that the measure is unjust; second, that\r\n    it is unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nSee also the third example under Rule\xc2\xa012 and the last under Rule\xc2\xa013.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, what if a writer needs to express a very large number\r\nof similar ideas, say twenty? Must he write twenty consecutive sentences\r\nof the same pattern? On closer examination he will probably find that\r\nthe difficulty is imaginary, that his twenty ideas can be classified in\r\ngroups, and that he need apply the principle only within each group.\r\nOtherwise he had best avoid difficulty by putting his statements in the\r\nform of a table.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Keep related words together.\r\n\r\nThe position of the words in a sentence is the principal means of\r\nshowing their relationship. The writer must therefore, so far as\r\npossible, bring together the words, and groups of words, that are\r\nrelated in thought, and keep apart those which are not so related.\r\n\r\nThe subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule,\r\nbe separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n  Wordsworth, in the fifth book of _The Excursion_, gives a\r\n  minute description of this church.\r\n\r\n    In the fifth book of _The Excursion_, Wordsworth gives a\r\n    minute description of this church.\r\n\r\n  Cast iron, when treated in a Bessemer converter, is changed into\r\n  steel.\r\n\r\n    By treatment in a Bessemer converter, cast iron is changed into\r\n    steel.\r\n\r\nThe objection is that the interposed phrase or clause needlessly\r\ninterrupts the natural order of the main clause. Usually, however, this\r\nobjection does not hold when the order is interrupted only by a relative\r\nclause or by an expression in apposition. Nor does it hold in periodic\r\nsentences in which the interruption is a deliberately used means of\r\ncreating suspense (see examples under Rule\xc2\xa018).\r\n\r\nThe relative pronoun should come, as a rule, immediately after its\r\nantecedent.\r\n\r\n  There was a look in his eye that boded mischief.\r\n\r\n    In his eye was a look that boded mischief.\r\n\r\n  He wrote three articles about his adventures in Spain, which were\r\n  published in _Harper\'s Magazine_.\r\n\r\n    He published in _Harper\'s Magazine_ three articles about\r\n    his adventures in Spain.\r\n\r\n  This is a portrait of Benjamin Harrison, grandson of William Henry\r\n  Harrison, who became President in 1889.\r\n\r\n    This is a portrait of Benjamin Harrison, grandson of William Henry\r\n    Harrison.

In summaries, keep to one tense.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the action of a drama, the writer should always use the\r\npresent tense. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, he should\r\npreferably use the present, though he may use the past if he prefers. If\r\nthe summary is in the present tense, antecedent action should be\r\nexpressed by the perfect; if in the past, by the past perfect.\r\n\r\n  An unforeseen chance prevents Friar John from delivering Friar\r\n  Lawrence\'s letter to Romeo. Meanwhile, owing to her father\'s arbitrary\r\n  change of the day set for her wedding, Juliet has been compelled to\r\n  drink the potion on Tuesday night, with the result that Balthasar\r\n  informs Romeo of her supposed death before Friar Lawrence learns of\r\n  the non-delivery of the letter.\r\n\r\nBut whichever tense be used in the summary, a past tense in indirect\r\ndiscourse or in indirect question remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n  The Friar confesses that it was he who married them.\r\n\r\nApart from the exceptions noted, whichever tense the writer chooses, he\r\nshould use throughout. Shifting from one tense to the other gives the\r\nappearance of uncertainty and irresolution (compare Rule\xc2\xa015).\r\n\r\nIn presenting the statements or the thought of some one else, as in\r\nsummarizing an essay or reporting a speech, the writer should avoid\r\nintercalating such expressions as "he said," "he stated," "the speaker\r\nadded," "the speaker then went on to say," "the author also thinks," or\r\nthe like. He should indicate clearly at the outset, once for all, that\r\nwhat follows is summary, and then waste no words in repeating the\r\nnotification.\r\n\r\nIn notebooks, in newspapers, in handbooks of literature, summaries of\r\none kind or another may be indispensable, and for children in primary\r\nschools it is a useful exercise to retell a story in their own words.\r\nBut in the criticism or interpretation of literature the writer should\r\nbe careful to avoid dropping into summary. He may find it necessary to\r\ndevote one or two sentences to indicating the subject, or the opening\r\nsituation, of the work he is discussing; he may cite numerous details to\r\nillustrate its qualities. But he should aim to write an orderly\r\ndiscussion supported by evidence, not a summary with occasional comment.\r\nSimilarly, if the scope of his discussion includes a number of works, he\r\nwill as a rule do better not to take them up singly in chronological\r\norder, but to aim from the beginning at establishing general\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.\r\n\r\nThe proper place in the sentence for the word, or group of words, which\r\nthe writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end.\r\n\r\n  Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it\r\n  has advanced in many other ways.\r\n\r\n    Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it\r\n    has hardly advanced in fortitude.\r\n\r\n  This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its\r\n  hardness.\r\n\r\n    Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making\r\n    razors.\r\n\r\nThe word or group of words entitled to this position of prominence is\r\nusually the logical predicate, that is, the _new_ element in the\r\nsentence, as it is in the second example.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the periodic sentence arises from the prominence\r\nwhich it gives to the main statement.\r\n\r\n  Four centuries ago, Christopher Columbus, one of the Italian mariners\r\n  whom the decline of their own republics had put at the service of the\r\n  world and of adventure, seeking for Spain a westward passage to the\r\n  Indies as a set-off against the achievements of Portuguese\r\n  discoverers, lighted on America.\r\n\r\n  With these hopes and in this belief I would urge you, laying aside all\r\n  hindrance, thrusting away all private aims, to devote yourself\r\n  unswervingly and unflinchingly to the vigorous and successful\r\n  prosecution of this war.\r\n\r\nThe other prominent position in the sentence is the beginning. Any\r\nelement in the sentence, other than the subject, may become emphatic\r\nwhen placed first.\r\n\r\n  Deceit or treachery he could never forgive.\r\n\r\n  So vast and rude, fretted by the action of nearly three thousand\r\n  years, the fragments of this architecture may often seem, at first\r\n  sight, like works of nature.\r\n\r\nA subject coming first in its sentence may be emphatic, but hardly by\r\nits position alone. In the sentence,\r\n\r\n  Great kings worshipped at his shrine,\r\n\r\nthe emphasis upon _kings_ arises largely from its meaning and from the\r\ncontext. To receive special emphasis, the subject of a sentence must\r\ntake the position of the predicate.\r\n\r\n  Through the middle of the valley flowed a winding stream.\r\n\r\nThe principle that the proper place for what is to be made most\r\nprominent is the end applies equally to the words of a sentence, to the\r\nsentences of a paragraph, and to the paragraphs of a composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. A FEW MATTERS OF FORM\r\n\r\n\r\n=Headings.= Leave a blank line, or its equivalent in space, after the\r\ntitle or heading of a manuscript. On succeeding pages, if using ruled\r\npaper, begin on the first line.\r\n\r\n=Numerals.= Do not spell out dates or other serial numbers. Write them\r\nin figures or in Roman notation, as may be appropriate.\r\n\r\n  August 9, 1918 (9 August 1918)\r\n\r\n  Rule 3\r\n\r\n  Chapter XII\r\n\r\n  352nd Infantry\r\n\r\n=Parentheses.= A sentence containing an expression in parenthesis is\r\npunctuated, outside of the marks of parenthesis, exactly as if the\r\nexpression in parenthesis were absent. The expression within is\r\npunctuated as if it stood by itself, except that the final stop is\r\nomitted unless it is a question mark or an exclamation point.\r\n\r\n  I went to his house yesterday (my third attempt to see him), but he\r\n  had left town.\r\n\r\n  He declares (and why should we doubt his good faith?) that he is now\r\n  certain of success.\r\n\r\n(When a wholly detached expression or sentence is parenthesized, the\r\nfinal stop comes before the last mark of parenthesis.)\r\n\r\n=Quotations.= Formal quotations, cited as documentary evidence, are\r\nintroduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks.\r\n\r\n  The provision of the Constitution is: "No tax or duty shall be laid on\r\n  articles exported from any state."\r\n\r\nQuotations grammatically in apposition or the direct objects of verbs\r\nare preceded by a comma and enclosed in quotation marks.\r\n\r\n  I recall the maxim of La Rochefoucauld, "Gratitude is a lively sense\r\n  of benefits to come."\r\n\r\n  Aristotle says, "Art is an imitation of nature."\r\n\r\nQuotations of an entire line, or more, of verse, are begun on a fresh\r\nline and centered, but need not be enclosed in quotation marks.\r\n\r\n  Wordsworth\'s enthusiasm for the Revolution was at first unbounded:\r\n\r\n    Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,\r\n    But to be young was very heaven!\r\n\r\nQuotations introduced by _that_ are regarded as in indirect discourse\r\nand not enclosed in quotation marks.\r\n\r\n  Keats declares that beauty is truth, truth beauty.\r\n\r\nProverbial expressions and familiar phrases of literary origin require\r\nno quotation marks.\r\n\r\n  These are the times that try men\'s souls.\r\n\r\n  He lives far from the madding crowd.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of colloquialisms and slang.\r\n\r\n=References.= In scholarly work requiring exact references, abbreviate\r\ntitles that occur frequently, giving the full forms in an alphabetical\r\nlist at the end. As a general practice, give the references in\r\nparenthesis or in footnotes, not in the body of the sentence. Omit the\r\nwords _act_, _scene_, _line_, _book_, _volume_, _page_, except when\r\nreferring by only one of them. Punctuate as indicated below.\r\n\r\n  In the second scene of the third act\r\n\r\n    In III.ii (still better, simply insert III.ii in\r\n    parenthesis at the proper place in the sentence)\r\n\r\n  After the killing of Polonius, Hamlet is placed under guard (IV.ii.\r\n  14).\r\n\r\n  _2 Samuel_ i:17-27\r\n\r\n  _Othello_ II.iii. 264-267, III.iii. 155-161.\r\n\r\n=Syllabication.= If there is room at the end of a line for one or more\r\nsyllables of a word, but not for the whole word, divide the word, unless\r\nthis involves cutting off only a single letter, or cutting off only two\r\nletters of a long word. No hard and fast rule for all words can be laid\r\ndown. The principles most frequently applicable are:\r\n\r\n(a) Divide the word according to its formation:\r\n\r\n  know-ledge (not knowl-edge); Shake-speare (not Shakes-peare);\r\n  de-scribe (not des-cribe); atmo-sphere (not atmos-phere);\r\n\r\n(b) Divide "on the vowel:"\r\n\r\n  edi-ble (not ed-ible); propo-sition; ordi-nary; espe-cial; reli-gious;\r\n  oppo-nents; regu-lar; classi-fi-ca-tion (three divisions allowable);\r\n  deco-rative; presi-dent;\r\n\r\n(c) Divide between double letters, unless they come at the end of the\r\nsimple form of the word:\r\n\r\n  Apen-nines; Cincin-nati; refer-ring; but tell-ing.\r\n\r\n(d) Do not divide before final _-ed_ if the _e_ is silent:\r\n\r\n  treat-ed (but not roam-ed or nam-ed).\r\n\r\nThe treatment of consonants in combination is best shown from examples:\r\n\r\n  for-tune; pic-ture; sin-gle; presump-tuous; illus-tration;\r\n  sub-stan-tial (either division); indus-try; instruc-tion;\r\n  sug-ges-tion; incen-diary.\r\n\r\nThe student will do well to examine the syllable-division in a number of\r\npages of any carefully printed book.\r\n\r\n=Titles.= For the titles of literary works, scholarly usage prefers\r\nitalics with capitalized initials. The usage of editors and publishers\r\nvaries, some using italics with capitalized initials, others using Roman\r\nwith capitalized initials and with or without quotation marks. Use\r\nitalics (indicated in manuscript by underscoring), except in writing for\r\na periodical that follows a different practice. Omit initial _A_ or\r\n_The_ from titles when you place the possessive before them.\r\n\r\n  The _Iliad_; the _Odyssey_; _As You Like It_; _To a Skylark_; _The\r\n  Newcomes_; _A Tale of Two Cities_; Dickens\'s _Tale of Two Cities_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS COMMONLY MISUSED\r\n\r\n\r\n(Some of the forms here listed, as _like I did_, are downright bad\r\nEnglish; others, as the split infinitive, have their defenders, but are\r\nin such general disfavor that it is at least inadvisable to use them;\r\nstill others, as _case_, _factor_, _feature_, _interesting_, _one of the\r\nmost_, are good in their place, but are constantly obtruding themselves\r\ninto places where they have no right to be. If the writer will make it\r\nhis purpose from the beginning to express accurately his own individual\r\nthought, and will refuse to be satisfied with a ready-made formula that\r\nsaves him the trouble of doing so, this last set of expressions will\r\ncause him little trouble. But if he finds that in a moment of\r\ninadvertence he has used one of them, his proper course will probably be\r\nnot to patch up the sentence by substituting one word or set of words\r\nfor another, but to recast it completely, as illustrated in a number of\r\nexamples below and in others under Rules 12 and 13.)\r\n\r\n=All right.= Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the\r\nsense, "Agreed," or "Go ahead." In other uses better avoided. Always\r\nwritten as two words.\r\n\r\n=As good or better than.= Expressions of this type should be corrected\r\nby rearranging the sentence.\r\n\r\n  My opinion is as good or better than his.\r\n\r\n    My opinion is as good as his, or better (if not better).\r\n\r\n=As to whether.= _Whether_ is sufficient; see under Rule\xc2\xa013.\r\n\r\n=Bid.= Takes the infinitive without _to_. The past tense in the sense,\r\n"ordered," is _bade_.\r\n\r\n=But.= Unnecessary after _doubt_ and _help_.\r\n\r\n  I have no doubt but that\r\n\r\n    I have no doubt that\r\n\r\n  He could not help see but that\r\n\r\n    He could not help seeing that\r\n\r\nThe too frequent use of _but_ as a conjunction leads to the fault\r\ndiscussed under Rule\xc2\xa014. A loose sentence formed with _but_ can always\r\nbe converted into a periodic sentence formed with _although_, as\r\nillustrated under Rule\xc2\xa04.\r\n\r\nParticularly awkward is the following of one _but_ by another, making a\r\ncontrast to a contrast or a reservation to a reservation. This is easily\r\ncorrected by re-arrangement.\r\n\r\n  America had vast resources, but she seemed almost wholly unprepared\r\n  for war. But within a year she had created an army of four million\r\n  men.\r\n\r\n    America seemed almost wholly unprepared for war, but she had vast\r\n    resources. Within a year she had created an army of four million\r\n    men.\r\n\r\n=Can.= Means _am (is, are) able_. Not to be used as a substitute for\r\n_may_.\r\n\r\n=Case.= The _Concise Oxford Dictionary_ begins its definition of this\r\nword: "instance of a thing\'s occurring; usual state of affairs." In\r\nthese two senses, the word is usually unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated.\r\n\r\n    Many of the rooms were poorly ventilated.\r\n\r\n  It has rarely been the case that any mistake has been made.\r\n\r\n    Few mistakes have been made.\r\n\r\nSee Wood, _Suggestions to Authors_, pp.\xc2\xa068-71, and Quiller-Couch, _The\r\nArt of Writing_, pp.\xc2\xa0103-106.\r\n\r\n=Certainly.= Used indiscriminately by some writers, much as others use\r\n_very_, to intensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind,\r\nbad in speech, is even worse in writing.\r\n\r\n=Character.= Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of\r\nwordiness.\r\n\r\n  Acts of a hostile character\r\n\r\n    Hostile acts\r\n\r\n=Claim, vb.= With object-noun, means _lay claim to_. May be used with a\r\ndependent clause if this sense is clearly involved: "He claimed that he\r\nwas the sole surviving heir." (But even here, "claimed to be" would be\r\nbetter.) Not to be used as a substitute for _declare_, _maintain_, or\r\n_charge_.\r\n\r\n=Clever.= This word has been greatly overused; it is best restricted to\r\ningenuity displayed in small matters.\r\n\r\n=Compare.= To _compare to_ is to point out or imply resemblances,\r\nbetween objects regarded as essentially of different order; to _compare\r\nwith_ is mainly to point out differences, between objects regarded as\r\nessentially of the same order. Thus life has been compared to a\r\npilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be compared with the\r\nBritish Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be\r\ncompared with modern London.\r\n\r\n=Consider.= Not followed by _as_ when it means "believe to be." "I\r\nconsider him thoroughly competent." Compare, "The lecturer considered\r\nCromwell first as soldier and second as administrator," where\r\n"considered" means "examined" or "discussed."\r\n\r\n=Data.= A plural, like _phenomena_ and _strata_.\r\n\r\n  These data were tabulated.\r\n\r\n=Dependable.= A needless substitute for _reliable_, _trustworthy_.\r\n\r\n=Different than.= Not permissible. Substitute _different from_, _other\r\nthan_, or _unlike_.\r\n\r\n=Divided into.= Not to be misused for _composed of_. The line is\r\nsometimes difficult to draw; doubtless plays are divided into acts, but\r\npoems are composed of stanzas.\r\n\r\n=Don\'t.= Contraction of _do not_. The contraction of _does not_ is\r\n_doesn\'t_.\r\n\r\n=Due to.= Incorrectly used for _through_, _because of_, or _owing to_,\r\nin adverbial phrases: "He lost the first game, due to carelessness." In\r\ncorrect use related as predicate or as modifier to a particular noun:\r\n"This invention is due to Edison;" "losses due to preventable fires."\r\n\r\n=Folk.= A collective noun, equivalent to _people_. Use the singular form\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n=Effect.= As noun, means _result_; as verb, means _to bring about_,\r\n_accomplish_ (not to be confused with _affect_, which means "to\r\ninfluence").\r\n\r\nAs noun, often loosely used in perfunctory writing about fashions,\r\nmusic, painting, and other arts: "an Oriental effect;" "effects in pale\r\ngreen;" "very delicate effects;" "broad effects;" "subtle effects;" "a\r\ncharming effect was produced by." The writer who has a definite meaning\r\nto express will not take refuge in such vagueness.\r\n\r\n=Etc.= Equivalent to _and the rest_, _and so forth_, and hence not to be\r\nused if one of these would be insufficient, that is, if the reader would\r\nbe left in doubt as to any important particulars. Least open to\r\nobjection when it represents the last terms of a list already given in\r\nfull, or immaterial words at the end of a quotation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a list introduced by _such as_, _for example_, or any\r\nsimilar expression, _etc._ is incorrect.\r\n\r\n=Fact.= Use this word only of matters of a kind capable of direct\r\nverification, not of matters of judgment. That a particular event\r\nhappened on a given date, that lead melts at a certain temperature, are\r\nfacts. But such conclusions as that Napoleon was the greatest of modern\r\ngenerals, or that the climate of California is delightful, however\r\nincontestable they may be, are not properly facts.\r\n\r\nOn the formula _the fact that_, see under Rule\xc2\xa013.\r\n\r\n=Factor.= A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it forms part can\r\nusually be replaced by something more direct and idiomatic.\r\n\r\n  His superior training was the great factor in his winning the match.\r\n\r\n    He won the match by being better trained.\r\n\r\n  Heavy artillery has become an increasingly important factor in\r\n  deciding battles.\r\n\r\n    Heavy artillery has played a constantly larger part in deciding\r\n    battles.\r\n\r\n=Feature.= Another hackneyed word; like _factor_ it usually adds nothing\r\nto the sentence in which it occurs.\r\n\r\n  A feature of the entertainment especially worthy of mention was the\r\n  singing of Miss A.\r\n\r\n    (Better use the same number of words to tell what Miss A. sang, or\r\n    if the programme has already been given, to tell how she sang.)\r\n\r\nAs a verb, in the advertising sense of _offer as a special attraction_,\r\nto be avoided.\r\n\r\n=Fix.= Colloquial in America for _arrange_, _prepare_, _mend_. In\r\nwriting restrict it to its literary senses, _fasten_, _make firm or\r\nimmovable_, etc.\r\n\r\n=Get.= The colloquial _have got_ for _have_ should not be used in\r\nwriting. The preferable form of the participle is _got_.\r\n\r\n=He is a man who.= A common type of redundant expression; see Rule\xc2\xa013.\r\n\r\n  He is a man who is very ambitious.\r\n\r\n    He is very ambitious.\r\n\r\n  Spain is a country which I have always wanted to visit.\r\n\r\n    I have always wanted to visit Spain.\r\n\r\n=Help.= See under =But=.\r\n\r\n=However.= In the meaning _nevertheless_, not to come first in its\r\nsentence or clause.\r\n\r\n  The roads were almost impassable. However, we at last succeeded in\r\n  reaching camp.\r\n\r\n    The roads were almost impassable. At last, however, we succeeded in\r\n    reaching camp.\r\n\r\nWhen _however_ comes first, it means _in whatever way_ or _to whatever\r\nextent_.\r\n\r\n  However you advise him, he will probably do as he thinks best.\r\n\r\n  However discouraging the prospect, he never lost heart.\r\n\r\n=Interesting.= Avoid this word as a perfunctory means of introduction.\r\nInstead of announcing that what you are about to tell is interesting,\r\nmake it so.\r\n\r\n  An interesting story is told of\r\n\r\n    (Tell the story without preamble.)\r\n\r\n  In connection with the anticipated visit of Mr. B. to America, it is\r\n  interesting to recall that he\r\n\r\n    Mr. B., who it is expected will soon visit America\r\n\r\n=Kind of.= Not to be used as a substitute for _rather_ (before\r\nadjectives and verbs), or except in familiar style, for _something like_\r\n(before nouns). Restrict it to its literal sense: "Amber is a kind of\r\nfossil resin;" "I dislike that kind of notoriety." The same holds true\r\nof _sort of_.\r\n\r\n=Less.= Should not be misused for _fewer_.\r\n\r\n  He had less men than in the previous campaign\r\n\r\n    He had fewer men than in the previous campaign\r\n\r\n_Less_ refers to quantity, _fewer_ to number. "His troubles are less\r\nthan mine" means "His troubles are not so great as mine." "His troubles\r\nare fewer than mine" means "His troubles are not so numerous as mine."\r\nIt is, however, correct to say, "The signers of the petition were less\r\nthan a hundred," where the round number _a hundred_ is something like a\r\ncollective noun, and _less_ is thought of as meaning a less quantity or\r\namount.\r\n\r\n=Like.= Not to be misused for _as_. _Like_ governs nouns and pronouns;\r\nbefore phrases and clauses the equivalent word is _as_.\r\n\r\n  We spent the evening like in the old days.\r\n\r\n    We spent the evening as in the old days.\r\n\r\n  He thought like I did.\r\n\r\n    He thought as I did (like me).\r\n\r\n=Line, along these lines.= _Line_ in the sense of _course of procedure_,\r\n_conduct_, _thought_, is allowable, but has been so much overworked,\r\nparticularly in the phrase _along these lines_, that a writer who aims\r\nat freshness or originality had better discard it entirely.\r\n\r\n  Mr. B. also spoke along the same lines.\r\n\r\n    Mr. B. also spoke, to the same effect.\r\n\r\n  He is studying along the line of French literature.\r\n\r\n    He is studying French literature.\r\n\r\n=Literal, literally.= Often incorrectly used in support of exaggeration\r\nor violent metaphor.\r\n\r\n  A literal flood of abuse.\r\n\r\n    A flood of abuse.\r\n\r\n  Literally dead with fatigue\r\n\r\n    Almost dead with fatigue (dead tired)\r\n\r\n=Lose out.= Meant to be more emphatic than _lose_, but actually less so,\r\nbecause of its commonness. The same holds true of _try out_, _win out_,\r\n_sign up_, _register up_. With a number of verbs, _out_ and _up_ form\r\nidiomatic combinations: _find out_, _run out_, _turn out_, _cheer up_,\r\n_dry up_, _make up_, and others, each distinguishable in meaning from\r\nthe simple verb. _Lose out_ is not.\r\n\r\n=Most.= Not to be used for _almost_.\r\n\r\n  Most everybody\r\n\r\n    Almost everybody\r\n\r\n  Most all the time\r\n\r\n    Almost all the time\r\n\r\n=Nature.= Often simply redundant, used like _character_.\r\n\r\n  Acts of a hostile nature\r\n\r\n    Hostile acts\r\n\r\nOften vaguely used in such expressions as a "lover of nature;" "poems\r\nabout nature." Unless more specific statements follow, the reader cannot\r\ntell whether the poems have to do with natural scenery, rural life, the\r\nsunset, the untracked wilderness, or the habits of squirrels.\r\n\r\n=Near by.= Adverbial phrase, not yet fully accepted as good English,\r\nthough the analogy of _close by_ and _hard by_ seems to justify it.\r\n_Near_, or _near at hand_, is as good, if not better.\r\n\r\nNot to be used as an adjective; use _neighboring_.\r\n\r\n=Oftentimes, ofttimes.= Archaic forms, no longer in good use. The modern\r\nword is _often_.\r\n\r\n=One hundred and one.= Retain the _and_ in this and similar expressions,\r\nin accordance with the unvarying usage of English prose from Old English\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n=One of the most.= Avoid beginning essays or paragraphs with this\r\nformula, as, "One of the most interesting developments of modern science\r\nis, etc.;" "Switzerland is one of the most interesting countries of\r\nEurope." There is nothing wrong in this; it is simply threadbare and\r\nforcible-feeble.\r\n\r\nA common blunder is to use a singular verb in a relative clause\r\nfollowing this or a similar expression, when the relative is the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n  One of the ablest men that has attacked this problem.\r\n\r\n    One of the ablest men that have attacked this problem.\r\n\r\n=Participle for verbal noun.=\r\n\r\n  Do you mind me asking a question?\r\n\r\n    Do you mind my asking a question?\r\n\r\n  There was little prospect of the Senate accepting even this\r\n  compromise.\r\n\r\n    There was little prospect of the Senate\'s accepting even this\r\n    compromise.\r\n\r\nIn the left-hand column, _asking_ and _accepting_ are present\r\nparticiples; in the right-hand column, they are verbal nouns (gerunds).\r\nThe construction shown in the left-hand column is occasionally found,\r\nand has its defenders. Yet it is easy to see that the second sentence\r\nhas to do not with a prospect of the Senate, but with a prospect of\r\naccepting. In this example, at least, the construction is plainly\r\nillogical.\r\n\r\nAs the authors of _The King\'s English_ point out, there are sentences\r\napparently, but not really, of this type, in which the possessive is not\r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\n  I cannot imagine Lincoln refusing his assent to this measure.\r\n\r\nIn this sentence, what the writer cannot imagine is Lincoln himself, in\r\nthe act of refusing his assent. Yet the meaning would be virtually the\r\nsame, except for a slight loss of vividness, if he had written,\r\n\r\n  I cannot imagine Lincoln\'s refusing his assent to this measure.\r\n\r\nBy using the possessive, the writer will always be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nIn the examples above, the subject of the action is a single, unmodified\r\nterm, immediately preceding the verbal noun, and the construction is as\r\ngood as any that could be used. But in any sentence in which it is a\r\nmere clumsy substitute for something simpler, or in which the use of the\r\npossessive is awkward or impossible, should of course be recast.\r\n\r\n  In the event of a reconsideration of the whole matter\'s becoming\r\n  necessary\r\n\r\n    If it should become necessary to reconsider the whole matter\r\n\r\n  There was great dissatisfaction with the decision of the arbitrators\r\n  being favorable to the company.\r\n\r\n    There was great dissatisfaction that the arbitrators should have\r\n    decided in favor of the company.\r\n\r\n=People.= _The people_ is a political term, not to be confused with _the\r\npublic_. From the people comes political support or opposition; from the\r\npublic comes artistic appreciation or commercial patronage.\r\n\r\n=Phase.= Means a stage of transition or development: "the phases of the\r\nmoon;" "the last phase." Not to be used for _aspect_ or _topic_.\r\n\r\n  Another phase of the subject\r\n\r\n    Another point (another question)\r\n\r\n=Possess.= Not to be used as a mere substitute for _have_ or _own_.\r\n\r\n  He possessed great courage.\r\n\r\n    He had great courage (was very brave).\r\n\r\n  He was the fortunate possessor of\r\n\r\n    He owned\r\n\r\n=Prove.= The past participle is _proved_.\r\n\r\n=Respective, respectively.= These words may usually be omitted with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n  Works of fiction are listed under the names of their respective\r\n  authors.\r\n\r\n    Works of fiction are listed under the names of their authors.\r\n\r\n  The one mile and two mile runs were won by Jones and Cummings\r\n  respectively.\r\n\r\n    The one mile and two mile runs were won by Jones and by Cummings.\r\n\r\nIn some kinds of formal writing, as geometrical proofs, it may be\r\nnecessary to use _respectively_, but it should not appear in writing on\r\nordinary subjects.\r\n\r\n=Shall, Will.= The future tense requires _shall_ for the first person,\r\n_will_ for the second and third. The formula to express the speaker\'s\r\nbelief regarding his future action or state is _I shall_; _I will_\r\nexpresses his determination or his consent.\r\n\r\n=Should.= See under =Would=.\r\n\r\n=So.= Avoid, in writing, the use of _so_ as an intensifier: "so good;"\r\n"so warm;" "so delightful."\r\n\r\nOn the use of _so_ to introduce clauses, see Rule\xc2\xa04.\r\n\r\n=Sort of.= See under =Kind of=.\r\n\r\n=Split Infinitive.= There is precedent from the fourteenth century\r\ndownward for interposing an adverb between _to_ and the infinitive which\r\nit governs, but the construction is in disfavor and is avoided by nearly\r\nall careful writers.\r\n\r\n  To diligently inquire\r\n\r\n    To inquire diligently\r\n\r\n=State.= Not to be used as a mere substitute for _say_, _remark_.\r\nRestrict it to the sense of _express fully or clearly_, as, "He refused\r\nto state his objections."\r\n\r\n=Student Body.= A needless and awkward expression meaning no more than\r\nthe simple word _students_.\r\n\r\n  A member of the student body\r\n\r\n    A student\r\n\r\n  Popular with the student body\r\n\r\n    Liked by the students\r\n\r\n  The student body passed resolutions.\r\n\r\n    The students passed resolutions.\r\n\r\n=System.= Frequently used without need.\r\n\r\n  Dayton has adopted the commission system of government.\r\n\r\n    Dayton has adopted government by commission.\r\n\r\n  The dormitory system\r\n\r\n    Dormitories\r\n\r\n=Thanking You in Advance.= This sounds as if the writer meant, "It will\r\nnot be worth my while to write to you again." In making your request,\r\nwrite, "Will you please," or "I shall be obliged," and if anything\r\nfurther seems necessary write a letter of acknowledgment later.\r\n\r\n=They.= A common inaccuracy is the use of the plural pronoun when the\r\nantecedent is a distributive expression such as _each_, _each one_,\r\n_everybody_, _every one_, _many a man_, which, though implying more than\r\none person, requires the pronoun to be in the singular. Similar to this,\r\nbut with even less justification, is the use of the plural pronoun with\r\nthe antecedent _anybody_, _any one_, _somebody_, _some one_, the\r\nintention being either to avoid the awkward "he or she," or to avoid\r\ncommitting oneself to either. Some bashful speakers even say, "A friend\r\nof mine told me that they, etc."\r\n\r\nUse _he_ with all the above words, unless the antecedent is or must be\r\nfeminine.\r\n\r\n=Very.= Use this word sparingly. Where emphasis is necessary, use words\r\nstrong in themselves.\r\n\r\n=Viewpoint.= Write _point of view_, but do not misuse this, as many do,\r\nfor _view_ or _opinion_.\r\n\r\n=While.= Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word for _and_, _but_, and\r\n_although_. Many writers use it frequently as a substitute for _and_ or\r\n_but_, either from a mere desire to vary the connective, or from\r\nuncertainty which of the two connectives is the more appropriate. In\r\nthis use it is best replaced by a semicolon.\r\n\r\n  The office and salesrooms are on the ground floor, while the rest of\r\n  the building is devoted to manufacturing.\r\n\r\n    The office and salesrooms are on the ground floor; the rest of the\r\n    building is devoted to manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIts use as a virtual equivalent of _although_ is allowable in sentences\r\nwhere this leads to no ambiguity or absurdity.\r\n\r\n  While I admire his energy, I wish it were employed in a better cause.\r\n\r\nThis is entirely correct, as shown by the paraphrase,\r\n\r\n  I admire his energy; at the same time I wish it were employed in a\r\n  better cause.\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n  While the temperature reaches 90 or 95 degrees in the daytime, the\r\n  nights are often chilly.\r\n\r\n    Although the temperature reaches 90 or 95 degrees in the daytime,\r\n    the nights are often chilly.\r\n\r\nThe paraphrase,\r\n\r\n  The temperature reaches 90 or 95 degrees in the daytime; at the same\r\n  time the nights are often chilly,\r\n\r\nshows why the use of _while_ is incorrect.\r\n\r\nIn general, the writer will do well to use _while_ only with strict\r\nliteralness, in the sense of _during the time that_.\r\n\r\n=Whom.= Often incorrectly used for _who_ before _he said_ or similar\r\nexpressions, when it is really the subject of a following verb.\r\n\r\n  His brother, whom he said would send him the money\r\n\r\n    His brother, who he said would send him the money\r\n\r\n  The man whom he thought was his friend\r\n\r\n    The man who (that) he thought was his friend (whom he thought his\r\n    friend)\r\n\r\n=Worth while.= Overworked as a term of vague approval and (with _not_)\r\nof disapproval. Strictly applicable only to actions: "Is it worth while\r\nto telegraph?"\r\n\r\n  His books are not worth while.\r\n\r\n    His books are not worth reading (are not worth one\'s while to read;\r\n    do not repay reading; are worthless).\r\n\r\nThe use of _worth while_ before a noun ("a worth while story") is\r\nindefensible.\r\n\r\n=Would.= A conditional statement in the first person requires _should_,\r\nnot _would_.\r\n\r\n  I should not have succeeded without his help.\r\n\r\nThe equivalent of _shall_ in indirect quotation after a verb in the past\r\ntense is _should_, not _would_.\r\n\r\n  He predicted that before long we should have a great surprise.\r\n\r\nTo express habitual or repeated action, the past tense, without _would_,\r\nis usually sufficient, and from its brevity, more emphatic.\r\n\r\n  Once a year he would visit the old mansion.\r\n\r\n    Once a year he visited the old mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. SPELLING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spelling of English words is not fixed and invariable, nor does it\r\ndepend on any other authority than general agreement. At the present day\r\nthere is practically unanimous agreement as to the spelling of most\r\nwords. In the list below, for example, _rime_ for _rhyme_ is the only\r\nallowable variation; all the other forms are co-extensive with the\r\nEnglish language. At any given moment, however, a relatively small\r\nnumber of words may be spelled in more than one way. Gradually, as a\r\nrule, one of these forms comes to be generally preferred, and the less\r\ncustomary form comes to look obsolete and is discarded. From time to\r\ntime new forms, mostly simplifications, are introduced by innovators,\r\nand either win their place or die of neglect.\r\n\r\nThe practical objection to unaccepted and over-simplified spellings is\r\nthe disfavor with which they are received by the reader. They distract\r\nhis attention and exhaust his patience. He reads the form _though_\r\nautomatically, without thought of its needless complexity; he reads the\r\nabbreviation _tho_ and mentally supplies the missing letters, at the\r\ncost of a fraction of his attention. The writer has defeated his own\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORDS OFTEN MISSPELLED\r\n\r\n  accidentally\r\n  advice\r\n  affect\r\n  believe\r\n  benefit\r\n  challenge\r\n  coarse\r\n  course\r\n  criticize\r\n  deceive\r\n  definite\r\n  describe\r\n  despise\r\n  develop\r\n  disappoint\r\n  dissipate\r\n  duel\r\n  ecstasy\r\n  effect\r\n  embarrass\r\n  existence\r\n  fascinate\r\n  fiery\r\n  formerly\r\n  humorous\r\n  hypocrisy\r\n  immediately\r\n  impostor\r\n  incident\r\n  incidentally\r\n  latter\r\n  led\r\n  lose\r\n  marriage\r\n  mischief\r\n  murmur\r\n  necessary\r\n  occurred\r\n  opportunity\r\n  parallel\r\n  Philip\r\n  playwright\r\n  preceding\r\n  prejudice\r\n  principal\r\n  principle\r\n  privilege\r\n  pursue\r\n  repetition\r\n  rhyme\r\n  rhythm\r\n  ridiculous\r\n  sacrilegious\r\n  seize\r\n  separate\r\n  shepherd\r\n  siege\r\n  similar\r\n  simile\r\n  too\r\n  tragedy\r\n  tries\r\n  undoubtedly\r\n  until\r\n  villain\r\n\r\nNote that a single consonant (other than _v_) preceded by a stressed\r\nshort vowel is doubled before _-ed_ and _-ing_: _planned_, _letting_,\r\n_beginning_.

EXERCISES ON CHAPTERS II AND III\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Punctuate:\r\n\r\n  1. In 1788 the King\'s advisers warned him that the nation was facing\r\n  bankruptcy therefore he summoned a body called the States-General\r\n  believing that it would authorize him to levy new taxes. The people of\r\n  France however were suffering from burdensome taxation oppressive\r\n  social injustice and acute scarcity of food and their representatives\r\n  refused to consider projects of taxation until social and economic\r\n  reforms should be granted. The King who did not realize the gravity of\r\n  the situation tried to overawe them collecting soldiers in and about\r\n  Versailles where the sessions were being held. The people of Paris\r\n  seeing the danger organized militia companies to defend their\r\n  representatives. In order to supply themselves with arms they attacked\r\n  the Invalides and the Bastille which contained the principal supplies\r\n  of arms and munitions in Paris.\r\n\r\n  2. On his first continental tour begun in 1809 Byron visited Portugal\r\n  Spain Albania Greece and Turkey. Of this tour he composed a poetical\r\n  journal Childe Harold\'s Pilgrimage in which he ascribed his\r\n  experiences and reflections not to himself but to a fictitious\r\n  character Childe Harold described as a melancholy young nobleman\r\n  prematurely familiar with evil sated with pleasures and embittered\r\n  against humanity. The substantial merits of the work however lay not\r\n  in this shadowy and somewhat theatrical figure but in Byron\'s spirited\r\n  descriptions of wild or picturesque scenes and in his eloquent\r\n  championing of Spain and Greece against their oppressors. On his\r\n  return to England in 1811 he was persuaded rather against his own\r\n  judgment into allowing the work to be published. Its success was\r\n  almost unprecedented in his own words he awoke and found himself\r\n  famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Explain the difference in meaning:\r\n\r\n  3. \'God save thee, ancyent Marinere!\r\n     \'From the fiends that plague thee thus--\r\n\r\n  _Lyrical Ballads_, 1798.\r\n\r\n     \'God save thee, ancient Mariner!\r\n     From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--\r\n\r\n  _Lyrical Ballads_, 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Explain and correct the errors in punctuation:\r\n\r\n  4. This course is intended for Freshmen, who in the opinion of the\r\n  Department are not qualified for military drill.\r\n\r\n  5. A restaurant, not a cafeteria where good meals are served at\r\n  popular prices.--_Advt._\r\n\r\n  6. The poets of _The Nation_, for all their intensity of patriotic\r\n  feeling, followed the English rather than the Celtic tradition, their\r\n  work has a political rather than a literary value and bears little\r\n  upon the development of modern Irish verse.\r\n\r\n  7. We were in one of the strangest places imaginable. A long and\r\n  narrow passage overhung on either side by a stupendous barrier of\r\n  black and threatening rocks.\r\n\r\n  8. Only a few years ago after a snow storm in the passes not far north\r\n  of Jerusalem no less than twenty-six Russian pilgrims perished amidst\r\n  the snow. One cannot help thinking largely because they made little\r\n  attempt to save themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Point out and correct the faults in the following sentences:\r\n\r\n  9. During childhood his mother had died.\r\n\r\n  10. Any language study is good mind training while acquiring\r\n  vocabulary.\r\n\r\n  11. My farm consisted of about twenty acres of excellent land, having\r\n  given a hundred pounds for my predecessor\'s lease.\r\n\r\n  12. Prepared to encounter a woman of disordered mind, the appearance\r\n  presented by Mrs. Taylor at his entrance greatly astonished him.\r\n\r\n  13. Pale and swooning, with two broken legs, they carried him into the\r\n  house.\r\n\r\n  14. Count Cassini, the Russian plenipotentiary, had several long and\r\n  intimate conversations during the tedious weeks of the conference with\r\n  his British colleague, Sir Arthur Nicholson.\r\n\r\n  15. But though they had been victorious in the land engagements, they\r\n  were so little decisive as to lead to no important results.\r\n\r\n  16. Knowing nothing of the rules of the college or of its customs, it\r\n  was with the greatest difficulty that the Dean could make me\r\n  comprehend wherein my wrong-doing lay.\r\n\r\n  17. Fire, therefore, was the first object of my search. Happily, some\r\n  embers were found upon the hearth, together with potato-stalks and dry\r\n  chips. Of these, with much difficulty, I kindled a fire, by which some\r\n  warmth was imparted to our shivering limbs.\r\n\r\n  18. In this connection a great deal of historic fact is introduced\r\n  into the novel about the past history of the cathedral and of Spain.\r\n\r\n  19. Over the whole scene hung the haze of twilight that is so\r\n  peaceful.\r\n\r\n  20. Compared with Italy, living is more expensive.\r\n\r\n  21.

Not only had the writer entr\xc3\xa9e to the titled families of Italy in\r\n  whose villas she was hospitably entertained, but by royalty also.\r\n\r\n  23. It is not a strange sight to catch a glimpse of deer along the\r\n  shore.\r\n\r\n  24. Earnings from other sources are of such a favorable character as\r\n  to enable a splendid showing to be made by the company.\r\n\r\n  25. But while earnings have mounted amazingly, the status of affairs\r\n  is such as to make it impossible to predict the course events may\r\n  take, with any degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [ Transcriber\'s Note:\r\n\r\n    The following is a list of corrections made to the original.\r\n    The first line is the original line, the second the corrected one.\r\n\r\n  University have greatly helped him in the preparation of his manuscript\r\n  University have greatly helped him in the preparation of his manuscript.\r\n\r\n  Compare the sentence.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
