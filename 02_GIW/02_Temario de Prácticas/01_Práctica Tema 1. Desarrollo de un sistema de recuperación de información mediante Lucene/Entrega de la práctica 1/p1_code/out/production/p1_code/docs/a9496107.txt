Abstract    :
              A challenge facing theoretical computer scientists today is not                
              so much to obtain more trendy results of limited long term                     
              significance, but rather, to try to formulate a more coherent                  
              framework and methodology.  To meet this challenge more traditional            
              branches of mathematics, in addition to combinatorics, will play a             
              more significant role.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate circuit complexity, cooperative games            
              and interactive proof systems and develop new proof techniques and             
              methodologies in hopes to obtain a more coherent framework for                 
              complexity theory and contribute to our understanding of the nature of         
              computation.
