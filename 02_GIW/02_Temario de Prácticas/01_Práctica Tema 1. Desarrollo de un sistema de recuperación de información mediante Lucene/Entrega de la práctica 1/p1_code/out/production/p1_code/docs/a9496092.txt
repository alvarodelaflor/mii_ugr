Abstract    :
              The in situ generation of lubricating carbonaceous films on rubbing            
              surfaces at elevated temperatures will be evaluated.  In the first             
              part of the study it was proven feasible to catalyze formation of              
              such films from combustion gases and other carbonaceous gases on               
              surfaces containing nickel and on the surfaces of certain common               
              ceramics when they are subjected to tribological interactions.                 
              This part of the study aims at determining the nature of the                   
              carbonaceous films, their formation parameters and their                       
              tribological properties.
