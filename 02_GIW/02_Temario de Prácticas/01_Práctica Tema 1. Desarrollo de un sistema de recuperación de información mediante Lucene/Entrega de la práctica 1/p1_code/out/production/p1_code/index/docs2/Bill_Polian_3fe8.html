<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Polian_3fe8.html" title="Edit section: Buffalo Bills">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Buffalo Bills</span></h2>
<p>Polian was General Manager in Buffalo from <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>-<a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>. "When Bill Polian was promoted to general manager of the Buffalo Bills on Dec. 30, 1985, the Bills were suffering from back to back 2-14 seasons and fan interest was at an all-time low. Polian had been with the Bills since August 2, 1984. He was originally hired as director of pro personnel, where he impressed Bills Owner Ralph Wilson by telling then-coach Kay Stephenson "We were 2-14 on merit--we have the worst personnel in the NFL". On February 7, 1985, Bills general manager Terry Bledsoe suffered a heart attack and Polian was named along with, director of scouting, Norm Pollom, to handle contract negotiations in Bledsoe's absence. Polian was instrumental in the signing of Bruce Smith to his first NFL contract. This impressed the Bills' hierarchy enough to warrant a promotion to GM, after the firing of Bledsoe, in 1985. The fans were not impressed with the promotion of Polian however. Most observers considered the move business as usual, on a 2-14 team.</p>
<p>Polian stated in his first press conference, "I know the NFL well, I know it's players, I think I'm prepared for the job." His statement proved to be true. Polian proceeded to build an NFL powerhouse. In 1986, Polian got USFL star Jim Kelly to finally come to Buffalo. He next hired Marv Levy to replace Hank Bullough as head coach. In the 1987 draft, Polian's skill as a GM was apparent as he "traded down" from the #3 slot in the first round to the #8 slot (linebacker Shane Conlon) and also acquiring the #36 slot, which was traded up with Tampa to select cornerback Nate Odomes. On October 31, 1987, Polian orchestrated one of the biggest trades in Bills history by acquiring linebacker Cornelius Bennett. In 1988, without the luxury of a first round pick, Polian drafted running back Thurman Thomas in the second round. Polian had expertly put the pieces together that would make the Bills a "championship caliber team," appearing in an NFL record, 4 straight Super Bowls. Because of his accomplishments, Bill Polian won the NFL Executive of the Year Award twice, in 1988 and in 1991.</p>
<p>On February 4, 1993, after the Bills had appeared in their 3rd straight Super Bowl, Bill Polian was fired as general manager. Polian wasn't fired because he wasn't doing a good job, he was fired because he didn't get along with treasurer, Jeff Littmann, for reasons unknown to all except those close to owner Ralph Wilson, Littmann and Polian himself.</p>
<p>In his closing press conference, Bill Polian said of the team that he built, "They're a very special group of men. Cherish them, you will not see their like again."</p>

<p>Polian was General Manger of the Panthers from <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>-<a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>. He tried to create the quickest Super Bowl winner in history, and nearly did so, building a team that went to the NFC Championship game in only its second year of existence. This feat led him to a promotion, becoming not just the GM, but the President of the Indianapolis Colts.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, the Colts played their last game of the season, losing to the Vikings and finishing the season 3-13. The very next day, Polian was hired as President to try and turn the team around. Polian opted not to keep QB <a href="../../../../articles/j/i/m/Jim_Harbaugh_e2b7.html" title="Jim Harbaugh">Jim Harbaugh</a>, who had led the team to the <a href="../../../../articles/a/f/c/AFC_Championship_game_3934.html" class="mw-redirect" title="AFC Championship game">AFC Championship game</a> following the 1995 season. Instead, he decided to build through the draft as the Colts would have the number 1 overall pick for 1998, and 2 of the most hyped <a href="../../../../articles/q/u/a/Quarterbacks.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Quarterbacks">quarterbacks</a> would be coming out of college. As the '98 draft approached, much hype surrounded the first and second picks, as most people assumed they were going to be <a href="../../../../articles/r/y/a/Ryan_Leaf_5392.html" title="Ryan Leaf">Ryan Leaf</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/p/e/y/Peyton_Manning_d218.html" title="Peyton Manning">Peyton Manning</a>.

<p><br />
Also in 1998, Polian hired his son Chris as Director of Pro Personnel; he has since been promoted to Vice-President of Football Operations.</p>

<p>Even though the Colts finished 3-13 under Polian's first year as president, there were obvious signs of improvement. It was clear that towards the end of the season, Manning and his corps of receivers were starting to get a very good rhythm and the offense was starting to shine. Even with these signs of improvement, Polian opted not to keep RB <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Marshall_Faulk_6869.html" title="Marshall Faulk">Marshall Faulk</a>, again deciding to build through the draft. The Colts would have the 4th overall pick in the draft, and again much hype would surround the draft as <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Ricky_Williams_0bd7.html" title="Ricky Williams">Ricky Williams</a> was coming out. The <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> re-entered the <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" class="mw-redirect" title="NFL">NFL</a> in 1999 and would have the first pick, but with a short roster, they would opt for QB <a href="../../../../articles/t/i/m/Tim_Couch_0e7e.html" title="Tim Couch">Tim Couch</a>. The <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> then selected QB <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/n/Donovan_McNabb_bdd1.html" title="Donovan McNabb">Donovan McNabb</a>, and the <a href="../../../../articles/c/i/n/Cincinnati_Bengals_5178.html" title="Cincinnati Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> then took QB <a href="../../../../articles/a/k/i/Akili_Smith_d331.html" title="Akili Smith">Akili Smith</a>. Many Colt fans watching the draft live no doubt anticipated the selection next of the still-available <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Ricky_Williams_0bd7.html" title="Ricky Williams">Ricky Williams</a>. But Polian shocked almost everyone by drafting <a href="../../../../articles/e/d/g/Edgerrin_James_bbd1.html" title="Edgerrin James">Edgerrin James</a> instead. The <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Orleans_Saints_b2f5.html" title="New Orleans Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> then traded away all of their draft picks for the entire year to move up high enough to take Williams with the next pick. Williams went on to struggle to live up to expectations, later leaving the <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" class="mw-redirect" title="NFL">NFL</a> altogether. James would win the rushing title in both his rookie and second seasons by nearly 100 yards and 200 yards resepectively, vindicating Polian's choice. Following the 2005 season, Edgerrin became a free agent and the Colts chose not to sign him to a deal or place the franchise tag on him. This left many Colt fans scratching their heads. However, in the 2006 NFL Draft, Polian drafted presumably the next great Colt runner with the 30th pick in LSU's <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/s/Joseph_Addai_14e7.html" title="Joseph Addai">Joseph Addai</a>. While many talented runners were taken ahead of Addai in <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/g/Reggie_Bush_802f.html" title="Reggie Bush">Reggie Bush</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/u/Laurence_Maroney_cac0.html" title="Laurence Maroney">Laurence Maroney</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/a/DeAngelo_Williams_1f35.html" title="DeAngelo Williams">DeAngelo Williams</a>, Joseph Addai led all rookie runners with 1,081 rushing yards and did so without making a regular season start, playing behind <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/m/Dominic_Rhodes_6d94.html" title="Dominic Rhodes">Dominic Rhodes</a>. Many teammates including <a href="../../../../articles/p/e/y/Peyton_Manning_d218.html" title="Peyton Manning">Peyton Manning</a> have stated that it's not so much Addai's talent but his desire to learn. His running was instrumental in the Colts winning their first Super Bowl with Indianapolis.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Polian_3fe8.html" title="Edit section: The turnaround">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The turnaround</span></h4>
<p>During Polian's second year as president, the Colts finished 13-3 winning the <a href="../../../../articles/a/f/c/AFC_East_141b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="AFC East">AFC East</a> title. As of 2006, this finish is the biggest turnaround in NFL history, as the Colts were 3-13 the prior season. The Colts would go on to a 10-6 record in 2000 qualifying the playoffs as a wild card. It was obvious the team was moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><a name="Drafting" id="Drafting"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Polian_3fe8.html" title="Edit section: Drafting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drafting</span></h4>
<p>Following the 2000 season, it became clear that the Colts needed to focus on defense as their offense was very productive. Polian opted instead to draft WR <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/g/Reggie_Wayne_35a2.html" title="Reggie Wayne">Reggie Wayne</a> with their first pick in the '01 draft. Although this choice was infurating to some Colt fans at the time(most people felt the team needed more defense), Wayne has gone on to be one of the premier receivers in the league, complementing <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Marvin_Harrison_f0ed.html" title="Marvin Harrison">Marvin Harrison</a> in an already potent offense. Polian also bolstered the offense with fourth-round pick <a href="../../../../articles/r/y/a/Ryan_Diem_f63f.html" title="Ryan Diem">Ryan Diem</a>.</p>
<p>Before the '02 draft, Polian would fire head coach <a href="../../../../articles/j/i/m/Jim_Mora_f1e7.html" title="Jim Mora">Jim Mora</a> in favor of <a href="../../../../articles/t/o/n/Tony_Dungy_10b5.html" title="Tony Dungy">Tony Dungy</a>. As the '02 draft approached it was clear the Colts desperately needed defense. Polian would draft <a href="../../../../articles/d/w/i/Dwight_Freeney_c91a.html" title="Dwight Freeney">Dwight Freeney</a> in the 1st round amid much criticism that Freeney was too short to play defensive end and was a reach for the 11th overall pick. Freeney would go on to be selected to 3 consecutive <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Pro_bowl.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Pro bowl">Pro Bowls</a> following the '03,'04, and '05 seasons.</p>
<p>The '03 draft produced 2 late round picks who would become impact players within the Colts defense. Fifth-round pick <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/b/Robert_Mathis_d835.html" title="Robert Mathis">Robert Mathis</a> has become one of the best pass rushing defensive ends in the AFC, and sixth-round pick <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/t/Cato_June_d62c.html" title="Cato June">Cato June</a> (who played safety in college) would become a <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> linebacker.</p>
<p>In the '04 draft, Polian selected strong safety <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/b/Bob_Sanders_7098.html" title="Bob Sanders">Bob Sanders</a>. Sanders probably would have been a higher pick in the draft, but he had suffered a foot injury which would require surgery and most other teams did not want that liability. However, Polian rolled the dice on how good Sanders would be once his foot healed. Sanders would only play in 5 games his rookie season, but his second (and first full) season would prove why Polian drafted him as Sanders would go on to the <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a>, and, in his fourth season, become the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year.</p>
<p><a name="Free_Agency" id="Free_Agency"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Polian_3fe8.html" title="Edit section: Free Agency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Free Agency</span></h4>
<p>Despite his penchant for quality drafts, the key to the Colts success may come from Polian's ability to sign free agents, specifically undrafted rookie free agents who would become key contributors. Under Polian's watch, the Colts have signed undrafted or waived rookies such as <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/f/Jeff_Saturday_feee.html" title="Jeff Saturday">Jeff Saturday</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/m/Dominic_Rhodes_6d94.html" title="Dominic Rhodes">Dominic Rhodes</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/r/Terrence_Wilkins_a618.html" title="Terrence Wilkins">Terrence Wilkins</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/r/a/h/Raheem_Brock_5aa8.html" title="Raheem Brock">Raheem Brock</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/m/James_Mungro_5374.html" title="James Mungro">James Mungro</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/r/Gary_Brackett_c8c5.html" title="Gary Brackett">Gary Brackett</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/n/Ben_Utecht_7d16.html" title="Ben Utecht">Ben Utecht</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/r/y/a/Ryan_Lilja_8d11.html" title="Ryan Lilja">Ryan Lilja</a>. Polian also signed <a href="../../../../articles/n/i/c/Nick_Harper_c6aa.html" title="Nick Harper">Nick Harper</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/k/Mike_Vanderjagt_ed36.html" title="Mike Vanderjagt">Mike Vanderjagt</a> as free agents from the <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_451d.html" title="Canadian Football League">Canadian Football League</a>.</p>
<p>Polian has rarely signed established free agents away from other teams through big money contracts. He has said that the Colts have no interest in the annual sweepstakes for veteran free agents. The Colts under Polian are also known for finding unknown linebackers who become hugely successful in Indianapolis before moving on to large contracts elsewhere, including Marcus Washington, Mike Peterson, and Cato June. In the offseason of 2004, he signed former pro-bowl DT <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/r/Corey_Simon_4858.html" title="Corey Simon">Corey Simon</a> in a move that did not work out as planned because Simon contributed little to the Colts due to a "mystery" illness; Simon was cut and Jim Irsay publicly said signing him was a mistake. Another notable exception was following the 2005 season, when he signed kicker <a href="../../../../articles/a/d/a/Adam_Vinatieri_e0e0.html" title="Adam Vinatieri">Adam Vinatieri</a> to a $12 million contract, although Sports Illustrated noted the contract took up only 3% of the Colts' 2006 salary cap. The move made Vinatieri the NFL's highest paid kicker, and his clutch play was key in the Colts progression toward becoming <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a> champions.</p>
<p>Following the retirement of tackle <a href="../../../../articles/t/a/r/Tarik_Glenn_e9fc.html" title="Tarik Glenn">Tarik Glenn</a> prior to the start of the 2007 season, only one player remains from the pre-Polian era, wide receiver <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Marvin_Harrison_f0ed.html" title="Marvin Harrison">Marvin Harrison</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Bill_Polian_3fe8.html" title="Edit section: Playoff woes end">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playoff woes end</span></h4>
<p>Even though the Colts finished with winning records and looked much better as a franchise, they would suffer playoff losses following the '99 and '00 seasons. Things would only get worse for the 2001 season as Edgerrin James would go down in week 7 with a season ending injury and the Colts would finish 6-10. A humiliating loss at home to the <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/n/San_Francisco_49ers_43f8.html" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> would spark the famous "Playoffs?!" rant by then coach <a href="../../../../articles/j/i/m/Jim_Mora_f1e7.html" title="Jim Mora">Jim Mora</a>. Their biggest nemesis had been the Patriots, whom the Colts seemed unable to overcome in the playoffs. In 2003 and 2004, the Colts had one of the most prolific offenses in the history of the NFL, and Manning won back to back MVP awards. However, both these seasons would end in New England, as the Patriots stiffled the Colts 24-14 and 20-3. After the 2003 AFC Championship game, Polian coerced the competition committee and the leagues head of officiating Mike Pereria to issue a crackdown on illegal contact and defensive holding in the secondary, claiming that the Colts receivers had been roughed up illegally by the Patriots defensive backs without penalty during the Championship game. The league complied, leading to these penalties becoming much more strictly enforced and prevalent during games.</p>
<p>The fact that both losses came in bad weather in Foxboro led to many questioning whether the Colts offense was built for indoor stadiums (as the Colts play their home games inside of the RCA Dome) and if Peyton Manning would ever win a Super Bowl Title. In 2005, the struggles continued, as the Colts fell to the sixth-seeded Pittsburgh Steelers, even though they were the beneficiary of a questionable overturn of an apparent Troy Polamalu interception that led to a Colts touchdown. After Manning was sacked on 4th down inside of his own 10 yard line with under two minutes to play, the Steelers seemed poised for victory. But a Jerome Bettis fumble was recovered by Nick Harper, who only had to get past Steeler QB Ben Rothliesberger to score a game-winning TD--and Rothliesberger tackled him (it was later revealed Harper was limited by a gash to the knee he had suffered the night before the game). After driving to the Steelers 24 yard line, Vanderjact, who at the time was the most accurate kicker in NFL history, badly missed a 41 yard field goal, leading to another offseason of excuses from the Colts. After the game, Manning infamously claimed that the Colts offense "had some problems with protection", and was harshly criticized for blaming his teammates for his team's failures. It appeared that Manning would never overcome his playoff woes.</p>
<p>However in 2007, the Colts finally overcame their personal "<a href="../../../../articles/k/r/y/Kryptonite.html" title="Kryptonite">kryptonite</a>", beating the Patriots 38-34 in the biggest comeback ever in a Conference Championship game, after the Patriots took a 21-3 lead late in the first half. The Patriots had multiple chances to put the game away, but were unable to convert on 3rd and 4 with only minutes remaining in the game, and were forced to punt the ball back to the Colts. After a quick scoring drive, which ended in a Joseph Addai touchdown run, the Patriots got the ball back for one final shot, but Tom Brady was intercepted by Marlin Jackson, and the Colts had finally lived up to expectations and made the Super Bowl. They went on to defeat the <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a> 29-17 in <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XLI_893d.html" title="Super Bowl XLI">Super Bowl XLI</a> at Dolphin Stadium.</p>
