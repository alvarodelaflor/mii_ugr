Abstract    :
                   The regulatory mechanisms utilized for the control of                     
              expression of the rudimentary gene of Drosophila melanogaster will             
              be examined with a combination of genetic and molecular approaches.            
              The underlying hypothesis is that there exist a number of trans-               
              acting regulatory genes which interact with the rudimentary gene to            
              produce the developmental program of gene expression. The tissue-              
              specific control regions within the 5'end of the rudimentary gene              
              will be more precisely mapped and characterized. Fusion proteins               
              will be isolated and used to generate antibodies to the wild-type              
              mod(r)1 and mod(r)2 proteins. These antibodies will be used to                 
              determine the tissue distribution and the cellular localization of             
              the wild-type proteins. Additionally, the antibodies will be used              
              for the characterization and purification of the gene products.                
              Lastly, the null phenotypes and normal functions of mod(r)1 and                
              mod(r)2 will be determined. Mutants which have deficiencies and                
              have a null phenotype will be isolated and characterized. cDNA's               
              will continue to be isolated and sequenced in an effort to                     
              determine the biological function of these genes.

              An understanding of the many ways in which genes are regulated so              
              that the precise developmental pattern of a living organism almost             
              invariably occurs is critical to our insight into life processes.
