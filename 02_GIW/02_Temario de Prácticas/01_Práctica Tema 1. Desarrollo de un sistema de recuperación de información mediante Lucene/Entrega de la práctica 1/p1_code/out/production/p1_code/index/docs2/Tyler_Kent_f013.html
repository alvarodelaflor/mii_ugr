<p>As soon as Kent arrived in London, he was seen in the company of Ludwig Matthias, suspected German agent who was being tailed by detectives of <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/o/Scotland_Yard_5bca.html" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard's</a> <a href="../../../../articles/s/p/e/Special_Branch_7a96.html" title="Special Branch">Special Branch</a>. He was observed being a frequent guest of the Russian Tea Room in <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/South_Kensington_e38b.html" title="South Kensington">South Kensington</a>, a habitué for <a href="../../../../articles/w/h/i/White_movement.html" title="White movement">White Russians</a> led by Adm. Nikolai Wolkoff, the former naval attaché for <a href="../../../../articles/i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> in London, and his wife, a former maid of honor to the <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/e/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_of_Hesse_d151.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse">Tsaritsa</a>. Through one of their daughters, <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/n/Anna_Wolkoff_92a0.html" title="Anna Wolkoff">Anna</a>, Kent met Irene Danishewsky, wife of a British merchant who was a frequent visitor of the Soviet Union. She became Kent's mistress. Because of their background, Irene and her husband were placed under <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/r/Surveillance.html" title="Surveillance">surveillance</a> by <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/5/MI5_b0c3.html" title="MI5">MI5</a> as possible Soviet spies.</p>
<p>With a position which required him to encode and decode sensitive telegrams, Kent had access to a wide range of secret documents, especially the communications between Churchill and Roosevelt, and he began to take many of the more interesting ones home with him. Meanwhile, he was also becoming active in politics. Kent's views are uncertain but many have assumed that he took an <a href="../../../../articles/i/s/o/Isolationism.html" title="Isolationism">isolationist</a> line, and that he was prepared to help <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> anti-war campaigns. Early in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, through Anna Wolkoff, he met <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/c/Archibald_Maule_Ramsay_268a.html" title="Archibald Maule Ramsay">Archibald Maule Ramsay</a>, an <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-semitism">anti-semitic</a> <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a>, and joined Ramsay's group "The Right Club". Ramsay gave him the Right Club's membership list for safe-keeping.</p>
<p>Kent later invited Wolkoff and Ramsay to his flat and showed them the stolen documents. He would later claim that he showed them to Ramsay in the hope that the latter would pass them to politicians hostile to Roosevelt. Anna Wolkoff herself made copies of some of these documents on <a href="../../../../articles/a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">April 13</a>, and sent them to <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> through an intermediary from the <a href="../../../../articles/i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> Embassy. It was afterwards found that based on interception of wireless messages by <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/8/MI8_d475.html" title="MI8">MI8</a> that it came under the possession of <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/l/Wilhelm_Canaris_328a.html" title="Wilhelm Canaris">Vice Admiral Wilhelm Canaris</a>, the head of the <a href="../../../../articles/a/b/w/Abwehr.html" title="Abwehr">Abwehr</a>.</p>
<p>Wolkoff approached fellow Right Club member Joan Miller, and asked her if she could pass a coded letter to <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/l/William_Joyce_f6d9.html" title="William Joyce">William Joyce</a> through her contacts at the Italian Embassy. Miller agreed, but what Wolkoff did not know was that Miller was an undercover agent for <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/5/MI5_b0c3.html" title="MI5">MI5</a>, and directly under the supervision of its head of counter-subversion, <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/x/Maxwell_Knight_5bbb.html" title="Maxwell Knight">Maxwell Knight</a>. Miller agreed to take the letter, but instead of bringing it to the Italian Embassy, the letter was shown to Knight.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a> The U.S. Ambassador, <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/s/Joseph_P._Kennedy_Sr._8175.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.">Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.</a> was informed of this development, and agreed to waive <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/p/Diplomatic_immunity.html" title="Diplomatic immunity">diplomatic immunity</a> against Kent. On <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> Kent was arrested in a dawn raid at his flat. When officers of MI5 inspected his flat, they found 1,929 official documents: besides Churchill's cables, there was a book containing the names of people under surveillance by Special Branch and MI5. Searchers also found keys to the U.S. Embassy code room.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, after 11 days of secret arrest, the U.S. State Department announced that he had been fired and "detained by order of the <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/m/Home_Secretary_407d.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a>". The statement did not say that he had been arrested under the <a href="../../../../articles/o/f/f/Official_Secrets_Act_a58a.html" title="Official Secrets Act">Official Secrets Act</a>. Anna was likewise arrested on May 20 and charged with violating the same act.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../../articles/o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">October 23</a> Kent was tried <i><a href="../../../../articles/i/n/_/In_camera.html" title="In camera">in camera</a></i> in the <a href="../../../../articles/o/l/d/Old_Bailey_a6e6.html" title="Old Bailey">Old Bailey</a>. Brown paper was pasted on the windows and glass door panels. He was specifically charged with obtaining documents that "might be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy" and letting Wolkoff have them in her possession. He was also accused of stealing documents that were the property of Ambassador Kennedy. The only spectators allowed at the trial were official observers, including <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/l/Malcolm_Muggeridge_a42d.html" title="Malcolm Muggeridge">Malcolm Muggeridge</a>, representing <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/6/MI6_da6b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="MI6">MI6</a>. Two of the witnesses against Kent were Maxwell Knight and Archibald Ramsay himself, who was interned on the <a href="../../../../articles/i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> under <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/f/Defence_Regulation_18B_0a4c.html" title="Defence Regulation 18B">Defence Regulation 18B</a> because he had seen the documents. British officials who were knowledgeable of the documents believed that if they would come to light at that time, it would seriously damage Anglo-American relations, for it showed that Roosevelt was looking at ways to evade the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/u/Neutrality_Acts_41c6.html" title="Neutrality Acts">Neutrality Acts</a> to help Britain survive the German onslaught. It would have also damaged Roosevelt's reelection bid for the presidency that year.</p>
<p>In his trial, Kent also admitted that he secreted documents from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, with the vague notion of someday showing them to U.S. senators who shared his isolationist, anti-semitic views. He said that he burned the Moscow documents before being assigned to London. It was learned later on that he fell in love with an interpreter who worked for the <a href="../../../../articles/n/k/v/NKVD_9ef5.html" title="NKVD">NKVD</a>, thus fuelling speculations that he had Soviet contacts.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> he was convicted and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. The trial and imprisonment of Kent, and the cooperation of the US authorities, led isolationist groups in the United States to claim that he had been framed and that the trial was an attempted cover-up of an attempt to get the U.S. to join the war. The documents, finally released in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, did not support this claim. The papers that Kent had purloined did indicate Anglo-American naval cooperation, but they also showed that Roosevelt was not prepared to go further without support from <a href="../../../../articles/u/2E/s/U.S._Congress_7589.html" class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Congress">Congress</a> or the public.</p>

<p>At the end of the war Kent was released and deported to the United States. He never changed his beliefs: he insisted that he had always been a staunch anti-<a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Communist.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Communist">communist</a>. After marrying a wealthy woman, he became a publisher of a newspaper with links to the <a href="../../../../articles/k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. He condemned <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">President John F. Kennedy</a> as a communist and charged that he was killed by communists because he was abandoning his communist leanings.</p>
<p>According to Ray Bearse and Anthony Read, in their book on Tyler Kent (see below), despite his anti-communist beliefs, officials in the FBI believed him to be a secret Soviet sympathizer. He was the subject of six FBI investigations from <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> to <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, all ending inconclusively. He died in poverty in a <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> trailer park in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>.</p>
