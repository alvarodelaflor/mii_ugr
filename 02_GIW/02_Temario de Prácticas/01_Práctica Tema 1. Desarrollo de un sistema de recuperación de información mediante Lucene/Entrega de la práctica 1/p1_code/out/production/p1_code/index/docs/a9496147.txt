Abstract    :
              The purpose of this collaborative project is to extend the                     
              Batemen-Foust 1860 data set by collecting data for the same                    
              townships from the manuscripts of the 1880 Census of Population                
              and Agriculture.  These two data sets will then be linked across               
              households between the two census dates to provide a large scale               
              cross-section/time-series database on families, households,                    
              individuals, farms, and communities in the second half of the                  
              nineteenth century.  The resulting composite database promises                 
              important new insights into the development of the American                    
              economy at a critical period in its history and offers long term               
              research material for economic historians, demographers, rural                 
              sociologists and scholars from other disciplines.  It is also of               
              potential interest and relevance for contemporary research since               
              the late nineteenth century witnessed the structural change of                 
              America from a rural, agricultural country to an urban-industrial              
              one, a change analogous to the on-going shift from manufacturing               
              to services.
