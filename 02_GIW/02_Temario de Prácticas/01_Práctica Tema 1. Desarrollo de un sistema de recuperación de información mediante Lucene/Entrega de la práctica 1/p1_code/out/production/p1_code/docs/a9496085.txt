Abstract    :
                   Variations of sensible and latent heat fluxes between                     
              different soil and vegetation conditions can in some cases be                  
              significant and may influence the local development (timing,                   
              location and intensity) of deep convective cloud systems.                      
                   The Principal Investigators will perform a systematic set of              
              numerical experiments in order to quantify the mechanisms and                  
              effects by which surface thermal and moisture forcing affect the               
              development of deep convective clouds over different types of                  
              terrain.  Emphasis will be placed on vegetated and bare soil                   
              surfaces as well as sea surfaces under a variety of                            
              evapotranspiration conditions.                                                 
                   The results will contribute to a basic understanding of the               
              ways by which surface characteristics influence the development                
              of local deep convection and may suggest refinements in the                    
              forecasting of such events.
