Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
              research on  charge transfer reactions by Dr. D. Paul Rillema of the Chemistry
              Department, University of  North Carolina at Charlotte.  Complexes, primarily
              of rhenium, containing light harvesting  chromophores will be synthesized. 
              Photoexcitation of the chromophore promotes electron  transfer between electron
              donor and acceptor groups covalently attached to it.  The work will  yield
              fundamental information on the quenching of photogenerated excited states, and
              is relevant  to solar energy conversion.  This is a Research at Undergraduate
              Institutions (RUI) award and  the research will be conducted by undergraduate
              students.
