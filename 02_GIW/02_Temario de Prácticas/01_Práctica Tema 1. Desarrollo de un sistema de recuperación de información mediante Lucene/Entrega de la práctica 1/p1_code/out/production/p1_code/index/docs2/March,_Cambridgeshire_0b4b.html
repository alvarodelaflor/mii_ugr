<p>March was the <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/u/County_town.html" title="County town">county town</a> of the Isle of Ely, a separate administrative county between 1889 and 1965, and is now the administrative centre of <a href="../../../../articles/f/e/n/Fenland_District_Council_1387.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fenland District Council">Fenland District Council</a>.</p>
<p>It was an important railway centre, with a <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/March_railway_station.html" title="March railway station">major junction station</a> on the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Great_Eastern_Railway_c0ba.html" title="Great Eastern Railway">Great Eastern</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Great_Northern_Railway_%28Great_Britain%29_198e.html" title="Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)">Great Northern railways</a>, 88 miles from London by rail, 29 north from <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, 14 north-west from <a href="../../../../articles/e/l/y/Ely.html" title="Ely">Ely</a> and 9 south from <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/s/Wisbech.html" title="Wisbech">Wisbech</a>.</p>
<p>The town is situated on the banks of the <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/v/River_Nene_b399.html" title="River Nene">River Nene</a>, which is navigable, and is used by pleasure boats.</p>
<p>Like many Fenland towns, March was once an island surrounded by marshes. It occupied the second largest "island" in the Great Level.</p>
<p>As the land drained, the town grew and prospered as a trading and religious centre. It was also a minor port and in more recent times a market town, administrative and railway centre.</p>

<p>Modern March lies on the path of the <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/m/Roman_road.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Roman road">Roman road</a>, the <a href="../../../../articles/f/e/n/Fen_Causeway_c9f3.html" title="Fen Causeway">Fen Causeway</a> and there is evidence of Roman settlements in the area.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Fens_4447.html" title="The Fens">draining of the fens</a>, the town was effectively an island in the marshy fens. It was formed from two settlements, Merche and Mercheford, separated by a canal. The town probably owes its origin to the ford on the old course of the Nene, where the road between <a href="../../../../articles/e/l/y/Ely.html" title="Ely">Ely</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/s/Wisbech.html" title="Wisbech">Wisbech</a>, the two chief towns of the Isle of Ely, crossed the river. At one time shipping on the River Nene provided the basis of the town's trade, but this declined with coming of the railway in the 19th century.</p>
<p>A bridge of one arch was erected over the river Nene towards the north end of the town in 1850. The High Street, which is the chief thoroughfare, is continued over the bridge to Broad Street on the north side of the Nene, and the High Causeway is lined with a fine avenue of elm and other trees.</p>
<p>A Local Board of Health was formed in 1851, under the Act, 14 and 15 Vict. c. 103 (1851), but under the provisions of the "Local Government Act, 1894" (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 73), the town is now governed by an Urban District Council of 12 members, and is lighted with gas from works the property of the March Gas and Coke Co. Limited. The Wisbech Water Works Company, by a provisional order, obtained in 1884, supply the town with water, which is brought through mains from Wisbech, a distance of 10 miles.</p>
<p>The town is divided into four ecclesiastical parishes which, with three others, were formed out of the parish of <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/d/Doddington%2C_Cambridgeshire_ffa6.html" title="Doddington, Cambridgeshire">Doddington</a> subsequently to 1863, according to the provisions of the Doddington Rectory Division Acts, 10 and 11 Vict. c. 3 (1847) and 19 and 20 Vict. c. 1 (1856)." "The area of the entire civil parish is 19,669 acres of land and 108 of water; rateable value, £47,414; the area of the ecclesiastical parishes is:- St. Mary, 7,143; St John 3,485; St. Peter, 4,072. The population of the civil parish and urban district in 1891 was 6,988; and the ecclesiastical parishes, viz. St. John, 3,685; St. Mary, 634; St. Peter, 1,697 and St. Wendreda, 972."</p>
<p>March is also home to <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/r/Her_Majesty%27s_Prison_Service_5911.html" title="Her Majesty's Prison Service">HM Prison</a> <a href="../../../../articles/w/h/i/Whitemoor_%28HM_Prison%29_9f16.html" title="Whitemoor (HM Prison)">Whitemoor</a>, first opened in 1992.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/March%2C_Cambridgeshire_0b4b.html" title="Edit section: Market">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Market</span></h2>
<p>With a long history of trading, in the reign of <a href="../../../../articles/e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a>, March was a minor port. In 1566 eight boats, capable of carrying one, one and a half, or two cartloads, were used in the coal and grain trades. A certain amount of traffic - in coal and other commodities, carried in barges, was observed by <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/l/William_Dugdale_a1bd.html" title="William Dugdale">Dugdale</a> in 1657. Local tradesmen’s <a href="../../../../articles/t/o/k/Token_coin.html#Trade_Tokens_or_Barter_tokens" title="Token coin">tokens</a> of 1669, and a silver shilling token of 1811, have been noted.</p>
<p>Originally a market appears to have been held near the original town (then village) centre, on land beside The Causeway. A Market Cross (now called The Stone Cross) points towards the existence of an early Market and this cross was erected in the early 16th Century. This site was very near to St Wendreda’s Church.</p>
<p>In 1669 the people of the town successfully petitioned King <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Charles_II_ac38.html" title="Charles II">Charles II</a> and in 1670 he granted the Lord of the Manor of <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/d/Doddington%2C_Cambridgeshire_ffa6.html" title="Doddington, Cambridgeshire">Doddington</a> a Royal Charter endowing the right to hold a market with two annual fairs, in spite of the opposition of Wisbech Corporation. This market was held on Fridays. The Lord of the Manor of Doddington, who owned a large part of March, gave special permission to the townspeople to sell their goods on some of his land in the town centre. This site, now called the Market Place, was then known as Bridge Green Common and later named Market Hill.</p>
<p>In 1785 the tolls were assessed at £6 per year. Soon after this the market appears to have lapsed, though the fairs continued at this period to be prosperous. The development of the market was impeded by the absence of a covered hall and by the fact that market day in March and several neighbouring towns fell on the same day (Friday).</p>
<p>In 1807 the <a href="../../../../articles/v/e/s/Vestry.html#Administrative_vestry" title="Vestry">Vestry</a> decided that it was not hygienic for goods to be loaded or unloaded in the vicinity of the market and ordered all saw pits, timber and other encroachments around the Market place to be removed. The market was struggling during this time and an attempt to revive it in 1821 was not very successful. A Butter Cross, also known as a Market House, was erected in 1831. This building also housed the town fire engine and had an upstairs room that for a time housed the ‘Clock House School’ and later the Town Surveyor’s office. This office was covered by a turret which housed the Town Clock (purchased by public subscription about 1750) and the Fire Bell. During later refurbishments this clock was re-housed in St Peter’s Church Tower. The Town Stocks were also placed in the Market Place and local offenders (and those who refused to go to church) were placed in them.</p>
<p>The want of a Market House was remedied, in a make-shift fashion, by Sir Henry Peyton, 2nd baronet of the 1776 creation, (who was the current Lord of the Manor of Doddington). His building, however, was only 40 ft long by 17 ft broad, and provided only 14 stalls under cover</p>
<p>After the opening of the railway in 1847 another attempt was made to increase the Market. In 1851 the Market had been stated to be ‘making progress’; and £150 was subscribed to give a treat to the poor at its re-opening. The difficulty of the clashing with other Market days was solved in December 1856 by changing the day from Friday to Wednesday ‘by private arrangement and without any formalities’. The tolls were, however, collected in an arbitrary and haphazard way; they were assessed for poor rate purposes at £10.</p>
<p>In 1872 the Board of Health bought a Shand and Mason fire engine that was the town’s first steam appliance that was to be housed in the Market house. During the same year the Vestry agreed to erect a urinal at the back of the Butter Cross for use by boys attending the Clock House School, but would not erect a water closet (toilet).</p>
<p>The Market toll-keeper in 1888, though he had no fixed scale of charges and kept no record of receipts, was said to be taking about £50 a year. The success and prosperity of the Market fluctuated over the years and an attempt by the Local Board to purchase the Market Rights to mark the Jubilee of 1887 was a failure. However in 1897 Sir Algernon Peyton ( the Lord of the Manor of Doddington ) agreed to sell the Market Rights, the Market Place and Market House to March Urban District Council for the sum of £800. At that time the Market was leased to Mr F. B. Phillips who agreed to surrender his lease in 1898 subject to his receiving the Market tolls for one year without charge. This was agreed and the transaction was completed.</p>
<p>The Market Rights passed to <a href="../../../../articles/f/e/n/Fenland_District_Council_1387.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fenland District Council">Fenland District Council</a> following the Local Government Re-organisation in 1974.</p>
