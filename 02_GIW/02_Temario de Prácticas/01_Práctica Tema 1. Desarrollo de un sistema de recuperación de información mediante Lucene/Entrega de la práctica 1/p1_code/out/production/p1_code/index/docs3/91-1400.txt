So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\r\n\r\nI give Pirrip as my father\xe2\x80\x99s family name, on the authority of his\r\ntombstone and my sister,\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.\r\nAs I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of\r\neither of them (for their days were long before the days of\r\nphotographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were\r\nunreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,\r\nwith curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_,\xe2\x80\x9d I drew a childish conclusion that\r\nmy mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each\r\nabout a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside\r\ntheir grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\r\nmine,\xe2\x80\x94who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that\r\nuniversal struggle,\xe2\x80\x94I am indebted for a belief I religiously\r\nentertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands\r\nin their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state\r\nof existence.\r\n\r\nOurs was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river\r\nwound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad\r\nimpression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on\r\na memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out\r\nfor certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the\r\nchurchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also\r\nGeorgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,\r\nBartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the\r\naforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness\r\nbeyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,\r\nwith scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low\r\nleaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from\r\nwhich the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of\r\nshivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your noise!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from\r\namong the graves at the side of the church porch. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep still, you\r\nlittle devil, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut your throat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man\r\nwith no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his\r\nhead. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and\r\nlamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by\r\nbriars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose\r\nteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Don\xe2\x80\x99t cut my throat, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I pleaded in terror. \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us your name!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, staring at me. \xe2\x80\x9cGive it mouth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip. Pip, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow us where you live,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cPint out the place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the\r\nalder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\r\n\r\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and\r\nemptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.\r\nWhen the church came to itself,\xe2\x80\x94for he was so sudden and strong that he\r\nmade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\r\nfeet,\xe2\x80\x94when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\r\ntombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou young dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, licking his lips, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat fat cheeks you\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my\r\nyears, and not strong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarn me if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, with a threatening shake\r\nof his head, \xe2\x80\x9cand if I han\xe2\x80\x99t half a mind to\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and held tighter to the\r\ntombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;\r\npartly, to keep myself from crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow lookee here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d I timidly explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso Georgiana. That\xe2\x80\x99s my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coming back. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that your father alonger your\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9chim too; late of this parish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered then, considering. \xe2\x80\x9cWho d\xe2\x80\x99ye live with,\xe2\x80\x94supposin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re kindly let to live, which I han\xe2\x80\x99t made up my mind about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister, sir,\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Joe Gargery,\xe2\x80\x94wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlacksmith, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. And looked down at his leg.\r\n\r\nAfter darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to\r\nmy tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\r\ncould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\r\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow lookee here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe question being whether you\xe2\x80\x99re to be\r\nlet to live. You know what a file is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know what wittles is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\r\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get me a file.\xe2\x80\x9d He tilted me again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you get me wittles.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntilted me again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou bring \xe2\x80\x99em both to me.\xe2\x80\x9d He tilted me again. \xe2\x80\x9cOr\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have your heart and liver out.\xe2\x80\x9d He tilted me again.\r\n\r\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\r\nhands, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\r\nsir, perhaps I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\r\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\r\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\r\nbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and\r\nyou never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your\r\nhaving seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall\r\nbe let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no\r\nmatter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore\r\nout, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t alone, as you may think I am.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I\r\nam a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has\r\na secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his\r\nheart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide\r\nhimself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in\r\nbed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think\r\nhimself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and\r\ncreep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man\r\nfrom harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I\r\nfind it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what\r\ndo you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\r\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay Lord strike you dead if you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\nI said so, and he took me down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cyou remember what you\xe2\x80\x99ve undertook, and you\r\nremember that young man, and you get home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoo-good night, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch of that!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish I was a frog. Or a eel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\r\narms,\xe2\x80\x94clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,\xe2\x80\x94and limped\r\ntowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\r\nnettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\r\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\r\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\r\nankle and pull him in.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose\r\nlegs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When\r\nI saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of\r\nmy legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on\r\nagain towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and\r\npicking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into\r\nthe marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were\r\nheavy or the tide was in.\r\n\r\nThe marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped\r\nto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not\r\nnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long\r\nangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the\r\nriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\r\nprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the\r\nbeacon by which the sailors steered,\xe2\x80\x94like an unhooped cask upon a\r\npole,\xe2\x80\x94an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with\r\nsome chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was\r\nlimping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,\r\nand come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a\r\nterrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their\r\nheads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I\r\nlooked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of\r\nhim. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,\r\nand had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours\r\nbecause she had brought me up \xe2\x80\x9cby hand.\xe2\x80\x9d Having at that time to find\r\nout for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a\r\nhard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her\r\nhusband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both\r\nbrought up by hand.\r\n\r\nShe was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general\r\nimpression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe\r\nwas a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth\r\nface, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to\r\nhave somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,\r\ngood-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x94a sort\r\nof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing\r\nredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\r\nshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall\r\nand bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her\r\nfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in\r\nfront, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful\r\nmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this\r\napron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn\r\nit at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken\r\nit off, every day of her life.\r\n\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of\r\nthe dwellings in our country were,\xe2\x80\x94most of them, at that time. When I\r\nran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was\r\nsitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and\r\nhaving confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment\r\nI raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,\r\nsitting in the chimney corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nout now, making it a baker\xe2\x80\x99s dozen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cand what\xe2\x80\x99s worse, she\xe2\x80\x99s got Tickler with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat\r\nround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler\r\nwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sot down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand she got up, and she made a grab at\r\nTickler, and she Ram-paged out. That\xe2\x80\x99s what she did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, slowly\r\nclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at\r\nit; \xe2\x80\x9cshe Ram-paged out, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she been gone long, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I always treated him as a larger species\r\nof child, and as no more than my equal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s been on the\r\nRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She\xe2\x80\x99s a-coming! Get\r\nbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,\r\nand finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,\r\nand applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by\r\nthrowing me\xe2\x80\x94I often served as a connubial missile\xe2\x80\x94at Joe, who, glad to\r\nget hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly\r\nfenced me up there with his great leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been, you young monkey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe, stamping her\r\nfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me directly what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing to wear me away with\r\nfret and fright and worrit, or I\xe2\x80\x99d have you out of that corner if you\r\nwas fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only been to the churchyard,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, from my stool, crying and\r\nrubbing myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChurchyard!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it warn\xe2\x80\x99t for me you\xe2\x80\x99d have been\r\nto the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by\r\nhand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why did I do it, I should like to know?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my sister.\r\n\r\nI whimpered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d never do it again! I know that. I may\r\ntruly say I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough to be a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s wife (and him a Gargery) without\r\nbeing your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at\r\nthe fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the\r\nmysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was\r\nunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me\r\nin the avenging coals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. \xe2\x80\x9cChurchyard,\r\nindeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.\xe2\x80\x9d One of us, by the by,\r\nhad not said it at all. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixt\r\nyou, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you\xe2\x80\x99d be without\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me\r\nover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and\r\ncalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the\r\ngrievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his\r\nright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with\r\nhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.\r\n\r\nMy sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,\r\nthat never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\r\nand fast against her bib,\xe2\x80\x94where it sometimes got a pin into it, and\r\nsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she\r\ntook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,\r\nin an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,\xe2\x80\x94using\r\nboth sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and\r\nmoulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a\r\nfinal smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very\r\nthick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the\r\nloaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.\r\nI felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful\r\nacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew\r\nMrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my\r\nlarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.\r\nTherefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of\r\nmy trousers.\r\n\r\nThe effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I\r\nfound to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\r\nfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\r\nAnd it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our\r\nalready-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\r\ngood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\r\nthe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s admiration now and then,\xe2\x80\x94which stimulated us to new exertions.\r\nTo-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\r\ndiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he\r\nfound me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my\r\nuntouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\r\nconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had\r\nbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\r\ncircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\r\nme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.\r\n\r\nJoe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\r\nof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than\r\nusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like\r\na pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on\r\none side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw\r\nthat my bread and butter was gone.\r\n\r\nThe wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of\r\nhis bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter _now_?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious\r\nremonstrance. \xe2\x80\x9cPip, old chap! You\xe2\x80\x99ll do yourself a mischief. It\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstick somewhere. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have chawed it, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated my sister, more sharply than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend you to do\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, all aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cManners is manners, but still your elth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour elth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,\r\nand, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little\r\nwhile against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking\r\nguiltily on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll mention what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, out of\r\nbreath, \xe2\x80\x9cyou staring great stuck pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and\r\nlooked at me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,\r\nand speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou and me is always friends, and I\xe2\x80\x99d be the last to tell upon you,\r\nany time. But such a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he moved his chair and looked about the floor\r\nbetween us, and then again at me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csuch a most oncommon Bolt as that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeen bolting his food, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,\r\nwith his bite still in his cheek, \xe2\x80\x9cI Bolted, myself, when I was your\r\nage\xe2\x80\x94frequent\xe2\x80\x94and as a boy I\xe2\x80\x99ve been among a many Bolters; but I never\r\nsee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy you ain\xe2\x80\x99t Bolted\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying\r\nnothing more than the awful words, \xe2\x80\x9cYou come along and be dosed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine\r\nmedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;\r\nhaving a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the\r\nbest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a\r\nchoice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like\r\na new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded\r\na pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater\r\ncomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be\r\nheld in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to\r\nswallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and\r\nmeditating before the fire), \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he had had a turn.\xe2\x80\x9d Judging from\r\nmyself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had\r\nnone before.\r\n\r\nConscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in\r\nthe case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret\r\nburden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great\r\npunishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nnever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the\r\nhousekeeping property as his\xe2\x80\x94united to the necessity of always keeping\r\none hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about\r\nthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,\r\nas the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the\r\nvoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to\r\nsecrecy, declaring that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t starve until\r\nto-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the\r\nyoung man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his\r\nhands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should\r\nmistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and\r\nliver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody\xe2\x80\x99s hair stood on\r\nend with terror, mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\never did?\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with\r\na copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with\r\nthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the\r\nload on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the\r\nbread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped\r\naway, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final\r\nwarm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; \xe2\x80\x9cwas that great\r\nguns, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another conwict off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEscaped. Escaped.\xe2\x80\x9d Administering the definition like Tar-water.\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my\r\nmouth into the forms of saying to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a convict?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe put\r\n_his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,\r\nthat I could make out nothing of it but the single word \xe2\x80\x9cPip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a conwict off last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cafter\r\nsunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfiring warning of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Who\xe2\x80\x99s_ firing?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrat that boy,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be told no\r\nlies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be\r\ntold lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite\r\nunless there was company.\r\n\r\nAt this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\r\npains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a\r\nword that looked to me like \xe2\x80\x9csulks.\xe2\x80\x9d Therefore, I naturally pointed to\r\nMrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cher?\xe2\x80\x9d But Joe\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,\r\nand shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make\r\nnothing of the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as a last resort, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t much mind\xe2\x80\x94where the firing comes from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my sister, as if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite mean\r\nthat but rather the contrary. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the Hulks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh-h!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, looking at Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cHulks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I told you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd please, what\xe2\x80\x99s Hulks?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way with this boy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my sister, pointing me out\r\nwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer him one\r\nquestion, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,\r\nright \xe2\x80\x99cross th\xe2\x80\x99 meshes.\xe2\x80\x9d We always used that name for marshes, in our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who\xe2\x80\x99s put into prison-ships, and why they\xe2\x80\x99re put there?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.\r\n\r\nIt was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what,\r\nyoung fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring you up by hand to badger\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.\r\nPeople are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,\r\nand forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking\r\nquestions. Now, you get along to bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went\r\nupstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,\xe2\x80\x94from Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s thimble\r\nhaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nfelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were\r\nhandy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking\r\nquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\nSince that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought\r\nthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.\r\nNo matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in\r\nmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in\r\nmortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal\r\nterror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had\r\nno hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me\r\nat every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on\r\nrequirement, in the secrecy of my terror.\r\n\r\nIf I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting\r\ndown the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate\r\ncalling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the\r\ngibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at\r\nonce, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been\r\ninclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob\r\nthe pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no\r\ngetting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have\r\nstruck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very\r\npirate himself rattling his chains.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was\r\nshot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,\r\nand every crack in every board calling after me, \xe2\x80\x9cStop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGet\r\nup, Mrs. Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied\r\nthan usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare\r\nhanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back\r\nwas half turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for\r\nselection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole\r\nsome bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I\r\ntied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night\xe2\x80\x99s slice), some\r\nbrandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had\r\nsecretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,\r\nSpanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from\r\na jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and\r\na beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without the\r\npie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that\r\nwas put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,\r\nand I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not\r\nintended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.\r\n\r\nThere was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I\r\nunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe\xe2\x80\x99s tools.\r\nThen I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which\r\nI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the\r\nmisty marshes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the\r\noutside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there\r\nall night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw\r\nthe damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort\r\nof spiders\xe2\x80\x99 webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.\r\nOn every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so\r\nthick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our\r\nvillage\xe2\x80\x94a direction which they never accepted, for they never came\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I\r\nlooked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience\r\nlike a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.\r\n\r\nThe mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that\r\ninstead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.\r\nThis was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and\r\nbanks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly\r\nas could be, \xe2\x80\x9cA boy with somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s pork pie! Stop him!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ncattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,\r\nand steaming out of their nostrils, \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, young thief!\xe2\x80\x9d One black\r\nox, with a white cravat on,\xe2\x80\x94who even had to my awakened conscience\r\nsomething of a clerical air,\xe2\x80\x94fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, and\r\nmoved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved\r\nround, that I blubbered out to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, sir! It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor myself I took it!\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of\r\nsmoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and\r\na flourish of his tail.\r\n\r\nAll this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I\r\nwent, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,\r\nas the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I\r\nknew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there\r\non a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that\r\nwhen I was \xe2\x80\x99prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks\r\nthere! However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last\r\ntoo far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the\r\nriver-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes\r\nthat staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I\r\nhad just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and\r\nhad just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man\r\nsitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded,\r\nand was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.\r\n\r\nI thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,\r\nin that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on\r\nthe shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but\r\nanother man!\r\n\r\nAnd yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great iron\r\non his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that\r\nthe other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat\r\nbroad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for\r\nI had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x94it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself\r\ndown, for it made him stumble,\xe2\x80\x94and then he ran into the mist, stumbling\r\ntwice as he went, and I lost him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the young man!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified\r\nhim. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had\r\nknown where it was.\r\n\r\nI was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x94hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all\r\nnight left off hugging and limping,\xe2\x80\x94waiting for me. He was awfully\r\ncold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face\r\nand die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that\r\nwhen I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it\r\noccurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my\r\nbundle. He did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had,\r\nbut left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in the bottle, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrandy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHe was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious\r\nmanner,\xe2\x80\x94more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent\r\nhurry, than a man who was eating it,\xe2\x80\x94but he left off to take some of\r\nthe liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite\r\nas much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his\r\nteeth, without biting it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you have got the ague,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much of your opinion, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s bad about here,\xe2\x80\x9d I told him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been lying out on the\r\nmeshes, and they\xe2\x80\x99re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my breakfast afore they\xe2\x80\x99re the death of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do\r\nthat, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is\r\nover there, directly afterwards. I\xe2\x80\x99ll beat the shivers so far, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all\r\nat once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round\r\nus, and often stopping\xe2\x80\x94even stopping his jaws\xe2\x80\x94to listen. Some real or\r\nfancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the\r\nmarsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir! No!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor giv\xe2\x80\x99 no one the office to follow you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you. You\xe2\x80\x99d be but a fierce young hound\r\nindeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched\r\nwarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,\r\nand was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nPitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down\r\nupon the pie, I made bold to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was glad you enjoyed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, my boy. I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now\r\nnoticed a decided similarity between the dog\xe2\x80\x99s way of eating, and the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He\r\nswallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;\r\nand he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought\r\nthere was danger in every direction of somebody\xe2\x80\x99s coming to take the\r\npie away. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to\r\nappreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with\r\nhim, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of\r\nwhich particulars he was very like the dog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you won\xe2\x80\x99t leave any of it for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, timidly; after\r\na silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making\r\nthe remark. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no more to be got where that came from.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nthe certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave any for him? Who\xe2\x80\x99s him?\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend, stopping in his\r\ncrunching of pie-crust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh ah!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cHim? Yes,\r\nyes! _He_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want no wittles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he looked as if he did,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nThe man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and\r\nthe greatest surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooked? When?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, pointing; \xe2\x80\x9cover there, where I found him nodding\r\nasleep, and thought it was you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his\r\nfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDressed like you, you know, only with a hat,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained, trembling;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I was very anxious to put this delicately\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand with\xe2\x80\x94the same\r\nreason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear the cannon last\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there _was_ firing!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we\r\nheard it up at home, and that\xe2\x80\x99s farther away, and we were shut in\r\nbesides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, see now!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a man\xe2\x80\x99s alone on these flats, with a\r\nlight head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees\r\nthe soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried\r\nafore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself\r\nchallenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders \xe2\x80\x98Make\r\nready! Present! Cover him steady, men!\xe2\x80\x99 and is laid hands on\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night\xe2\x80\x94coming up\r\nin order, Damn \xe2\x80\x99em, with their tramp, tramp\xe2\x80\x94I see a hundred. And as to\r\nfiring! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad\r\nday,\xe2\x80\x94But this man\xe2\x80\x9d; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my\r\nbeing there; \xe2\x80\x9cdid you notice anything in him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a badly bruised face,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, recalling what I hardly knew I\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot here?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly,\r\nwith the flat of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of\r\nhis grey jacket. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me the way he went. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pull him down, like a\r\nbloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, and\r\nhe looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet\r\ngrass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding\r\nhis own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which\r\nhe handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.\r\nI was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself\r\ninto this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping\r\naway from home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice,\r\nso I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw\r\nof him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his\r\nfetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last\r\nI heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me\r\nup. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet\r\nbeen made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the\r\nhouse ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon\r\nthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,\xe2\x80\x94an article into\r\nwhich his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was\r\nvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where the deuce ha\xe2\x80\x99 _you_ been?\xe2\x80\x9d was Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas\r\nsalutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.\r\n\r\nI said I had been down to hear the Carols. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! well!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs.\r\nJoe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might ha\xe2\x80\x99 done worse.\xe2\x80\x9d Not a doubt of that I thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps if I warn\xe2\x80\x99t a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and (what\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing) a\r\nslave with her apron never off, _I_ should have been to hear the\r\nCarols,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather partial to Carols, myself, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the best of reasons for my never hearing any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had\r\nretired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a\r\nconciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her\r\neyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and\r\nexhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.\r\nThis was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for\r\nweeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to\r\ntheir legs.\r\n\r\nWe were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork\r\nand greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had\r\nbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not\r\nbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive\r\narrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\r\nbreakfast; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to have no\r\nformal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nbefore me, I promise you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on\r\na forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of\r\nmilk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the\r\ndresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and\r\ntacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the\r\nold one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,\r\nwhich was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the\r\nyear in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four\r\nlittle white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black\r\nnose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of\r\nthe other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite\r\nart of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than\r\ndirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the\r\nsame by their religion.\r\n\r\nMy sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that\r\nis to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a\r\nwell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he\r\nwas more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\r\nNothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\r\neverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive\r\noccasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,\r\nthe picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,\r\nI think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young\r\noffender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and\r\ndelivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged\r\nmajesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being\r\nborn in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,\r\nand against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I\r\nwas taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make\r\nthem like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the\r\nfree use of my limbs.\r\n\r\nJoe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\r\nfor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\r\nwhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.\r\nJoe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\r\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\r\ndone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\r\nChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\r\nterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived\r\nthe idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYe are now to declare it!\xe2\x80\x9d would be the time for me to rise and\r\npropose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure\r\nthat I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to\r\nthis extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble\r\nthe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe\xe2\x80\x99s uncle,\r\nbut Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in\r\nthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was\r\nhalf-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and\r\nMrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked\r\n(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and\r\neverything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.\r\n\r\nThe time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and\r\nthe company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large\r\nshining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud\r\nof; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could\r\nonly give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he\r\nhimself confessed that if the Church was \xe2\x80\x9cthrown open,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning to\r\ncompetition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Church\r\nnot being \xe2\x80\x9cthrown open,\xe2\x80\x9d he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he\r\npunished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,\xe2\x80\x94always\r\ngiving the whole verse,\xe2\x80\x94he looked all round the congregation first, as\r\nmuch as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your\r\nopinion of this style!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI opened the door to the company,\xe2\x80\x94making believe that it was a habit of\r\nours to open that door,\xe2\x80\x94and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. _I_ was\r\nnot allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged\r\nslow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair\r\nstanding upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been\r\nall but choked, and had that moment come to, \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought you as the\r\ncompliments of the season\xe2\x80\x94I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry\r\nwine\xe2\x80\x94and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with\r\nexactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.\r\nEvery Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, \xe2\x80\x9cO, Un\xe2\x80\x94cle\r\nPum-ble\xe2\x80\x94chook! This _is_ kind!\xe2\x80\x9d Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as he\r\nnow retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no more than your merits. And now are you all\r\nbobbish, and how\xe2\x80\x99s Sixpennorth of halfpence?\xe2\x80\x9d meaning me.\r\n\r\nWe dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts\r\nand oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very like\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister\r\nwas uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally\r\nmore gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I\r\nremember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,\r\nwho held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married\r\nMr. Hubble,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at what remote period,\xe2\x80\x94when she was much\r\nyounger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,\r\nstooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs\r\nextraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some\r\nmiles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.\r\n\r\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\r\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and\r\nthe Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to\r\nspeak (I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the\r\nscaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure\r\ncorners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason\r\nto be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have\r\nleft me alone. But they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me alone. They seemed to think\r\nthe opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,\r\nevery now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an\r\nunfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched\r\nup by these moral goads.\r\n\r\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\r\ntheatrical declamation,\xe2\x80\x94as it now appears to me, something like a\r\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\r\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\r\nreproachful voice, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear that? Be grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cbe grateful, boy, to them which\r\nbrought you up by hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\r\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it that the\r\nyoung are never grateful?\xe2\x80\x9d This moral mystery seemed too much for the\r\ncompany until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNaterally\r\nwicious.\xe2\x80\x9d Everybody then murmured \xe2\x80\x9cTrue!\xe2\x80\x9d and looked at me in a\r\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.\r\n\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when\r\nthere was company than when there was none. But he always aided and\r\ncomforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did\r\nso at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being\r\nplenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about\r\nhalf a pint.\r\n\r\nA little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with\r\nsome severity, and intimated\xe2\x80\x94in the usual hypothetical case of the\r\nChurch being \xe2\x80\x9cthrown open\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what kind of sermon _he_ would have given\r\nthem. After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, he\r\nremarked that he considered the subject of the day\xe2\x80\x99s homily, ill\r\nchosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many\r\nsubjects \xe2\x80\x9cgoing about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve hit it, sir! Plenty of\r\nsubjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their\r\ntails. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s wanted. A man needn\xe2\x80\x99t go far to find a subject, if\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s ready with his salt-box.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short\r\ninterval of reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at Pork alone. There\xe2\x80\x99s a subject! If you\r\nwant a subject, look at Pork!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, sir. Many a moral for the young,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Wopsle,\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nknew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; \xe2\x80\x9cmight be deduced\r\nfrom that text.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cYou listen to this,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)\r\n\r\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwine,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his\r\nfork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cswine\r\nwere the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put\r\nbefore us, as an example to the young.\xe2\x80\x9d (I thought this pretty well in\r\nhim who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr girl,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Hubble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Mr. Wopsle, rather\r\nirritably, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is no girl present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, \xe2\x80\x9cthink what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be grateful for. If you\xe2\x80\x99d been born a Squeaker\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _was_, if ever a child was,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, most emphatically.\r\n\r\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless in that form,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in that form, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had\r\nan objection to being interrupted; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, enjoying himself with his\r\nelders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and\r\nrolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And what would have been your destination?\xe2\x80\x9d turning on me\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\r\nto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would\r\nhave come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped\r\nyou under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his\r\nfrock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would\r\nhave shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then.\r\nNot a bit of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a world of trouble to you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hubble,\r\ncommiserating my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed my sister; \xe2\x80\x9ctrouble?\xe2\x80\x9d and then entered on a fearful\r\ncatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts\r\nof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled\r\nfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I\r\nhad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I\r\nhad contumaciously refused to go there.\r\n\r\nI think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with\r\ntheir noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in\r\nconsequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s Roman nose so aggravated me, during\r\nthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it\r\nuntil he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in\r\ncomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\r\npause was broken which ensued upon my sister\xe2\x80\x99s recital, and in which\r\npause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with\r\nindignation and abhorrence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the\r\ntheme from which they had strayed, \xe2\x80\x9cPork\xe2\x80\x94regarded as biled\xe2\x80\x94is rich,\r\ntoo; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a little brandy, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister.\r\n\r\nO Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say\r\nit was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under\r\nthe cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.\r\n\r\nMy sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,\r\nand poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man\r\ntrifled with his glass,\xe2\x80\x94took it up, looked at it through the light, put\r\nit down,\xe2\x80\x94prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were\r\nbriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the\r\ntable with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his\r\nglass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the\r\nbrandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with\r\nunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning\r\nround several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and\r\nrushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,\r\nviolently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,\r\nand apparently out of his mind.\r\n\r\nI held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\r\nhad done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my\r\ndreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and\r\nsurveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,\r\nsank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, \xe2\x80\x9cTar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be\r\nworse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day,\r\nby the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTar!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how ever could Tar come\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear the word, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all\r\naway with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had\r\nbegun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in\r\ngetting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and\r\nmixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on\r\nto the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of\r\npudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.\r\nThe course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the\r\ngenial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over\r\nthe day, when my sister said to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cClean plates,\xe2\x80\x94cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my\r\nbosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my\r\nsoul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must taste,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, addressing the guests with her best\r\ngrace\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious\r\npresent of Uncle Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMust they! Let them not hope to taste it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a pie; a savory pork\r\npie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of\r\nhaving deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,\xe2\x80\x94quite vivaciously,\r\nall things considered,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Joe, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best endeavours;\r\nlet us have a cut at this same pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.\r\nI saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in\r\nthe Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that \xe2\x80\x9ca bit\r\nof savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do\r\nno harm,\xe2\x80\x9d and I heard Joe say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have some, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d I have never\r\nbeen absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,\r\nmerely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that\r\nI could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of\r\nthe table, and ran for my life.\r\n\r\nBut I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost\r\ninto a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a\r\npair of handcuffs to me, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere you are, look sharp, come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their\r\nloaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from\r\ntable in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen\r\nempty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious goodness gracious me, what\xe2\x80\x99s gone\xe2\x80\x94with the\xe2\x80\x94pie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; at\r\nwhich crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was the\r\nsergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the\r\ncompany, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his\r\nright hand, and his left on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, ladies and gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cbut as I have\r\nmentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,\xe2\x80\x9d (which he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray what might you want with _him_?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted my sister, quick to\r\nresent his being wanted at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the gallant sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cspeaking for myself, I should\r\nreply, the honour and pleasure of his fine wife\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance;\r\nspeaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.\r\nPumblechook cried audibly, \xe2\x80\x9cGood again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, blacksmith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, who had by this time picked\r\nout Joe with his eye, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have had an accident with these, and I find\r\nthe lock of one of \xe2\x80\x99em goes wrong, and the coupling don\xe2\x80\x99t act pretty.\r\nAs they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would\r\nnecessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer two\r\nhours than one. \xe2\x80\x9cWill it? Then will you set about it at once,\r\nblacksmith?\xe2\x80\x9d said the off-hand sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cas it\xe2\x80\x99s on his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nthemselves useful.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, he called to his men, who came trooping\r\ninto the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner.\r\nAnd then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands\r\nloosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now,\r\neasing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over\r\ntheir high stocks, out into the yard.\r\n\r\nAll these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I was\r\nin an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the\r\nhandcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the\r\nbetter of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little\r\nmore of my scattered wits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you give me the time?\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, addressing himself to\r\nMr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the\r\ninference that he was equal to the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just gone half past two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, reflecting; \xe2\x80\x9ceven if I was\r\nforced to halt here nigh two hours, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do. How far might you call\r\nyourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a mile,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do. We begin to close in upon \xe2\x80\x99em about dusk. A little before\r\ndusk, my orders are. That\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConvicts, sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty well known to be out\r\non the marshes still, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t try to get clear of \xe2\x80\x99em before\r\ndusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll find themselves trapped in a\r\ncircle, I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nready, his Majesty the King is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather\r\napron on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its\r\nwooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the\r\nbellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then\r\nJoe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general\r\nattention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer\r\nfrom the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a\r\nglass of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cGive him wine,\r\nMum. I\xe2\x80\x99ll engage there\xe2\x80\x99s no tar in that:\xe2\x80\x9d so, the sergeant thanked him\r\nand said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take\r\nwine, if it was equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a\r\nmouthful and smacked his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood stuff, eh, sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cI suspect that\r\nstuff\xe2\x80\x99s of _your_ providing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na man that knows what\xe2\x80\x99s what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nanother glass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith you. Hob and nob,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe top of mine to the\r\nfoot of yours,\xe2\x80\x94the foot of yours to the top of mine,\xe2\x80\x94Ring once, ring\r\ntwice,\xe2\x80\x94the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live\r\na thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you\r\nare at the present moment of your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for\r\nanother glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality\r\nappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the\r\nbottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a\r\ngush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine\r\nthat he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with\r\nthe same liberality, when the first was gone.\r\n\r\nAs I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,\r\nenjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a\r\ndinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed\r\nthemselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened\r\nwith the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively\r\nanticipation of \xe2\x80\x9cthe two villains\xe2\x80\x9d being taken, and when the bellows\r\nseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke\r\nto hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and\r\nall the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\r\nblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale\r\nafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have\r\nturned pale on their account, poor wretches.\r\n\r\nAt last, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As\r\nJoe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us\r\nshould go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.\r\nPumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsociety; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was\r\nagreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should\r\nhave got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity to know\r\nall about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook to me to put it together again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.\r\nPumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully\r\nsensible of that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s merits under arid conditions, as when\r\nsomething moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.\r\nMr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and\r\nto speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in\r\nthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I\r\ntreasonably whispered to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Joe, we shan\xe2\x80\x99t find them.\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nJoe whispered to me, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give a shilling if they had cut and run,\r\nPip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was\r\ncold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming\r\non, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A\r\nfew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came\r\nout. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.\r\nThere we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\r\ngraves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding\r\nanything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\r\nat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\r\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\r\n\r\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\r\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\r\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\r\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\r\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\r\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\r\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\r\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\r\n\r\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\r\nhunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\r\nto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\r\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\r\nthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\r\nEither the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\r\nUnder the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\r\nmound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\r\nthough all of a watery lead colour.\r\n\r\nWith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s broad shoulder, I\r\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I\r\ncould hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by\r\nhis blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\r\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\r\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\r\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;\r\nand the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\r\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\r\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\r\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we\r\nwere moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all\r\nstopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a\r\nlong shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but\r\nit was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised\r\ntogether,\xe2\x80\x94if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.\r\n\r\nTo this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under\r\ntheir breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment\xe2\x80\x99s listening,\r\nJoe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)\r\nagreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not\r\nbe answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men\r\nshould make towards it \xe2\x80\x9cat the double.\xe2\x80\x9d So we slanted to the right\r\n(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had\r\nto hold on tight to keep my seat.\r\n\r\nIt was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he\r\nspoke all the time, \xe2\x80\x9ca Winder.\xe2\x80\x9d Down banks and up banks, and over\r\ngates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no\r\nman cared where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became\r\nmore and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.\r\nSometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.\r\nWhen it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate\r\nthan ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,\r\nthat we could hear one voice calling \xe2\x80\x9cMurder!\xe2\x80\x9d and another voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConvicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nboth voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would\r\nbreak out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like\r\ndeer, and Joe too.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and\r\ntwo of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and\r\nlevelled when we all ran in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are both men!\xe2\x80\x9d panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\r\nditch. \xe2\x80\x9cSurrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\r\nasunder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWater was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,\r\nand blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the\r\nditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and\r\nthe other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and\r\nstruggling; but of course I knew them both directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind!\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\r\nsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ took him! _I_\r\ngive him up to you! Mind that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not much to be particular about,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nyou small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to do me any good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to do me more\r\ngood than it does now,\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, with a greedy laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI took\r\nhim. He knows it. That\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\r\nbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\r\nHe could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\r\nseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake notice, guard,\xe2\x80\x94he tried to murder me,\xe2\x80\x9d were his first words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTried to murder him?\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, disdainfully. \xe2\x80\x9cTry, and not do\r\nit? I took him, and giv\xe2\x80\x99 him up; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I done. I not only\r\nprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,\xe2\x80\x94dragged\r\nhim this far on his way back. He\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman, if you please, this\r\nvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\r\nhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\r\nhim back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other one still gasped, \xe2\x80\x9cHe tried\xe2\x80\x94he tried-to\xe2\x80\x94murder me. Bear\xe2\x80\x94bear\r\nwitness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here!\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict to the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cSingle-handed I got\r\nclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 got\r\nclear of these death-cold flats likewise\xe2\x80\x94look at my leg: you won\xe2\x80\x99t find\r\nmuch iron on it\xe2\x80\x94if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made the discovery that _he_ was here. Let\r\n_him_ go free? Let _him_ profit by the means as I found out? Let _him_\r\nmake a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had\r\ndied at the bottom there,\xe2\x80\x9d and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch\r\nwith his manacled hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have held to him with that grip, that you\r\nshould have been safe to find him in my hold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his\r\ncompanion, repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cHe tried to murder me. I should have been a dead\r\nman if you had not come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lies!\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, with fierce energy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a liar born, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it written there? Let him\r\nturn those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not,\r\nhowever, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set\r\nexpression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and\r\nat the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued my convict. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see what a villain he is?\r\nDo you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That\xe2\x80\x99s how he looked\r\nwhen we were tried together. He never looked at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes\r\nrestlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment\r\non the speaker, with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not much to look at,\xe2\x80\x9d and with\r\na half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict\r\nbecame so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him\r\nbut for the interposition of the soldiers. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe other convict then, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he would murder me, if he could?\xe2\x80\x9d And any\r\none could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon\r\nhis lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of this parley,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cLight those torches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went\r\ndown on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first\r\ntime, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe\xe2\x80\x99s back on the brink of the\r\nditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly\r\nwhen he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I\r\nhad been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my\r\ninnocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\r\nmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it\r\nall passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a\r\nday, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having\r\nbeen more attentive.\r\n\r\nThe soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four\r\ntorches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been\r\nalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\r\nvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\r\na ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches\r\nkindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the\r\nopposite bank of the river. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cMarch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\r\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are expected\r\non board,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant to my convict; \xe2\x80\x9cthey know you are coming.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t straggle, my man. Close up here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate\r\nguard. I had hold of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hand now, and Joe carried one of the\r\ntorches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to\r\nsee it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good\r\npath now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and\r\nthere where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy\r\nsluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming\r\nin after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon\r\nthe track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I\r\ncould see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air\r\nabout us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather\r\nto like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We\r\ncould not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,\r\nthat two or three times we had to halt while they rested.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\r\nand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\r\nand the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\r\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a\r\nstand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\r\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a\r\ndozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in\r\ntheir great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their\r\nheads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant\r\nmade some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the\r\nconvict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,\r\nto go on board first.\r\n\r\nMy convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the\r\nhut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up\r\nhis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if\r\nhe pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the\r\nsergeant, and remarked,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some\r\npersons laying under suspicion alonger me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can say what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant, standing coolly\r\nlooking at him with his arms folded, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you have no call to say it\r\nhere. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about\r\nit, before it\xe2\x80\x99s done with, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstarve; at least _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t. I took some wittles, up at the willage over\r\nyonder,\xe2\x80\x94where the church stands a\xe2\x80\x99most out on the marshes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean stole,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where from. From the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, staring at Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, staring at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was some broken wittles\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was\xe2\x80\x94and a dram of liquor,\r\nand a pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nthe sergeant, confidentially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know,\r\nPip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and\r\nwithout the least glance at me,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso you\xe2\x80\x99re the blacksmith, are you?\r\nThan I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say, I\xe2\x80\x99ve eat your pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to it,\xe2\x80\x94so far as it was ever mine,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\r\nhave done, but we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have you starved to death for it, poor\r\nmiserable fellow-creatur.\xe2\x80\x94Would us, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man\xe2\x80\x99s throat\r\nagain, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard\r\nwere ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough\r\nstakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a\r\ncrew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or\r\ninterested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or\r\nspoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive way, you!\xe2\x80\x9d which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the\r\nlight of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from\r\nthe mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark. Cribbed and barred and\r\nmoored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes\r\nto be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we\r\nsaw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches\r\nwere flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so\r\nunexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I\r\nhope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nI do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference\r\nto Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I\r\nloved Joe,\xe2\x80\x94perhaps for no better reason in those early days than\r\nbecause the dear fellow let me love him,\xe2\x80\x94and, as to him, my inner self\r\nwas not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when\r\nI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe\r\nthe whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted\r\nthat if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at\r\nnight staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up\r\nmy tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I\r\nnever afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair\r\nwhisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe\r\nknew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meat or pudding when it came on to-day\xe2\x80\x99s table, without\r\nthinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That,\r\nif Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life\r\nremarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he\r\nsuspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word,\r\nI was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too\r\ncowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had no\r\nintercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its\r\nmany inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an untaught genius, I\r\nmade the discovery of the line of action for myself.\r\n\r\nAs I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took\r\nme on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome\r\njourney of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad\r\ntemper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have\r\nexcommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In\r\nhis lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an\r\ninsane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the\r\nkitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have\r\nhanged him, if it had been a capital offence.\r\n\r\nBy that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little\r\ndrunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through\r\nhaving been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and\r\nnoise of tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump\r\nbetween the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation \xe2\x80\x9cYah! Was there\r\never such a boy as this!\xe2\x80\x9d from my sister,) I found Joe telling them\r\nabout the convict\xe2\x80\x99s confession, and all the visitors suggesting\r\ndifferent ways by which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook\r\nmade out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he had first got\r\nupon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the\r\nhouse, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made\r\nof his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very\r\npositive and drove his own chaise-cart\xe2\x80\x94over everybody\xe2\x80\x94it was agreed\r\nthat it must be so. Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\nthe feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat\r\non, he was unanimously set at naught,\xe2\x80\x94not to mention his smoking hard\r\nbehind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp\r\nout: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.\r\n\r\nThis was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a\r\nslumberous offence to the company\xe2\x80\x99s eyesight, and assisted me up to bed\r\nwith such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be\r\ndangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as\r\nI have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted\r\nlong after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned\r\nsaving on exceptional occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family\r\ntombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My\r\nconstruction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I\r\nread \xe2\x80\x9cwife of the Above\xe2\x80\x9d as a complimentary reference to my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations\r\nhad been referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cBelow,\xe2\x80\x9d I have no doubt I should have formed\r\nthe worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my\r\nnotions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at\r\nall accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my\r\ndeclaration that I was to \xe2\x80\x9cwalk in the same all the days of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlaid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our\r\nhouse in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down\r\nby the wheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s or up by the mill.\r\n\r\nWhen I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I\r\ncould assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPompeyed,\xe2\x80\x9d or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only\r\nodd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an extra\r\nboy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was\r\nfavoured with the employment. In order, however, that our superior\r\nposition might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the\r\nkitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all my\r\nearnings were dropped. I have an impression that they were to be\r\ncontributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt,\r\nbut I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is\r\nto say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited\r\ninfirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in\r\nthe society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the\r\nimproving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage,\r\nand Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to\r\noverhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and\r\noccasionally bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr.\r\nWopsle \xe2\x80\x9cexamined\xe2\x80\x9d the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those\r\noccasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark\r\nAntony\xe2\x80\x99s oration over the body of Caesar. This was always followed by\r\nCollins\xe2\x80\x99s Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr.\r\nWopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and\r\ntaking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not\r\nwith me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of\r\nthe Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the\r\ndisadvantage of both gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,\r\nkept in the same room\xe2\x80\x94a little general shop. She had no idea what stock\r\nshe had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a\r\nlittle greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a\r\nCatalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop\r\ntransactions. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter; I\r\nconfess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what\r\nrelation she was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me,\r\ntoo, had been brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought,\r\nin respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing,\r\nher hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending\r\nand pulling up at heel. This description must be received with a\r\nweek-day limitation. On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.\r\n\r\nMuch of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.\r\nWopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been\r\na bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every\r\nletter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who\r\nseemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and\r\nbaffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to\r\nread, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.\r\n\r\nOne night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending\r\ngreat efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must\r\nhave been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a\r\nlong time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet\r\non the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two\r\nto print and smear this epistle:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE\r\nU JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN\r\nBLEVE ME INF XN PIP.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by\r\nletter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered\r\nthis written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe\r\nreceived it as a miracle of erudition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Pip, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a\r\nscholar you are! An\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, glancing at the slate as he held it;\r\nwith a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here\xe2\x80\x99s a J,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand a O equal to anythink! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a J and\r\na O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this\r\nmonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I\r\naccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit\r\nhis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to\r\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I\r\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! But read the\r\nrest, Jo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rest, eh, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching\r\neye, \xe2\x80\x9cOne, two, three. Why, here\xe2\x80\x99s three Js, and three Os, and three\r\nJ-O, Joes in it, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the\r\nwhole letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, when I had finished. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE a scholar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you spell Gargery, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him, with a modest patronage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t spell it at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut supposing you did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ be supposed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cTho\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m uncommon fond of reading,\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn-common. Give me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9ca good book, or a good newspaper, and\r\nsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, after rubbing his knees a little, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you _do_ come to a J\r\nand a O, and says you, \xe2\x80\x98Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 how interesting\r\nreading is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI derived from this, that Joe\xe2\x80\x99s education, like Steam, was yet in its\r\ninfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his\r\nusual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire\r\nbetween the lower bars; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given\r\nto drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my\r\nmother, most onmerciful. It were a\xe2\x80\x99most the only hammering he did,\r\nindeed, \xe2\x80\x99xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to\r\nbe equalled by the wigor with which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hammer at his\r\nanwil.\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re a listening and understanding, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\r\ntimes; and then my mother she\xe2\x80\x99d go out to work, and she\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cJoe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cnow, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abear to be without us. So, he\xe2\x80\x99d come with a most\r\ntremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where\r\nwe was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us\r\nand to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.\r\nWhich, you see, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the\r\nfire, and looking at me, \xe2\x80\x9cwere a drawback on my learning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, poor Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough mind you, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the\r\npoker on the top bar, \xe2\x80\x9crendering unto all their doo, and maintaining\r\nequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his\r\nhart, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d Joe pursued, \xe2\x80\x9csomebody must keep the pot a-biling, Pip, or the\r\npot won\xe2\x80\x99t bile, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw that, and said so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsequence, my father didn\xe2\x80\x99t make objections to my going to work; so\r\nI went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he would\r\nhave followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure _you_, Pip. In\r\ntime I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a\r\npurple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his\r\ntombstone that, Whatsume\xe2\x80\x99er the failings on his part, Remember reader\r\nhe were that good in his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful\r\nperspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cmy own self. I made it in a moment. It was like\r\nstriking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so\r\nmuch surprised in all my life,\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t credit my own ed,\xe2\x80\x94to tell you\r\nthe truth, hardly believed it _were_ my own ed. As I was saying, Pip,\r\nit were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs\r\nmoney, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not\r\nto mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for\r\nmy mother. She were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren\xe2\x80\x99t long of\r\nfollowing, poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them,\r\nand then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner,\r\nwith the round knob on the top of the poker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were but lonesome then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cliving here alone, and I got\r\nacquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Joe looked firmly at me as if\r\nhe knew I was not going to agree with him;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyour sister is a fine\r\nfigure of a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever family opinions, or whatever the world\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, on that\r\nsubject may be, Pip, your sister is,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe tapped the top bar with the\r\npoker after every word following, \xe2\x80\x9ca-fine-figure\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could think of nothing better to say than \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you think so,\r\nJoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, catching me up. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ am glad I think so, Pip.\r\nA little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does\r\nit signify to Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sagaciously observed, if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t signify to him, to whom did it\r\nsignify?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d assented Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, old chap! When I\r\ngot acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing\r\nyou up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,\r\nalong with all the folks. As to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe pursued with a countenance\r\nexpressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cif you could have\r\nbeen aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nformed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot exactly relishing this, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind me, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did mind you, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned with tender simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\r\noffered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at\r\nsuch times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x98And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to your sister, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s room for _him_ at the forge!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:\r\nwho dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, \xe2\x80\x9cEver the best of friends;\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99t us, Pip? Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, Pip, and here we are! That\xe2\x80\x99s about where it lights;\r\nhere we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I\r\ntell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee too much of what we\xe2\x80\x99re up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the\r\nsly. And why on the sly? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could\r\nhave proceeded in his demonstration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister is given to government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven to government, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea\r\n(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a\r\nfavour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven to government,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay the government of\r\nyou and myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she an\xe2\x80\x99t over partial to having scholars on the premises,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cand in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\r\nscholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhen Joe stopped me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay a bit. I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down\r\nupon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,\r\nPip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, \xe2\x80\x9ccandour\r\ncompels fur to admit that she is a Buster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital\r\nBs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,\r\nPip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might\r\nfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that\r\nplacid occupation; \xe2\x80\x9cyour sister\xe2\x80\x99s a master-mind. A master-mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But\r\nJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely\r\nstopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a master-mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,\r\nand got back to his whisker. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd last of all, Pip,\xe2\x80\x94and this I want to\r\nsay very serious to you, old chap,\xe2\x80\x94I see so much in my poor mother, of\r\na woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\r\ngetting no peace in her mortal days, that I\xe2\x80\x99m dead afeerd of going\r\nwrong in the way of not doing what\xe2\x80\x99s right by a woman, and I\xe2\x80\x99d fur\r\nrather of the two go wrong the t\xe2\x80\x99other way, and be a little\r\nill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I\r\nwish there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it\r\nall on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and\r\nI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll overlook shortcomings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from\r\nthat night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,\r\nafterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about\r\nhim, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up\r\nto Joe in my heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nDutch-clock a-working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nand she\xe2\x80\x99s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s mare mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave set a forefoot on a piece o\xe2\x80\x99 ice, and gone down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,\r\nto assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no\r\nconfidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe\r\nwas out on one of these expeditions.\r\n\r\nJoe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to\r\nlisten for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew\r\nkeenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of\r\nlying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars,\r\nand considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to\r\nthem as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the\r\nglittering multitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes the mare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cringing like a peal of bells!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as\r\nshe came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out,\r\nready for Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might\r\nsee a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that\r\nnothing might be out of its place. When we had completed these\r\npreparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon\r\nlanded, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with\r\na cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air\r\nin with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and\r\nthrowing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif this boy ain\xe2\x80\x99t grateful this night, he never will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly\r\nuninformed why he ought to assume that expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only to be hoped,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he won\xe2\x80\x99t be Pompeyed.\r\nBut I have my fears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ain\xe2\x80\x99t in that line, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe looked at me, making the motion with _his_ lips and\r\neyebrows, \xe2\x80\x9cShe?\xe2\x80\x9d My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of\r\nhis hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such\r\noccasions, and looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, in her snappish way. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you staring at?\r\nIs the house afire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Which some individual,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe politely hinted, \xe2\x80\x9cmentioned\xe2\x80\x94she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is a she, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you call Miss\r\nHavisham a he. And I doubt if even you\xe2\x80\x99ll go so far as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham, up town?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any Miss Havisham down town?\xe2\x80\x9d returned my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he\xe2\x80\x99s going. And\r\nhe had better play there,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, shaking her head at me as an\r\nencouragement to be extremely light and sportive, \xe2\x80\x9cor I\xe2\x80\x99ll work him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had heard of Miss Havisham up town,\xe2\x80\x94everybody for miles round had\r\nheard of Miss Havisham up town,\xe2\x80\x94as an immensely rich and grim lady who\r\nlived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who\r\nled a life of seclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, astounded. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder how she come to know\r\nPip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoodle!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said she knew him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Which some individual,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe again politely hinted, \xe2\x80\x9cmentioned that\r\nshe wanted him to go and play there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and\r\nplay there? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be\r\na tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes\xe2\x80\x94we won\xe2\x80\x99t say quarterly or\r\nhalf-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94go there to pay his rent? And couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she then ask Uncle\r\nPumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nUncle Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94though you may not think it, Joseph,\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone of the deepest\r\nreproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, \xe2\x80\x9cthen mention this\r\nboy, standing Prancing here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which I solemnly declare I was not\r\ndoing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat I have for ever been a willing slave to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood again!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Uncle Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cWell put! Prettily pointed!\r\nGood indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Joseph,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe\r\napologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou do not yet\xe2\x80\x94though you may not think it\xe2\x80\x94know the case. You may\r\nconsider that you do, but you do _not_, Joseph. For you do not know\r\nthat Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell,\r\nthis boy\xe2\x80\x99s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, has\r\noffered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to\r\nkeep him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister,\r\ncasting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, \xe2\x80\x9chere I stand talking to\r\nmere Mooncalfs, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching\r\ncold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair\r\nof his head to the sole of his foot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face\r\nwas squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps\r\nof water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and\r\nthumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside\r\nmyself. (I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better\r\nacquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a\r\nwedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)\r\n\r\nWhen my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the\r\nstiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was\r\ntrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered\r\nover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the\r\nSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been\r\ndying to make all along: \xe2\x80\x9cBoy, be forever grateful to all friends, but\r\nespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, Pip, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what\r\nwith soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart. But\r\nthey twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the\r\nquestions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and what\r\non earth I was expected to play at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s premises in the High Street of the market town, were\r\nof a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a\r\ncornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be\r\na very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;\r\nand I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and\r\nsaw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds\r\nand bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\r\nspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\r\nan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\r\nbedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\r\neyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\r\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\r\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about the\r\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and\r\nflavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I\r\nhardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for\r\nnoticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by\r\nlooking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact\r\n_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to\r\nget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating\r\nthe baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,\r\nwho stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always\r\nporing over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and\r\nalways inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the\r\nglass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the\r\nHigh Street whose trade engaged his attention.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the parlour\r\nbehind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of\r\nbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered\r\nMr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be\r\nimparted to my diet,\xe2\x80\x94besides giving me as much crumb as possible in\r\ncombination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm\r\nwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the\r\nmilk out altogether,\xe2\x80\x94his conversation consisted of nothing but\r\narithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,\r\npompously, \xe2\x80\x9cSeven times nine, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d And how should _I_ be able to\r\nanswer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I\r\nwas hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum\r\nthat lasted all through the breakfast. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd four?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\neight?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd six?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd two?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd ten?\xe2\x80\x9d And so on. And after each\r\nfigure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a\r\nsup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,\r\nand eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)\r\na gorging and gormandizing manner.\r\n\r\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock came and we started\r\nfor Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the\r\nmanner in which I should acquit myself under that lady\xe2\x80\x99s roof. Within a\r\nquarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s house, which was of old\r\nbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the\r\nwindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were\r\nrustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so\r\nwe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to\r\nopen it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.\r\nPumblechook said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd fourteen?\xe2\x80\x9d but I pretended not to hear him), and\r\nsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing\r\nwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA window was raised, and a clear voice demanded \xe2\x80\x9cWhat name?\xe2\x80\x9d To which\r\nmy conductor replied, \xe2\x80\x9cPumblechook.\xe2\x80\x9d The voice returned, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the\r\ncourt-yard, with keys in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cis Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Pip, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\r\nseemed very proud; \xe2\x80\x9ccome in, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you wish to see Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss Havisham wished to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook,\r\ndiscomfited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you see she don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\r\nPumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\r\nprotest. But he eyed me severely,\xe2\x80\x94as if _I_ had done anything to\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x94and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: \xe2\x80\x9cBoy! Let\r\nyour behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by\r\nhand!\xe2\x80\x9d I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to\r\npropound through the gate, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd sixteen?\xe2\x80\x9d But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nMy young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.\r\nIt was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The\r\nbrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the\r\nwooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood\r\nopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.\r\nThe cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it\r\nmade a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\r\nbrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.\r\n\r\nShe saw me looking at it, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou could drink without hurt\r\nall the strong beer that\xe2\x80\x99s brewed there now, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think I could, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in a shy way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like it, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that anybody means to try,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that\xe2\x80\x99s all done with,\r\nand the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong\r\nbeer, there\xe2\x80\x99s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor\r\nHouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the name of this house, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of its names, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has more than one, then, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or\r\nHebrew, or all three\xe2\x80\x94or all one to me\xe2\x80\x94for enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough House,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a curious name, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it meant more than it said. It meant, when it\r\nwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They\r\nmust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t loiter, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough she called me \xe2\x80\x9cboy\xe2\x80\x9d so often, and with a carelessness that was\r\nfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much\r\nolder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and\r\nself-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been\r\none-and-twenty, and a queen.\r\n\r\nWe went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two\r\nchains across it outside,\xe2\x80\x94and the first thing I noticed was, that the\r\npassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.\r\nShe took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,\r\nand still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to the door of a room, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cGo in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, more in shyness than politeness, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter you, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this she returned: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd scornfully walked away, and\xe2\x80\x94what was worse\xe2\x80\x94took the candle with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThis was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only\r\nthing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\r\nfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a\r\npretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of\r\ndaylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed\r\nfrom the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite\r\nunknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded\r\nlooking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing-table.\r\n\r\nWhether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\r\nfine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow\r\nresting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\r\nstrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in rich materials,\xe2\x80\x94satins, and lace, and silks,\xe2\x80\x94all of\r\nwhite. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\r\nfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\r\nwhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\r\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\r\nthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\r\nShe had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nother was on the table near her hand,\xe2\x80\x94her veil was but half arranged,\r\nher watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay\r\nwith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some\r\nflowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the\r\nlooking-glass.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though\r\nI saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I\r\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\r\nwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\r\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\r\nlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\r\nsunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\r\nof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\r\nshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\r\nwaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\r\nlying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\r\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\r\na vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\r\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if\r\nI could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady at the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s boy, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Come\xe2\x80\x94to play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome nearer; let me look at you. Come close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of\r\nthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped\r\nat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at\r\ntwenty minutes to nine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not afraid of a woman who\r\nhas never seen the sun since you were born?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\r\ncomprehended in the answer \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I touch here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laying her hands, one upon\r\nthe other, on her left side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d (It made me think of the young man.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I touch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBroken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and\r\nwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept\r\nher hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if\r\nthey were heavy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am tired,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cI want diversion, and I have done\r\nwith men and women. Play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she\r\ncould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the\r\nwide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes have sick fancies,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have a sick fancy\r\nthat I want to see some play. There, there!\xe2\x80\x9d with an impatient movement\r\nof the fingers of her right hand; \xe2\x80\x9cplay, play, play!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment, with the fear of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s working me before my eyes, I\r\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed\r\ncharacter of Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s chaise-cart. But I felt myself so\r\nunequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss\r\nHavisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as\r\nshe said, when we had taken a good look at each other,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sullen and obstinate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can\xe2\x80\x99t play just\r\nnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\r\nI would do it if I could; but it\xe2\x80\x99s so new here, and so strange, and so\r\nfine,\xe2\x80\x94and melancholy\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had\r\nalready said it, and we took another look at each other.\r\n\r\nBefore she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\r\ndress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in\r\nthe looking-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo new to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cso old to me; so strange to him, so\r\nfamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she\r\nwas still talking to herself, and kept quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall Estella,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, flashing a look at me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can do that.\r\nCall Estella. At the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\r\nbawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor\r\nresponsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,\r\nwas almost as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and\r\nher light came along the dark passage like a star.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\r\ntable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\r\npretty brown hair. \xe2\x80\x9cYour own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\r\nwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this boy? Why, he is a common labouring-boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,\xe2\x80\x94only it seemed so\r\nunlikely,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell? You can break his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you play, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Estella of myself, with the greatest\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeggar him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.\r\n\r\nIt was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\r\nstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\r\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\r\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the\r\ndressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now\r\nyellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the\r\nshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now\r\nyellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,\r\nthis standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the\r\nwithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like\r\ngrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.\r\n\r\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\r\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew\r\nnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies\r\nburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being\r\ndistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have\r\nlooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have\r\nstruck her to dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella with disdain,\r\nbefore our first game was out. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what coarse hands he has! And what\r\nthick boots!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to\r\nconsider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\r\nstrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\r\n\r\nShe won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\r\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\r\na stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say nothing of her,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What\r\ndo you think of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say,\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me in my ear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, bending down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she is very proud,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she is very pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she is very insulting.\xe2\x80\x9d (She was looking at me then with a\r\nlook of supreme aversion.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should like to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd never see her again, though she is so pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to see her again, but I should\r\nlike to go home now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall go soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cPlay the game out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure\r\nthat Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s face could not smile. It had dropped into a\r\nwatchful and brooding expression,\xe2\x80\x94most likely when all the things about\r\nher had become transfixed,\xe2\x80\x94and it looked as if nothing could ever lift\r\nit up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice\r\nhad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;\r\naltogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,\r\nwithin and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.\r\n\r\nI played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She\r\nthrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she\r\ndespised them for having been won of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall I have you here again?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she\r\nchecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of\r\nweeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him\r\nroam and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she\r\nstood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the side\r\nentrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must\r\nnecessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded\r\nme, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange\r\nroom many hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to wait here, you boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella; and disappeared and\r\nclosed the door.\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\r\ncoarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was\r\nnot favourable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me\r\nnow, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever\r\ntaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called\r\nknaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and\r\nthen I should have been so too.\r\n\r\nShe came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She\r\nput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and\r\nmeat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in\r\ndisgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncannot hit upon the right name for the smart\xe2\x80\x94God knows what its name\r\nwas,\xe2\x80\x94that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the\r\ngirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of\r\nthem. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she\r\ngave a contemptuous toss\xe2\x80\x94but with a sense, I thought, of having made\r\ntoo sure that I was so wounded\xe2\x80\x94and left me.\r\n\r\nBut when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\r\nin, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\r\nsleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\r\nAs I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\r\nbitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,\r\nthat needed counteraction.\r\n\r\nMy sister\xe2\x80\x99s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\r\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\r\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\r\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is\r\nsmall, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\r\nhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\r\nmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\r\ninjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\r\nsister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\r\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave\r\nher no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,\r\ndisgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had\r\nnursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a\r\nsolitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was\r\nmorally timid and very sensitive.\r\n\r\nI got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\r\nbrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\r\nface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\r\nwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\r\nin spirits to look about me.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\r\nbrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\r\nwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\r\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no\r\npigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,\r\nno malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper\r\nor the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have\r\nevaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a\r\nwilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of\r\nbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as\r\na sample of the beer that was gone,\xe2\x80\x94and in this respect I remember\r\nthose recluses as being like most others.\r\n\r\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\r\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\r\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\r\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\r\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes\r\nwalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But\r\nshe seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation\r\npresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking\r\non them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,\r\nand held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never\r\nlooked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery\r\nitself,\xe2\x80\x94by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used\r\nto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I\r\nfirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the\r\ndoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and\r\nascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,\r\nas if she were going out into the sky.\r\n\r\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\r\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\r\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes\xe2\x80\x94a little dimmed by\r\nlooking up at the frosty light\xe2\x80\x94towards a great wooden beam in a low\r\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\r\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one\r\nshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\r\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\r\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and\r\nin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\r\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\r\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.\r\n\r\nNothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of\r\npeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving\r\ninfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have\r\nbrought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself\r\nas soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to\r\nlet me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\r\nthought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\r\n\r\nShe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\r\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\r\ngate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,\r\nwhen she touched me with a taunting hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you cry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been crying till you are half blind, and\r\nyou are near crying again now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.\r\nI went straight to Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, and was immensely relieved to\r\nfind him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I\r\nwas wanted at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to\r\nour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply\r\nrevolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;\r\nthat my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of\r\ncalling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had\r\nconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived\r\nbad way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself\r\ngetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the\r\nsmall of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the\r\nkitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nIf a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other\r\nyoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden\r\nin mine,\xe2\x80\x94which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to\r\nsuspect myself of having been a monstrosity,\xe2\x80\x94it is the key to many\r\nreservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nmy eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I\r\nfelt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and\r\nalthough she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an\r\nimpression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my\r\ndragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before\r\nthe contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I\r\ncould, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by\r\na devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came\r\ngaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details\r\ndivulged to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes\r\nand mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat\r\nheaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the\r\nchair of honour by the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get on up town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, \xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and my sister shook her fist at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty well is no answer.\r\nTell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\r\nperhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my\r\nobstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered\r\nas if I had discovered a new idea, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean pretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,\xe2\x80\x94when Mr.\r\nPumblechook interposed with \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Don\xe2\x80\x99t lose your temper. Leave this lad\r\nto me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; leave this lad to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook then turned me\r\ntowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI calculated the consequences of replying \xe2\x80\x9cFour Hundred Pound,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\nsomewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\r\npence-table from \xe2\x80\x9ctwelve pence make one shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d up to \xe2\x80\x9cforty pence\r\nmake three and fourpence,\xe2\x80\x9d and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\r\ndone for me, \xe2\x80\x9c_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?\xe2\x80\x9d To which I\r\nreplied, after a long interval of reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d And I was\r\nso aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIs forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\r\ninstance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was\r\nhighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and\r\nbrought him to a dead stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy! What like is Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook began again when he\r\nhad recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\r\nscrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery tall and dark,\xe2\x80\x9d I told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my sister.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he\r\nhad never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way to have\r\nhim! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had him always; you\r\nknow so well how to deal with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, boy! What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr.\r\nPumblechook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was sitting,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cin a black velvet coach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another\xe2\x80\x94as they well\r\nmight\xe2\x80\x94and both repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cIn a black velvet coach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Miss Estella\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s her niece, I think\xe2\x80\x94handed her\r\nin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had\r\ncake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat\r\nmine, because she told me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas anybody else there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarge or small?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmense,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver\r\nbasket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\r\namazement. I was perfectly frantic,\xe2\x80\x94a reckless witness under the\r\ntorture,\xe2\x80\x94and would have told them anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d They stared again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nhorses to it.\xe2\x80\x9d I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\r\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\r\nharnessing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan this be possible, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can the boy mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsedan-chair. She\xe2\x80\x99s flighty, you know,\xe2\x80\x94very flighty,\xe2\x80\x94quite flighty\r\nenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see her in it, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, forced to the admission, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I never see\r\nher in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when I have\r\nbeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the\r\ndoor has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know _that_, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did\r\nyou play at, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe played with flags,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. (I beg to observe that I think of\r\nmyself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlags!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cEstella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\r\nMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\r\nat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwords!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get swords from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of a cupboard,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I saw pistols in it,\xe2\x80\x94and jam,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\npills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\r\nwith candles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nstate of the case, for that much I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen myself.\xe2\x80\x9d And then they both\r\nstared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\r\ncountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\r\nwith my right hand.\r\n\r\nIf they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\r\nbetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\r\nthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\r\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\r\nin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\r\nmarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I\r\nescaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to\r\nhave a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own\r\nmind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nNow, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\r\nkitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only\r\nas regarded him,\xe2\x80\x94not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\r\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\r\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x9d for me; their doubts related to the form that something\r\nwould take. My sister stood out for \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook was in\r\nfavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel\r\ntrade,\xe2\x80\x94say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the\r\ndeepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I\r\nmight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the\r\nveal-cutlets. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a fool\xe2\x80\x99s head can\xe2\x80\x99t express better opinions than\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, \xe2\x80\x9cand you have got any work to do, you had better\r\ngo and do it.\xe2\x80\x9d So he went.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing\r\nup, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had\r\ndone for the night. Then I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the fire goes out, Joe, I\r\nshould like to tell you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell us. What is it, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\r\nit between my finger and thumb, \xe2\x80\x9cyou remember all that about Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you! Wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you telling of, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\r\namazement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I do; it\xe2\x80\x99s lies, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not all of it? Why sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, Pip, that there was\r\nno black welwet co\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d For, I stood shaking my head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut at least\r\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, persuasively, \xe2\x80\x9cif there\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dog?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cA puppy? Come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, old chap! This won\xe2\x80\x99t do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect\r\nto go to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s terrible, Joe; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerrible?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cAwful! What possessed you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what possessed me, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, letting his shirt\r\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\r\nwish my boots weren\xe2\x80\x99t so thick nor my hands so coarse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\r\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that\r\nI knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the\r\nlies had come of it somehow, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\r\n\r\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\r\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\r\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, after some\r\nrumination, \xe2\x80\x9cnamely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\r\nthe same. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell no more of \xe2\x80\x99em, Pip. _That_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t the way to\r\nget out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You\xe2\x80\x99re oncommon\r\nsmall. Likewise you\xe2\x80\x99re a oncommon scholar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen letters\xe2\x80\x94Ah! and from gentlefolks!\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear weren\xe2\x80\x99t wrote in\r\nprint,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cbe it so or be it son\xe2\x80\x99t, you must be a common\r\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\r\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can\xe2\x80\x99t sit and write his acts of\r\nParliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\r\nPrince, with the alphabet.\xe2\x80\x94Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d added Joe, with a shake of the head\r\nthat was full of meaning, \xe2\x80\x9cand begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\r\nAnd _I_ know what that is to do, though I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99ve exactly done\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether common ones as to callings and earnings,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Joe,\r\nreflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cmightn\xe2\x80\x99t be the better of continuing for to keep company\r\nwith common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\r\nones,\xe2\x80\x94which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c(I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry there weren\xe2\x80\x99t a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t be, is a thing as can\xe2\x80\x99t be looked into now, without putting\r\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that\xe2\x80\x99s a thing not to be thought of as\r\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\r\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get to\r\nbe oncommon through going straight, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get to do it through\r\ngoing crooked. So don\xe2\x80\x99t tell no more on \xe2\x80\x99em, Pip, and live well and die\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not angry with me, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of\r\na stunning and outdacious sort,\xe2\x80\x94alluding to them which bordered on\r\nweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,\xe2\x80\x94a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,\r\ntheir being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all, old chap, and don\xe2\x80\x99t never do it no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and\r\nunthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common\r\nEstella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and\r\nhow coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting\r\nin the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how\r\nMiss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above\r\nthe level of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I \xe2\x80\x9cused\r\nto do\xe2\x80\x9d when I was at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s; as though I had been there weeks\r\nor months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject\r\nof remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.\r\n\r\nThat was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it\r\nis the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,\r\nand think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read\r\nthis, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of\r\nthorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the\r\nformation of the first link on one memorable day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,\r\nthat the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to\r\nget out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous\r\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to\r\nget on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she\r\nwould impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging\r\nof girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her\r\npromise within five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\r\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and\r\nput straws down one another\xe2\x80\x99s backs, until Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\r\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\r\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,\r\nthe pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand\r\nto hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a\r\nlittle spelling,\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\r\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt fell into a state of\r\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils\r\nthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\r\nsubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\r\nhardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a\r\nrush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they\r\nhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more\r\nillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have\r\nsince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various\r\nspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part\r\nof the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between\r\nBiddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave\r\nout the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nwhat we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,\r\nshrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or\r\nreverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had\r\nlasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt,\r\nwho staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was\r\nunderstood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into\r\nthe air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that\r\nthere was no prohibition against any pupil\xe2\x80\x99s entertaining himself with\r\na slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not\r\neasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of\r\nthe little general shop in which the classes were holden\xe2\x80\x94and which was\r\nalso Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room and bedchamber\xe2\x80\x94being but\r\nfaintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle\r\nand no snuffers.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under\r\nthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very\r\nevening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some\r\ninformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of\r\nmoist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D\r\nwhich she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I\r\nsupposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.\r\n\r\nOf course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe\r\nliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders\r\nfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that\r\nevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the\r\nThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.\r\n\r\nThere was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk\r\nscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to\r\nbe never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and\r\nhad grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our\r\ncountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\r\nto account.\r\n\r\nIt being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at\r\nthese records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I\r\nmerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the\r\nend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and\r\nwhere Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\r\nstranger. Joe greeted me as usual with \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Pip, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nmoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\r\n\r\nHe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\r\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\r\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\r\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\r\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\r\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\r\ndown there.\r\n\r\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\r\nresort, I said \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and fell into the space Joe made\r\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\r\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\r\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg\xe2\x80\x94in a very odd way, as\r\nit struck me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange man, turning to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you was a\r\nblacksmith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I said it, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you drink, Mr.\xe2\x80\x94? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention your name, by the bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nyou drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell you the truth, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t much in the habit of\r\ndrinking at anybody\xe2\x80\x99s expense but my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHabit? No,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cbut once and away, and on a\r\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be stiff company,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cRum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRum,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd will the other gentleman originate a\r\nsentiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree Rums!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cGlasses\r\nround!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis other gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his\r\nlegs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\r\nbroad-brimmed traveller\xe2\x80\x99s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over\r\nhis head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he\r\nlooked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\r\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\r\nsolitary country towards the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost marshes is solitary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\r\nvagrants of any sort, out there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cnone but a runaway convict now and then. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\r\nbut not warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeems you have been out after such?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that we wanted to take them, you understand;\r\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t us,\r\nPip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked at me again,\xe2\x80\x94still cocking his eye, as if he were\r\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,\xe2\x80\x94and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristened Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not christened Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurname Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\r\ninfant, and is called by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSon of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\r\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\r\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\r\ndiscussed over pipes,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwell\xe2\x80\x94no. No, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevvy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nis not\xe2\x80\x94no, not to deceive you, he is _not_\xe2\x80\x94my nevvy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the Blue Blazes is he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\r\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about\r\nrelationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female\r\nrelations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and\r\nJoe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most\r\nterrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to\r\nthink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nthe poet says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he\r\nconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and\r\npoke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing\r\nwho visited at our house should always have put me through the same\r\ninflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to\r\nmind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our\r\nsocial family circle, but some large-handed person took some such\r\nophthalmic steps to patronise me.\r\n\r\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\r\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\r\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\r\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\r\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\r\n\r\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\r\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at\r\nme, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it\r\nand he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a\r\nfile_.\r\n\r\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\r\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfile, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\r\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on\r\nhis settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally\r\nabout turnips.\r\n\r\nThere was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause\r\nbefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,\r\nwhich stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on\r\nSaturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water\r\nrunning out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange man. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the\r\nboy shall have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some\r\ncrumpled paper, and gave it to me. \xe2\x80\x9cYours!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cMind! Your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,\r\nand holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.\r\nWopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look\r\nwith his aiming eye,\xe2\x80\x94no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may\r\nbe done with an eye by hiding it.\r\n\r\nOn the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk must\r\nhave been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of\r\nthe Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide\r\nopen, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in a\r\nmanner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old\r\nacquaintance, and could think of nothing else.\r\n\r\nMy sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in\r\nthe kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to\r\ntell her about the bright shilling. \xe2\x80\x9cA bad un, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Joe triumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9cor he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given it to the boy! Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlook at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the\r\npaper. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo One-Pound notes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to\r\nhave been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets\r\nin the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the\r\nJolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat\r\ndown on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty\r\nsure that the man would not be there.\r\n\r\nPresently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,\r\nJoe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.\r\nThen my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under\r\nsome dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in\r\nthe state parlour. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and\r\nmany a night and day.\r\n\r\nI had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the\r\nstrange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the\r\nguiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of\r\nconspiracy with convicts,\xe2\x80\x94a feature in my low career that I had\r\npreviously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed\r\nme that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed\r\nmyself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, next Wednesday; and in\r\nmy sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who\r\nheld it, and I screamed myself awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and my hesitating\r\nring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting me,\r\nas she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage\r\nwhere her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the\r\ncandle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to come this way to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d and took me to quite another\r\npart of the house.\r\n\r\nThe passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square\r\nbasement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,\r\nhowever, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and\r\nopened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a\r\nsmall paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a\r\ndetached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the\r\nmanager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the\r\nouter wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s room, and\r\nlike Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.\r\n\r\nWe went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a\r\nlow ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in\r\nthe room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to go and\r\nstand there boy, till you are wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x9d, being the window, I\r\ncrossed to it, and stood \xe2\x80\x9cthere,\xe2\x80\x9d in a very uncomfortable state of\r\nmind, looking out.\r\n\r\nIt opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the\r\nneglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree\r\nthat had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new\r\ngrowth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different colour, as if\r\nthat part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This\r\nwas my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been\r\nsome light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;\r\nbut, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of\r\ngarden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the\r\nwindow, as if it pelted me for coming there.\r\n\r\nI divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that\r\nits other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room\r\nexcept the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in\r\nall my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.\r\n\r\nThere were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had\r\nbeen standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me\r\nthat they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended\r\nnot to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the\r\nadmission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to\r\nbe a toady and humbug.\r\n\r\nThey all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure,\r\nand the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to\r\nrepress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\r\nme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I\r\nfound when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.\r\nIndeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had\r\nany features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s enemy but his own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be much more commendable to be somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cfar more natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin Raymond,\xe2\x80\x9d observed another lady, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are to love our\r\nneighbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSarah Pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cousin Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cif a man is not his own\r\nneighbour, who is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea!\xe2\x80\x9d But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea\r\ntoo. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\r\nemphatically, \xe2\x80\x9c_Very_ true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor soul!\xe2\x80\x9d Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been\r\nlooking at me in the mean time), \xe2\x80\x9che is so very strange! Would anyone\r\nbelieve that when Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wife died, he actually could not be induced to\r\nsee the importance of the children\xe2\x80\x99s having the deepest of trimmings to\r\ntheir mourning? \xe2\x80\x98Good Lord!\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98Camilla, what can it signify so\r\nlong as the poor bereaved little things are in black?\xe2\x80\x99 So like Matthew!\r\nThe idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood points in him, good points in him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Raymond; \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven\r\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\r\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I was obliged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI was obliged to be firm. I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.\xe2\x80\x99 I told him that,\r\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\r\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\r\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, \xe2\x80\x98Then do as you like.\xe2\x80\x99 Thank\r\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\r\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He_ paid for them, did he not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nCamilla. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\r\nwhen I wake up in the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\r\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the\r\nconversation and caused Estella to say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d On my turning\r\nround, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went\r\nout, I heard Sarah Pocket say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell I am sure! What next!\xe2\x80\x9d and Camilla\r\nadd, with indignation, \xe2\x80\x9cWas there ever such a fancy! The i-d_e_-a!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella\r\nstopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting\r\nmanner, with her face quite close to mine,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I think you are very pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I insulting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much so as you were last time,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face\r\nwith such force as she had, when I answered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou little coarse monster, what do you think of me\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you cry again, you little wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ll never cry for you again,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. Which was, I suppose,\r\nas false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for\r\nher then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going\r\nup, we met a gentleman groping his way down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom have we here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\nHe was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an\r\nexceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin\r\nin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the\r\nlight of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,\r\nand had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie down but stood up\r\nbristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were\r\ndisagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and\r\nstrong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he\r\nhad let them. He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight\r\nthen, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had\r\nthis opportunity of observing him well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy of the neighbourhood? Hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_ come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham sent for me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, biting the side of his\r\ngreat forefinger as he frowned at me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou behave yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, he released me\xe2\x80\x94which I was glad of, for his hand\r\nsmelt of scented soap\xe2\x80\x94and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether\r\nhe could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a doctor, or he\r\nwould have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much\r\ntime to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nwhere she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella\r\nleft me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham\r\ncast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, without being startled or surprised: \xe2\x80\x9cthe days have\r\nworn away, have they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. To-day is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, there!\xe2\x80\x9d with the impatient movement of her fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to know. Are you ready to play?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was obliged to answer in some confusion, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at cards again?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, with a searching look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; I could do that, if I was wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince this house strikes you old and grave, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham,\r\nimpatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cand you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\r\nfind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go into that opposite room,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, pointing at the door\r\nbehind me with her withered hand, \xe2\x80\x9cand wait there till I come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\r\nFrom that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had\r\nan airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\r\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\r\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed\r\ncolder than the clearer air,\xe2\x80\x94like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry\r\nbranches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the\r\nchamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its\r\ndarkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but\r\nevery discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and\r\ndropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a\r\ntablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the\r\nhouse and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece\r\nof some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily\r\noverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,\r\nas I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its\r\nseeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with\r\nblotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some\r\ncircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in\r\nthe spider community.\r\n\r\nI heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\r\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles\r\ntook no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a\r\nponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of\r\nhearing, and not on terms with one another.\r\n\r\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\r\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\r\nIn her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,\r\nand she looked like the Witch of the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, \xe2\x80\x9cis where\r\nI will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\r\nthere and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork\r\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think that is?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked me, again pointing with her\r\nstick; \xe2\x80\x9cthat, where those cobwebs are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t guess what it is, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\r\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, come!\r\nWalk me, walk me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\r\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\r\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\r\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\r\nPumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s chaise-cart.\r\n\r\nShe was not physically strong, and after a little time said, \xe2\x80\x9cSlower!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStill, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\r\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\r\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a\r\nwhile she said, \xe2\x80\x9cCall Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d so I went out on the landing and roared\r\nthat name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\r\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\r\nand round the room.\r\n\r\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\r\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\r\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham\r\ntwitched my shoulder, and we posted on,\xe2\x80\x94with a shame-faced\r\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Sarah Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cHow well you look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cI am yellow skin and bone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCamilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\r\nmurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear\r\nsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are _you_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\r\nCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\r\nHavisham wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\r\nobnoxious to Camilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI am as well as can be\r\nexpected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\r\nsharpness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing worth mentioning,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Camilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to make a\r\ndisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in\r\nthe night than I am quite equal to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t think of me,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery easily said!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\r\nhitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. \xe2\x80\x9cRaymond is a\r\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\r\nRaymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\r\nand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\r\nanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\r\nI should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I\r\nwish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nidea!\xe2\x80\x9d Here, a burst of tears.\r\n\r\nThe Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\r\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this\r\npoint, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, \xe2\x80\x9cCamilla, my\r\ndear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually\r\nundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than\r\nthe other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not aware,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\r\nonce, \xe2\x80\x9cthat to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\r\nperson, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\r\nold woman, with a small face that might have been made of\r\nwalnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat\xe2\x80\x99s without the whiskers,\r\nsupported this position by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, my dear. Hem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThinking is easy enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said the grave lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is easier, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\r\nrise from her legs to her bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very true! It\xe2\x80\x99s a weakness\r\nto be so affectionate, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. No doubt my health would be\r\nmuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change my disposition\r\nif I could. It\xe2\x80\x99s the cause of much suffering, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a consolation to\r\nknow I posses it, when I wake up in the night.\xe2\x80\x9d Here another burst of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\r\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\r\nvisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Matthew!\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mixing with any natural ties,\r\nnever coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa\r\nwith my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my\r\nhead over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cMuch higher than your head, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Camilla.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of\r\nMatthew\xe2\x80\x99s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally I must say I should think not!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the grave lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious\r\npersonage), \xe2\x80\x9cthe question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to\r\nthank you, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed\r\nCamilla, \xe2\x80\x9cI have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond\r\nis a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total\r\ninefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte\r\ntuner\xe2\x80\x99s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even\r\nsupposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,\xe2\x80\x94and now to be told\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHere Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical\r\nas to the formation of new combinations there.\r\n\r\nWhen this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and\r\nherself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great\r\ninfluence in bringing Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s chemistry to a sudden end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew will come and see me at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, sternly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen I am laid on that table. That will be his place,\xe2\x80\x94there,\xe2\x80\x9d striking\r\nthe table with her stick, \xe2\x80\x9cat my head! And yours will be there! And\r\nyour husband\xe2\x80\x99s there! And Sarah Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s there! And Georgiana\xe2\x80\x99s there!\r\nNow you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast\r\nupon me. And now go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in\r\na new place. She now said, \xe2\x80\x9cWalk me, walk me!\xe2\x80\x9d and we went on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Camilla, \xe2\x80\x9cbut comply\r\nand depart. It\xe2\x80\x99s something to have seen the object of one\xe2\x80\x99s love and\r\nduty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy\r\nsatisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have\r\nthat comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a\r\ndisplay of my feelings, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to be told one wants to\r\nfeast on one\xe2\x80\x99s relations,\xe2\x80\x94as if one was a Giant,\xe2\x80\x94and to be told to go.\r\nThe bare idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving\r\nbosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I\r\nsupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of\r\nview, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah\r\nPocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was\r\ntoo knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful\r\nslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah\r\nPocket then made her separate effect of departing with, \xe2\x80\x9cBless you,\r\nMiss Havisham dear!\xe2\x80\x9d and with a smile of forgiving pity on her\r\nwalnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.\r\n\r\nWhile Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked\r\nwith her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she\r\nstopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it\r\nsome seconds,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my birthday, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer it to be spoken of. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer those who were here\r\njust now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but\r\nthey dare not refer to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course _I_ made no further effort to refer to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of\r\ndecay,\xe2\x80\x9d stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the\r\ntable, but not touching it, \xe2\x80\x9cwas brought here. It and I have worn away\r\ntogether. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of\r\nmice have gnawed at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking\r\nat the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the\r\nonce white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state\r\nto crumble under a touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the ruin is complete,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a ghastly look, \xe2\x80\x9cand when\r\nthey lay me dead, in my bride\xe2\x80\x99s dress on the bride\xe2\x80\x99s table,\xe2\x80\x94which shall\r\nbe done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,\xe2\x80\x94so much the\r\nbetter if it is done on this day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own\r\nfigure lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too\r\nremained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time.\r\nIn the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in\r\nits remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I\r\nmight presently begin to decay.\r\n\r\nAt length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an\r\ninstant, Miss Havisham said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see you two play cards; why have\r\nyou not begun?\xe2\x80\x9d With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as\r\nbefore; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham\r\nwatched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, and\r\nmade me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella\xe2\x80\x99s breast and\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nEstella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she\r\ndid not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,\r\na day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard\r\nto be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left\r\nto wander about as I liked.\r\n\r\nIt is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which\r\nI had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last\r\noccasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw\r\none now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let the\r\nvisitors out,\xe2\x80\x94for she had returned with the keys in her hand,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nstrolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a\r\nwilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,\r\nwhich seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of\r\nweak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a\r\nweedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.\r\n\r\nWhen I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but\r\na fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal\r\ncorner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for\r\na moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,\r\nand found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a\r\npale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.\r\n\r\nThis pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside\r\nme. He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him,\r\nand I now saw that he was inky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyoung fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be\r\nbest answered by itself, _I_ said, \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d politely omitting young\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho let _you_ in?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you leave to prowl about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and fight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pale young gentleman.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\r\nsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was so\r\nastonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\r\nspell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a minute, though,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, wheeling round before we had gone\r\nmany paces. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against\r\none another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my\r\nhair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nThe bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\r\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\r\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit\r\nout at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAha! Would\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite\r\nunparalleled within my limited experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws of the game!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\r\nhis right. \xe2\x80\x9cRegular rules!\xe2\x80\x9d Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\r\nhis left. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!\xe2\x80\x9d Here,\r\nhe dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\r\nlooked helplessly at him.\r\n\r\nI was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\r\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\r\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\r\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\r\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\r\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking\r\nme if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he\r\nbegged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned\r\nwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. \xe2\x80\x9cAvailable for\r\nboth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to\r\npulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a\r\nmanner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\r\n\r\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,\xe2\x80\x94having pimples on his face, and\r\na breaking out at his mouth,\xe2\x80\x94these dreadful preparations quite appalled\r\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\r\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\r\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for\r\nbattle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\r\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\r\n\r\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\r\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\r\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\r\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,\r\nlooking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\r\nfore-shortened.\r\n\r\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a\r\ngreat show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\r\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\r\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\r\n\r\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\r\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked\r\ndown; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or\r\ndrinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in\r\nseconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air\r\nand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at\r\nlast. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I\r\nhit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and\r\nagain, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head\r\nagainst the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and\r\nturned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;\r\nbut finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the\r\nsame time panting out, \xe2\x80\x9cThat means you have won.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\r\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\r\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\r\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\r\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he said \xe2\x80\x9cNo thankee,\xe2\x80\x9d and I said \xe2\x80\x9cGood afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d and _he_ said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.\r\nBut she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her\r\nwaiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though\r\nsomething had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the\r\ngate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here! You may kiss me, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone\r\nthrough a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was\r\ngiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and\r\nthat it was worth nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with\r\nthe fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the\r\nlight on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming\r\nagainst a black night-sky, and Joe\xe2\x80\x99s furnace was flinging a path of\r\nfire across the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.\r\nThe more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman\r\non his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the\r\nmore certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt\r\nthat the pale young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s blood was on my head, and that the Law\r\nwould avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I\r\nhad incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go\r\nstalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and\r\npitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves\r\nopen to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,\r\nand looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and\r\ntrepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County\r\nJail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s nose had stained\r\nmy trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the\r\ndead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nteeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I\r\ndevised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance\r\nwhen I should be haled before the Judges.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of\r\nviolence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of\r\nJustice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush\r\nbehind the gate;\xe2\x80\x94whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal\r\nvengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those\r\ngrave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:\xe2\x80\x94whether\r\nsuborned boys\xe2\x80\x94a numerous band of mercenaries\xe2\x80\x94might be engaged to fall\r\nupon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;\xe2\x80\x94it was high\r\ntestimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,\r\nthat I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; they\r\nalways came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,\r\ngoaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the\r\nfamily features.\r\n\r\nHowever, go to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s I must, and go I did. And behold!\r\nnothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way,\r\nand no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I\r\nfound the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in\r\nat the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped\r\nby the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner\r\nwhere the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the\r\nyoung gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s existence. There were traces of his gore in that\r\nspot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.\r\n\r\nOn the broad landing between Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s own room and that other\r\nroom in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlight chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed\r\nthere since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular\r\noccupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired\r\nof walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and\r\nacross the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over\r\nagain, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as\r\nlong as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general\r\nmention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled\r\nthat I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,\r\nand because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more\r\nto me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I\r\ngoing to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I\r\nbelieved; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know\r\neverything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that\r\ndesirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer\r\nmy being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,\xe2\x80\x94or anything\r\nbut my daily dinner,\xe2\x80\x94nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told\r\nme I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;\r\nsometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite\r\nfamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she\r\nhated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we\r\nwere alone, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d And when I said\r\nyes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when\r\nwe played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish\r\nof Estella\xe2\x80\x99s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods\r\nwere so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled\r\nwhat to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish\r\nfondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like \xe2\x80\x9cBreak their\r\nhearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which\r\nthe burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of\r\nrendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in\r\nthat relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure\r\nof beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the\r\nintroduction of Old Clem\xe2\x80\x99s respected name. Thus, you were to hammer\r\nboys round\xe2\x80\x94Old Clem! With a thump and a sound\xe2\x80\x94Old Clem! Beat it out,\r\nbeat it out\xe2\x80\x94Old Clem! With a clink for the stout\xe2\x80\x94Old Clem! Blow the\r\nfire, blow the fire\xe2\x80\x94Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher\xe2\x80\x94Old Clem!\r\nOne day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly\r\nsaying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\r\nthere, there! Sing!\xe2\x80\x9d I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I\r\npushed her over the floor. It happened so to catch her fancy that she\r\ntook it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.\r\nAfter that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,\r\nand Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so\r\nsubdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in\r\nthe grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.\r\n\r\nWhat could I become with these surroundings? How could my character\r\nfail to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts\r\nwere dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light\r\nfrom the misty yellow rooms?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had\r\nnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I\r\nhad confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly\r\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger\r\nto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of\r\nhim. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella\r\ndiscussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more\r\npotent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but\r\nBiddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to\r\ndo so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did\r\nnot know then, though I think I know now.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost\r\ninsupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,\r\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\r\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these\r\nhands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would\r\nhave done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of\r\nmind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94as it were, to operate upon,\xe2\x80\x94and he would drag me up from my stool\r\n(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me\r\nbefore the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by\r\nhand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which\r\nso did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!\xe2\x80\x9d And then he would\r\nrumple my hair the wrong way,\xe2\x80\x94which from my earliest remembrance, as\r\nalready hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any\r\nfellow-creature to do,\xe2\x80\x94and would hold me before him by the sleeve,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.\r\n\r\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\r\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\r\nthat I used to want\xe2\x80\x94quite painfully\xe2\x80\x94to burst into spiteful tears, fly\r\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\r\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\r\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\r\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\r\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\r\n\r\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\r\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s perceiving that he\r\nwas not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\r\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\r\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\r\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into\r\nopposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out\r\nof his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating\r\nend to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to\r\nlead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching\r\nsight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_\xe2\x80\x99ve given trouble\r\nenough for one night, I hope!\xe2\x80\x9d As if I had besought them as a favour to\r\nbother my life out.\r\n\r\nWe went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we\r\nshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss\r\nHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my\r\nshoulder; and said with some displeasure,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are growing tall, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,\r\nthat this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nShe said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at\r\nme again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and\r\nmoody. On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was\r\nover, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a\r\nmovement of her impatient fingers:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe Gargery, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with\r\nyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let him come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any particular time, Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come\r\nalong with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwent on the Rampage,\xe2\x80\x9d in a more alarming degree than at any previous\r\nperiod. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats\r\nunder our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we\r\ngraciously thought she _was_ fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent\r\nof such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud\r\nsobbing, got out the dustpan,\xe2\x80\x94which was always a very bad sign,\xe2\x80\x94put on\r\nher coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not\r\nsatisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush,\r\nand cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the\r\nback-yard. It was ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night before we ventured to creep in\r\nagain, and then she asked Joe why he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t married a Negress Slave at\r\nonce? Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker\r\nand looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have\r\nbeen a better speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe\r\narraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the\r\noccasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in\r\nhis working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so\r\ndreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for\r\nme he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the\r\nhair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town\r\nwith us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s and called for \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we\r\nhad done with our fine ladies\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a way of putting the case, from which\r\nJoe appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the\r\nday, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to\r\ndo on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable\r\nHOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the\r\ndirection he had taken.\r\n\r\nWe walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver\r\nbonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited\r\nStraw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was\r\na fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were\r\ncarried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were\r\ndisplayed as articles of property,\xe2\x80\x94much as Cleopatra or any other\r\nsovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, my sister bounced in and left us. As it\r\nwas almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nEstella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe\r\ntook his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands;\r\nas if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to\r\nhalf a quarter of an ounce.\r\n\r\nEstella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew\r\nso well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back\r\nat Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the\r\ngreatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of\r\nhis toes.\r\n\r\nEstella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff\r\nand conducted him into Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s presence. She was seated at her\r\ndressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the husband of the sister of this boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or\r\nso like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with\r\nhis tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a\r\nworm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the husband,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Miss Havisham, \xe2\x80\x9cof the sister of this\r\nboy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted\r\nin addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe now observed in a manner that was at\r\nonce expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great\r\npoliteness, \xe2\x80\x9cas I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time\r\nwhat you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have reared the boy, with the\r\nintention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cas you and me were ever friends, and it\r\nwere looked for\xe2\x80\x99ard to betwixt us, as being calc\xe2\x80\x99lated to lead to\r\nlarks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the\r\nbusiness,\xe2\x80\x94such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nbut what they would have been attended to, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, \xe2\x80\x9cever made any objection? Does he\r\nlike the trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe,\r\nstrengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and\r\npoliteness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it were the wish of your own hart.\xe2\x80\x9d (I saw the idea\r\nsuddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the\r\noccasion, before he went on to say) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there weren\xe2\x80\x99t no objection on\r\nyour part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he\r\nought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures to\r\nhim to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he\r\npersisted in being to Me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought his indentures with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joe, as if that were a little\r\nunreasonable, \xe2\x80\x9cyou yourself see me put \xe2\x80\x99em in my \xe2\x80\x99at, and therefore you\r\nknow as they are here.\xe2\x80\x9d With which he took them out, and gave them, not\r\nto Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good\r\nfellow,\xe2\x80\x94I _know_ I was ashamed of him,\xe2\x80\x94when I saw that Estella stood at\r\nthe back of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and that her eyes laughed\r\nmischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to\r\nMiss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou expected,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\npremium with the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe!\xe2\x80\x9d I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nanswer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I\r\nmeantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself\r\nand me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it\r\nto be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was\r\nbetter than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took\r\nup a little bag from the table beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip has earned a premium here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand here it is. There are\r\nfive-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in\r\nhim by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,\r\npersisted in addressing me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is wery liberal on your part, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is as such\r\nreceived and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,\r\nnor nowheres. And now, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, conveying to me a\r\nsensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that\r\nfamiliar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand now, old chap,\r\nmay we do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and\r\nanother, and by them which your liberal present\xe2\x80\x94have-conweyed\xe2\x80\x94to be\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe satisfaction of mind-of\xe2\x80\x94them as never\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d here Joe showed that he\r\nfelt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly\r\nrescued himself with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cand from myself far be it!\xe2\x80\x9d These\r\nwords had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them out, Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to come again, Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe\r\nin a distinct emphatic voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy has been a good boy here, and\r\nthat is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no\r\nother and no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I\r\nknow that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\r\ninstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went\r\nafter him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the\r\ngate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the\r\ndaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d And there he remained so long saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming\r\nback. At length he prolonged his remark into \xe2\x80\x9cPip, I do assure _you_\r\nthis is as-TON-ishing!\xe2\x80\x9d and so, by degrees, became conversational and\r\nable to walk away.\r\n\r\nI have reason to think that Joe\xe2\x80\x99s intellects were brightened by the\r\nencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhe invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what\r\ntook place in Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s parlour: where, on our presenting\r\nourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, addressing us both at once. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappened to _you_? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor\r\nsociety as this, I am sure I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of\r\nremembrance, \xe2\x80\x9cmade it wery partick\xe2\x80\x99ler that we should give her\xe2\x80\x94were it\r\ncompliments or respects, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompliments,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich that were my own belief,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cher compliments to Mrs.\r\nJ. Gargery\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch good they\xe2\x80\x99ll do me!\xe2\x80\x9d observed my sister; but rather gratified\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wishing,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another\r\neffort of remembrance, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the state of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s elth were\r\nsitch as would have\xe2\x80\x94allowed, were it, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her having the pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d I added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf ladies\xe2\x80\x99 company,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. And drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe giv\xe2\x80\x99 him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat she giv\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cshe giv\xe2\x80\x99 to his friends. \xe2\x80\x98And by his\r\nfriends,\xe2\x80\x99 were her explanation, \xe2\x80\x98I mean into the hands of his sister\r\nMrs. J. Gargery.\xe2\x80\x99 Them were her words; \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. J. Gargery.\xe2\x80\x99 She mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave know\xe2\x80\x99d,\xe2\x80\x9d added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it\r\nwere Joe, or Jorge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden\r\narm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all\r\nabout it beforehand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much have you got?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my sister, laughing. Positively\r\nlaughing!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would present company say to ten pound?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my sister, curtly, \xe2\x80\x9cpretty well. Not too much,\r\nbut pretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than that, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\nThat fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he\r\nrubbed the arms of his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than that, Mum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I do, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook; \xe2\x80\x9cbut wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good\r\nin you! Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would present company say,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cto twenty pound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome would be the word,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than twenty pound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a\r\npatronizing laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her\r\nup, Joseph!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen to make an end of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to\r\nmy sister; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s five-and-twenty pound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed that basest of swindlers,\r\nPumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s no more than\r\nyour merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy\r\nof the money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently\r\nawful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into\r\ncustody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality\r\nfar behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you see, Joseph and wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, as he took me by the\r\narm above the elbow, \xe2\x80\x9cI am one of them that always go right through\r\nwith what they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_my_ way. Bound out of hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister (grasping the\r\nmoney), \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re deeply beholden to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind me, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d returned that diabolical cornchandler. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\npleasure\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we\r\nmust have him bound. I said I\xe2\x80\x99d see to it\xe2\x80\x94to tell you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once\r\nwent over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial\r\npresence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,\r\nexactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick;\r\nindeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken\r\nred-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd,\r\nI heard some people say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he done?\xe2\x80\x9d and others, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a young\r\n\xe2\x80\x99un, too, but looks bad, don\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d One person of mild and benevolent\r\naspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent\r\nyoung man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and\r\nentitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.\r\n\r\nThe Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a\r\nchurch,\xe2\x80\x94and with people hanging over the pews looking on,\xe2\x80\x94and with\r\nmighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with\r\nfolded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading\r\nthe newspapers,\xe2\x80\x94and with some shining black portraits on the walls,\r\nwhich my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and\r\nsticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and\r\nattested, and I was \xe2\x80\x9cbound\xe2\x80\x9d; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while\r\nas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little\r\npreliminaries disposed of.\r\n\r\nWhen we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been\r\nput into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly\r\ntortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were\r\nmerely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s. And there my\r\nsister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would\r\nserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue\r\nBoar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring\r\nthe Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it\r\ninscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole\r\ncompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it\r\nworse, they all asked me from time to time,\xe2\x80\x94in short, whenever they had\r\nnothing else to do,\xe2\x80\x94why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy myself? And what could I\r\npossibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,\xe2\x80\x94when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\n\r\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\r\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\r\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\r\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\r\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\r\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\r\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\r\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\r\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\r\n\r\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,\r\nwoke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the\r\nevening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins\xe2\x80\x99s ode, and threw his bloodstained\r\nsword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Tumblers\xe2\x80\x99 Arms.\xe2\x80\x9d That, they were all in excellent spirits on\r\nthe road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and\r\nasserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive\r\nbore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by\r\nwanting to know all about everybody\xe2\x80\x99s private affairs) that _he_ was\r\nthe man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole\r\nthe weakest pilgrim going.\r\n\r\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\r\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be\r\nblack ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive\r\nand well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.\r\n\r\nHome had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had\r\nbelieved in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon; I had believed\r\nin the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose\r\nsolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had\r\nbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I\r\nhad believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and\r\nindependence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all\r\ncoarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella\r\nsee it on any account.\r\n\r\nHow much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,\r\nhow much Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, how much my sister\xe2\x80\x99s, is now of no moment to\r\nme or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well\r\nor ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.\r\n\r\nOnce, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my\r\nshirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99prentice, I should be\r\ndistinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt\r\nthat I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight\r\nupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have\r\nbeen occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I\r\nhave felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its\r\ninterest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance\r\nany more. Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my\r\nway in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly\r\nentered road of apprenticeship to Joe.\r\n\r\nI remember that at a later period of my \xe2\x80\x9ctime,\xe2\x80\x9d I used to stand about\r\nthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my\r\nown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness\r\nbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both\r\nthere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite\r\nas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that\r\nafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe\r\nwhile my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I _am_ glad to\r\nknow of myself in that connection.\r\n\r\nFor, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I\r\nproceed to add was Joe\xe2\x80\x99s. It was not because I was faithful, but\r\nbecause Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier\r\nor a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of\r\nindustry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,\r\nthat I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible\r\nto know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing\r\nman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it\r\nhas touched one\xe2\x80\x99s self in going by, and I know right well that any good\r\nthat intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented\r\nJoe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted, who can say? How can _I_ say, when I never knew? What I\r\ndreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and\r\ncommonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of\r\nthe wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she\r\nwould, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing\r\nthe coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.\r\nOften after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were\r\nsinging Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s would seem to show me Estella\xe2\x80\x99s face in the fire, with her\r\npretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,\xe2\x80\x94often at\r\nsuch a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the\r\nwall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her\r\njust drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nAfter that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal would\r\nhave a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of\r\nhome than ever, in my own ungracious breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s room, my\r\neducation under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however,\r\nuntil Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little\r\ncatalogue of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a\r\nhalf-penny. Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of\r\nliterature were the opening lines,\r\n\r\n     When I went to Lunnon town sirs,\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I done very brown sirs?\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with\r\nthe utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit,\r\nexcept that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in\r\nexcess of the poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to\r\nMr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he\r\nkindly complied. As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for\r\na dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over\r\nand bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of\r\nways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr.\r\nWopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me.\r\n\r\nWhatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so\r\nwell, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted\r\nto make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my\r\nsociety and less open to Estella\xe2\x80\x99s reproach.\r\n\r\nThe old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken\r\nslate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational\r\nimplements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew\r\nJoe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire,\r\nunder my tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke\r\nhis pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere\r\nelse,\xe2\x80\x94even with a learned air,\xe2\x80\x94as if he considered himself to be\r\nadvancing immensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river\r\npassing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low,\r\nlooking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on\r\nat the bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out\r\nto sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss\r\nHavisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off,\r\nupon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the\r\nsame.\xe2\x80\x94Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange\r\nlife appeared to have something to do with everything that was\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself\r\non being \xe2\x80\x9cmost awful dull,\xe2\x80\x9d that I had given him up for the day, I lay\r\non the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying\r\ntraces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky\r\nand in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought\r\nconcerning them that had been much in my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, slowly considering. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for, Joe? What is any visit made for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some wisits p\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99aps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cas for ever remains open to\r\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\r\nthink you wanted something,\xe2\x80\x94expected something of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she might credit it. Similarly\r\nshe mightn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\r\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\r\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe. I heard her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALL,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe repeated, very emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,\xe2\x80\x94Make a end\r\non it!\xe2\x80\x94As you was!\xe2\x80\x94Me to the North, and you to the South!\xe2\x80\x94Keep in\r\nsunders!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to\r\nfind that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\r\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\r\nher, or shown that I remember her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\r\nall four round,\xe2\x80\x94and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four\r\nround might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\r\nhoofs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cOr even,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you was helped to knocking her up a new\r\nchain for the front door,\xe2\x80\x94or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws\r\nfor general use,\xe2\x80\x94or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\r\nwhen she took her muffins,\xe2\x80\x94or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean any present at all, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\r\npressed it, \xe2\x80\x9cif I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. No, I would _not_. For\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s a door-chain when she\xe2\x80\x99s got one always up? And shark-headers is\r\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you\xe2\x80\x99d go\r\ninto brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow himself oncommon in a gridiron,\xe2\x80\x94for a gridiron IS a gridiron,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring\r\nto rouse me from a fixed delusion, \xe2\x80\x9cand you may haim at what you like,\r\nbut a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your\r\nleave, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t help yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\r\nalong; \xe2\x80\x9cand what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\r\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I\r\nwould go uptown and make a call on Miss Est\xe2\x80\x94Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich her name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t Estavisham, Pip, unless she\r\nhave been rechris\xe2\x80\x99ened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\r\nJoe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\r\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\r\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\r\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for\r\na favour received, then this experimental trip should have no\r\nsuccessor. By these conditions I promised to abide.\r\n\r\nNow, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. He\r\npretended that his Christian name was Dolge,\xe2\x80\x94a clear Impossibility,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nhe was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to\r\nhave been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to\r\nhave imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its\r\nunderstanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of\r\ngreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even\r\nseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by\r\nmere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his\r\ndinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the\r\nWandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention\r\nof ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s out on the marshes,\r\nand on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his\r\nhands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his\r\nneck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the\r\nsluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,\r\nlocomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or\r\notherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,\r\nhalf-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it\r\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.\r\n\r\nThis morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and\r\ntimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner\r\nof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was\r\nnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,\r\nand that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99prentice,\r\nOrlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace\r\nhim; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything,\r\nor did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he\r\nalways beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old\r\nClem, he came in out of time.\r\n\r\nDolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of\r\nmy half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just\r\ngot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by\r\nand by he said, leaning on his hammer,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, master! Sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not a-going to favour only one of us. If\r\nYoung Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.\xe2\x80\x9d I suppose he\r\nwas about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an\r\nancient person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll _I_ do with it! What\xe2\x80\x99ll _he_ do with it? I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as much with\r\nit as _him_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orlick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to Pip, he\xe2\x80\x99s going up town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, as to Old Orlick, _he_\xe2\x80\x99s a-going up town,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted that\r\nworthy. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo can go up town. Tain\xe2\x80\x99t only one wot can go up town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lose your temper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall if I like,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Orlick. \xe2\x80\x9cSome and their uptowning! Now,\r\nmaster! Come. No favouring in this shop. Be a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was\r\nin a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot\r\nbar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,\r\nwhisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,\xe2\x80\x94as if\r\nit were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nfinally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and\r\nhe again leaned on his hammer,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all right now?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I am all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said gruff Old Orlick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoe, \xe2\x80\x9clet it be a half-holiday for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\na most unscrupulous spy and listener,\xe2\x80\x94and she instantly looked in at\r\none of the windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike you, you fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cgiving holidays to great idle\r\nhulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in\r\nthat way. I wish _I_ was his master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be everybody\xe2\x80\x99s master, if you durst,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Orlick, with an\r\nill-favoured grin.\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cLet her alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be a match for all noodles and all rogues,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my sister,\r\nbeginning to work herself into a mighty rage. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a\r\nmatch for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a match for the\r\nrogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and\r\nthe worst rogue between this and France. Now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the journeyman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that\r\nmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good\xe2\x80\x99un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cLet her alone, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, beginning to scream. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you\r\nsay? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,\r\nwith my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d Each of these exclamations\r\nwas a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of\r\nall the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for\r\nher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she\r\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\r\ninto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was the\r\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold\r\nme! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh-h-h!\xe2\x80\x9d growled the journeyman, between his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d hold you, if\r\nyou was my wife. I\xe2\x80\x99d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, let her alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! To hear him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a\r\nscream together,\xe2\x80\x94which was her next stage. \xe2\x80\x9cTo hear the names he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngiving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my\r\nhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d Here my sister, after a fit of clappings\r\nand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and\r\nthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,\xe2\x80\x94which were the last stages\r\non her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\r\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\r\n\r\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\r\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he\r\nmeant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether\r\nhe was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation\r\nadmitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence\r\nstraightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt\r\naprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in\r\nthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.\r\nOrlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young\r\ngentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come\r\nout of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had\r\ndropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I\r\nthink), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was\r\nrecommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her\r\nhands in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hair. Then came that singular calm and silence which\r\nsucceed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have\r\nalways connected with such a lull,\xe2\x80\x94namely, that it was Sunday, and\r\nsomebody was dead,\xe2\x80\x94I went upstairs to dress myself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any\r\nother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils,\r\nwhich was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared\r\nfrom the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a\r\npeaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence\r\non Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting\r\nobservation that might do me good, \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Rampage, Pip, and off the\r\nRampage, Pip:\xe2\x80\x94such is Life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very\r\nserious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed\r\nthe gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how I\r\ndebated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should\r\nundoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, then? You here again?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah\r\nevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my\r\nbusiness. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in,\r\nand presently brought the sharp message that I was to \xe2\x80\x9ccome up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, fixing her eyes upon me. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you want nothing?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing\r\nvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there!\xe2\x80\x9d with the old restless fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cCome now and then; come\r\non your birthday.\xe2\x80\x94Ay!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried suddenly, turning herself and her\r\nchair towards me, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are looking round for Estella? Hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had been looking round,\xe2\x80\x94in fact, for Estella,\xe2\x80\x94and I stammered that I\r\nhoped she was well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham; \xe2\x80\x9ceducating for a lady; far out of reach;\r\nprettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you\r\nhave lost her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last\r\nwords, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a\r\nloss what to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by\r\ndismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the\r\nwalnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my\r\nhome and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by\r\n_that_ motion.\r\n\r\nAs I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at\r\nthe shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,\r\nwho should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in\r\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that\r\nmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on\r\nthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner\r\ndid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence\r\nhad put a \xe2\x80\x99prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,\r\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As I\r\nknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the\r\nway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better\r\nthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into\r\nPumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.\r\n\r\nAs I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it\r\ntook until half-past nine o\xe2\x80\x99 clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle\r\ngot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he\r\nbecame so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful\r\ncareer. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being\r\ncut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to\r\nseed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was\r\na mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\r\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When\r\nBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively\r\napologetic, Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,\r\ntoo, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and\r\nmaudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating\r\ncircumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every\r\noccasion; it became sheer monomania in my master\xe2\x80\x99s daughter to care a\r\nbutton for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating\r\nconduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general\r\nfeebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle\r\nhad closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his\r\nhead, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTake warning, boy, take warning!\xe2\x80\x9d as if it were a\r\nwell-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided\r\nI could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with\r\nMr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out,\r\nand it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of\r\nthe lamp\xe2\x80\x99s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance\r\non the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose\r\nwith a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we\r\ncame upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d we said, stopping. \xe2\x80\x9cOrlick there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, slouching out. \xe2\x80\x9cI was standing by a minute, on the\r\nchance of company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are late,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\nOrlick not unnaturally answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWell? And _you_\xe2\x80\x99re late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nhave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\r\nwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending\r\nhis half-holiday up and down town?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9call of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nyou, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns\r\nis going again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Hulks?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! There\xe2\x80\x99s some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been\r\ngoing since dark, about. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear one presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\r\nwell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\r\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\r\nand threatening the fugitives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good night for cutting off in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orlick. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d be puzzled how to\r\nbring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\r\nsilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very\r\ndark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the\r\nsound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled\r\nsulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my\r\nthoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game\r\non Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick\r\nsometimes growled, \xe2\x80\x9cBeat it out, beat it out,\xe2\x80\x94Old Clem! With a clink\r\nfor the stout,\xe2\x80\x94Old Clem!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought he had been drinking, but he was\r\nnot drunk.\r\n\r\nThus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us\r\npast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find\xe2\x80\x94it being\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and\r\nunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\r\nabout. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that\r\na convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, without stopping, \xe2\x80\x9cup at your\r\nplace, Pip. Run all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand. The house seems to have been violently\r\nentered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has\r\nbeen attacked and hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no\r\nstop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole\r\nvillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there\r\nwas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst\r\nof the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,\r\nand so I became aware of my sister,\xe2\x80\x94lying without sense or movement on\r\nthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on\r\nthe back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\r\nturned towards the fire,\xe2\x80\x94destined never to be on the Rampage again,\r\nwhile she was the wife of Joe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to\r\nbelieve that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,\r\nor at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\r\nobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\r\nany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began\r\nto reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all\r\nsides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\r\n\r\nJoe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\r\nquarter after eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock to a quarter before ten. While he was\r\nthere, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had\r\nexchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not\r\nbe more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into\r\ndense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been\r\nbefore nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found\r\nher struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The\r\nfire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle\r\nvery long; the candle, however, had been blown out.\r\n\r\nNothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\r\nthe blowing out of the candle,\xe2\x80\x94which stood on a table between the door\r\nand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and\r\nwas struck,\xe2\x80\x94was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\r\nas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\r\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\r\nsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\r\ndealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\r\nviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when\r\nJoe picked her up, was a convict\xe2\x80\x99s leg-iron which had been filed\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\nNow, Joe, examining this iron with a smith\xe2\x80\x99s eye, declared it to have\r\nbeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\r\nHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was\r\ncorroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\r\nprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they\r\nclaimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been\r\nworn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,\r\none of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his\r\niron.\r\n\r\nKnowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\r\nthe iron to be my convict\xe2\x80\x99s iron,\xe2\x80\x94the iron I had seen and heard him\r\nfiling at, on the marshes,\xe2\x80\x94but my mind did not accuse him of having put\r\nit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\r\nbecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\r\nEither Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.\r\n\r\nNow, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\r\npicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\r\nevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\r\nhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\r\nhim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\r\neverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\r\nhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no\r\ndispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore\r\nthem. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in\r\nso silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could\r\nlook round.\r\n\r\nIt was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\r\nundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered\r\nunspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I\r\nshould at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the\r\nstory. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally\r\nin the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The\r\ncontention came, after all, to this;\xe2\x80\x94the secret was such an old one\r\nnow, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not\r\ntear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much\r\nmischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me\r\nif he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not\r\nbelieve it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets\r\nas a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing\r\nis always done?\xe2\x80\x94and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see\r\nany such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of\r\nthe assailant.\r\n\r\nThe Constables and the Bow Street men from London\xe2\x80\x94for, this happened in\r\nthe days of the extinct red-waistcoated police\xe2\x80\x94were about the house for\r\na week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like\r\nauthorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously\r\nwrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,\r\nand persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead\r\nof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood\r\nabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks\r\nthat filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a\r\nmysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as\r\ntaking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.\r\n\r\nLong after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay\r\nvery ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects\r\nmultiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of\r\nthe realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and\r\nher speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as\r\nto be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always\r\nby her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate\r\nin speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than\r\nindifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,\r\nextraordinary complications arose between them which I was always\r\ncalled in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,\r\nthe substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among\r\nthe mildest of my own mistakes.\r\n\r\nHowever, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A\r\ntremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part\r\nof her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three\r\nmonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then\r\nremain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We\r\nwere at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a\r\ncircumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had\r\nfallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.\r\n\r\nIt may have been about a month after my sister\xe2\x80\x99s reappearance in the\r\nkitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the\r\nwhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.\r\nAbove all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly\r\ncut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had\r\nbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me\r\nevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a fine\r\nfigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d Biddy instantly taking the\r\ncleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe\r\nbecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,\r\nand to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that\r\ndid him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had\r\nall more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that\r\nthey had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest\r\nspirits they had ever encountered.\r\n\r\nBiddy\xe2\x80\x99s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that\r\nhad completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made\r\nnothing of it. Thus it was:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAgain and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a\r\ncharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost\r\neagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\r\nwanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\r\nfrom tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\r\nsign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\r\nqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one\r\nafter another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the\r\nshape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and\r\ndisplayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook\r\nher head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified\r\nlest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.\r\n\r\nWhen my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this\r\nmysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at\r\nit, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\r\nthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\r\ninitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Biddy, with an exultant face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOrlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify\r\nhim by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the\r\nkitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his\r\narm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out,\r\nwith a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly\r\ndistinguished him.\r\n\r\nI confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I was\r\ndisappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest\r\nanxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his\r\nbeing at length produced, and motioned that she would have him given\r\nsomething to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were\r\nparticularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his\r\nreception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and\r\nthere was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have\r\nseen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that\r\nday, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate,\r\nand without Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as\r\nif he knew no more than I did what to make of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was\r\nvaried beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more\r\nremarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying\r\nanother visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty\r\nat the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she\r\nspoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.\r\nThe interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I\r\nwas going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention\r\nat once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking\r\nthe guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than\r\ncausing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after\r\nthat, I took it.\r\n\r\nSo unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened\r\nroom, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that\r\nI felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that\r\nmysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew\r\nolder, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my\r\nthoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.\r\nIt bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate\r\nmy trade and to be ashamed of home.\r\n\r\nImperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her\r\nshoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands\r\nwere always clean. She was not beautiful,\xe2\x80\x94she was common, and could not\r\nbe like Estella,\xe2\x80\x94but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.\r\nShe had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly\r\nout of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself\r\none evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes\r\nthat were very pretty and very good.\r\n\r\nIt came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring\r\nat\xe2\x80\x94writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at\r\nonce by a sort of stratagem\xe2\x80\x94and seeing Biddy observant of what I was\r\nabout. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\r\nlaying it down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\r\nare very clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that I manage? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Biddy, smiling.\r\n\r\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\r\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you manage, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cto learn everything that I learn,\r\nand always to keep up with me?\xe2\x80\x9d I was beginning to be rather vain of my\r\nknowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\r\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have\r\nno doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might as well ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9chow _you_ manage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\r\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must catch it like a cough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, quietly; and went\r\non with her sewing.\r\n\r\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\r\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her\r\nrather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was\r\nequally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our\r\ndifferent sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I\r\nknew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith\r\nas I, or better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are one of those, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwho make the most of every\r\nchance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\r\nimproved you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nyour first teacher though; wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as she sewed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are crying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, looking up and laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat put that in\r\nyour head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it\r\ndropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been\r\nuntil Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of\r\nliving, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled\r\nthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the\r\nmiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,\r\nwith that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and\r\nshouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must\r\nhave been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first\r\nuneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of\r\ncourse. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I\r\nlooked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps\r\nI had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too\r\nreserved, and should have patronised her more (though I did not use\r\nthat precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, when I had done turning it over, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were my\r\nfirst teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being\r\ntogether like this, in this kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to\r\ntransfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,\r\nmaking her more comfortable; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s sadly true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must talk together a little more, as we used to do.\r\nAnd I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a\r\nquiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook\r\nthe care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out\r\ntogether. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed\r\nthe village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the\r\nmarshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I\r\nbegan to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my\r\nusual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank,\r\nwith the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it\r\nwould have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time\r\nand place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after binding her to secrecy, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, if I was you!\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with some severity, \xe2\x80\x9cI have particular reasons for\r\nwanting to be a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best, Pip; but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you are happier as you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all happy as I am. I am\r\ndisgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to\r\neither, since I was bound. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas I absurd?\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry\r\nfor that; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be\r\ncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be\r\ncomfortable\xe2\x80\x94or anything but miserable\xe2\x80\x94there, Biddy!\xe2\x80\x94unless I can lead a\r\nvery different sort of life from the life I lead now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.\r\n\r\nNow, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind\r\nof quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half\r\ninclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave\r\nutterance to her sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I\r\nknew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could have settled down,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Biddy, plucking up the short\r\ngrass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings\r\nout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif I could have\r\nsettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was\r\nlittle, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe\r\nwould have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone\r\npartners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to\r\nkeep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a\r\nfine Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for\r\n_you_; shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I, Biddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for\r\nanswer, \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I am not over-particular.\xe2\x80\x9d It scarcely sounded\r\nflattering, but I knew she meant well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade\r\nor two, \xe2\x80\x9csee how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had\r\ntold me so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more\r\nattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I\r\nwas going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and she\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nbeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I\r\nwant to be a gentleman on her account.\xe2\x80\x9d Having made this lunatic\r\nconfession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I\r\nhad some thoughts of following it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBiddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I moodily answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, if it is to spite her,\xe2\x80\x9d Biddy pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI should think\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nyou know best\xe2\x80\x94that might be better and more independently done by\r\ncaring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94but you know best\xe2\x80\x94she was not worth gaining over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was\r\nperfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed\r\nvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\r\nwisest of men fall every day?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be all quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I admire her\r\ndreadfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good\r\ngrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All\r\nthe while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and\r\nmisplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face\r\nright, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the\r\npebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.\r\n\r\nBiddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.\r\nShe put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by\r\nwork, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my\r\nhair. Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with\r\nmy face upon my sleeve I cried a little,\xe2\x80\x94exactly as I had done in the\r\nbrewery yard,\xe2\x80\x94and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used\r\nby somebody, or by everybody; I can\xe2\x80\x99t say which.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is, that you have felt\r\nyou could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,\r\nand that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it\r\nand always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a\r\npoor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your\r\nteacher at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would\r\nset. But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use now.\xe2\x80\x9d So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from\r\nthe bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, \xe2\x80\x9cShall\r\nwe walk a little farther, or go home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving\r\nher a kiss, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always tell you everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill you\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I never shall be, so that\xe2\x80\x99s always. Not that I have any\r\noccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,\xe2\x80\x94as I\r\ntold you at home the other night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.\r\nAnd then repeated, with her former pleasant change, \xe2\x80\x9cshall we walk a\r\nlittle farther, or go home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the\r\nsummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very\r\nbeautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and\r\nwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing\r\nbeggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stopped\r\nclocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good\r\nfor me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those\r\nremembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish\r\nwhat I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked\r\nmyself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were\r\nbeside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?\r\nI was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said\r\nto myself, \xe2\x80\x9cPip, what a fool you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed\r\nright. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and\r\nsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no\r\npleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her\r\nown breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her\r\nmuch the better of the two?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when we were walking homeward, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could put\r\nme right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only get myself to fall in love with you,\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my\r\nspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, not at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only get myself to do it, _that_ would be the thing for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you never will, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would\r\nhave done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore\r\nobserved I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she _was_, and\r\nshe said it decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet\r\nI took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.\r\n\r\nWhen we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and\r\nget over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate,\r\nor from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant\r\nway), Old Orlick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d he growled, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you two going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere should we be going, but home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m jiggered if I don\xe2\x80\x99t see you home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of\r\nhis. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,\r\nbut used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,\r\nand convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,\r\nI had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he\r\nwould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\r\n\r\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let him come; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him.\xe2\x80\x9d As I did not like him either, I\r\ntook the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\r\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\r\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give\r\nany account, I asked her why she did not like him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid he likes me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he ever tell you he liked you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, \xe2\x80\x9che never told me\r\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\r\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\r\nOld Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it makes no difference to you, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\napprove of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cThough _that_ makes no difference to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must tell you I should have no opinion of\r\nyou, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\r\nwere favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\r\ndemonstration. He had struck root in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s establishment, by reason of\r\nmy sister\xe2\x80\x99s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\r\ndismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as\r\nI had reason to know thereafter.\r\n\r\nAnd now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated\r\nits confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I\r\nwas clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the\r\nplain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be\r\nashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and\r\nhappiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my\r\ndisaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was\r\ngrowing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company\r\nwith Biddy,\xe2\x80\x94when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the\r\nHavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and\r\nscatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and\r\noften before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in\r\nall directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss\r\nHavisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.\r\n\r\nIf my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my\r\nperplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was\r\nbrought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a\r\nSaturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three\r\nJolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.\r\nOf that group I was one.\r\n\r\nA highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued\r\nin blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in\r\nthe description, and identified himself with every witness at the\r\nInquest. He faintly moaned, \xe2\x80\x9cI am done for,\xe2\x80\x9d as the victim, and he\r\nbarbarously bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll serve you out,\xe2\x80\x9d as the murderer. He gave\r\nthe medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner;\r\nand he piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard\r\nblows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding\r\nthe mental competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed\r\nhimself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully\r\ncomfortable. In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful\r\nMurder.\r\n\r\nThen, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning\r\nover the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an\r\nexpression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great\r\nforefinger as he watched the group of faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked\r\nat everybody coldly and sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuilty, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOut with it. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Wopsle, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout having the honour of your\r\nacquaintance, I do say Guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon this we all took courage to unite\r\nin a confirmatory murmur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger; \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would. I told you so.\r\nBut now I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know, that\r\nthe law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is\r\nproved\xe2\x80\x94proved\xe2\x80\x94to be guilty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wopsle began to reply, \xe2\x80\x9cas an Englishman myself, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t evade\r\nthe question. Either you know it, or you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it. Which is it to\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a\r\nbullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.\r\nWopsle,\xe2\x80\x94as it were to mark him out\xe2\x80\x94before biting it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know it, or don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly you know it. Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so at first? Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nask you another question,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he\r\nhad a right to him,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_do_ you know that none of these witnesses have\r\nyet been cross-examined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle was beginning, \xe2\x80\x9cI can only say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d when the stranger stopped\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You won\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try you\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d Throwing his finger at him again. \xe2\x80\x9cAttend to me. Are you aware,\r\nor are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been\r\ncross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor\r\nopinion of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve help, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x9cthe printed paper you have just been reading from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it\r\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal\r\nadvisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read that just now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wopsle pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what you read just now, sir; I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you what you read\r\njust now. You may read the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer backwards, if you like,\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nperhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my\r\nfriend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the\r\nbottom, to the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of\r\nsubterfuge.) \xe2\x80\x9cWell? Have you found it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it\r\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was\r\ninstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come!\r\nDo you make that of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThose are not the exact words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the exact words!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the gentleman bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the\r\nexact substance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\r\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I\r\nask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that\r\npassage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\r\npronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\r\nhim, and that he was beginning to be found out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that same man, remember,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the gentleman, throwing his\r\nfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat same man might be summoned as a\r\njuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed\r\nhimself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon\r\nhis pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly\r\ntry the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the\r\nprisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the\r\nevidence, so help him God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too\r\nfar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\r\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\r\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to\r\ndisclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space\r\nbetween the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remained\r\nstanding, his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of\r\nhis right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom information I have received,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking round at us as we\r\nall quailed before him, \xe2\x80\x9cI have reason to believe there is a blacksmith\r\namong you, by name Joseph\xe2\x80\x94or Joe\xe2\x80\x94Gargery. Which is the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\nThe strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an apprentice,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly known as Pip?\r\nIs he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\nThe stranger did not recognise me, but I recognised him as the\r\ngentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit\r\nto Miss Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the\r\nsettle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my\r\nshoulder, I checked off again in detail his large head, his dark\r\ncomplexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large\r\nwatch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the\r\nsmell of scented soap on his great hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to have a private conference with you two,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when he\r\nhad surveyed me at his leisure. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will take a little time. Perhaps we\r\nhad better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my\r\ncommunication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you\r\nplease to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,\r\nand in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange\r\ngentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of\r\nhis finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion\r\nas an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front\r\ndoor. Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feebly\r\nlighted by one candle.\r\n\r\nIt began with the strange gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s sitting down at the table,\r\ndrawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his\r\npocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little\r\naside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to\r\nascertain which was which.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\r\npretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\r\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\r\nhad been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you\r\nsee me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I\r\ndo. No less, no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got\r\nup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus\r\nhaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\r\nthis young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his\r\nindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\r\nso doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr.\r\nJaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer is,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool\r\nfor his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between\r\nbreathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cRecollect the admission you have made,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t try to go from it presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s a-going to try?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do keep a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\r\nBear that in mind, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\r\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got\r\nto make is, that he has great expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am instructed to communicate to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\r\nfinger at me sideways, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he will come into a handsome property.\r\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\r\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of\r\nlife and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x94in a word,\r\nas a young fellow of great expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss\r\nHavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cI address the rest of what I have\r\nto say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request of\r\nthe person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the\r\nname of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great\r\nexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have\r\nany objection, this is the time to mention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,\r\nthat I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that\r\nthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a\r\nprofound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered\r\nto mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first\r\nhand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be\r\ncarried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now,\r\nyou are distinctly to understand that you are most positively\r\nprohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or\r\nreference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as _the_\r\nindividual, in all the communications you may have with me. If you have\r\na suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.\r\nIt is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition\r\nare; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere\r\nwhim. This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down.\r\nYour acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the\r\nonly remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from\r\nwhom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise\r\nresponsible. That person is the person from whom you derive your\r\nexpectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.\r\nAgain, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a\r\nrise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time\r\nto mention it. Speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThough he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he\r\nstill could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and\r\neven now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while\r\nhe spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my\r\ndisparagement, if he only chose to mention them. \xe2\x80\x9cWe come next, to mere\r\ndetails of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used the\r\nterm \xe2\x80\x98expectations\xe2\x80\x99 more than once, you are not endowed with\r\nexpectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money\r\namply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will\r\nplease consider me your guardian. Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d for I was going to thank him, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t render\r\nthem. It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance\r\nwith your altered position, and that you will be alive to the\r\nimportance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I had always longed for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckeep to the record. If you long for it now, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Am I\r\nanswered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper\r\ntutor? Is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stammered yes, that was it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\r\nwise, mind, but it\xe2\x80\x99s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom\r\nyou would prefer to another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt;\r\nso, I replied in the negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think\r\nmight suit the purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend him,\r\nobserve; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is\r\none Mr. Matthew Pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s relation. The\r\nMatthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose\r\nplace was to be at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s head, when she lay dead, in her\r\nbride\xe2\x80\x99s dress on the bride\xe2\x80\x99s table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then\r\nshutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.\r\n\r\nMy answer was, that I had heard of the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of the name. But the question is, what\r\ndo you say of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his\r\nrecommendation\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my young friend!\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted, shaking his great head very\r\nslowly. \xe2\x80\x9cRecollect yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him\r\nfor his recommendation\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning\r\nand smiling both at once,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cno, no, no; it\xe2\x80\x99s very well done, but it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not\r\nthe word, Mr. Pip. Try another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCorrecting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his\r\nmention of Mr. Matthew Pocket\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_\xe2\x80\x99s more like it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x94And (I added), I would\r\ngladly try that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be\r\nprepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When\r\nwill you come to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I\r\nsupposed I could come directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cyou should have some new clothes to come\r\nin, and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwant some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them\r\nout on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he\r\nhad taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he\r\nhad pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in a very decided manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were understood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it are understood. And it ever\r\nwill be similar according.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat if it was in my\r\ninstructions to make you a present, as compensation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs compensation what for?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the loss of his services.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have\r\noften thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or\r\npat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. \xe2\x80\x9cPip\r\nis that hearty welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cto go free with his services, to\r\nhonour and fortun\xe2\x80\x99, as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money\r\ncan make compensation to me for the loss of the little child\xe2\x80\x94what come\r\nto the forge\xe2\x80\x94and ever the best of friends!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nO dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I\r\nsee you again, with your muscular blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s arm before your eyes,\r\nand your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good\r\nfaithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my\r\narm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwing!\r\n\r\nBut I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future\r\nfortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I\r\nbegged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best\r\nof friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes\r\nwith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\r\nsaid not another word.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe the\r\nvillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said,\r\nweighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\r\nmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in\r\ncharge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the\r\ncontrary you mean to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped\r\nby Joe\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell\r\npugilistic purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you come into my place\r\nbull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\r\nand stand or fall by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\r\nme, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\r\none whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to be\r\nbull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\r\nJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any\r\ninclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\r\nremarks. They were these.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here\xe2\x80\x94as you are to be a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\r\nreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a\r\nhackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to\r\nme. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the\r\ntrust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now,\r\nunderstand that, finally. Understand that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\r\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\r\n\r\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he\r\nwas going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, facing round, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\r\nso I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my\r\ntaking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in the village only, but up town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNo objection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had\r\nalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was\r\nseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at\r\nthe burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the\r\ncoals, and nothing was said for a long time.\r\n\r\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at\r\nher needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next\r\nJoe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the\r\nglowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the\r\nlonger the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\r\n\r\nAt length I got out, \xe2\x80\x9cJoe, have you told Biddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\r\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to\r\nmake off somewhere, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I left it to yourself, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather you told, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman of fortun\xe2\x80\x99 then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand God bless him in\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\r\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\r\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\r\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\r\n\r\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with\r\nthe grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and\r\nsay nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in\r\ngood time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,\r\nsave that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.\r\nBiddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work\r\nagain, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining\r\nhis knees, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nthey congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at\r\nthe notion of my being a gentleman that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t half like it.\r\n\r\nInfinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some\r\nidea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts\r\nentirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,\r\nand even repeated after Biddy, the words \xe2\x80\x9cPip\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cProperty.\xe2\x80\x9d But I\r\ndoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I\r\ncannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.\r\n\r\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy\r\nbecame more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\r\nDissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\r\npossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\r\nwith myself.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\r\nlooking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\r\nabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\r\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\r\noften looked at me,\xe2\x80\x94particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\r\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\r\nby word or sign.\r\n\r\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\r\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings\r\nto air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am\r\nafraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the\r\nrustic objects among which I had passed my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday night,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\r\nand beer. \xe2\x80\x9cFive more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsoon go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll soon go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon, soon go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\r\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and put\r\nthem on there, or that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s. It\r\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\r\ntoo, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese\r\non it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\r\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. \xe2\x80\x9cSo might\r\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I don\xe2\x80\x99t want, Joe. They would make such a business of\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94such a coarse and common business,\xe2\x80\x94that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that indeed, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abear yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister\xe2\x80\x99s plate, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nthought about when you\xe2\x80\x99ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\r\nand me? You will show yourself to us; won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned with some resentment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are so exceedingly quick\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to keep up with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cShe always were quick,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Joe.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\r\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,\xe2\x80\x94most likely\r\non the evening before I go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\r\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I\r\ngot into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a\r\nmean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,\r\nfor ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even\r\nat the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\r\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\r\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and Biddy and Estella.\r\n\r\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\r\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I\r\nsaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or\r\ntwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and\r\nlight it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me\r\nthat he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.\r\n\r\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his\r\npipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew\r\nthat they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing\r\ntone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for\r\nmore, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and\r\nsat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and\r\nstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the\r\nloneliest I had ever known.\r\n\r\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe\xe2\x80\x99s pipe\r\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\r\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\r\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,\r\nand brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay\r\nheaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened\r\nbetween me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a\r\nmisgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and\r\nthat, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or\r\nclean gone.\r\n\r\nJoe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our\r\napproaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After\r\nbreakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best\r\nparlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With\r\nall the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe,\r\nand thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have read that about the\r\nrich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.\r\n\r\nAfter our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off\r\nthe marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I\r\nfelt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion\r\nfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after\r\nSunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the\r\nlow green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them\r\none of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner\r\nof roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of\r\ncondescension, upon everybody in the village.\r\n\r\nIf I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my\r\ncompanionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among\r\nthose graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place\r\nrecalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and\r\nbadge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he\r\nhad doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to\r\nme, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.\r\n\r\nNo more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these\r\ngrazing cattle,\xe2\x80\x94though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a\r\nmore respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might\r\nstare as long as possible at the possessor of such great\r\nexpectations,\xe2\x80\x94farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,\r\nhenceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith\xe2\x80\x99s work in\r\ngeneral, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,\r\nlying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham\r\nintended me for Estella, fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,\r\nsmoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my\r\neyes, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs being the last time, Pip, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d foller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Joe, I am very glad you did so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure, dear Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, after we had shaken hands,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall never forget you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in a comfortable tone, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\xe2\x80\x99m sure of that.\r\nAy, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well\r\nround in a man\xe2\x80\x99s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time\r\nto get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow, I was not best pleased with Joe\xe2\x80\x99s being so mightily secure of\r\nme. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does you credit, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d or something of that sort. Therefore, I made\r\nno remark on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the\r\ntidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a\r\ngentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I\r\nwere one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you though?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity now, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you did not get on a little more,\r\nwhen we had our lessons here; isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so awful dull. I\xe2\x80\x99m only master\r\nof my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno more of a pity now, than it was\xe2\x80\x94this day twelvemonth\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to\r\ndo something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he had\r\nbeen better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly\r\ninnocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to\r\nBiddy in preference.\r\n\r\nSo, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our\r\nlittle garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a\r\ngeneral way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never\r\nforget her, said I had a favour to ask of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will not omit any opportunity of\r\nhelping Joe on, a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow helping him on?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Joe is a dear good fellow,\xe2\x80\x94in fact, I think he is the dearest\r\nfellow that ever lived,\xe2\x80\x94but he is rather backward in some things. For\r\ninstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her\r\neyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, his manners! won\xe2\x80\x99t his manners do then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Biddy, plucking a\r\nblack-currant leaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Biddy, they do very well here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! they _do_ very well here?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Biddy, looking closely at\r\nthe leaf in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me out,\xe2\x80\x94but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I\r\nshall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would\r\nhardly do him justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he knows that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most\r\ndistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nsmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that\r\nevening in the little garden by the side of the lane,\xe2\x80\x94said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nnever considered that he may be proud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! there are many kinds of pride,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, looking full at me and\r\nshaking her head; \xe2\x80\x9cpride is not all of one kind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? What are you stopping for?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot all of one kind,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe may be too proud to let any\r\none take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills\r\nwell and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it\r\nsounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry to see this in you. I did not\r\nexpect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You\r\nare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nshowing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have the heart to think so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9csay so. Say so\r\nover and over again, if you have the heart to think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in a\r\nvirtuous and superior tone; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t put it off upon me. I am very sorry\r\nto see it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad side of human nature. I did intend to\r\nask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was\r\ngone, of improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am\r\nextremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbad side of human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether you scold me or approve of me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned poor Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may\r\nequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at\r\nall times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no\r\ndifference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be\r\nunjust neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, turning away her head.\r\n\r\nI again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in\r\nwhich sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to\r\nthink I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy,\r\nand Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and\r\ntook a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very\r\nsorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright\r\nfortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.\r\n\r\nBut, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency\r\nto Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I\r\nhad, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,\r\nand presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his\r\nbreakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did not think it\r\nworth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are\r\nyou, and what can I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was\r\nslipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a\r\nprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous\r\nlittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let\r\ninto the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that\r\nheaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Trabb,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,\r\nbecause it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome\r\nproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up\r\nfrom the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going up to my guardian in London,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, casually drawing some\r\nguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; \xe2\x80\x9cand I want a fashionable\r\nsuit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,\xe2\x80\x9d I added\xe2\x80\x94otherwise I\r\nthought he might only pretend to make them, \xe2\x80\x9cwith ready money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened\r\nhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\r\nelbow, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate\r\nyou? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.\r\nWhen I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his\r\nlabours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into\r\nthe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\r\ncorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with\r\nany blacksmith, alive or dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold that noise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, \xe2\x80\x9cor\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll knock your head off!\xe2\x80\x94Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,\r\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out\r\nin a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand\r\nunder it to show the gloss, \xe2\x80\x9cis a very sweet article. I can recommend\r\nit for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you\r\nshall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!\xe2\x80\x9d (To the boy, and with\r\na dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\r\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\r\nThen he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd let\r\nme have none of your tricks here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, \xe2\x80\x9cor you shall repent\r\nit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\r\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\r\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it\r\nwould ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished\r\nfellow-townsman\xe2\x80\x99s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\r\nworn. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nTrabb to the boy after that, \xe2\x80\x9cor shall I kick you out of the shop and\r\nbring them myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njudgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.\r\nTrabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\r\nwith it, he said apologetically that it \xe2\x80\x9cwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do under existing\r\ncircumstances, sir,\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do at all.\xe2\x80\x9d So, Mr. Trabb measured and\r\ncalculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest\r\nspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I\r\nfelt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\r\npains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\r\nto Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\r\nupon the parlour lock, \xe2\x80\x9cI know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\r\nexpected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\r\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\r\nit. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.\xe2\x80\x94Door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\r\nit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\r\nhands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\r\nwas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\r\n\r\nAfter this memorable event, I went to the hatter\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\r\nbootmaker\xe2\x80\x99s, and the hosier\xe2\x80\x99s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndog whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also went\r\nto the coach-office and took my place for seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Saturday\r\nmorning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come\r\ninto a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,\r\nit followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention\r\ndiverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his\r\nmind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my\r\nsteps towards Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, and, as I approached that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace of business, I saw him standing at his door.\r\n\r\nHe was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with\r\nthe chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had\r\nprepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour, and he too ordered\r\nhis shopman to \xe2\x80\x9ccome out of the gangway\xe2\x80\x9d as my sacred person passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when\r\nhe and I and the collation were alone, \xe2\x80\x9cI give you joy of your good\r\nfortune. Well deserved, well deserved!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of\r\nexpressing himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for\r\nsome moments, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should have been the humble instrument of leading\r\nup to this, is a proud reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said\r\nor hinted, on that point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook; \xe2\x80\x9cif you will allow me to\r\ncall you so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI murmured \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands\r\nagain, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an\r\nemotional appearance, though it was rather low down, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young\r\nfriend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping\r\nthe fact before the mind of Joseph.\xe2\x80\x94Joseph!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, in\r\nthe way of a compassionate adjuration. \xe2\x80\x9cJoseph!! Joseph!!!\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon\r\nhe shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be hungry,\r\nyou must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the\r\nBoar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here\xe2\x80\x99s one or two\r\nlittle things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.\r\nBut do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he\r\nhad sat down, \xe2\x80\x9csee afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of\r\nhappy infancy? And may I\xe2\x80\x94_may_ I\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was\r\nfervent, and then sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us drink, Thanks to Fortune,\r\nand may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment! And yet I\r\ncannot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, \xe2\x80\x9csee afore me One\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nlikewise drink to One\xe2\x80\x94without again expressing\xe2\x80\x94May I\xe2\x80\x94_may_ I\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his\r\nglass and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned\r\nmyself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more\r\ndirect to my head.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of\r\ntongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and\r\ntook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! poultry,\r\npoultry! You little thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising the\r\nfowl in the dish, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you was a young fledgling, what was in store\r\nfor you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this\r\nhumble roof for one as\xe2\x80\x94Call it a weakness, if you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nPumblechook, getting up again, \xe2\x80\x9cbut may I? _may_ I\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he\r\ndid it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself\r\nwith my knife, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, after a little steady eating, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich had\r\nthe honour of bringing you up by hand! It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad picter, to reflect\r\nthat she\xe2\x80\x99s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour. May\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll drink her health,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid\r\nwith admiration, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way you know \xe2\x80\x99em, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who\r\nSir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person\r\npresent); \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever\r\nforgiving and ever affable. It might,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servile Pumblechook,\r\nputting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, \xe2\x80\x9cto a\r\ncommon person, have the appearance of repeating\xe2\x80\x94but _may_ I\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nus never be blind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cto her faults of temper, but\r\nit is to be hoped she meant well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\r\nthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\r\nsent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I\r\nmentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,\r\nand he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he\r\nintimated, worthy of my confidence, and\xe2\x80\x94in short, might he? Then he\r\nasked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we\r\nhad gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he\r\nhad ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken\r\nten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he\r\nnever had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of\r\nhearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling\r\nconvinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a\r\nsensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.\r\n\r\nBy degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask\r\nmy advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was\r\nan opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and\r\nseed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred\r\nbefore in that or any other neighbourhood. What alone was wanting to\r\nthe realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.\r\nThose were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him\r\n(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through\r\na sleeping partner, sir,\xe2\x80\x94which sleeping partner would have nothing to\r\ndo but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine the\r\nbooks,\xe2\x80\x94and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his\r\npocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,\xe2\x80\x94it appeared to him that that\r\nmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with\r\nproperty, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?\r\nHe had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it\r\nas my opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d The united vastness and distinctness of\r\nthis view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake\r\nhands with me, but said he really must,\xe2\x80\x94and did.\r\n\r\nWe drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and\r\nover again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what mark), and\r\nto render me efficient and constant service (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nservice). He also made known to me for the first time in my life, and\r\ncertainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had\r\nalways said of me, \xe2\x80\x9cThat boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwill be no common fortun\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d He said with a tearful smile that it was a\r\nsingular thing to think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out\r\ninto the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted\r\nin the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got\r\nto the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.\r\n\r\nThere, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s hailing me. He was a long way\r\ndown the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to\r\nstop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without\r\nthat affability on your part.\xe2\x80\x94May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?\r\n_May_ I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young\r\ncarter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed me\r\nand stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the\r\nroad; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge\r\nbefore I pursued my way home.\r\n\r\nI had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little\r\nI possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that\r\nsame afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want\r\nnext morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.\r\n\r\nSo, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I\r\nwent to Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to\r\nMiss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s own room was given up to me to dress\r\nin, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My\r\nclothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and\r\neagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a\r\ntrifle short of the wearer\xe2\x80\x99s expectation. But after I had had my new\r\nsuit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of\r\nposturing with Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s very limited dressing-glass, in the\r\nfutile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being\r\nmarket morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.\r\nPumblechook was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to\r\nleave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before\r\ndeparting. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new\r\narray, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious\r\nafter all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin his Sunday suit.\r\n\r\nI went circuitously to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s by all the back ways, and rang\r\nat the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my\r\ngloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when\r\nshe saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned\r\nfrom brown to green and yellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou? Good gracious! What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to London, Miss Pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand want to say good-bye\r\nto Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went\r\nto ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned\r\nand took me up, staring at me all the way.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread\r\ntable, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore,\r\nand at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then\r\njust abreast of the rotted bride-cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go, Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d I was exceedingly\r\ncareful what I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I thought you would kindly not mind my taking\r\nleave of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a gay figure, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, making her crutch stick play\r\nround me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were\r\nbestowing the finishing gift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss\r\nHavisham,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with\r\ndelight. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen Mr. Jaggers. _I_ have heard about it, Pip. So you\r\ngo to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are adopted by a rich person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot named?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her\r\nenjoyment of Sarah Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s jealous dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nhave a promising career before you. Be good\xe2\x80\x94deserve it\xe2\x80\x94and abide by Mr.\r\nJaggers\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and\r\nSarah\xe2\x80\x99s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Pip!\xe2\x80\x94you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my\r\nlips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came\r\nnaturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket\r\nwith triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with\r\nboth her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly\r\nlighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.\r\n\r\nSarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen\r\nout. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree\r\nconfounded. I said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Miss Pocket;\xe2\x80\x9d but she merely stared, and\r\ndid not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the\r\nhouse, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, took off my new\r\nclothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,\r\ncarrying it\xe2\x80\x94to speak the truth\xe2\x80\x94much more at my ease too, though I had\r\nthe bundle to carry.\r\n\r\nAnd now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run\r\nout fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more\r\nsteadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled\r\naway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\r\nappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\r\ndressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\r\nsplendour\t until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,\r\ngraced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish\r\nwith. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nI was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\r\nhand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\r\nalone. I am afraid\xe2\x80\x94sore afraid\xe2\x80\x94that this purpose originated in my sense\r\nof the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the\r\ncoach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of\r\nthis taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on\r\nthis last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had\r\nan impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in\r\nthe morning. I did not.\r\n\r\nAll night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\r\ninstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\r\npigs, now men,\xe2\x80\x94never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me\r\nuntil the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\r\npartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\r\ntaking it fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\r\nsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\r\nI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the\r\nafternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking\r\nof the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go\r\ndownstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and\r\nunstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,\r\nuntil Biddy called to me that I was late.\r\n\r\nIt was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\r\nsaying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I suppose I must be off!\xe2\x80\x9d and then I kissed my sister who was\r\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,\r\nand threw my arms around Joe\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Then I took up my little\r\nportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I\r\npresently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing\r\nan old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped\r\nthen, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above\r\nhis head, crying huskily \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar!\xe2\x80\x9d and Biddy put her apron to her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nI walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\r\nsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\r\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\r\nStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\r\npeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\r\nshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\r\nbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\r\nand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\r\nvillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, O my dear,\r\ndear friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\r\nupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\r\nbetter after I had cried than before,\xe2\x80\x94more sorry, more aware of my own\r\ningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\r\nwith me then.\r\n\r\nSo subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the\r\ncourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was\r\nclear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would\r\nnot get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another\r\nevening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made\r\nup my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite\r\npracticable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while\r\nI was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact\r\nresemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my\r\nheart would beat high.\xe2\x80\x94As if he could possibly be there!\r\n\r\nWe changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to\r\ngo back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and\r\nthe world lay spread before me.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the first stage of Pip\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five\r\nhours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by\r\nwhich I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about\r\nthe Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.\r\n\r\nWe Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was\r\ntreasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything:\r\notherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I\r\nmight have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly,\r\ncrooked, narrow, and dirty.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and\r\nhe had written after it on his card, \xe2\x80\x9cjust out of Smithfield, and close\r\nby the coach-office.\xe2\x80\x9d Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to\r\nhave as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed\r\nme up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier\r\nof steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on\r\nhis box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old\r\nweather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a\r\nwork of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets\r\noutside, and ragged things behind for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many footmen to\r\nhold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from\r\nyielding to the temptation.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\r\nstraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman\r\nbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop\r\nwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\r\ndoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked the coachman.\r\n\r\nThe coachman answered, \xe2\x80\x9cA shilling\xe2\x80\x94unless you wish to make it more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI naturally said I had no wish to make it more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it must be a shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the coachman. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nget into trouble. _I_ know _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d He darkly closed an eye at Mr.\r\nJaggers\xe2\x80\x99s name, and shook his head.\r\n\r\nWhen he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the\r\nascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his\r\nmind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\r\nhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in Court at present. Am I\r\naddressing Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say how\r\nlong he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time\r\nbeing valuable, that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be longer than he can help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner\r\nchamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a\r\nvelveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on\r\nbeing interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and wait outside, Mike,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\r\n\r\nI began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk\r\nshoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,\r\nand tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most\r\ndismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head,\r\nand the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted\r\nthemselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers\r\nabout, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd\r\nobjects about, that I should not have expected to see,\xe2\x80\x94such as an old\r\nrusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and\r\npackages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly\r\nswollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s own high-backed\r\nchair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,\r\nlike a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and\r\nbit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the\r\nclients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the\r\nwall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s chair, being greasy with\r\nshoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled\r\nforth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being\r\nturned out.\r\n\r\nI sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\r\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\r\neverybody else\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\r\nother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\r\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\r\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\r\nthere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\r\nill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\r\nblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\r\nOf course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits\r\nmay have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and\r\ngrit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s close room, until I really could not bear the two casts\r\non the shelf above Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and got up and went out.\r\n\r\nWhen I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I\r\nwaited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into\r\nSmithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being\r\nall asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to\r\nme. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a\r\nstreet where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s bulging at me\r\nfrom behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate\r\nPrison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered\r\nwith straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and\r\nfrom the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits\r\nand beer, I inferred that the trials were on.\r\n\r\nWhile I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk\r\nminister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a\r\ntrial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half\r\na crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice\r\nin his wig and robes,\xe2\x80\x94mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and\r\npresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I\r\ndeclined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as\r\nto take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also\r\nwhere people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nDoor, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest\r\nof that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that \xe2\x80\x9cfour on \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwould come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the\r\nmorning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a\r\nsickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his\r\npocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not\r\nbelonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had\r\nbought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought\r\nmyself well rid of him for a shilling.\r\n\r\nI dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I\r\nfound he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour\r\nof Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became\r\naware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as\r\nI. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew\r\nClose, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the\r\npavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when\r\nthey first passed me, that \xe2\x80\x9cJaggers would do it if it was to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and\r\none of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted\r\nher by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cJaggers\r\nis for him, \xe2\x80\x99Melia, and what more _could_ you have?\xe2\x80\x9d There was a\r\nred-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering\r\nthere, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;\r\nand while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a\r\nhighly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a\r\nlamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cO Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,\r\ngive me Jaggerth!\xe2\x80\x9d These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian\r\nmade a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than\r\never.\r\n\r\nAt length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close\r\ninto Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards\r\nme. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there\r\nwas quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and\r\nwalking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed\r\nhimself to his followers.\r\n\r\nFirst, he took the two secret men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I have nothing to say to _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\r\nfinger at them. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know no more than I know. As to the result,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you\r\npaid Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe made the money up this morning, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men,\r\nsubmissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it\r\nup at all. Has Wemmick got it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said both the men together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; then you may go. Now, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Jaggers,\r\nwaving his hand at them to put them behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you say a word to\r\nme, I\xe2\x80\x99ll throw up the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought, Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d one of the men began, pulling off his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I told you not to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ thought! I\r\nthink for you; that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\r\nfind you; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to find me. Now I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\r\nagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on\r\nthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly\r\nseparated,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Amelia, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cthat but for me you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed both women together. \xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you, sir, well\r\nwe knows that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Bill, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d the crying woman pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I tell you what!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce for all. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that your Bill\xe2\x80\x99s in good hands, I know it. And if you come here\r\nbothering about your Bill, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make an example of both your Bill and\r\nyou, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, sir! Every farden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94one single word\xe2\x80\x94and Wemmick shall give you your money back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No\r\none remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\r\nskirts of Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s coat to his lips several times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know this man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\r\nstrain: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this fellow want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cLet go of my coat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing\r\nit, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHabraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cI am over the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly father, Mithter Jaggerth!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my excitable acquaintance,\r\nturning white, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t thay you\xe2\x80\x99re again Habraham Latharuth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cand there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it. Get out of the\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen\xe2\x80\x99th gone to Mithter\r\nWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth.

Without further\r\ninterruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and\r\nthe man in velveteen with the fur cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Mike,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and\r\napproaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of\r\nhair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling\r\nat the bell-rope; \xe2\x80\x9cyour man comes on this afternoon. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a\r\nconstitutional cold; \xe2\x80\x9carter a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found one, sir, as\r\nmight do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he prepared to swear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this\r\ntime; \xe2\x80\x9cin a general way, anythink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I warned you before,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you\r\never presumed to talk in that way here, I\xe2\x80\x99d make an example of you. You\r\ninfernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious\r\nwhat he had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpooney!\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his\r\nelbow. \xe2\x80\x9cSoft Head! Need you say it face to face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I ask you, you blundering booby,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian, very sternly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9conce more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is\r\nprepared to swear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson\r\nfrom his face, and slowly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAyther to character, or to having\r\nbeen in his company and never left him all the night in question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, be careful. In what station of life is this man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the\r\nceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before\r\nbeginning to reply in a nervous manner, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve dressed him up like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhen my guardian blustered out,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You WILL, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cSpooney!\xe2\x80\x9d added the clerk again, with another stir.)\r\n\r\nAfter some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dressed like a \xe2\x80\x99spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my guardian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike, \xe2\x80\x9ca setting on some doorsteps round the\r\ncorner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him past that window, and let me see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it,\r\nbehind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an\r\naccidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short\r\nsuit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was\r\nnot by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of\r\nrecovery, which was painted over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him to take his witness away directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian to the\r\nclerk, in extreme disgust, \xe2\x80\x9cand ask him what he means by bringing such\r\na fellow as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,\r\nstanding, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed\r\nto bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements\r\nhe had made for me. I was to go to \xe2\x80\x9cBarnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn,\xe2\x80\x9d to young Mr.\r\nPocket\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I\r\nwas to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go\r\nwith him to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked\r\nit. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,\xe2\x80\x94it was a very liberal\r\none,\xe2\x80\x94and had handed to me from one of my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s drawers, the cards\r\nof certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,\r\nand such other things as I could in reason want. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will find your\r\ncredit good, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt\r\nlike a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall by\r\nthis means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find\r\nyou outrunning the constable. Of course you\xe2\x80\x99ll go wrong somehow, but\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s no fault of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked\r\nMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth\r\nwhile, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me,\r\nif I pleased.\r\n\r\nI then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk\r\nwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I\r\naccompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.\r\nWe found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way\r\namong them by saying coolly yet decisively, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s no use; he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have a word to say to one of you;\xe2\x80\x9d and we soon got clear of them,\r\nand went on side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\r\nlike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\r\nstature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have\r\nbeen imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some\r\nmarks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been\r\nsofter and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.\r\nThe chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment\r\nover his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them\r\noff. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his\r\nlinen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for\r\nhe wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a\r\nlady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,\r\nthat several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were\r\nquite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering\r\neyes,\xe2\x80\x94small, keen, and black,\xe2\x80\x94and thin wide mottled lips. He had had\r\nthem, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you were never in London before?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ was new here once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cRum to think of now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are well acquainted with it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the moves of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a very wicked place?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, more for the sake of saying\r\nsomething than for information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\r\nplenty of people anywhere, who\xe2\x80\x99ll do that for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is bad blood between you and them,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, to soften it off\r\na little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about bad blood,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nmuch bad blood about. They\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to be got by\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes it worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch about the same, I should\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before\r\nhim: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the\r\nstreets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a\r\nmouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the\r\ntop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical\r\nappearance, and that he was not smiling at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Mr. Wemmick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, nodding in the direction. \xe2\x80\x9cAt Hammersmith, west of\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Say five miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re a regular cross-examiner!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\r\nwith an approving air. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know him. _I_ know him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\r\nthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\r\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\r\nwhen he said here we were at Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. My depression was not\r\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\r\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\r\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a\r\ndisembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection\r\nof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club\r\nfor Tom-cats.\r\n\r\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\r\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\r\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\r\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the\r\nmost dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever\r\nseen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those\r\nhouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and\r\ncurtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable\r\nmakeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,\r\nas if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of\r\nBarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the\r\npresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy\r\nmourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,\r\nand it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and\r\nhumiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry\r\nrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and\r\ncellar,\xe2\x80\x94rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand\r\nbesides\xe2\x80\x94addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Mixture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great\r\nexpectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nmistaking me; \xe2\x80\x9cthe retirement reminds you of the country. So it does\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\r\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\r\nthemselves without the means of coming down,\xe2\x80\x94to a set of chambers on\r\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\r\na label on the letter-box, \xe2\x80\x9cReturn shortly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hardly thought you\xe2\x80\x99d come so soon,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wemmick explained. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want me any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I keep the cash,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wemmick observed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall most likely meet\r\npretty often. Good day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\r\nthought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\r\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure! Yes. You\xe2\x80\x99re in the habit of shaking hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\r\nbut said yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got so out of it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept at last. Very\r\nglad, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window\r\nand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it\r\ncame down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not\r\nput my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view\r\nof the Inn through the window\xe2\x80\x99s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully\r\nlooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket, Junior\xe2\x80\x99s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly\r\nmaddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my\r\nname with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the\r\nwindow, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose\r\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\r\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\r\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\r\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\r\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nthat that is any excuse,\xe2\x80\x94for I thought, coming from the country, you\r\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\r\nMarket to get it good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\r\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think\r\nthis was a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cThis door sticks so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\r\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\r\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\r\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\r\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\r\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start\r\nout of my head, and as if this must be a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to lead the way. I\r\nam rather bare here, but I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make out tolerably\r\nwell till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably\r\nthrough to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk\r\nabout London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As\r\nto our table, you won\xe2\x80\x99t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied\r\nfrom our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your\r\nexpense, such being Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s directions. As to our lodging, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my\r\nfather hasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to give me, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be willing to take\r\nit, if he had. This is our sitting-room,\xe2\x80\x94just such chairs and tables\r\nand carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,\r\nbecause they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little\r\nbedroom; rather musty, but Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;\r\nthe furniture\xe2\x80\x99s hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the\r\npurpose; if you should want anything, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch it. The\r\nchambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you\xe2\x80\x99re holding the\r\nfruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite\r\nashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,\r\nOne, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I\r\nknew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless me, you\xe2\x80\x99re the prowling boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9care the pale young gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in\r\nBarnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, until we both burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of its being\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of its being _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. And then we\r\ncontemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\npale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humouredly, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nover now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive\r\nme for having knocked you about so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the\r\npale young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name) still rather confounded his intention with\r\nhis execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come into your good fortune at that time?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert\r\nPocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he acquiesced: \xe2\x80\x9cI heard it had happened very lately. _I_ was\r\nrather on the lookout for good fortune then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy\r\nto me. But she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94at all events, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad taste,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a fact. Yes, she had sent for\r\nme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I\r\nsuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been\r\nwhat-you-may-called it to Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, with sudden gravity.\r\n\r\nHe was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his\r\nattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffianced,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, still busy with the fruit. \xe2\x80\x9cBetrothed.\r\nEngaged. What\xe2\x80\x99s-his-named. Any word of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you bear your disappointment?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t care much for it. _She\xe2\x80\x99s_ a Tartar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl\xe2\x80\x99s hard and\r\nhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by\r\nMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat relation is she to Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly adopted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Mr. Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And\r\nnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come\r\nthere, that day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst\r\nout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nhim if _he_ was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know he is Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s man of business and solicitor, and has\r\nher confidence when nobody else has?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with\r\na constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers\r\nin Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s house on the very day of our combat, but never at\r\nany other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having\r\never seen me there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he\r\ncalled on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father\r\nfrom his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he\r\nis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.\r\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who\r\nmore strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural\r\nincapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something\r\nwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the\r\nsame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first\r\noccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nHe was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered\r\nlanguor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did\r\nnot seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face,\r\nbut it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.\r\nHis figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had\r\ntaken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be\r\nlight and young. Whether Mr. Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s local work would have sat more\r\ngracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious\r\nthat he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried\r\noff my new suit.\r\n\r\nAs he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a\r\nbad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,\r\nand laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.\r\nI further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a\r\ncountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would\r\ntake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\r\nhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I venture to prophesy that you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwant very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I\r\nshould like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me\r\nthe favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my\r\nChristian name was Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take to Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it sounds like a moral\r\nboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,\r\nor so fat that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that\r\nhe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in\r\nthe neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious,\r\nand you have been a blacksmith,\xe2\x80\x94would you mind it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind anything that you propose,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind Handel for a familiar name? There\xe2\x80\x99s a charming piece of\r\nmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, my dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning round as the door opened,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the\r\ntable, because the dinner is of your providing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a\r\nnice little dinner,\xe2\x80\x94seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Feast,\xe2\x80\x94and it\r\nacquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\r\ncircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.\r\nThis again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the\r\nbanquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have\r\nsaid, the lap of luxury,\xe2\x80\x94being entirely furnished forth from the\r\ncoffee-house,\xe2\x80\x94the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a\r\ncomparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter\r\nthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell\r\nover them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the\r\nbookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into\r\nmy bed in the next room,\xe2\x80\x94where I found much of its parsley and butter\r\nin a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made\r\nthe feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my\r\npleasure was without alloy.\r\n\r\nWe had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his\r\npromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the\r\ntopic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put\r\nthe knife in the mouth,\xe2\x80\x94for fear of accidents,\xe2\x80\x94and that while the fork\r\nis reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It\r\nis scarcely worth mentioning, only it\xe2\x80\x99s as well to do as other people\r\ndo. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This\r\nhas two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is\r\nthe object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening\r\noysters, on the part of the right elbow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we\r\nboth laughed and I scarcely blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\r\nknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\r\nfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\r\nyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it should be\r\na crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\r\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\r\nand brew. You see it every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot on any account,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a public-house may keep a\r\ngentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\r\ndaughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham was an only child?\xe2\x80\x9d I hazarded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she\r\nhad a half-brother. Her father privately married again\xe2\x80\x94his cook, I\r\nrather think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was proud,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\r\nbecause he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died. When she was\r\ndead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\r\nthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\r\nacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\r\nextravagant, undutiful,\xe2\x80\x94altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\r\nhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\r\nnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x94Take another glass of wine,\r\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to\r\nbe so strictly conscientious in emptying one\xe2\x80\x99s glass, as to turn it\r\nbottom upwards with the rim on one\xe2\x80\x99s nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\r\nthanked him, and apologised. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d and resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\r\nas a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\r\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\r\nThere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\r\nbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a\r\ndeep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,\xe2\x80\x94merely breaking off,\r\nmy dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a\r\ntumbler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\r\nsay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\r\nmuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\r\nwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he\r\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner, \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x9d and resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere appeared upon the scene\xe2\x80\x94say at the races, or the public balls,\r\nor anywhere else you like\xe2\x80\x94a certain man, who made love to Miss\r\nHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\r\nbefore you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\r\nhe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he\r\nwas not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a\r\ngentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a\r\nprinciple of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever\r\nwas, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no\r\nvarnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you\r\nput on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued\r\nMiss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe\r\nshe had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the\r\nsusceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she\r\npassionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized\r\nhim. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got\r\ngreat sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out\r\nof a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his\r\nfather) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband\r\nhe must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love\r\nto be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with\r\nthe exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or\r\njealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she\r\nwas doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too\r\nunreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily\r\nordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has\r\nnever seen her since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought of her having said, \xe2\x80\x9cMatthew will come and see me at last\r\nwhen I am laid dead upon that table;\xe2\x80\x9d and I asked Herbert whether his\r\nfather was so inveterate against her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she charged him, in the presence of her\r\nintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\r\nher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would\r\nlook true\xe2\x80\x94even to him\xe2\x80\x94and even to her. To return to the man and make an\r\nend of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were\r\nbought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were\r\ninvited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich she received,\xe2\x80\x9d I struck in, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she was dressing for her\r\nmarriage? At twenty minutes to nine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the hour and minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, nodding, \xe2\x80\x9cat which she\r\nafterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it\r\nmost heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she\r\nlaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never\r\nsince looked upon the light of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all the story?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, after considering it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it\r\nout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss\r\nHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was\r\nabsolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one\r\nthing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\r\nconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it\r\nwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder he didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry her and get all the property,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have\r\nbeen a part of her half-brother\xe2\x80\x99s scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cMind! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat became of the two men?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, after again considering the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey fell into deeper shame and degradation\xe2\x80\x94if there can be deeper\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they alive now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but\r\nadopted. When adopted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has always been an Estella,\r\nsince I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now,\r\nHandel,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is\r\na perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss\r\nHavisham, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all that I know,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity\r\nbetween you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your\r\nadvancement in life,\xe2\x80\x94namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to\r\nwhom you owe it,\xe2\x80\x94you may be very sure that it will never be encroached\r\nupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject\r\ndone with, even though I should be under his father\xe2\x80\x99s roof for years\r\nand years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I\r\nfelt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as\r\nI understood the fact myself.\r\n\r\nIt had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for\r\nthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the\r\nlighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to\r\nbe the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, what he was? He replied, \xe2\x80\x9cA capitalist,\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nInsurer of Ships.\xe2\x80\x9d I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in\r\nsearch of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nCity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in\r\nthe City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer\r\non his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible\r\nhead open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd\r\nimpression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in\r\ninsuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut\r\ninto the Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of\r\nthese things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on\r\nmy own account. I think I shall trade,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, leaning back in his\r\nchair, \xe2\x80\x9cto the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and\r\nprecious woods. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the profits are large?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTremendous!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall trade, also,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting his thumbs in his\r\nwaist-coat pockets, \xe2\x80\x9cto the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.\r\nAlso to Ceylon, especially for elephants\xe2\x80\x99 tusks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will want a good many ships,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA perfect fleet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nQuite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked\r\nhim where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t begun insuring yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI am looking about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. I said\r\n(in a tone of conviction), \xe2\x80\x9cAh-h!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs a counting-house profitable?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo\xe2\x80\x94do you mean to the young fellow who\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, n-no; not to me.\xe2\x80\x9d He said this with the air of one carefully\r\nreckoning up and striking a balance. \xe2\x80\x9cNot directly profitable. That is,\r\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay me anything, and I have to\xe2\x80\x94keep myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as\r\nif I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative\r\ncapital from such a source of income.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the thing is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert Pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you look about you.\r\n_That\xe2\x80\x99s_ the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and\r\nyou look about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck me as a singular implication that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be out of a\r\ncounting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred\r\nto his experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the time comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you see your opening. And\r\nyou go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then\r\nthere you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing\r\nto do but employ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;\r\nvery like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded\r\nto his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all\r\nblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then.\r\nIt was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest\r\nnecessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have\r\nbeen sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.\r\n\r\nYet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so\r\nunassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being\r\npuffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,\r\nand we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the\r\nstreets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to\r\nchurch at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the\r\nParks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nOn a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had\r\nleft Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them\r\npartook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That\r\nI could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on\r\nthe very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of\r\nimpossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the\r\nLondon streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the\r\ndusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I\r\nhad put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of\r\nnight, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning\r\nabout Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the\r\ncounting-house to report himself,\xe2\x80\x94to look about him, too, I\r\nsuppose,\xe2\x80\x94and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or two\r\nto attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It\r\nappeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched\r\nwere incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging\r\nfrom the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday\r\nmorning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my\r\neyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard,\r\nof a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another\r\nback second floor, rather than a look out.\r\n\r\nI waited about until it was noon, and I went upon \xe2\x80\x99Change, and I saw\r\nfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to\r\nbe great merchants, though I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they should all be\r\nout of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a\r\ncelebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have\r\nbeen the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help\r\nnoticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths\r\nand knives and waiters\xe2\x80\x99 clothes, than in the steaks. This collation\r\ndisposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was not\r\ncharged for), we went back to Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn and got my little\r\nportmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at\r\ntwo or three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk\r\nto Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct\r\ninto a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s children\r\nwere playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my\r\ninterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s children were not growing up or being brought up, but\r\nwere tumbling up.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\r\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s two nurse-maids\r\nwere looking about them while the children played. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHerbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is young Mr. Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\r\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Alick and Miss Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the nurses to two of the\r\nchildren, \xe2\x80\x9cif you go a bouncing up against them bushes you\xe2\x80\x99ll fall over\r\ninto the river and be drownded, and what\xe2\x80\x99ll your pa say then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchief, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIf that don\xe2\x80\x99t make six times you\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped it, Mum!\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which\r\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Flopson,\xe2\x80\x9d and settling\r\nherself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance\r\nimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been\r\nreading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,\r\nshe fixed her eyes upon me, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope your mamma is quite\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x9d This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I\r\nbegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such\r\nperson I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have\r\nbeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the\r\nnurse came to my rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, \xe2\x80\x9cif that don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\r\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\r\nrecognition, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Flopson,\xe2\x80\x9d and forgot me, and went on\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\r\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\r\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the\r\nregion of air, wailing dolefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there ain\xe2\x80\x99t Baby!\xe2\x80\x9d said Flopson, appearing to think it most\r\nsurprising. \xe2\x80\x9cMake haste up, Millers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by\r\ndegrees the child\xe2\x80\x99s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a\r\nyoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all\r\nthe time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\r\n\r\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\r\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\r\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\r\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\r\ntumbled over her,\xe2\x80\x94always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\r\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\r\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\r\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\r\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\r\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\r\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious me, Flopson!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\r\nmoment, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody\xe2\x80\x99s tumbling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious you, indeed, Mum!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Flopson, very red in the face;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat have you got there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ got here, Flopson?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t your footstool!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Flopson. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you keep it\r\nunder your skirts like that, who\xe2\x80\x99s to help tumbling? Here! Take the\r\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\r\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\r\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\r\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made\r\nthe second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the\r\nlittle Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the\r\nchildren into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket\r\ncame out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to\r\nfind that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression\r\nof face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t quite see his way to putting anything straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to\r\nsee him. \xe2\x80\x9cFor, I really am not,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with his son\xe2\x80\x99s smile, \xe2\x80\x9can\r\nalarming personage.\xe2\x80\x9d He was a young-looking man, in spite of his\r\nperplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite\r\nnatural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;\r\nthere was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would\r\nhave been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was\r\nvery near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to\r\nMrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which\r\nwere black and handsome, \xe2\x80\x9cBelinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd she looked up from her book, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She then smiled upon\r\nme in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of\r\norange-flower water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on\r\nany foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been\r\nthrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversational\r\ncondescension.\r\n\r\nI found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.\r\nPocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased\r\nKnight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased\r\nfather would have been made a Baronet but for somebody\xe2\x80\x99s determined\r\nopposition arising out of entirely personal motives,\xe2\x80\x94I forget whose, if\r\nI ever knew,\xe2\x80\x94the Sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s, the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s, the Lord\r\nChancellor\xe2\x80\x99s, the Archbishop of Canterbury\xe2\x80\x99s, anybody\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x94and had tacked\r\nhimself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite\r\nsupposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for\r\nstorming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate\r\naddress engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first\r\nstone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage\r\neither the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed\r\nMrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature\r\nof things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the\r\nacquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.\r\n\r\nSo successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\r\nby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\r\nperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\r\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\r\nalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to\r\nmount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing\r\nthe one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket\r\nhad taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it\r\nwould seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the\r\nknowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing\r\nto bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that\r\ndower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket\r\nthat his wife was \xe2\x80\x9ca treasure for a Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pocket had invested\r\nthe Prince\xe2\x80\x99s treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was\r\nsupposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.\r\nPocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,\r\nbecause she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of\r\na queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a\r\npleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for\r\nmy own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other\r\nsimilar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle\r\nand Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of\r\narchitecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,\r\nwas reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of\r\nexploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house\r\nand let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the\r\nservants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of\r\nsaving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the\r\nservants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their\r\neating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They\r\nallowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always\r\nappeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded\r\nin would have been the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x94always supposing the boarder capable of\r\nself-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring lady\r\nwith whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that\r\nshe had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs.\r\nPocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it\r\nwas an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind their own\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBy degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been\r\neducated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished\r\nhimself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket\r\nvery early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the\r\ncalling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,\xe2\x80\x94of whom\r\nit was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always\r\ngoing to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the\r\nblades had left the Grindstone,\xe2\x80\x94he had wearied of that poor work and\r\nhad come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x9cread\xe2\x80\x9d with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,\r\nand had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned\r\nhis acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,\r\nand on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still\r\nmaintained the house I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that highly\r\nsympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,\r\nand shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.\r\nThis lady\xe2\x80\x99s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking her\r\ndown to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand\r\non the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.\r\nPocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read\r\nwith him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and\r\nconfidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five\r\nminutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dear Mrs. Pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Coiler, \xe2\x80\x9cafter her early\r\ndisappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that),\r\nrequires so much luxury and elegance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is of so aristocratic a disposition\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d I said again, with the same object as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94That it _is_ hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Coiler, \xe2\x80\x9cto have dear Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s time\r\nand attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s time\r\nand attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,\r\nand indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nIt came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and\r\nDrummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and\r\nother instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian\r\nname was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It\r\nfurther appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the\r\ngarden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which\r\nher grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at\r\nall. Drummle didn\xe2\x80\x99t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a\r\nsulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.\r\nPocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler\r\nthe toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the\r\nconversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but\r\nit promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the\r\nannouncement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook\r\nhad mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first\r\ntime, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance\r\nthat struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on\r\nanybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He\r\nlaid down the carving-knife and fork,\xe2\x80\x94being engaged in carving, at the\r\nmoment,\xe2\x80\x94put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make\r\nan extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done\r\nthis, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with\r\nwhat he was about.\r\n\r\nMrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked\r\nit for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the\r\npleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at me\r\nwhen she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and\r\nlocalities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and\r\nwhen she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little\r\nto her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for\r\nbeing on the opposite side of the table.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made\r\nadmiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,\xe2\x80\x94a sagacious way of\r\nimproving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little\r\nboys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby\xe2\x80\x99s next\r\nsuccessor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and\r\nMillers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been\r\nrecruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.\r\nPocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she\r\nrather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what to make of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flopson. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake it that way, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll get its head under the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon\r\nthe table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious\r\nconcussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flopson; \xe2\x80\x9cand Miss Jane, come\r\nand dance to baby, do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\r\ntaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place\r\nby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and\r\nlaughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the\r\nmeantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,\r\nand we all laughed and were glad.\r\n\r\nFlopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,\r\nthen got it safely into Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s lap, and gave it the nut-crackers\r\nto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice\r\nthat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\r\neyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the\r\ntwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase\r\nwith a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly\r\nlost half his buttons at the gaming-table.\r\n\r\nI was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s falling into a\r\ndiscussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a\r\nsliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the\r\nbaby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.\r\nAt length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,\r\nsoftly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the\r\ndangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the\r\nsame time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma dear,\xe2\x80\x9d lisped the little girl, \xe2\x80\x9cbaby ood have put hith eyeth\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you tell me so?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs. Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and sit down in\r\nyour chair this moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if\r\nI myself had done something to rouse it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelinda,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the\r\nprotection of baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not allow anybody to interfere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsurprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of\r\ninterference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to\r\nsave them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be interfered with by Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, with a\r\nmajestic glance at that innocent little offender. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I know my\r\npoor grandpapa\xe2\x80\x99s position. Jane, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did\r\nlift himself some inches out of his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cHear this!\xe2\x80\x9d he helplessly\r\nexclaimed to the elements. \xe2\x80\x9cBabies are to be nut-crackered dead, for\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s poor grandpapa\xe2\x80\x99s positions!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he let himself down again,\r\nand became silent.\r\n\r\nWe all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A\r\npause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a\r\nseries of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the\r\nonly member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had\r\nany decided acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Drummle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you ring for Flopson? Jane, you\r\nundutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with\r\nma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might. It\r\ndoubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s arm, exhibited a\r\npair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its\r\nsoft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it\r\ngained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a\r\nfew minutes, being nursed by little Jane.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the other five children were left behind at the\r\ndinner-table, through Flopson\xe2\x80\x99s having some private engagement, and\r\ntheir not being anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s business. I thus became aware of the\r\nmutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in\r\nthe following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his\r\nface heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,\r\nas if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in\r\nthat establishment, and why they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been billeted by Nature on\r\nsomebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain\r\nquestions,\xe2\x80\x94as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,\r\nFlopson was going to mend it when she had time,\xe2\x80\x94and how little Fanny\r\ncame by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it\r\nwhen she didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and\r\ngave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as\r\nthey went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the\r\nhair he dismissed the hopeless subject.\r\n\r\nIn the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop\r\nhad each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I\r\nwas pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but\r\nas I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,\xe2\x80\x94not to\r\nsay for other waters,\xe2\x80\x94I at once engaged to place myself under the\r\ntuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to\r\nwhom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority\r\nconfused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he\r\ncould have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt\r\nif he would have paid it.\r\n\r\nThere was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we\r\nshould all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable\r\ndomestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid\r\ncame in, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to your master?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or\r\nspeak to me\xe2\x80\x94at some other time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegging your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the housemaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI should wish to\r\nspeak at once, and to speak to master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of\r\nourselves until he came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pretty thing, Belinda!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pocket, returning with a\r\ncountenance expressive of grief and despair. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the cook lying\r\ninsensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh\r\nbutter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nthat odious Sophia\xe2\x80\x99s doing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Belinda?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSophia has told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I not see her with my own\r\neyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask\r\nto speak to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Pocket,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand shown me the woman, and the bundle too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you defend her, Matthew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cfor making\r\nmischief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I, grandpapa\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful\r\nwoman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after\r\nthe situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the\r\nattitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a\r\nhollow voice, \xe2\x80\x9cGood night, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d when I deemed it advisable to go\r\nto bed and leave him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and\r\nhad gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had\r\nordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk\r\ntogether. He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he\r\nreferred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed\r\nfor any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my\r\ndestiny if I could \xe2\x80\x9chold my own\xe2\x80\x9d with the average of young men in\r\nprosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nHe advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition\r\nof such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the\r\nfunctions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that\r\nwith intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,\r\nand should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his\r\nway of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself\r\non confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state\r\nat once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his\r\ncompact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling\r\nmine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no\r\ndoubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no\r\nsuch excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever\r\nregard him as having anything ludicrous about him\xe2\x80\x94or anything but what\r\nwas serious, honest, and good\xe2\x80\x94in his tutor communication with me.\r\n\r\nWhen these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had\r\nbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my\r\nbedroom in Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my\r\nmanners would be none the worse for Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s society. Mr. Pocket did\r\nnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could\r\npossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt\r\nthat this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would\r\nsave Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted\r\nmy wish to Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could buy the furniture now hired for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand one or\r\ntwo other little things, I should be quite at home there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you you\xe2\x80\x99d get\r\non. Well! How much do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much? Fifty pounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, not nearly so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive pounds?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\nThis was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, \xe2\x80\x9cO, more than\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than that, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with\r\nhis hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the\r\nwall behind me; \xe2\x80\x9chow much more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so difficult to fix a sum,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get at it. Twice five; will that do?\r\nThree times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I thought that would do handsomely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour times five will do handsomely, will it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers,\r\nknitting his brows. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what do you make of four times five?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers; \xe2\x80\x9chow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you make it twenty pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what _I_ make it, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Jaggers, with a\r\nknowing and contradictory toss of his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what _you_\r\nmake it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty pounds, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWemmick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. \xe2\x80\x9cTake Mr. Pip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwritten order, and pay him twenty pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked\r\nimpression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never\r\nlaughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising\r\nhimself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows\r\njoined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to\r\ncreak, as if _they_ laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened\r\nto go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to\r\nWemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him that, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll take it as a compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wemmick;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you _should_ know what to make of it.\xe2\x80\x94Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d for I\r\nlooked surprised, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not personal; it\xe2\x80\x99s professional: only\r\nprofessional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick was at his desk, lunching\xe2\x80\x94and crunching\xe2\x80\x94on a dry hard biscuit;\r\npieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as\r\nif he were posting them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cas if he had set a man-trap and\r\nwas watching it. Suddenly\xe2\x80\x94click\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re caught!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life,\r\nI said I supposed he was very skilful?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cas Australia.\xe2\x80\x9d Pointing with his pen at the\r\noffice floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the\r\npurposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the\r\nglobe. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there was anything deeper,\xe2\x80\x9d added Wemmick, bringing his pen\r\nto paper, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d be it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCa-pi-tal!\xe2\x80\x9d Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he\r\nreplied,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t run much into clerks, because there\xe2\x80\x99s only one Jaggers, and\r\npeople won\xe2\x80\x99t have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would\r\nyou like to see \xe2\x80\x99em? You are one of us, as I may say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the\r\npost, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of\r\nwhich safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his\r\ncoat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark\r\nand shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.\r\nJaggers\xe2\x80\x99s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase\r\nfor years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something\r\nbetween a publican and a rat-catcher\xe2\x80\x94a large pale, puffed, swollen\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby\r\nappearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to\r\nbe treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s coffers. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting evidence\r\ntogether,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the Bailey.\xe2\x80\x9d In the\r\nroom over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair\r\n(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was\r\nsimilarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented\r\nto me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt\r\nme anything I pleased,\xe2\x80\x94and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,\r\nas if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a\r\nhigh-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was\r\ndressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been\r\nwaxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of\r\nthe other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s own use.\r\n\r\nThis was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick\r\nled me into my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s room, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them\r\ncaught my sight again, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose likenesses are those?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off\r\nthe horrible heads before bringing them down. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are two celebrated\r\nones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap\r\n(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the\r\ninkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered\r\nhis master, and, considering that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t brought up to evidence,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t plan it badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it like him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat\r\nupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike him? It\xe2\x80\x99s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,\r\ndirectly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me,\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Old Artful?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. He then explained this\r\naffectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady\r\nand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad it made for me, express!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the lady anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly his game. (You liked your bit of game,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except\r\none,\xe2\x80\x94and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something to\r\ndrink in it.\xe2\x80\x9d Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he\r\nput down the cast, and polished the brooch with his\r\npocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid that other creature come to the same end?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has the\r\nsame look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the genuine look. Much as if one\r\nnostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he\r\ncame to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He\r\nforged wills, this blade did, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t also put the supposed\r\ntestators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr.\r\nWemmick was again apostrophising), \xe2\x80\x9cand you said you could write Greek.\r\nYah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBefore putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the\r\nlargest of his mourning rings and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSent out to buy it for me,\r\nonly the day before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,\r\nthe thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\r\nfrom like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\r\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood\r\nbefore me, dusting his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are all gifts of that kind. One brings\r\nanother, you see; that\xe2\x80\x99s the way of it. I always take \xe2\x80\x99em. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncuriosities. And they\xe2\x80\x99re property. They may not be worth much, but,\r\nafter all, they\xe2\x80\x99re property and portable. It don\xe2\x80\x99t signify to you with\r\nyour brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get hold of portable property\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a\r\nfriendly manner:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I\r\nshould consider it an honour. I have not much to show you; but such two\r\nor three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I\r\nam fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthen we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider that it\xe2\x80\x99s to come off, when\r\nconvenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll give you wine, and good wine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\r\nyou punch, and not bad punch. And now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something. When you\r\ngo to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I see something very uncommon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very\r\nuncommon, you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original\r\nwildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won\xe2\x80\x99t lower your\r\nopinion of Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s powers. Keep your eye on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his\r\npreparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I\r\nwould like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers \xe2\x80\x9cat it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor several reasons, and not least because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t clearly know what\r\nMr. Jaggers would be found to be \xe2\x80\x9cat,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied in the affirmative. We\r\ndived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a\r\nblood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the\r\nfanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably\r\nchewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or\r\ncross-examination,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which,\xe2\x80\x94and was striking her, and the\r\nbench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever\r\ndegree, said a word that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve of, he instantly required to\r\nhave it \xe2\x80\x9ctaken down.\xe2\x80\x9d If anybody wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make an admission, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have it out of you!\xe2\x80\x9d and if anybody made an admission, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I have got you!\xe2\x80\x9d The magistrates shivered under a single bite of\r\nhis finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his\r\nwords, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their\r\ndirection. Which side he was on I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out, for he seemed to\r\nme to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I\r\nstole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was\r\nmaking the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive\r\nunder the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the\r\nrepresentative of British law and justice in that chair that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book\r\nas if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an\r\nacquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, and\r\ncomprehension,\xe2\x80\x94in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the\r\nlarge, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he\r\nhimself lolled about in a room,\xe2\x80\x94he was idle, proud, niggardly,\r\nreserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,\r\nwho had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the\r\ndiscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley\r\nDrummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that\r\ngentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.\r\n\r\nStartop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought\r\nto have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and\r\nadmired her beyond measure. He had a woman\xe2\x80\x99s delicacy of feature, and\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas you may see, though you never saw her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexactly like his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d It was but natural that I should take to\r\nhim much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest\r\nevenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one\r\nanother, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in\r\nour wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He\r\nwould always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious\r\ncreature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and\r\nI always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the\r\nback-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the\r\nmoonlight in mid-stream.\r\n\r\nHerbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a\r\nhalf-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down\r\nto Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often\r\ntook me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all\r\nhours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so\r\npleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of\r\nuntried youth and hope.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been in Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCamilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Georgiana, whom I\r\nhad seen at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s on the same occasion, also turned up. She\r\nwas a cousin,\xe2\x80\x94an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity\r\nreligion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of\r\ncupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me\r\nin my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as a\r\ngrown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the\r\ncomplacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they held\r\nin contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily\r\ndisappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThese were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied\r\nmyself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began\r\nto spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should\r\nhave thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my\r\nbooks. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to\r\nfeel my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast;\r\nand, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I\r\nwanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as\r\ngreat a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.\r\n\r\nI had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write\r\nhim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He\r\nreplied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect\r\nme at the office at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,\r\nputting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you think of walking down to Walworth?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif you approve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d was Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s reply, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have had my legs under the\r\ndesk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nwhat I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nis of home preparation,\xe2\x80\x94and a cold roast fowl,\xe2\x80\x94which is from the\r\ncook\xe2\x80\x99s-shop. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s tender, because the master of the shop was a\r\nJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.\r\nI reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cPick us out a\r\ngood one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\r\nanother day or two, we could easily have done it.\xe2\x80\x9d He said to that,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.\xe2\x80\x9d I let him, of\r\ncourse. As far as it goes, it\xe2\x80\x99s property and portable. You don\xe2\x80\x99t object\r\nto an aged parent, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have got an aged parent at my place.\xe2\x80\x9d I then said what\r\npoliteness required.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, as we walked\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have an invitation to-morrow. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to ask your pals, too.\r\nThree of \xe2\x80\x99em; ain\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my\r\nintimate associates, I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to ask the whole gang,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I hardly felt complimented by\r\nthe word,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand whatever he gives you, he\xe2\x80\x99ll give you good. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nforward to variety, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll have excellence. And there\xe2\x80\x99s another rum\r\nthing in his house,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Wemmick, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, as if\r\nthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; \xe2\x80\x9che never lets a\r\ndoor or window be fastened at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he never robbed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says, and gives it out publicly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to see the man who\xe2\x80\x99ll rob _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d Lord bless you, I have heard him,\r\na hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in\r\nour front office, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn\r\nthere; why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\ntempt you?\xe2\x80\x9d Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,\r\nfor love or money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey dread him so much?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDread him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you they dread him. Not but what\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\r\nmetal, every spoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have much,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if they\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! But _he_ would have much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, cutting me short, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthey know it. He\xe2\x80\x99d have their lives, and the lives of scores of \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d have all he could get. And it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to say what he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget, if he gave his mind to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was falling into meditation on my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s greatness, when Wemmick\r\nremarked:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the absence of plate, that\xe2\x80\x99s only his natural depth, you know. A\r\nriver\xe2\x80\x99s its natural depth, and he\xe2\x80\x99s his natural depth. Look at his\r\nwatch-chain. That\xe2\x80\x99s real enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very massive,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMassive?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cI think so. And his watch is a gold\r\nrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a penny. Mr. Pip,\r\nthere are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\r\nthat watch; there\xe2\x80\x99s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it\r\nwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a\r\nmore general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the\r\nroad, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the\r\ndistrict of Walworth.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little\r\ngardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.\r\nWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of\r\ngarden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery\r\nmounted with guns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks pretty; don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;\r\nwith the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them\r\nsham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a real flagstaff, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand on Sundays I run\r\nup a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I\r\nhoist it up\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94and cut off the communication.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and\r\ntwo deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he\r\nhoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and\r\nnot merely mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock every night, Greenwich time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gun\r\nfires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsay he\xe2\x80\x99s a Stinger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,\r\nconstructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an\r\ningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, at the back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cout of sight, so as not to impede\r\nthe idea of fortifications,\xe2\x80\x94for it\xe2\x80\x99s a principle with me, if you have\r\nan idea, carry it out and keep it up,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether that\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nopinion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94At the back, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I\r\nknock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of\r\na time in point of provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was\r\napproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long\r\ntime to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.\r\nOur punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower\r\nwas raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which\r\nmight have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he\r\nhad constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill\r\ngoing and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent\r\nthat it made the back of your hand quite wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my\r\nown gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, in\r\nacknowledging my compliments. \xe2\x80\x9cWell; it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, you know. It\r\nbrushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put\r\nyou out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There we\r\nfound, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,\r\ncheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell aged parent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial\r\nand jocose way, \xe2\x80\x9chow am you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John; all right!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Pip, aged parent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish you could hear\r\nhis name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that\xe2\x80\x99s what he likes. Nod away at\r\nhim, if you please, like winking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fine place of my son\xe2\x80\x99s, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, while I\r\nnodded as hard as I possibly could. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pretty pleasure-ground,\r\nsir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\r\ntogether by the Nation, after my son\xe2\x80\x99s time, for the people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re as proud of it as Punch; ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, Aged?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick,\r\ncontemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_there\xe2\x80\x99s_ a nod for you;\xe2\x80\x9d giving him a tremendous one; \xe2\x80\x9c_there\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\nanother for you;\xe2\x80\x9d giving him a still more tremendous one; \xe2\x80\x9cyou like\r\nthat, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? If you\xe2\x80\x99re not tired, Mr. Pip\xe2\x80\x94though I know it\xe2\x80\x99s tiring\r\nto strangers\xe2\x80\x94will you tip him one more? You can\xe2\x80\x99t think how it pleases\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him\r\nbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\r\nthe arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had\r\ntaken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present\r\npitch of perfection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your own, Mr. Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cI have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfreehold, by George!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever seen it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cNever heard of it. Never seen the Aged.\r\nNever heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\r\nanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\r\nwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nin any way disagreeable to you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige me by doing the same. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish it professionally spoken about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\r\nrequest. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and\r\ntalking, until it was almost nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting near gun-fire,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s treat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\r\nwith expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\r\nnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\r\nmoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\r\nrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\r\nStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\r\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup\r\nin it ring. Upon this, the Aged\xe2\x80\x94who I believe would have been blown out\r\nof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows\xe2\x80\x94cried out exultingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s fired! I heerd him!\xe2\x80\x9d and I nodded at the old gentleman until it\r\nis no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\r\n\r\nThe interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me\r\nhis collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious\r\ncharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\r\ncommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and\r\nseveral manuscript confessions written under condemnation,\xe2\x80\x94upon which\r\nMr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, \xe2\x80\x9cevery\r\none of \xe2\x80\x99em Lies, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d These were agreeably dispersed among small\r\nspecimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the\r\nproprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.\r\nThey were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had\r\nbeen first inducted, and which served, not only as the general\r\nsitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan\r\non the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the\r\nsuspension of a roasting-jack.\r\n\r\nThere was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged\r\nin the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered\r\nto give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper\r\nwas excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot\r\ninsomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have\r\nbeen farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.\r\nNor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there\r\nbeing such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when\r\nI lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that\r\npole on my forehead all night.\r\n\r\nWemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him\r\ncleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from\r\nmy gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a\r\nmost devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at\r\nhalf-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,\r\nWemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened\r\ninto a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business\r\nand he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as\r\nunconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the\r\ndrawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,\r\nhad all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the\r\nStinger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early\r\nopportunity of comparing my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s establishment with that of his\r\ncashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with\r\nhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he\r\ncalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\r\nwhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive. \xe2\x80\x9cNo ceremony,\xe2\x80\x9d he stipulated,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him where we should\r\ncome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his\r\ngeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you home with me.\xe2\x80\x9d I embrace this opportunity\r\nof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or\r\na dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,\r\nwhich smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer\xe2\x80\x99s shop. It had an\r\nunusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would\r\nwash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,\r\nwhenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his\r\nroom. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock next day, he\r\nseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than\r\nusual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only\r\nwashing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And\r\neven when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,\r\nhe took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before\r\nhe put his coat on.\r\n\r\nThere were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\r\nthe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was\r\nsomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his\r\npresence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along\r\nwestward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of\r\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he\r\nnever otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody\r\nrecognised him.\r\n\r\nHe conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side\r\nof that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in\r\nwant of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and\r\nopened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and\r\nlittle used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark\r\nbrown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the\r\npanelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know\r\nwhat kind of loops I thought they looked like.\r\n\r\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\r\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the\r\nwhole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was\r\ncomfortably laid\xe2\x80\x94no silver in the service, of course\xe2\x80\x94and at the side of\r\nhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and\r\ndecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed\r\nthroughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed\r\neverything himself.\r\n\r\nThere was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\r\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,\r\ntrials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very\r\nsolid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,\r\nand there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a\r\nlittle table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring\r\nthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\r\nevening and fall to work.\r\n\r\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,\xe2\x80\x94for he and I had\r\nwalked together,\xe2\x80\x94he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\r\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\r\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\r\nthe window, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know one from the other. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the Spider?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spider?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Bentley Drummle,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cthe one with the delicate face is\r\nStartop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot making the least account of \xe2\x80\x9cthe one with the delicate face,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreturned, \xe2\x80\x9cBentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\r\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\r\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to\r\nscrew discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came\r\nbetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,\xe2\x80\x94but I may have thought her\r\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\r\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\r\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\r\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious\r\nexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see\r\nMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked\r\nto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had\r\nseen rise out of the Witches\xe2\x80\x99 caldron.\r\n\r\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\r\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\r\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\r\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\r\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\r\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\r\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\r\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\r\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\r\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\r\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\r\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\r\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\r\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\r\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\r\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\r\n\r\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own\r\nstriking appearance and by Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s preparation, I observed that\r\nwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\r\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\r\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\r\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\r\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and\r\na purpose of always holding her in suspense.\r\n\r\nDinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\r\nthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\r\nour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing\r\nmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to\r\nboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my\r\nlips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\r\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\r\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\r\n\r\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\r\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\r\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\r\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\r\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\r\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible\r\nagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\r\nabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\r\nhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\r\na ridiculous manner.\r\n\r\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\r\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\r\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\r\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\r\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s, like a trap,\r\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\r\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you talk of strength,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\xe2\x80\x99ll show you a wrist.\r\nMolly, let them see your wrist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\r\nhand behind her waist. \xe2\x80\x9cMaster,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice, with her\r\neyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_\xe2\x80\x99ll show you a wrist,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\r\ndetermination to show it. \xe2\x80\x9cMolly, let them see your wrist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster,\xe2\x80\x9d she again murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMolly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\r\nat the opposite side of the room, \xe2\x80\x9clet them see _both_ your wrists.\r\nShow them. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\r\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\r\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,\xe2\x80\x94deeply scarred and scarred\r\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\r\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\r\nin succession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s power here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\r\nwith his forefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few men have the power of wrist that this\r\nwoman has. It\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\r\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\r\nstronger in that respect, man\xe2\x80\x99s or woman\xe2\x80\x99s, than these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\r\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\r\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Molly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been admired, and can go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,\r\nputting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and\r\npassed round the wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt half-past nine, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must break up. Pray make\r\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\r\ndrink to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\r\nit perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\r\ndepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\r\nuntil he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\r\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\r\nto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s wine.\r\n\r\nIn our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\r\nand I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\r\nboorish sneer of Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s, to the effect that we were too free with\r\nour money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that\r\nit came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\r\npresence but a week or so before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Drummle; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll be paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to imply that he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it might make you\r\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ should think!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, meaning to be very severe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lend one of you a sixpence.\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lend anybody a sixpence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ should say,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was so very aggravating\xe2\x80\x94the more especially as I found myself\r\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness\xe2\x80\x94that I said, disregarding\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to check me,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\r\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ngrowled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\r\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you want to know or not. We\r\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\r\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\r\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\r\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\r\n\r\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\r\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\r\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\r\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\r\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\r\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\r\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,\r\nDrummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his\r\npockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and\r\nwould have flung it at his adversary\xe2\x80\x99s head, but for our entertainer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\r\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, \xe2\x80\x9cI am exceedingly\r\nsorry to announce that it\xe2\x80\x99s half past nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\r\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle \xe2\x80\x9cold boy,\xe2\x80\x9d as if nothing had\r\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\r\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\r\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\r\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the\r\nhouses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.\r\n\r\nAs the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for\r\na moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found\r\nhim in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard\r\nat it, washing his hands of us.\r\n\r\nI told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything\r\ndisagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame\r\nme much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the\r\nwater-drops; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,\r\nand towelling himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you like him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d my guardian assented; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t have too much to do with him.\r\nKeep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one\r\nof the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking out of the towel, he caught my eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not a fortune-teller,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, letting his head drop into a\r\nfestoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I\r\nam, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Good night, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn about a month after that, the Spider\xe2\x80\x99s time with Mr. Pocket was up\r\nfor good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he\r\nwent home to the family hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MR PIP:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he is\r\ngoing to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if\r\nagreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel\r\nTuesday morning at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when if not agreeable please leave\r\nword. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of\r\nyou in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and\r\ndoing. If now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the\r\nlove of poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ever obliged, and affectionate servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBIDDY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S. He wishes me most particular to write _what larks_. He says you\r\nwill understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see\r\nhim, even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is\r\na worthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last\r\nlittle sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again _what\r\nlarks_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its\r\nappointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings\r\nI looked forward to Joe\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\r\n\r\nNot with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with\r\nconsiderable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of\r\nincongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly\r\nwould have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming\r\nto Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall\r\nin Bentley Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s way. I had little objection to his being seen by\r\nHerbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the\r\nsharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in\r\ncontempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are\r\nusually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\r\n\r\nI had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite\r\nunnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those\r\nwrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly\r\ndifferent from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honour of\r\noccupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring\r\nupholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a\r\nboy in boots,\xe2\x80\x94top boots,\xe2\x80\x94in bondage and slavery to whom I might have\r\nbeen said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of\r\nthe refuse of my washerwoman\xe2\x80\x99s family), and had clothed him with a blue\r\ncoat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots\r\nalready mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to\r\neat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThis avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday\r\nmorning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for\r\nfloorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he\r\nthought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being\r\nso interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of\r\nsuspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see _him_, he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been quite so brisk about it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and\r\nI got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and\r\nbreakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately\r\nthe morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact\r\nthat Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some\r\nweak giant of a Sweep.\r\n\r\nAs the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger\r\npursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the\r\nstaircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming\r\nupstairs,\xe2\x80\x94his state boots being always too big for him,\xe2\x80\x94and by the time\r\nit took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his\r\nascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his\r\nfinger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards\r\ndistinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a\r\nfaint single rap, and Pepper\xe2\x80\x94such was the compromising name of the\r\navenging boy\xe2\x80\x94announced \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gargery!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought he never would have\r\ndone wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the\r\nmat, but at last he came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe, how are you, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, how AIR you, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put down\r\non the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them\r\nstraight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest\r\nwith eggs in it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of parting with that piece of property,\r\nand persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you have that growed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand that swelled, and that\r\ngentle-folked;\xe2\x80\x9d Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas to be sure you are a honour to your king and country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Joe, look wonderfully well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ekerval to most. And your sister, she\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nworse than she were. And Biddy, she\xe2\x80\x99s ever right and ready. And all\r\nfriends is no backerder, if not no forarder. \xe2\x80\x99Ceptin Wopsle; he\xe2\x80\x99s had a\r\ndrop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this time (still with both hands taking great care of the\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and\r\nround and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad a drop, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, lowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s left the Church and went\r\ninto the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him to\r\nLondon along with me. And his wish were,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, getting the\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an\r\negg with his right; \xe2\x80\x9cif no offence, as I would \xe2\x80\x99and you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a\r\nsmall metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that\r\nvery week, of \xe2\x80\x9cthe celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,\r\nwhose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National\r\nBard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic\r\ncircles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you at his performance, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _were_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there a great sensation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.\r\nPartickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,\r\nwhether it were calc\xe2\x80\x99lated to keep a man up to his work with a good\r\nhart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d A man may have had a misfortun\xe2\x80\x99 and been in the Church,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\r\nis no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I\r\nmeantersay, if the ghost of a man\xe2\x80\x99s own father cannot be allowed to\r\nclaim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning \xe2\x80\x99at\r\nis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers\r\nbrings it off, try to keep it on how you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA ghost-seeing effect in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s own countenance informed me that Herbert\r\nhad entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his\r\nhand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour servant, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I hope as you and Pip\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here his\r\neye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so\r\nplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the\r\nfamily, that I frowned it down and confused him more\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI meantersay, you\r\ntwo gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x94which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?\r\nFor the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Joe, confidentially, \xe2\x80\x9cand I believe its character do stand it; but\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep a pig in it myself,\xe2\x80\x94not in the case that I wished him\r\nto fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our\r\ndwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csir,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the\r\nroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,\xe2\x80\x94as if it were\r\nonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a\r\nresting place,\xe2\x80\x94and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the\r\nchimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert, who always\r\npresided of a morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, stiff from head to foot, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take whichever\r\nis most agreeable to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to coffee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince you _are_ so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run\r\ncontrairy to your own opinions. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you never find it a little\r\n\xe2\x80\x99eating?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay tea then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, pouring it out.\r\n\r\nHere Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his\r\nchair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it\r\nwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere it yesterday afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, after coughing behind his\r\nhand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon\xe2\x80\x9d (with\r\nan appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen anything of London yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cme and Wopsle went off straight to look at\r\nthe Blacking Ware\xe2\x80\x99us. But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t find that it come up to its\r\nlikeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nJoe, in an explanatory manner, \xe2\x80\x9cas it is there drawd too\r\narchitectooralooral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily\r\nexpressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect\r\nChorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by his\r\nhat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant\r\nattention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by\r\nwicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the\r\ngreatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it\r\ndropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouring\r\nit in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern\r\nof the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it;\r\nfinally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of\r\nlaying hands upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to\r\nreflect upon,\xe2\x80\x94insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself\r\nto that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why\r\nshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his\r\nholiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of\r\nmeditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had\r\nhis eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such\r\nremarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more\r\nthan he ate, and pretended that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t dropped it; that I was\r\nheartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.\r\n\r\nI had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was\r\nall my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have\r\nbeen easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with\r\nhim; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUs two being now alone, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94began Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, pettishly, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you call me, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like\r\nreproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars\r\nwere, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUs two being now alone,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand me having the intentions\r\nand abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now\r\nconclude\xe2\x80\x94leastways begin\xe2\x80\x94to mention what have led to my having had the\r\npresent honour. For was it not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with his old air of lucid\r\nexposition, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my only wish were to be useful to you, I should not\r\nhave had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode of\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance\r\nagainst this tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is how it were. I were at the Bargemen\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other night, Pip;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whenever he subsided into affection, he called me\r\nPip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nthere come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same\r\nidentical,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, going down a new track, \xe2\x80\x9cdo comb my \xe2\x80\x99air the\r\nwrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were\r\nhim which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a\r\nplayfellow by yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. It was you, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I fully believed it were, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, slightly tossing his\r\nhead, \xe2\x80\x9cthough it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same\r\nidentical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the\r\nBargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the\r\nworkingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She wish,\xe2\x80\x99 were Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s word, \xe2\x80\x98to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Joe sat and\r\nrolled his eyes at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe? Go on, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext day, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chaving cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if\r\nhe were making his will, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss A., or otherways Havisham. Her\r\nexpression air then as follering: \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Gargery. You air in\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x99 Having had a letter from you, I were able\r\nto say \xe2\x80\x98I am.\xe2\x80\x99 (When I married your sister, sir, I said \xe2\x80\x98I will;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwhen I answered your friend, Pip, I said \xe2\x80\x98I am.\xe2\x80\x99) \xe2\x80\x98Would you tell him,\r\nthen,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98that which Estella has come home and would be glad to\r\nsee him.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause of\r\nits firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his\r\nerrand, I should have given him more encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I got home and asked her fur to write the\r\nmessage to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, \xe2\x80\x98I know he will be very\r\nglad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see\r\nhim, go!\xe2\x80\x99 I have now concluded, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, rising from his chair,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a\r\ngreater height.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not going now, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are coming back to dinner, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\nOur eyes met, and all the \xe2\x80\x9cSir\xe2\x80\x9d melted out of that manly heart as he\r\ngave me his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded\r\ntogether, as I may say, and one man\xe2\x80\x99s a blacksmith, and one\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwhitesmith, and one\xe2\x80\x99s a goldsmith, and one\xe2\x80\x99s a coppersmith. Diwisions\r\namong such must come, and must be met as they come. If there\xe2\x80\x99s been any\r\nfault at all to-day, it\xe2\x80\x99s mine. You and me is not two figures to be\r\ntogether in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and\r\nbeknown, and understood among friends. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t that I am proud, but\r\nthat I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these\r\nclothes. I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong in these clothes. I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong out of the forge, the\r\nkitchen, or off th\xe2\x80\x99 meshes. You won\xe2\x80\x99t find half so much fault in me if\r\nyou think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even\r\nmy pipe. You won\xe2\x80\x99t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you\r\nshould ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge\r\nwindow and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old\r\nburnt apron, sticking to the old work. I\xe2\x80\x99m awful dull, but I hope I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless\r\nyou, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in\r\nhim. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he\r\nspoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched\r\nme gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover\r\nmyself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the\r\nneighbouring streets; but he was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first\r\nflow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nBut, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s coach, and had been\r\ndown to Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s and back, I was not by any means convinced on the\r\nlast point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up\r\nat the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s; I was not\r\nexpected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and she was exacting and mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. All other\r\nswindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such\r\npretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should\r\ninnocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s manufacture is\r\nreasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin\r\nof my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of\r\ncompactly folding up my bank-notes for security\xe2\x80\x99s sake, abstracts the\r\nnotes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,\r\nwhen I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!\r\n\r\nHaving settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much\r\ndisturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was\r\ntempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots\r\nin the archway of the Blue Boar\xe2\x80\x99s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to\r\nimagine him casually produced in the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and confounding the\r\ndisrespectful senses of Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy. On the other hand, Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy\r\nmight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless\r\nand desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High\r\nStreet. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the\r\nwhole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.\r\n\r\nIt was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as\r\nwinter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until\r\ntwo or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys\r\nwas two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to\r\nspare, attended by the Avenger,\xe2\x80\x94if I may connect that expression with\r\none who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards\r\nby stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\r\npassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\r\ntheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised\r\nwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were\r\ntwo convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old\r\nreason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cconvict.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind them, Handel?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you seemed as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nparticularly. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee! There they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9ccoming out of the Tap. What a\r\ndegraded and vile sight it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler\r\nwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.\r\nThe two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their\r\nlegs,\xe2\x80\x94irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I\r\nlikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a\r\nthick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\r\nunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\r\nthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts\r\nwere an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he\r\nthe Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and\r\nappeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the\r\nworld, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller\r\nsuit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those\r\nshapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his\r\nhalf-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on\r\nthe settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had\r\nbrought me down with his invisible gun!\r\n\r\nIt was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\r\nnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye\r\nappraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said\r\nsomething to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves\r\nround with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something\r\nelse. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;\r\ntheir coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower\r\nanimals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with\r\npocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them\r\nand kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable\r\nand degraded spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the\r\nback of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and\r\nthat there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in\r\nfront behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had\r\ntaken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,\r\nand said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such\r\nvillainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and\r\ninfamous, and shameful, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else. At this time the\r\ncoach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing\r\nto get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,\xe2\x80\x94bringing\r\nwith them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and\r\nhearthstone, which attends the convict presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take it so much amiss, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the keeper to the angry\r\npassenger; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sit next you myself. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put \xe2\x80\x99em on the outside of\r\nthe row. They won\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with you, sir. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t know they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t blame _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the convict I had recognised. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am\r\nconcerned any one\xe2\x80\x99s welcome to _my_ place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have incommoded none\r\nof you, if I\xe2\x80\x99d had _my_ way.\xe2\x80\x9d Then they both laughed, and began\r\ncracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.\xe2\x80\x94As I really think I\r\nshould have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nAt length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\r\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So\r\nhe got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into\r\nthe place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as\r\nthey could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his\r\nbreath on the hair of my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Handel!\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a\r\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\r\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\r\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\r\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\r\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,\r\nin my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.\r\n\r\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\r\nall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\r\nHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\r\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\r\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\r\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\r\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\r\nquestion up again.\r\n\r\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I\r\ncould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\r\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\r\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\r\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\r\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\r\nmy own thought, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo One Pound notes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did he get \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d said the convict I had never seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had \xe2\x80\x99em stowed away\r\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x99em here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo one pound notes, or friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo one pound notes. I\xe2\x80\x99d sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\r\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he says,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the convict I had recognised,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit was all said\r\nand done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\r\nDock-yard,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a-going to be discharged?\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, I was. Would I find\r\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\r\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore fool you,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have spent \xe2\x80\x99em on a Man, in\r\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\r\nnothing of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a ha\xe2\x80\x99porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried\r\nagain for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was that\xe2\x80\x94Honour!\xe2\x80\x94the only time you worked out, in this part of the\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat might have been your opinion of the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\r\nmist, and mudbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\r\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.\r\n\r\nAfter overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and\r\nbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling\r\ncertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not\r\nonly so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and\r\nso differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could\r\nhave known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our\r\nbeing together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\r\ndread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in\r\nhis hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as\r\nsoon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This\r\ndevice I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot\r\nunder my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down\r\nbefore me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the\r\nfirst stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their\r\nway with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off\r\nto the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting\r\nfor them at the slime-washed stairs,\xe2\x80\x94again heard the gruff \xe2\x80\x9cGive way,\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d like and order to dogs,\xe2\x80\x94again saw the wicked Noah\xe2\x80\x99s Ark lying out\r\non the black water.\r\n\r\nI could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether\r\nundefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on\r\nto the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension\r\nof a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am\r\nconfident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the\r\nrevival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered\r\nmy dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As\r\nsoon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory, he asked me\r\nif he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from\r\nthe Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and\r\ntook the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local\r\nnewspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this\r\nparagraph:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOur readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference\r\nto the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of\r\nthis neighbourhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our\r\nas yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our\r\ncolumns!) that the youth\xe2\x80\x99s earliest patron, companion, and friend, was\r\na highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn\r\nand seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business\r\npremises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is\r\nnot wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as\r\nthe Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our\r\ntown produced the founder of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes. Does the\r\nthought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local\r\nBeauty inquire whose fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the\r\nBLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP.\r\n\r\nI entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the\r\ndays of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met\r\nsomebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have\r\ntold me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s side\r\nof town,\xe2\x80\x94which was not Joe\xe2\x80\x99s side; I could go there to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x94thinking\r\nabout my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nShe had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could\r\nnot fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for\r\nme to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark\r\nrooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down\r\nthe cobwebs, destroy the vermin,\xe2\x80\x94in short, do all the shining deeds of\r\nthe young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to\r\nlook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked\r\nwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with\r\nits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich\r\nattractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the\r\ninspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had\r\ntaken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so\r\nset upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had\r\nbeen all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her\r\nwith any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this\r\nplace, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be\r\nfollowed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the\r\nconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified\r\ntruth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her\r\nsimply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my\r\nsorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against\r\nreason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against\r\nhappiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I\r\nloved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence\r\nin restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nI so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When I\r\nhad rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the\r\ngate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart\r\nmoderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the\r\ncourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its\r\nrusty hinges.\r\n\r\nBeing at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started\r\nmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober\r\ngrey dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of\r\nporter at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrlick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, young master, there\xe2\x80\x99s more changes than yours. But come in, come\r\nin. It\xe2\x80\x99s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards\r\nthe house. \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come here,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, \xe2\x80\x9con my legs. I had my box brought alongside\r\nme in a barrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you here for good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t here for harm, young master, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my\r\nmind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my\r\nlegs and arms, to my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have left the forge?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo this look like a forge?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Orlick, sending his glance all\r\nround him with an air of injury. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, do it look like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked him how long he had left Gargery\xe2\x80\x99s forge?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day is so like another here,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwithout casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have told you that, Orlick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be a scholar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one\r\njust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the\r\ncourtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of\r\nplace usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were\r\nhanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his\r\npatchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The\r\nwhole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a\r\nhuman dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a\r\ncorner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was\r\nfitted up,\xe2\x80\x94as indeed he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw this room before,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there used to be no\r\nPorter here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cnot till it got about that there was no protection on\r\nthe premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and\r\nTag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended\r\nto the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought,\r\nand I took it. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier than bellowsing and hammering.\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloaded, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the\r\nchimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, not desirous of more conversation, \xe2\x80\x9cshall I go up to\r\nMiss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurn me, if I know!\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, first stretching himself and then\r\nshaking himself; \xe2\x80\x9cmy orders ends here, young master. I give this here\r\nbell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till\r\nyou meet somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am expected, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurn me twice over, if I can say!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nUpon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in\r\nmy thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,\r\nwhile the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who\r\nappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason\r\nof me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, is it, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family\r\nare all well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they any wiser?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know\r\nyour way, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I\r\nascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old\r\nway at the door of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s room. \xe2\x80\x9cPip\xe2\x80\x99s rap,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard her say,\r\nimmediately; \xe2\x80\x9ccome in, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two\r\nhands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on\r\nthe fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\r\nworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an\r\nelegant lady whom I had never seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking\r\nround or up; \xe2\x80\x9ccome in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as\r\nif I were a queen, eh?\xe2\x80\x94Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\r\ngrimly playful manner,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard, Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, rather at a loss, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were so\r\nkind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\r\narchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. But she\r\nwas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,\r\nin all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that\r\nI seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that I\r\nslipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O the\r\nsense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the\r\ninaccessibility that came about her!\r\n\r\nShe gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt\r\nin seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a\r\nlong, long time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you find her much changed, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Havisham, with her\r\ngreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\r\nthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella\r\nin the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into\r\nthe old\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You are not going to say into the old Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Havisham\r\ninterrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away\r\nfrom her. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better\r\nthen, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she\r\nhad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _he_ changed?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Havisham asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, looking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess coarse and common?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nEstella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,\r\nand looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,\r\nbut she lured me on.\r\n\r\nWe sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so\r\nwrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from\r\nFrance, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,\r\nshe had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\r\nit was impossible and out of nature\xe2\x80\x94or I thought so\xe2\x80\x94to separate them\r\nfrom her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\r\nfrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\r\ndisturbed my boyhood,\xe2\x80\x94from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had\r\nfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,\xe2\x80\x94from all those visions that had\r\nraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the\r\nanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\r\nwindow of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me\r\nto separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life\r\nof my life.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and\r\nreturn to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had\r\nconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the\r\nneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel\r\nher about a little, as in times of yore.\r\n\r\nSo, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\r\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\r\nI, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\r\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As\r\nwe drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\r\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rewarded me very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember I\r\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\r\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and I are great friends now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\r\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\r\ncompanions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd necessarily,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in a haughty tone; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was fit company\r\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\r\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\r\nit to flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\r\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\r\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\r\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\r\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\r\n\r\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\r\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\r\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\r\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\r\ncareless look in that direction, \xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d I reminded her where she had\r\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot remember that you made me cry?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe\r\nthat her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry\r\nagain, inwardly,\xe2\x80\x94and that is the sharpest crying of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\r\nbeautiful woman might, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have no heart,\xe2\x80\x94if that has anything to\r\ndo with my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\r\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, \xe2\x80\x9cand of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But\r\nyou know what I mean. I have no softness there,\r\nno\xe2\x80\x94sympathy\xe2\x80\x94sentiment\xe2\x80\x94nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\r\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?\r\nNo. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of\r\nresemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been\r\nacquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much\r\nassociated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will\r\nproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces\r\nthat are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to\r\nMiss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,\r\nthe suggestion was gone.\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am serious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow\r\nwas smooth) as with a darkening of her face; \xe2\x80\x9cif we are to be thrown\r\nmuch together, you had better believe it at once. No!\xe2\x80\x9d imperiously\r\nstopping me as I opened my lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not bestowed my tenderness\r\nanywhere. I have never had any such thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\r\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\r\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to\r\nhave seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,\r\nagain the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed\r\nme. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.\r\nInstantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you scared again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be, if I believed what you said just now,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, to turn\r\nit off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\r\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\r\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\r\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\r\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\r\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\r\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\r\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\r\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it\r\ncould not have been more cherished in my remembrance.\r\n\r\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\r\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\r\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\r\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my\r\ndelight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness\r\nhad chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!\r\n\r\nAt last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\r\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\r\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\r\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while\r\nwe were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\r\n\r\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\r\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in\r\nthe funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\r\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and\r\nbeautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\r\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\r\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\r\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\r\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\r\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\r\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\r\n\r\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\r\nsaid in a whisper,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\r\nshe sat in the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cLove her, love her, love her! How does she use\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\r\nat all) she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cLove her, love her, love her! If she favours\r\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\r\npieces,\xe2\x80\x94and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,\xe2\x80\x94love\r\nher, love her, love her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\r\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm\r\nround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\r\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\r\nLove her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\r\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead\r\nof love\xe2\x80\x94despair\xe2\x80\x94revenge\xe2\x80\x94dire death\xe2\x80\x94it could not have sounded from her\r\nlips more like a curse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning\r\nself-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself\r\nand against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the\r\nsmiter\xe2\x80\x94as I did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\r\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\r\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck\r\nherself against the wall and fallen dead.\r\n\r\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\r\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\r\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\r\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\r\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\r\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as\r\nif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or\r\nwitness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\r\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he\r\nhad this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking\r\nat us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent\r\npause in that attitude, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? Singular!\xe2\x80\x9d and then put the\r\nhandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)\r\nafraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\r\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs punctual as ever,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, coming up to us. \xe2\x80\x9c(How do you do,\r\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you\r\nare here, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\r\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Very fine young lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\r\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\r\nwere full of secrets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when\r\nhe came to a stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! How many times? Ten thousand times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Certainly not so many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, \xe2\x80\x9cleave my Pip\r\nalone, and go with him to your dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\r\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\r\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\r\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\r\ntimes and once.\r\n\r\nI considered, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd never will, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, with a frowning smile. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has\r\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\r\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\r\nhands on such food as she takes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I ask you a question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I may decline to answer it. Put your\r\nquestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella\xe2\x80\x99s name. Is it Havisham or\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d I had nothing to add.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr what?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\r\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green\r\nand yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\r\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\r\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\r\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\r\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\r\ntwo ladies left us.\r\n\r\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\r\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\r\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella\xe2\x80\x99s face once during\r\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\r\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\r\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\r\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a\r\ndry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\r\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,\r\nhe showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\r\nextorted\xe2\x80\x94and even did extort, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\xe2\x80\x94those references\r\nout of my innocent self.\r\n\r\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\r\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\r\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\r\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\r\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass\r\nagain, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\r\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had\r\nknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or\r\nfour times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he\r\nsaw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\r\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\r\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer.\r\n\r\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in\r\nthe danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\r\ncap,\xe2\x80\x94which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nstrewing the ground with her hair,\xe2\x80\x94which assuredly had never grown on\r\n_her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\r\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\r\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and about her bosom and\r\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\r\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\r\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\r\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\r\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,\r\nof the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in\r\nthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out\r\nlong ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his\r\ncold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I\r\ncould never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never\r\nbear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear\r\nto see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be\r\nwithin a foot or two of him,\xe2\x80\x94it was, that my feelings should be in the\r\nsame place with him,\xe2\x80\x94_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.\r\n\r\nWe played until nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and then it was arranged that when\r\nEstella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should\r\nmeet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her\r\nand left her.\r\n\r\nMy guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the\r\nnight, Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cLove her, love her, love her!\xe2\x80\x9d sounded\r\nin my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my\r\npillow, \xe2\x80\x9cI love her, I love her, I love her!\xe2\x80\x9d hundreds of times. Then,\r\na burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me,\r\nonce the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by\r\nno means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she\r\nbegin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her\r\nthat was mute and sleeping now?\r\n\r\nAh me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never\r\nthought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe,\r\nbecause I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone,\r\nand Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God\r\nforgive me! soon dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar\r\nin the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian,\r\ncomfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the man\r\nwho fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed\r\nquite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not\r\nexceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a\r\nsatisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\ngood, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, when I had concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go round\r\npresently, and pay our friend off.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather alarmed by this summary\r\naction, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend\r\nhimself might be difficult to deal with. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\nguardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect\r\nconfidence; \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see him argue the question with _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I\r\nbreakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely\r\nhold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a\r\nwalk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers\r\nwas occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get into\r\nmy place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar\r\nimmediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of\r\nmiles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s premises, I\r\ngot round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and\r\nfelt myself in comparative security.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was\r\nnot disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared\r\nafter. One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops\r\nand went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn,\r\nas if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,\xe2\x80\x94on which\r\noccasions I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they\r\nof not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a\r\ndistinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until\r\nFate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I\r\nbeheld Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.\r\nDeeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best\r\nbeseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced\r\nwith that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating\r\nmyself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy smote\r\ntogether, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in\r\nevery limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold me! I\xe2\x80\x99m so frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\r\ncontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed\r\nhim, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of\r\nextreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.\r\n\r\nThis was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced\r\nanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,\r\nand indignation, I again beheld Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy approaching. He was coming\r\nround a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest\r\nindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s with\r\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became\r\naware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his\r\nmotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees\r\nmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His\r\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,\r\nand I felt utterly confounded.\r\n\r\nI had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when\r\nI again beheld Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he\r\nwas entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my\r\ngreat-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the\r\nopposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young\r\nfriends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his\r\nhand, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know yah!\xe2\x80\x9d Words cannot state the amount of aggravation\r\nand injury wreaked upon me by Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy, when passing abreast of me,\r\nhe pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm\r\nakimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,\r\nand drawling to his attendants, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know yah, don\xe2\x80\x99t know yah, \xe2\x80\x99pon\r\nmy soul don\xe2\x80\x99t know yah!\xe2\x80\x9d The disgrace attendant on his immediately\r\nafterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with\r\ncrows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was\r\na blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and\r\nwas, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut unless I had taken the life of Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy on that occasion, I\r\nreally do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To have\r\nstruggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower\r\nrecompense from him than his heart\xe2\x80\x99s best blood, would have been futile\r\nand degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an\r\ninvulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew\r\nout again between his captor\xe2\x80\x99s legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,\r\nhowever, to Mr. Trabb by next day\xe2\x80\x99s post, to say that Mr. Pip must\r\ndecline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed\r\nto the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited\r\nLoathing in every respectable mind.\r\n\r\nThe coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my\r\nbox-seat again, and arrived in London safe,\xe2\x80\x94but not sound, for my heart\r\nwas gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel\r\nof oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then\r\nwent on to Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn.\r\n\r\nI found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.\r\nHaving despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to\r\nthe dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my\r\nfriend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger\r\nin the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an\r\nantechamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of\r\nthe severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be\r\nafforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to\r\nfind him employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to\r\nHyde Park corner to see what o\xe2\x80\x99clock it was.\r\n\r\nDinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to\r\nHerbert, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall esteem and respect your\r\nconfidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt concerns myself, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand one other person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,\r\nand having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, laying my hand upon his knee, \xe2\x80\x9cI love\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nadore\xe2\x80\x94Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy\r\nmatter-of-course way, \xe2\x80\x9cExactly. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next, I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I know _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I\r\nhave had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since\r\nI have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here\r\ntogether. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you\r\ntold me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her\r\nthe first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome\r\nlight, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a\r\nmost beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And\r\nif I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucky for you then, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are picked out\r\nfor her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground,\r\nwe may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of\r\nthat fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella\xe2\x80\x99s views on the adoration\r\nquestion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! She is thousands of miles away, from\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have\r\nsomething more to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed to say it,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet it\xe2\x80\x99s no worse to say it\r\nthan to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a\r\nblacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s boy but yesterday; I am\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say I am\xe2\x80\x94to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay a good fellow, if you want a phrase,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, smiling,\r\nand clapping his hand on the back of mine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca good fellow, with\r\nimpetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and\r\ndreaming, curiously mixed in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this\r\nmixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognised the\r\nanalysis, but thought it not worth disputing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have\r\ndone nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised\r\nme; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when don\xe2\x80\x99t you, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the\r\nfire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain\r\nI feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden\r\nground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of\r\none person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the\r\nbest, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what\r\nthey are!\xe2\x80\x9d In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been\r\nthere, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to\r\nme that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into\r\nour gift-horse\xe2\x80\x99s mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to\r\nme that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether\r\noverlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that\r\nyour guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were\r\nnot endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x94though that is a very large If, I grant,\xe2\x80\x94could you believe that of\r\nall men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations\r\ntowards you unless he were sure of his ground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people\r\noften do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth\r\nand justice;\xe2\x80\x94as if I wanted to deny it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it _was_ a strong point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand I should\r\nthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you\r\nmust bide your guardian\xe2\x80\x99s time, and he must bide his client\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then\r\nperhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nnearer getting it, for it must come at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a hopeful disposition you have!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, gratefully admiring his\r\ncheery ways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have not much else. I must\r\nacknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is\r\nnot my own, but my father\xe2\x80\x99s. The only remark I ever heard him make on\r\nyour story, was the final one, \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is settled and done, or Mr.\r\nJaggers would not be in it.\xe2\x80\x9d And now before I say anything more about\r\nmy father, or my father\xe2\x80\x99s son, and repay confidence with confidence, I\r\nwant to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a\r\nmoment,\xe2\x80\x94positively repulsive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes I shall!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOne, two, three, and now I am in for it.\r\nHandel, my good fellow;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94though he spoke in this light tone, he was\r\nvery much in earnest,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking since we have been talking\r\nwith our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition\r\nof your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am\r\nI right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never\r\nreferred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,\r\nfor instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage\r\nultimately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon my\r\nsoul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself\r\nfrom her?\xe2\x80\x94I told you I should be disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old\r\nmarsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had\r\nsubdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were\r\nsolemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post,\r\nsmote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a little\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but my dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,\r\ninstead of silent, \xe2\x80\x9cits having been so strongly rooted in the breast of\r\na boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very\r\nserious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of\r\nwhat she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may\r\nlead to miserable things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with my head still turned away, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t detach yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t try, Handel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been\r\nasleep, and stirring the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I\xe2\x80\x99ll endeavour to make myself\r\nagreeable again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in\r\ntheir places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,\r\nlooked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and\r\ncame back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left\r\nleg in both arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nto remark that my father\xe2\x80\x99s establishment is not particularly brilliant\r\nin its housekeeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is always plenty, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, to say something\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest\r\napproval, and so does the marine-store shop in the back street.\r\nGravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as\r\nwell as I do. I suppose there was a time once when my father had not\r\ngiven matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask\r\nyou if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part\r\nof the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are\r\nalways most particularly anxious to be married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know. Because it\r\nis decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next\r\nme and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little\r\nJane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you\r\nmight suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual\r\ncontemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already\r\nmade arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.\r\nAnd indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured with\r\nfurther particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my\r\nweakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask the name?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName of Clara,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perhaps I ought to mention,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, who had become\r\ncuriously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting\r\ntheme, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she is rather below my mother\xe2\x80\x99s nonsensical family\r\nnotions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.\r\nI think he was a species of purser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an invalid now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiving on\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the first floor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,\r\nfor I had intended my question to apply to his means. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never\r\nseen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known\r\nClara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous\r\nrows,\xe2\x80\x94roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nlooking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time\r\nrecovered his usual lively manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you expect to see him?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, I constantly expect to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\r\nnever hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the\r\nceiling. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long the rafters may hold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told\r\nme that the moment he began to realise Capital, it was his intention to\r\nmarry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,\r\nengendering low spirits, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ marry, you know, while you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlooking about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision\r\nto realise this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my\r\npockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my\r\nattention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received\r\nfrom Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian\r\nrenown. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd bless my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d I involuntarily added aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve\r\nto go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet\r\nHerbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable\r\nmeans, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me\r\nby reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had\r\nwarmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our\r\ncandles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest\r\nof Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country\r\nelevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The\r\nwhole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble\r\nboy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer\r\nwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in\r\nlife, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of\r\nwhite silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My\r\ngifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could\r\nhave wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.\r\n\r\nSeveral curious little circumstances transpired as the action\r\nproceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been\r\ntroubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it\r\nwith him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom\r\nalso carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had\r\nthe appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of\r\nanxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were\r\nsuggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led\r\nto the Shade\xe2\x80\x99s being advised by the gallery to \xe2\x80\x9cturn over!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nrecommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted\r\nof this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of\r\nhaving been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it\r\nperceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its\r\nterrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom\r\nlady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public\r\nto have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem\r\nby a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her\r\nwaist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so\r\nthat she was openly mentioned as \xe2\x80\x9cthe kettle-drum.\xe2\x80\x9d The noble boy in\r\nthe ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were\r\nin one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a\r\nclergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court\r\nfencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice\r\ndiscrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a\r\nwant of toleration for him, and even\xe2\x80\x94on his being detected in holy\r\norders, and declining to perform the funeral service\xe2\x80\x94to the general\r\nindignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such\r\nslow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off\r\nher white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who\r\nhad been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the\r\nfront row of the gallery, growled, \xe2\x80\x9cNow the baby\xe2\x80\x99s put to bed let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhave supper!\xe2\x80\x9d Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.\r\n\r\nUpon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with\r\nplayful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or\r\nstate a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on\r\nthe question whether \xe2\x80\x99twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared\r\nyes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said \xe2\x80\x9cToss up for\r\nit;\xe2\x80\x9d and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such\r\nfellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged\r\nwith loud cries of \xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d When he appeared with his stocking\r\ndisordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very\r\nneat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat\r\niron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness\r\nof his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had\r\ngiven him. On his taking the recorders,\xe2\x80\x94very like a little black flute\r\nthat had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the\r\ndoor,\xe2\x80\x94he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he\r\nrecommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ do it, neither; you\xe2\x80\x99re a deal worse than _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d And I\r\ngrieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of\r\nthese occasions.\r\n\r\nBut his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the\r\nappearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical\r\nwash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in\r\na comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,\r\nthe gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, \xe2\x80\x9cLook out! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nundertaker a coming, to see how you\xe2\x80\x99re a getting on with your work!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nbelieve it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle\r\ncould not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,\r\nwithout dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;\r\nbut even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without\r\nthe comment, \xe2\x80\x9cWai-ter!\xe2\x80\x9d The arrival of the body for interment (in an\r\nempty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a\r\ngeneral joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the\r\nbearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended\r\nMr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the\r\norchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the\r\nking off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nWe had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;\r\nbut they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,\r\nfeeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I\r\nlaughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;\r\nand yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly\r\nfine in Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s elocution,\xe2\x80\x94not for old associations\xe2\x80\x99 sake, I am\r\nafraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and\r\ndownhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural\r\ncircumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.\r\nWhen the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I\r\nsaid to Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough\r\neither. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy\r\nsmear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we\r\ncame up with him,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip and friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIdentity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Waldengarver,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be glad to have the honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaldengarver?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated\xe2\x80\x94when Herbert murmured in my ear, \xe2\x80\x9cProbably\r\nWopsle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Shall we follow you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few steps, please.\xe2\x80\x9d When we were in a side alley, he turned and\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you think he looked?\xe2\x80\x94I dressed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the\r\naddition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue\r\nribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some\r\nextraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he come to the grave,\xe2\x80\x9d said our conductor, \xe2\x80\x9che showed his cloak\r\nbeautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he see\r\nthe ghost in the queen\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, he might have made more of his\r\nstockings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,\r\ninto a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle\r\nwas divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just\r\nroom for us to look at him over one another\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, by keeping the\r\npacking-case door, or lid, wide open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, \xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,\r\nyou will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in\r\nformer times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\r\nacknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to\r\nget himself out of his princely sables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSkin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,\xe2\x80\x9d said the owner of that\r\nproperty, \xe2\x80\x9cor you\xe2\x80\x99ll bust \xe2\x80\x99em. Bust \xe2\x80\x99em, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll bust\r\nfive-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a\r\nfiner pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave \xe2\x80\x99em to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who,\r\non the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over\r\nbackward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.\r\n\r\nI had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,\r\nMr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), \xe2\x80\x9cCapitally.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nI said \xe2\x80\x9cCapitally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWaldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.\r\n\r\nHerbert said from behind (again poking me), \xe2\x80\x9cMassive and concrete.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nI said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x9cMassive and concrete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Waldengarver,\r\nwith an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall\r\nat the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who was\r\non his knees, \xe2\x80\x9cin which you\xe2\x80\x99re out in your reading. Now mind! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare who says contrairy; I tell you so. You\xe2\x80\x99re out in your reading of\r\nHamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed,\r\nmade the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to\r\nput a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal\r\n(which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and\r\nwhenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee no wafers!\xe2\x80\x9d And at night his reading was lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say \xe2\x80\x9ca faithful\r\nDependent\xe2\x80\x94I overlook his folly;\xe2\x80\x9d and then said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cMy view is a\r\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,\r\nthey will improve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you observe, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Waldengarver, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there was a\r\nman in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service,\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmean, the representation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was drunk, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear no, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, \xe2\x80\x9cnot drunk. His employer would see\r\nto that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know his employer?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both\r\nceremonies very slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have observed, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance\r\nexpressive of low malignity, who went through\xe2\x80\x94I will not say\r\nsustained\xe2\x80\x94the r\xc3\xb4le (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King\r\nof Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for\r\nMr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,\r\nthat I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put\r\non,\xe2\x80\x94which jostled us out at the doorway,\xe2\x80\x94to ask Herbert what he thought\r\nof having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would be kind\r\nto do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s with us,\r\nwrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his\r\nplans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general\r\nrecollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end\r\nwith crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft\r\nand without a chance or hope.\r\n\r\nMiserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella,\r\nand miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that\r\nI had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s Clara, or play Hamlet to\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing\r\ntwenty words of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note\r\nby the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;\r\nfor, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,\r\nI divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,\r\nor Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I\r\nbelieve it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham\r\nhas that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours, ESTELLA.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of\r\nclothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be\r\ncontent with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no\r\npeace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought me\r\neither; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the\r\ncoach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the\r\nBlue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still\r\nfelt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight\r\nlonger than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I\r\nhad performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours,\r\nwhen Wemmick ran against me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9chow do you do? I should hardly have\r\nthought this was _your_ beat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by\r\ncoach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth flourishing thankye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand particularly the Aged.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s in wonderful feather. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be eighty-two next birthday. I have a\r\nnotion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighbourhood shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncomplain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.\r\nHowever, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the office?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, for he was tending in that direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext thing to it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to Newgate. We are in\r\na banker\xe2\x80\x99s-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road\r\ntaking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word\r\nor two with our client.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your client commit the robbery?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your soul and body, no,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wemmick, very drily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\r\nis accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused\r\nof it, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly neither of us is,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?\r\nHave you time to spare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,\r\nnotwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my\r\neye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry\r\nwhether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and\r\nascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the\r\ntrying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be\r\nexpected,\xe2\x80\x94which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined\r\nMr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by\r\nthe information I had received, accepted his offer.\r\n\r\nWe were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge\r\nwhere some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison\r\nrules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much\r\nneglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all\r\npublic wrongdoing\xe2\x80\x94and which is always its heaviest and longest\r\npunishment\xe2\x80\x94was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better\r\nthan soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their\r\nprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their\r\nsoup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was\r\ngoing his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,\r\nwere buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,\r\ndisorderly, depressing scene it was.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\r\nmight walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his\r\nseeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\r\nCaptain Tom? Are _you_ there? Ah, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d and also, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that Black\r\nBill behind the cistern? Why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look for you these two months;\r\nhow do you find yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d Equally in his stopping at the bars and\r\nattending to anxious whisperers,\xe2\x80\x94always singly,\xe2\x80\x94Wemmick with his\r\npost-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,\r\nas if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,\r\nsince last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.\r\n\r\nHe was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department\r\nof Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers\r\nhung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His\r\npersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,\r\nand in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\r\nhands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in\r\nhis pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting\r\nthe raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible\r\nfrom the insufficient money produced, said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no use, my boy. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nonly a subordinate. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go on in that way with a\r\nsubordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had\r\nbetter address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals\r\nin the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one,\r\nmay be worth the while of another; that\xe2\x80\x99s my recommendation to you,\r\nspeaking as a subordinate. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try on useless measures. Why should\r\nyou? Now, who\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus, we walked through Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse, until he turned to me and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cNotice the man I shall shake hands with.\xe2\x80\x9d I should have done so,\r\nwithout the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see\r\nnow, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a\r\npeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that\r\nwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of\r\nthe bars, and put his hand to his hat\xe2\x80\x94which had a greasy and fatty\r\nsurface like cold broth\xe2\x80\x94with a half-serious and half-jocose military\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, to you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9chow are you, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Mr. Wemmick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too\r\nstrong for us, Colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was too strong, sir,\xe2\x80\x94but _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9c_you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, turning to\r\nme, \xe2\x80\x9cServed His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought\r\nhis discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d and the man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes looked at me, and then looked over\r\nmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across\r\nhis lips and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Wemmick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my friend, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. \xe2\x80\x9cSame to you,\r\nColonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nman, unwilling to let his hand go, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have asked the favour of\r\nyour wearing another ring\xe2\x80\x94in acknowledgment of your attentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept the will for the deed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the by; you were\r\nquite a pigeon-fancier.\xe2\x80\x9d The man looked up at the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cI am told you\r\nhad a remarkable breed of tumblers. _Could_ you commission any friend\r\nof yours to bring me a pair, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve no further use for \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cthey shall be taken care of.\r\nGood-afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d They shook hands again, and as we\r\nwalked away Wemmick said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cA Coiner, a very good workman. The\r\nRecorder\xe2\x80\x99s report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on\r\nMonday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are\r\nportable property all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, he looked back, and nodded\r\nat this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of\r\nthe yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAs we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great\r\nimportance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than\r\nby those whom they held in charge. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nturnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,\r\nand who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s Mr.\r\nJaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make it\r\nmanslaughter, or what\xe2\x80\x99s he going to make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask him?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, I dare say!\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Wemmick,\r\nturning to me with his post-office elongated. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t mind what\r\nthey ask of me, the subordinate; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never catch \xe2\x80\x99em asking any\r\nquestions of my principal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this young gentleman one of the \xe2\x80\x99prentices or articled ones of your\r\noffice?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes again, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so! Asks\r\nanother question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,\r\nsupposing Mr. Pip is one of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey, grinning again, \xe2\x80\x9che knows what Mr.\r\nJaggers is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a\r\nfacetious way, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do\r\nwith my principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us\r\nover the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm\r\nto be more confidential; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better\r\nthing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He\xe2\x80\x99s always so\r\nhigh. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.\r\nThat Colonel durst no more take leave of _him_, than that turnkey durst\r\nask him his intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and\r\nthem, he slips in his subordinate,\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x94and so he has \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nsoul and body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsubtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the\r\nfirst time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.\r\n\r\nMr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where\r\nsuppliants for Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s notice were lingering about as usual, and\r\nI returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some\r\nthree hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange\r\nit was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and\r\ncrime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter\r\nevening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have\r\nreappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded\r\nbut not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and\r\nadvancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful\r\nyoung Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with\r\nabsolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished\r\nthat Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone\r\nwith him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not\r\nhave had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust\r\noff my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress,\r\nand I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel,\r\nremembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and\r\nI was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand\r\nwaving to me.\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had\r\npassed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately\r\nbeautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was\r\nmore winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I\r\nthought I saw Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s influence in the change.\r\n\r\nWe stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and\r\nwhen it was all collected I remembered\xe2\x80\x94having forgotten everything but\r\nherself in the meanwhile\xe2\x80\x94that I knew nothing of her destination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to Richmond,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cOur lesson is, that there are\r\ntwo Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the\r\nSurrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage,\r\nand you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges\r\nout of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I,\r\nbut to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own\r\ndevices, you and I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner\r\nmeaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a\r\nlittle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you\r\nare to take care of me the while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a\r\nwaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\r\nsuch a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,\r\nhe pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the\r\nestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous\r\narticle, considering the hole\xe2\x80\x99s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,\r\nand somebody\xe2\x80\x99s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us\r\ninto another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a\r\nscorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked\r\nat this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;\r\nwhich, proving to be merely, \xe2\x80\x9cSome tea for the lady,\xe2\x80\x9d sent him out of\r\nthe room in a very low state of mind.\r\n\r\nI was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong\r\ncombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that\r\nthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising\r\nproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.\r\nYet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that\r\nwith her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all\r\nhappy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to, at Richmond?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to live,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cat a great expense, with a lady there,\r\nwho has the power\xe2\x80\x94or says she has\xe2\x80\x94of taking me about, and introducing\r\nme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered so carelessly, that I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou speak of yourself as if\r\nyou were some one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella,\r\nsmiling delightfully, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not expect me to go to school to _you_;\r\nI must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live quite pleasantly there; at least\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d It appeared to me that I was\r\nlosing a chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou silly boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, quite composedly, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you talk such\r\nnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest\r\nof his family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery superior indeed. He is nobody\xe2\x80\x99s enemy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t add but his own,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I hate that class of\r\nman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and\r\nspite, I have heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I have every reason to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\r\ngrave and rallying, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\r\ninsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\r\nwrite letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\r\nand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself\r\nthe hatred those people feel for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do me no harm, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very\r\nsingular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When\r\nshe left off\xe2\x80\x94and she had not laughed languidly, but with real\r\nenjoyment\xe2\x80\x94I said, in my diffident way with her,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\r\nharm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no you may be sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be certain\r\nthat I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and\r\nthe tortures they undergo!\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed again, and even now when she\r\nhad told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\r\ndoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I\r\nthought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\r\nthe thought in my mind, and answered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not easy for even you.\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cto know what satisfaction\r\nit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\r\nthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\r\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\r\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\r\nand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\r\nis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\r\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\r\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\r\nin the night. I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\r\nremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\r\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo things I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, notwithstanding the\r\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your\r\nmind at rest that these people never will\xe2\x80\x94never would in a hundred\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\r\nor small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\r\nbusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she gave it to me playfully,\xe2\x80\x94for her darker mood had been but\r\nmomentary\xe2\x80\x94I held it and put it to my lips. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ridiculous boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\r\nsame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat spirit was that?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\r\nplotters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to take\r\ncare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,\r\nand we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\r\nintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\r\nI could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\r\nagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\r\nalways was.\r\n\r\nI rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,\r\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\r\ntea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\r\nforks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek\r\nlittle muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron\r\ncover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a\r\nquantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof\r\nimpressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of\r\nbread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in\r\nwith, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a\r\nprolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came\r\nback with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I\r\nsteeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances\r\nextracted one cup of I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what for Estella.\r\n\r\nThe bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,\r\nand the chambermaid taken into consideration,\xe2\x80\x94in a word, the whole\r\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurse much lightened,\xe2\x80\x94we got into our post-coach and drove away.\r\nTurning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon\r\nunder the walls of which I was so ashamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat place is that?\xe2\x80\x9d Estella asked me.\r\n\r\nI made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then told\r\nher. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretches!\xe2\x80\x9d I would not have confessed to my visit for any\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chas the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\r\nthan any man in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is more in the secrets of every place, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I\r\ncan remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\r\nspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce habituated to his distrustful manner,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have done very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you intimate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have dined with him at his private house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, shrinking \xe2\x80\x9cthat must be a curious place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a curious place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\r\nher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\r\nthe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\r\nglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\r\nwith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out\r\nof it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nSo we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\r\nwhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\r\nside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\r\ntold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s neighbourhood until she\r\nhad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\r\ngoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\r\nwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said \xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand no more.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\r\nthat she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\r\nhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she\r\nhad not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should\r\nhave felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose\r\nto do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to\r\ncrush it and throw it away.\r\n\r\nWhen we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew\r\nPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I\r\nhoped I should see her sometimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you\r\nare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of\r\nsome station, though not averse to increasing her income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a part of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s plans for me, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, with\r\na sigh, as if she were tired; \xe2\x80\x9cI am to write to her constantly and see\r\nher regularly and report how I go on,\xe2\x80\x94I and the jewels,\xe2\x80\x94for they are\r\nnearly all mine now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she\r\ndid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.\r\n\r\nWe came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house\r\nby the green,\xe2\x80\x94a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,\r\nembroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their\r\ncourt days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still\r\ncut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\r\nstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of\r\nthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go\r\nthe silent way of the rest.\r\n\r\nA bell with an old voice\xe2\x80\x94which I dare say in its time had often said to\r\nthe house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted\r\nsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire\xe2\x80\x94sounded\r\ngravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering\r\nout to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she\r\ngave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed\r\nlikewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I\r\nshould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy\r\nwith her, but always miserable.\r\n\r\nI got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in\r\nwith a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our\r\nown door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party\r\nescorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite\r\nof his being subject to Flopson.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on\r\ndomestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and\r\nservants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But\r\nMrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of\r\nthe baby\xe2\x80\x99s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him\r\nquiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot\r\nGuards) of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be\r\nregarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either\r\nto apply externally or to take as a tonic.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical\r\nadvice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a\r\nhighly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging\r\nhim to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as\r\nshe sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a\r\nsovereign remedy for baby, I thought\xe2\x80\x94Well\xe2\x80\x94No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to\r\nnotice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on\r\nmy own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,\r\nbut I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of\r\nchronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience was\r\nnot by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x94like Camilla,\xe2\x80\x94I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits,\r\nthat I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with\r\nJoe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat\r\nalone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like\r\nthe forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.\r\n\r\nYet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of\r\nmind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part\r\nin its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,\r\nand yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my\r\nsatisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the\r\ninfluence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so\r\nI perceived\xe2\x80\x94though dimly enough perhaps\xe2\x80\x94that it was not beneficial to\r\nanybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My\r\nlavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not\r\nafford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace\r\nwith anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having\r\nunwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor\r\narts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,\r\nand would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them\r\nslumbering. But Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s was a very different case, and it often\r\ncaused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in\r\ncrowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery\r\nwork, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.\r\n\r\nSo now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began\r\nto contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must\r\nbegin too, so he soon followed. At Startop\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, we put\r\nourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the\r\nGrove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were\r\nnot that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to\r\nquarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause\r\nsix waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying\r\nsocial ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I\r\nunderstood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast\r\nof the society: which ran \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, may the present promotion of good\r\nfeeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in\r\nCovent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour of\r\njoining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about\r\ntown in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts\r\nat the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his\r\nequipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion\r\ndeliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way\xe2\x80\x94like\r\ncoals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could\r\nnot be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIn my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x99s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make\r\nno such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every\r\ndirection, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into\r\nkeeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him\r\nwith a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about\r\nhim more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came into\r\ndinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather\r\nclearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towards\r\nmidnight; and that at about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, he became so\r\ndeeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to\r\nAmerica, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nI was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at\r\nHammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert\r\nwould often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those\r\nseasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that\r\nthe opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the\r\ngeneral tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,\r\nwas a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew\r\ngreyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by\r\nthe hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,\r\nread her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about\r\nher grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it\r\ninto bed whenever it attracted her notice.\r\n\r\nAs I am now generalising a period of my life with the object of\r\nclearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once\r\ncompleting the description of our usual manners and customs at\r\nBarnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn.\r\n\r\nWe spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people\r\ncould make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less\r\nmiserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.\r\nThere was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying\r\nourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my\r\nbelief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look\r\nabout him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he\r\nconsorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an\r\nalmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I\r\never saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we\r\nundertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a\r\nRepublic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except\r\nat a certain hour of every afternoon to \xe2\x80\x9cgo to Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in observance\r\nof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything\r\nelse in connection with Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s that I could find out, except come back\r\nagain. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively\r\nmust find an opening, he would go on \xe2\x80\x99Change at a busy time, and walk\r\nin and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the\r\nassembled magnates. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on\r\none of those special occasions, \xe2\x80\x9cI find the truth to be, Handel, that\r\nan opening won\xe2\x80\x99t come to one, but one must go to it,\xe2\x80\x94so I have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated\r\none another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond\r\nexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight\r\nof the Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s livery; which had a more expensive and a less\r\nremunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast\r\nbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at\r\nbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, \xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nunwholly unconnected,\xe2\x80\x9d as my local paper might put it, \xe2\x80\x9cwith jewelery,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him\r\noff his feet,\xe2\x80\x94so that he was actually in the air, like a booted\r\nCupid,\xe2\x80\x94for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.\r\n\r\nAt certain times\xe2\x80\x94meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our\r\nhumour\xe2\x80\x94I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nwill believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange\r\ncoincidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d I would respond, \xe2\x80\x9clet us look into our affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\r\nthis purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to\r\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\r\nI know Herbert thought so too.\r\n\r\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\r\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds\r\nmight be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the\r\nmark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of\r\nink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was\r\nsomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\r\n\r\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in\r\na neat hand, the heading, \xe2\x80\x9cMemorandum of Pip\xe2\x80\x99s debts\xe2\x80\x9d; with Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nInn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet\r\nof paper, and write across it with similar formalities, \xe2\x80\x9cMemorandum of\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x99s debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\r\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\r\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\r\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us\r\nexceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to\r\ndistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually\r\npaying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things\r\nseemed about equal.\r\n\r\nWhen we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\r\nHerbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\r\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are mounting up, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert would say; \xe2\x80\x9cupon my life, they\r\nare mounting up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe firm, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d I would retort, plying my own pen with great\r\nassiduity. \xe2\x80\x9cLook the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\r\nthem out of countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\r\nfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the\r\nplea that he had not got Cobbs\xe2\x80\x99s bill, or Lobbs\xe2\x80\x99s, or Nobbs\xe2\x80\x99s, as the\r\ncase might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fellow of resource you are!\xe2\x80\x9d my friend would reply, with\r\nadmiration. \xe2\x80\x9cReally your business powers are very remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the\r\nreputation of a first-rate man of business,\xe2\x80\x94prompt, decisive,\r\nenergetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\r\ndown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\r\nself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\r\nWhen I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\r\ndocketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\r\nbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not\r\nmy administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into\r\na focus for him.\r\n\r\nMy business habits had one other bright feature, which I called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cleaving a Margin.\xe2\x80\x9d For example; supposing Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s debts to be one\r\nhundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave a\r\nmargin, and put them down at two hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d Or, supposing my own to be\r\nfour times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven\r\nhundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,\r\nbut I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have\r\nbeen an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately,\r\nto the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of\r\nfreedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\nBut there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these\r\nexaminations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable\r\nopinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the\r\ntable before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of some\r\nsort, rather than a private individual.\r\n\r\nWe shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we\r\nmight not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one\r\nevening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said\r\ndoor, and fall on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for you, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert,\r\ngoing out and coming back with it, \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope there is nothing the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.\r\n\r\nThe letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that I\r\nwas an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.\r\nGargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past\r\nsix in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the\r\ninterment on Monday next at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and\r\nthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my\r\nsister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That\r\nthe place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed\r\nunable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my\r\nthoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming\r\ntowards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the\r\ndoor. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,\r\nthere was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of\r\nthe sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she\r\nwere still alive and had been often there.\r\n\r\nWhatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my\r\nsister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret\r\nwhich may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and\r\nperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized\r\nwith a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had\r\nsuffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have\r\nrevengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.\r\n\r\nHaving written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him that\r\nI would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the\r\ncurious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the\r\nmorning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the\r\nforge.\r\n\r\nIt was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times\r\nwhen I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,\r\nvividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that\r\nsoftened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the\r\nbeans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it\r\nwould be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should\r\nbe softened as they thought of me.\r\n\r\nAt last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.\r\nhad put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally\r\nabsurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a\r\nblack bandage,\xe2\x80\x94as if that instrument could possibly communicate any\r\ncomfort to anybody,\xe2\x80\x94were posted at the front door; and in one of them I\r\nrecognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young\r\ncouple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of\r\nintoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped\r\nround the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and\r\nmost of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed\r\nwindows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two\r\nwarders (the postboy) knocked at the door,\xe2\x80\x94implying that I was far too\r\nmuch exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.\r\n\r\nAnother sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a\r\nwager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour. Here, Mr.\r\nTrabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves\r\nup, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity\r\nof black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished\r\nputting somebody\xe2\x80\x99s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;\r\nso he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and\r\nconfused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of\r\nwarm affection.\r\n\r\nPoor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow\r\nunder his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,\r\nas chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent\r\ndown and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDear Joe, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cPip, old chap,\r\nyou knowed her when she were a fine figure of a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and clasped my hand\r\nand said no more.\r\n\r\nBiddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly\r\nhere and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I\r\nthought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and\r\nthere began to wonder in what part of the house it\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x94my sister\xe2\x80\x94was.\r\nThe air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I\r\nlooked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible\r\nuntil one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum\r\ncake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and\r\nbiscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had\r\nnever seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.\r\nStanding at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook\r\nin a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately\r\nstuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my\r\nattention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing\r\nsherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I, dear sir?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ndid. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent\r\nspeechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to \xe2\x80\x9cfollow,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwere all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into\r\nridiculous bundles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.\r\nTrabb called \xe2\x80\x9cformed\xe2\x80\x9d in the parlour, two and two,\xe2\x80\x94and it was\r\ndreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I\r\nmeantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the\r\nchurch myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it\r\nwith willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbours\r\nwould look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in\r\nrespect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPocket-handkerchiefs out, all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a\r\ndepressed business-like voice. \xe2\x80\x9cPocket-handkerchiefs out! We are\r\nready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses\r\nwere bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and\r\nPumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had\r\nbeen brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of\r\nUndertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded\r\nunder a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole\r\nlooked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and\r\nblundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,\xe2\x80\x94the postboy and\r\nhis comrade.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and\r\nwe were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful\r\nand vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us\r\noff, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such\r\ntimes the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on\r\nour emergence round some corner of expectancy, \xe2\x80\x9c_Here_ they come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Here_ they are!\xe2\x80\x9d and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was\r\nmuch annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted\r\nall the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,\r\nand smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the\r\nexcessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited\r\nand vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.\r\n\r\nAnd now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the\r\nships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,\r\nclose to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this\r\nparish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was\r\nlaid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the\r\nlight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.\r\n\r\nOf the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,\r\nI desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even\r\nwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it\r\nbrought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it\r\nfleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him\r\ncough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came\r\nunexpectedly into large property. When we got back, he had the\r\nhardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had\r\ndone her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered it\r\nreasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drank\r\nall the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two\r\ntalked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as\r\nif they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were\r\nnotoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHubble,\xe2\x80\x94to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly\r\nBargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest\r\nbenefactor.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men\xe2\x80\x94but not his Boy; I\r\nlooked for him\xe2\x80\x94had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,\r\nthe house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a\r\ncold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the old\r\nkitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his\r\nknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great\r\nrestraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and\r\nwhen I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down\r\ntogether on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I\r\nnoticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to\r\nmake a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which\r\nthe dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.\r\n\r\nHe was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little\r\nroom, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great\r\nthing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing\r\nin, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a\r\nlittle talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you might have written to me about these sad\r\nmatters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have written if I had thought\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider\r\nthat you ought to have thought that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with\r\nher, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After\r\nlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave\r\nup that point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I can\xe2\x80\x99t do so, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still\r\nof quiet conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am\r\ngoing to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of\r\nMr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I going to live?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary\r\nflush upon her face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get\r\nthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be\r\nwell recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industrious\r\nand patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nnew schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you\r\nafter that time, and have had time since then to improve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Except in my bad side of human nature,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!\r\nI thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further\r\nwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not heard the particulars of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s death, Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad\r\nstates\xe2\x80\x94though they had got better of late, rather than worse\xe2\x80\x94for four\r\ndays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and\r\nsaid quite plainly, \xe2\x80\x98Joe.\xe2\x80\x99 As she had never said any word for a long\r\nwhile, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs\r\nto me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to\r\nput her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid\r\nher head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she\r\npresently said \xe2\x80\x98Joe\xe2\x80\x99 again, and once \xe2\x80\x98Pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 and once \xe2\x80\x98Pip.\xe2\x80\x99 And so\r\nshe never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later\r\nwhen we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that\r\nwere coming out, were blurred in my own sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing was ever discovered, Biddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what is become of Orlick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in\r\nthe quarries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you have seen him then?\xe2\x80\x94Why are you looking at that dark\r\ntree in the lane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him there, on the night she died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not the last time either, Biddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.\xe2\x80\x94It is of\r\nno use,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and\r\nhe is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\r\nthis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told\r\nher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\r\nthat country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she\r\ntold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,\xe2\x80\x94but ever did\r\nhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a\r\ngentle heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cand Biddy,\r\nwe must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often\r\ndown here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy said never a single word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x94which appears to me to be in\r\nbad taste, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x94what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Biddy, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI must request\r\nto know what you mean by this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t echo,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou used not to echo, Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsed not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cO Mr. Pip! Used!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another\r\nsilent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI made a remark respecting my coming down here often,\r\nto see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the\r\ngoodness, Biddy, to tell me why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nBiddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the\r\nstars with a clear and honest eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in\r\ndespair. \xe2\x80\x9cThis really is a very bad side of human nature! Don\xe2\x80\x99t say any\r\nmore, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and\r\nwhen I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of\r\nher as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the\r\nchurchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the\r\nnight, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an\r\nunkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and\r\nlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I\r\nstood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of\r\nhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright\r\nsun of the life in store for him were shining on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, dear Joe!\xe2\x80\x94No, don\xe2\x80\x99t wipe it off\xe2\x80\x94for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, give me your\r\nblackened hand!\xe2\x80\x94I shall be down soon and often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever too soon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand never too often, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk\r\nand a crust of bread. \xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when I gave her my hand at\r\nparting, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not angry, but I am hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t be hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded quite pathetically; \xe2\x80\x9clet only me be\r\nhurt, if I have been ungenerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to\r\nme, as I suspect they did, that I should _not_ come back, and that\r\nBiddy was quite right, all I can say is,\xe2\x80\x94they were quite right too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our\r\ndebts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like\r\nexemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a\r\nway of doing; and I came of age,\xe2\x80\x94in fulfilment of Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s prediction,\r\nthat I should do so before I knew where I was.\r\n\r\nHerbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had\r\nnothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a\r\nprofound sensation in Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. But we had looked forward to my\r\none-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and\r\nanticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly\r\nhelp saying something definite on that occasion.\r\n\r\nI had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my\r\nbirthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from\r\nWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call\r\nupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced\r\nus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual\r\nflutter when I repaired to my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s office, a model of\r\npunctuality.\r\n\r\nIn the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and\r\nincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of\r\ntissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting\r\nit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s room. It was\r\nNovember, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back\r\nagainst the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,\r\nMr. Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe shook hands,\xe2\x80\x94he was always a remarkably short shaker,\xe2\x80\x94and I thanked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a chair, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian.\r\n\r\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\r\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time\r\nwhen I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the\r\nshelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were\r\nmaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow my young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\r\nbox, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to have a word or two with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\r\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the rate of, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x94rate\xe2\x80\x94of?\xe2\x80\x9d And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\r\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\r\n\r\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\r\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\r\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\r\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so!\xe2\x80\x9d and blew his\r\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything to ask _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\r\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Ask another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that confidence to be imparted to me soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaive that, a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cand ask another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\r\nthe inquiry, \xe2\x80\x9cHave-I\xe2\x80\x94anything to receive, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d On that, Mr. Jaggers\r\nsaid, triumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we should come to it!\xe2\x80\x9d and called to\r\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it\r\nin, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cattend, if you please. You have been\r\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I must say yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you must say yes; don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you what you owe, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know; and if you did\r\nknow, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of\r\nprotesting: \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s likely enough that you think you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, but you\r\nwould. You\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\r\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\r\nand tell me what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a bank-note,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cfor five hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a bank-note,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cfor five hundred pounds.\r\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I do otherwise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! But answer the question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\r\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\r\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\r\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until\r\nthe donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your\r\nmoney affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from\r\nWemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are\r\nin communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\r\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\r\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\r\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\r\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot paid, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cto carry your words to any one;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\r\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, I hinted,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to\r\nwaive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me\r\naback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it likely,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, after hesitating, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my patron, the\r\nfountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d there I\r\ndelicately stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill soon what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no question as it stands,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill soon come to London,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after casting about for a precise\r\nform of words, \xe2\x80\x9cor summon me anywhere else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his\r\ndark deep-set eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must revert to the evening when we first\r\nencountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then,\r\nPip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that\r\nperson appeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s my answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my\r\nstrong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came\r\nquicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I\r\nhad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers shook his head,\xe2\x80\x94not in negativing the question, but in\r\naltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my\r\neyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their\r\nsuspended attention, and were going to sneeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs\r\nof his warmed hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nquestion I must not be asked. You\xe2\x80\x99ll understand that better, when I\r\ntell you it\xe2\x80\x99s a question that might compromise _me_. Come! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go a\r\nlittle further with you; I\xe2\x80\x99ll say something more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the\r\ncalves of his legs in the pause he made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen that person discloses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person\r\ndiscloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that\r\nperson discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything\r\nabout it. And that\xe2\x80\x99s all I have got to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked\r\nthoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion\r\nthat Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him\r\ninto her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he\r\nresented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did\r\nobject to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I\r\nraised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me\r\nall the time, and was doing so still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is all you have to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthere can be\r\nnothing left for me to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me\r\nwhere I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.\r\nAs a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with his\r\ncompany, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on\r\nwalking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation\r\nfor him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had\r\nhis hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk\r\nto Wemmick.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my\r\npocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there\r\nbefore; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise\r\nwith concerning such thought.\r\n\r\nHe had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going\r\nhome. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office\r\ncandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near\r\nthe door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his\r\nhat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest\r\nwith his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\r\nto serve a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\r\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cis trying to get on in commercial life, but\r\nhas no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\r\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith money down?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith _some_ money down,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot\r\nacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwith _some_\r\nmoney down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like just to run over with you on my\r\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as\r\nChelsea Reach. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see; there\xe2\x80\x99s London, one; Southwark, two;\r\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\r\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s as many as six, you see, to\r\nchoose from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChoose your bridge, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand take a walk upon\r\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\r\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\r\nyou may know the end of it too,\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s a less pleasant and profitable\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\r\nsaying this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very discouraging,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeant to be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen is it your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired, with some little indignation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat a man should never\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Invest portable property in a friend?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly he\r\nshould not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,\xe2\x80\x94and then it\r\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get\r\nrid of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cis your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cis my deliberate opinion in this office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\r\nhere; \xe2\x80\x9cbut would that be your opinion at Walworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cWalworth is one place, and this\r\noffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\r\nanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\r\nmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\r\nin this office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, much relieved, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I shall look you up at\r\nWalworth, you may depend upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be welcome there, in a private and\r\npersonal capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my\r\nguardian\xe2\x80\x99s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in\r\nhis doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and\r\nstood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street\r\ntogether, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.\r\nJaggers and I turned ours.\r\n\r\nI could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers\r\nhad had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a\r\nSomebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable\r\nconsideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all\r\nseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he\r\nmade of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than\r\nWemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to\r\ndinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,\r\nbecause, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes\r\nfixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and\r\nforgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s Walworth\r\nsentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage\r\nto the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\r\nJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\r\ndefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\r\npacific manner by the Aged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, \xe2\x80\x9crather\r\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\r\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s walk. He is very\r\nregular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my\r\nson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\r\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou made acquaintance with my son, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, in his\r\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, \xe2\x80\x9cat his office, I\r\nexpect?\xe2\x80\x9d I nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cHah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand\r\nat his business, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I nodded hard. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; so they tell me. His\r\nbusiness is the Law?\xe2\x80\x9d I nodded harder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich makes it more surprising\r\nin my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he was not brought up to the Law,\r\nbut to the Wine-Coopering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\r\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\r\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\r\nsprightly manner, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, to be sure; you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d And to this hour I\r\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\r\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his\r\nown calling in life had been \xe2\x80\x9cthe Wine-Coopering.\xe2\x80\x9d By dint of straining\r\nthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on\r\nthe chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my\r\nmeaning understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cthe warehousing, the warehousing. First,\r\nover yonder;\xe2\x80\x9d he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\r\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; \xe2\x80\x9cand then in the City of London\r\nhere. However, having an infirmity\xe2\x80\x94for I am hard of hearing, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\r\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and\r\nlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to\r\nwhat you said, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat I say is, No to be sure; you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\r\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\r\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\r\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\r\nwooden flap with \xe2\x80\x9cJOHN\xe2\x80\x9d upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\r\nwith great triumph, \xe2\x80\x9cMy son\xe2\x80\x99s come home!\xe2\x80\x9d and we both went out to the\r\ndrawbridge.\r\n\r\nIt was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\r\nother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\r\nthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\r\nthat I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\r\ncome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\r\nwas accompanied.\r\n\r\nMiss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in\r\nthe post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or\r\nthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed\r\nof portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both\r\nbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy\xe2\x80\x99s kite; and I might\r\nhave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves\r\na little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of\r\nfellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in\r\ndiscovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our\r\ngoing in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for\r\nannouncing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a\r\nmoment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently\r\nanother click came, and another little door tumbled open with \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nSkiffins\xe2\x80\x9d on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then\r\nMiss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up\r\ntogether. On Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s return from working these mechanical appliances,\r\nI expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, they\xe2\x80\x99re both pleasant and useful to the Aged.\r\nAnd by George, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the\r\npeople who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known\r\nto the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Wemmick made them,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Skiffins, \xe2\x80\x9cwith his own hands\r\nout of his own head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green\r\ngloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was\r\ncompany), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the\r\nproperty, and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he\r\ndid this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I\r\nseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\r\n\r\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\r\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\r\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\r\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s home, and at his character, and\r\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\r\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\r\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\r\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\r\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\r\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the\r\npossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the\r\ncertainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any\r\nmean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told\r\nWemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a\r\ngreat affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some\r\nrays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s experience\r\nand knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my\r\nresources to help Herbert to some present income,\xe2\x80\x94say of a hundred a\r\nyear, to keep him in good hope and heart,\xe2\x80\x94and gradually to buy him on\r\nto some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to\r\nunderstand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world\r\nwith whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his\r\nshoulder, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help confiding in you, though I know it\r\nmust be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever\r\nbrought me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of\r\nstart, \xe2\x80\x9cWell you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is\r\ndevilish good of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay you\xe2\x80\x99ll help me to be good then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEcod,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wemmick, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not my trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor is this your trading-place,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be\r\ndone by degrees. Skiffins (that\xe2\x80\x99s her brother) is an accountant and\r\nagent. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look him up and go to work for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you ten thousand times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, for though we are strictly in\r\nour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there\r\n_are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned\r\ninto the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The\r\nresponsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and\r\nthat excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me\r\nin some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were\r\ngoing to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a\r\nhay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as\r\nit simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss\r\nSkiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises\r\nbecame strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to\r\nparticipate in the entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right\r\nmoment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth\r\nas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed\r\nthe tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of\r\nJohn and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some\r\nspasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I\r\ngot used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss\r\nSkiffins\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and\r\nI rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the\r\nprofile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very\r\nnew moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by\r\nWemmick.\r\n\r\nWe ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was\r\ndelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged\r\nespecially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage\r\ntribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of\r\nher family on Sunday afternoons\xe2\x80\x94washed up the tea-things, in a trifling\r\nlady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on\r\nher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nAged Parent, tip us the paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that\r\nthis was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman\r\ninfinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t offer an\r\napology,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he isn\xe2\x80\x99t capable of many pleasures\xe2\x80\x94are\r\nyou, Aged P.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man, seeing himself\r\nspoken to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,\r\nAged One.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the cheerful old man, so busy\r\nand so pleased, that it really was quite charming.\r\n\r\nThe Aged\xe2\x80\x99s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\r\nthrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\r\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\r\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\r\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\r\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all\r\nexpressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\r\nresumed again.\r\n\r\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a\r\nshadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.\r\nWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually\r\nstealing his arm round Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s waist. In course of time I saw\r\nhis hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment\r\nMiss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm\r\nagain as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest\r\ndeliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s composure\r\nwhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever\r\nseen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction\r\nof mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it\r\nmechanically.\r\n\r\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s arm beginning to disappear again, and\r\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\r\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\r\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\r\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\r\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\r\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\r\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s reading,\r\nWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled\r\nto it by Miss Skiffins.\r\n\r\nAt last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time\r\nfor Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black\r\nbottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical\r\ndignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these\r\nappliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who\r\nwas soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and\r\nWemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer\r\nto see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had\r\nbest go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and\r\nhaving passed a pleasant evening.\r\n\r\nBefore a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,\r\nstating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\r\nappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would\r\nbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to\r\nWalworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\r\nappointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\r\nwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that\r\nwe found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\r\nestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\r\ncapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a\r\npartner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which\r\nHerbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds\r\ndown, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at\r\ncertain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my\r\nproperty. Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick\r\npervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.\r\n\r\nThe whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the\r\nleast suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the\r\nradiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a\r\nmighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the\r\nyoung merchant\xe2\x80\x99s name), and of Clarriker\xe2\x80\x99s having shown an\r\nextraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the\r\nopening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his\r\nface brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate\r\nfriend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of\r\ntriumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and\r\nhe having that day entered Clarriker\xe2\x80\x99s House, and he having talked to\r\nme for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really\r\ncry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations\r\nhad done some good to somebody.\r\n\r\nA great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my\r\nview. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all\r\nthe changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not\r\nmuch to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to\r\nbe haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O\r\nthe many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within\r\nme haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it\r\nwould, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a\r\nwidow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother\r\nlooked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother\xe2\x80\x99s complexion was\r\npink, and the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,\r\nand the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good\r\nposition, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,\r\nif any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but\r\nthe understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and\r\nthat she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s before the time of her seclusion.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Brandley\xe2\x80\x99s house and out of Mrs. Brandley\xe2\x80\x99s house, I suffered\r\nevery kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The\r\nnature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of\r\nfamiliarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to my\r\ndistraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned\r\nthe very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a\r\nconstant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary,\r\nsteward, half-brother, poor relation,\xe2\x80\x94if I had been a younger brother\r\nof her appointed husband,\xe2\x80\x94I could not have seemed to myself further\r\nfrom my hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her\r\nby her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the\r\ncircumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely\r\nthat it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it\r\nalmost maddened me.\r\n\r\nShe had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of\r\nevery one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them\r\nwithout that.\r\n\r\nI saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used\r\noften to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,\r\nf\xc3\xaate days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,\r\nthrough which I pursued her,\xe2\x80\x94and they were all miseries to me. I never\r\nhad one hour\xe2\x80\x99s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with\r\nme unto death.\r\n\r\nThroughout this part of our intercourse,\xe2\x80\x94and it lasted, as will\r\npresently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,\xe2\x80\x94she habitually\r\nreverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced\r\nupon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check\r\nin this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat\r\napart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you never\r\ntake warning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I mean! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I mean, you are blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the\r\nreason that I always was restrained\xe2\x80\x94and this was not the least of my\r\nmiseries\xe2\x80\x94by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,\r\nwhen she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My\r\ndread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy\r\ndisadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious\r\nstruggle in her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no warning given me just now, for you\r\nwrote to me to come to you, this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always\r\nchilled me.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on\r\nto say:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day\r\nat Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She\r\nwould rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,\r\nfor she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can\r\nyou take me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I take you, Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay\r\nall charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd must obey,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nThis was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others\r\nlike it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as\r\nseen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we\r\nfound her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless\r\nto add that there was no change in Satis House.\r\n\r\nShe was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I\r\nlast saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was\r\nsomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.\r\nShe hung upon Estella\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her\r\ngestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked\r\nat her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had\r\nreared.\r\n\r\nFrom Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to\r\npry into my heart and probe its wounds. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does she use you, Pip; how\r\ndoes she use you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,\r\neven in Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire at\r\nnight, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hand drawn\r\nthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by\r\ndint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular\r\nletters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;\r\nand as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind\r\nmortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch\r\nstick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a\r\nvery spectre.\r\n\r\nI saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of\r\ndependence and even of degradation that it awakened,\xe2\x80\x94I saw in this that\r\nEstella was set to wreak Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s revenge on men, and that she\r\nwas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw\r\nin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her\r\nout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with\r\nthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,\r\nand that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in\r\nthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even\r\nwhile the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my\r\nbeing staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeclining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.\r\nIn a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there\r\nbefore my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in\r\nthis, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which\r\nher life was hidden from the sun.\r\n\r\nThe candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on\r\nthe wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the\r\nsteady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I\r\nlooked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the\r\nstopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the\r\ntable and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly\r\nreflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I\r\nsaw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated\r\nand thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across\r\nthe landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it\r\nwere, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the\r\ncrawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as\r\nthey betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the\r\ngropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.\r\n\r\nIt happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose\r\nbetween Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever\r\nseen them opposed.\r\n\r\nWe were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham\r\nstill had Estella\xe2\x80\x99s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched\r\nEstella\xe2\x80\x99s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.\r\nShe had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather\r\nendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, \xe2\x80\x9care you tired\r\nof me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a little tired of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Estella, disengaging her arm,\r\nand moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak the truth, you ingrate!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Havisham, passionately\r\nstriking her stick upon the floor; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are tired of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEstella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at\r\nthe fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a\r\nself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was\r\nalmost cruel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stock and stone!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cold, cold heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she\r\nleaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nyou reproach me for being cold? You?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not?\xe2\x80\x9d was the fierce retort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cI am what you have made me. Take all\r\nthe praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the\r\nfailure; in short, take me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, look at her, look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nher so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I\r\ntook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its\r\nstabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least I was no party to the compact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cfor if I could\r\nwalk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But\r\nwhat would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe\r\neverything to you. What would you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother by adoption,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Estella, never departing from the easy\r\ngrace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never\r\nyielding either to anger or tenderness,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmother by adoption, I have\r\nsaid that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All\r\nthat you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that,\r\nI have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me,\r\nmy gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I never give her love!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all\r\ntimes, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call\r\nme mad, let her call me mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I call you mad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cI, of all people? Does\r\nany one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I\r\ndo? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as\r\nwell as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool\r\nthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up\r\ninto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon forgotten!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cTimes soon forgotten!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Estella,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot forgotten, but treasured up\r\nin my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have\r\nyou found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving\r\nadmission here,\xe2\x80\x9d she touched her bosom with her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cto anything that\r\nyou excluded? Be just to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo proud, so proud!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her grey hair\r\nwith both her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho taught me to be proud?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cWho praised me when I\r\nlearnt my lesson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo hard, so hard!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho taught me to be hard?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cWho praised me when I\r\nlearnt my lesson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to be proud and hard to _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as\r\nshe stretched out her arms. \xe2\x80\x9cEstella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and\r\nhard to _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEstella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was\r\nnot otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at\r\nthe fire again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\nyou should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a\r\nseparation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have\r\nnever been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any\r\nweakness that I can charge myself with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be weakness to return my love?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyes, yes, she would call it so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment\r\nof calm wonder, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I almost understand how this comes about. If you\r\nhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of\r\nthese rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as\r\nthe daylight by which she had never once seen your face,\xe2\x80\x94if you had\r\ndone that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the\r\ndaylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and\r\nangry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning,\r\nand swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhich is a nearer case,\xe2\x80\x94if you had taught her,\r\nfrom the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,\r\nthat there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her\r\nenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had\r\nblighted you and would else blight her;\xe2\x80\x94if you had done this, and then,\r\nfor a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she\r\ncould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her\r\nface), but still made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cI must be taken as I have been made. The success\r\nis not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,\r\namong the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took\r\nadvantage of the moment\xe2\x80\x94I had sought one from the first\xe2\x80\x94to leave the\r\nroom, after beseeching Estella\xe2\x80\x99s attention to her, with a movement of\r\nmy hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great\r\nchimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s grey\r\nhair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and\r\nwas a miserable sight to see.\r\n\r\nIt was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an\r\nhour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about\r\nthe ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I\r\nfound Estella sitting at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s knee, taking up some stitches\r\nin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and\r\nof which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old\r\nbanners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella\r\nand I played at cards, as of yore,\xe2\x80\x94only we were skilful now, and played\r\nFrench games,\xe2\x80\x94and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.\r\n\r\nI lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first\r\ntime I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to\r\ncome near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this\r\nside of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind\r\nthe half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the\r\nroom overhead, in the room beneath,\xe2\x80\x94everywhere. At last, when the night\r\nwas slow to creep on towards two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I felt that I absolutely\r\ncould no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I\r\nmust get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out\r\nacross the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the\r\nouter courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no\r\nsooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss\r\nHavisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I\r\nfollowed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She\r\ncarried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from\r\none of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by\r\nits light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed\r\nair of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard\r\nher walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again\r\ninto that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark\r\nboth to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some\r\nstreaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During\r\nthe whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I\r\nheard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless\r\nlow cry.\r\n\r\nBefore we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between\r\nher and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and\r\nthere were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,\r\ndid Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except\r\nthat I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley\r\nDrummle\xe2\x80\x99s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.\r\n\r\nOn a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and\r\nwhen good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nagreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to\r\norder, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which,\r\naccording to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nturn to do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me\r\nwhile the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost\r\nbetween us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when\r\nhe called upon the company to pledge him to \xe2\x80\x9cEstella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella who?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella of where?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are bound to say of where.\xe2\x80\x9d Which he\r\nwas, as a Finch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Richmond, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle, putting me out of the question,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand a peerless beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I\r\nwhispered Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had\r\nbeen honoured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so do I,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, with a scarlet face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9c_O_, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the only retort\xe2\x80\x94except glass or crockery\xe2\x80\x94that the heavy\r\ncreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it\r\nas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place\r\nand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable\r\nFinch\xe2\x80\x99s impudence to come down to that Grove,\xe2\x80\x94we always talked about\r\ncoming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of\r\nexpression,\xe2\x80\x94down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew\r\nnothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by\r\nthat? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\r\nwhere I was to be found.\r\n\r\nWhether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\r\nafter this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The\r\ndebate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more\r\nhonourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they\r\nbelieved _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was\r\ndecided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle\r\nwould bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that\r\nhe had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,\r\nas a gentleman and a Finch, for \xe2\x80\x9chaving been betrayed into a warmth\r\nwhich.\xe2\x80\x9d Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour\r\nshould take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a\r\npolite little avowal in Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hand, that she had had the honour of\r\ndancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret\r\nthat I had been \xe2\x80\x9cbetrayed into a warmth which,\xe2\x80\x9d and on the whole to\r\nrepudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.\r\nDrummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the\r\nGrove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the\r\npromotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nI tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot\r\nadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should\r\nshow any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far\r\nbelow the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been\r\nreferable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my\r\nlove for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to\r\nthat hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had\r\nfavoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind\r\nand degree of distress.\r\n\r\nIt was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle\r\nhad begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A\r\nlittle while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed\r\none another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and\r\nEstella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement,\r\nnow almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him\r\nvery well, now scarcely remembering who he was.\r\n\r\nThe Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,\r\nhowever, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a\r\nblockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which\r\nsometimes did him good service,\xe2\x80\x94almost taking the place of\r\nconcentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching\r\nEstella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil\r\nhimself and drop at the right nick of time.\r\n\r\nAt a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls\r\nat most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,\r\nthis blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration\r\non her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the\r\nnext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\r\ntake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I\r\nwas with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you tired, Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to\r\nwrite, before I go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecounting to-night\xe2\x80\x99s triumph?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely a very poor one,\r\nEstella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there had been any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cdo look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is\r\nlooking over here at us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I look at him?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella, with her eyes on me\r\ninstead. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,\xe2\x80\x94to use\r\nyour words,\xe2\x80\x94that I need look at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cFor he\r\nhas been hovering about you all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Estella, with a\r\nglance towards him, \xe2\x80\x9chover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned; \xe2\x80\x9cbut cannot the Estella help it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing, after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps. Yes. Anything you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\r\nencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is\r\ndespised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,\r\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\r\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her\r\nlovely eyes the wider.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\r\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cWell! Then, that is\r\nwhy it makes me wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea\r\nof making me\xe2\x80\x94me\xe2\x80\x94wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\r\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\r\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, casting her glance over the room, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nfoolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and\r\nmay be meant to have. It\xe2\x80\x99s not worth discussing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I cannot bear that people should say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest\r\nin the crowd.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalls me proud and inflexible in this breath!\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, opening\r\nher hands. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\r\nboor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, something hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have\r\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\r\ngive to\xe2\x80\x94me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\r\nserious, if not angry, look, \xe2\x80\x9cto deceive and entrap you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you deceive and entrap him, Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and many others,\xe2\x80\x94all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsay no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled\r\nmy heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on\r\nunhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the\r\nevent that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world\r\nheld Estella, and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving\r\nits first distortions from Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s wasting hands.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of\r\nstate in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry,\r\nthe tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried\r\nthrough the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in\r\nthe roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of\r\nhollow to the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labour,\r\nand the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and\r\nthe sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring\r\nwas put into his hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and\r\nrushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near\r\nand afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an\r\ninstant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to\r\nenlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third\r\nbirthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn more than a year,\r\nand lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original\r\nrelations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my\r\ninability to settle to anything,\xe2\x80\x94which I hope arose out of the restless\r\nand incomplete tenure on which I held my means,\xe2\x80\x94I had a taste for\r\nreading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x99s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have\r\nbrought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nBusiness had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and\r\nhad a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping\r\nthat to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed,\r\nI sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.\r\n\r\nIt was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,\r\nmud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been\r\ndriving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the\r\nEast there were an eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the\r\ngusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their\r\nroofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of\r\nwindmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast,\r\nof shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these\r\nrages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been\r\nthe worst of all.\r\n\r\nAlterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,\r\nand it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so\r\nexposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the\r\nwind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges\r\nof cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed\r\nagainst the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked,\r\nthat I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.\r\nOccasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it\r\ncould not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors\r\nopen and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out;\r\nand when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black\r\nwindows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in the\r\nteeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were\r\nblown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were\r\nshuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being\r\ncarried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.\r\n\r\nI read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book at\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, and all the many\r\nchurch-clocks in the City\xe2\x80\x94some leading, some accompanying, some\r\nfollowing\xe2\x80\x94struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;\r\nand I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,\r\nwhen I heard a footstep on the stair.\r\n\r\nWhat nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the\r\nfootstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I\r\nlistened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.\r\nRemembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up\r\nmy reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had\r\nstopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some one down there, is there not?\xe2\x80\x9d I called out, looking\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from the darkness beneath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat floor do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe top. Mr. Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my name.\xe2\x80\x94There is nothing the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the voice. And the man came on.\r\n\r\nI stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly\r\nwithin its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its\r\ncircle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere\r\ninstant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was\r\nstrange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\r\nand pleased by the sight of me.\r\n\r\nMoving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially\r\ndressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-grey\r\nhair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong\r\non his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\r\nweather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp\r\nincluded us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was\r\nholding out both his hands to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray what is your business?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy business?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, pausing. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Yes. I will explain my\r\nbusiness, by your leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to come in, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the\r\nsort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.\r\nI resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to\r\nrespond to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and,\r\nhaving set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to\r\nexplain himself.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him with the strangest air,\xe2\x80\x94an air of wondering\r\npleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\npulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head\r\nwas furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-grey hair grew only on\r\nits sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the\r\ncontrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, half suspecting him to be mad.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over\r\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s disapinting to a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a coarse broken\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9carter having looked for\xe2\x80\x99ard so distant, and come so fur; but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not to blame for that,\xe2\x80\x94neither on us is to blame for that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nspeak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his\r\nforehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him\r\nattentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no one nigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking over his shoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cis there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,\r\nask that question?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a game one,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, shaking his head at me with a\r\ndeliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most\r\nexasperating; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve grow\xe2\x80\x99d up, a game one! But don\xe2\x80\x99t catch\r\nhold of me. You\xe2\x80\x99d be sorry arterwards to have done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet\r\nI could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and\r\nthe rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the\r\nintervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first\r\nstood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my\r\nconvict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair\r\nbefore the fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to\r\nme; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round\r\nhis head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a\r\nshivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition. I\r\nknew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before,\r\nI had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.\r\n\r\nHe came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands. Not\r\nknowing what to do,\xe2\x80\x94for, in my astonishment I had lost my\r\nself-possession,\xe2\x80\x94I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them\r\nheartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou acted noble, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNoble, Pip! And I have never\r\nforgot it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I\r\nlaid a hand upon his breast and put him away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did\r\nwhen I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by\r\nmending your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not\r\nnecessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be\r\nsomething good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not\r\nrepulse you; but surely you must understand that\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at\r\nme, that the words died away on my tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was a-saying,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, when we had confronted one another in\r\nsilence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat surely I must understand. What, surely must I\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long\r\nago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have\r\nrepented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad\r\nthat, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But\r\nour ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look\r\nweary. Will you drink something before you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly\r\nobservant of me, biting a long end of it. \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, still\r\nwith the end at his mouth and still observant of me, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I _will_\r\ndrink (I thank you) afore I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table near\r\nthe fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the\r\nbottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum\r\nand water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look\r\nat me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his\r\nneckerchief between his teeth\xe2\x80\x94evidently forgotten\xe2\x80\x94made my hand very\r\ndifficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with\r\namazement that his eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished\r\nhim gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and\r\nfelt a touch of reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, hurriedly putting something\r\ninto a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nwill not think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of\r\ndoing it, and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of\r\nhis neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and\r\nstretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew\r\nhis sleeve across his eyes and forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you living?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in\r\nthe new world,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cmany a thousand mile of stormy water off from\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have done well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done wonderfully well. There\xe2\x80\x99s others went out alonger me as has\r\ndone well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I\xe2\x80\x99m famous for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which\r\nthey were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince he undertook that trust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever set eyes upon him. I warn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was a\r\npoor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little\r\nfortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay\r\nthem back. You can put them to some other poor boy\xe2\x80\x99s use.\xe2\x80\x9d I took out\r\nmy purse.\r\n\r\nHe watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he\r\nwatched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They\r\nwere clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him.\r\nStill watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them\r\nlong-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped\r\nthe ashes into the tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I make so bold,\xe2\x80\x9d he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,\r\nand with a frown that was like a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cas ask you _how_ you have done\r\nwell, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with\r\nhis heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,\r\nto dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither\r\nlooked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only\r\nnow that I began to tremble.\r\n\r\nWhen my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without\r\nsound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it\r\ndistinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight a mere warmint ask what property?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight a mere warmint ask whose property?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI faltered again, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I make a guess, I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Convict, \xe2\x80\x9cat your income\r\nsince you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose\r\nout of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking\r\nwildly at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConcerning a guardian,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere ought to have been some\r\nguardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As\r\nto the first letter of that lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s name now. Would it be J?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its\r\ndisappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed\r\nin in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to\r\nstruggle for every breath I drew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cas the employer of that lawyer whose name begun\r\nwith a J, and might be Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x94put it as he had come over sea to\r\nPortsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, you have found me out,\xe2\x80\x99 you says just now. Well! However, did\r\nI find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for\r\nparticulars of your address. That person\xe2\x80\x99s name? Why, Wemmick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life. I\r\nstood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where I\r\nseemed to be suffocating,\xe2\x80\x94I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I\r\ngrasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught\r\nme, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on\r\none knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and\r\nthat I shuddered at, very near to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pip, dear boy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a gentleman on you! It\xe2\x80\x99s me wot has done\r\nit! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea\r\nshould go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec\xe2\x80\x99lated and got\r\nrich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;\r\nI worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I\r\ntell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to\r\nknow as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his\r\nhead so high that he could make a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x94and, Pip, you\xe2\x80\x99re him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the\r\nrepugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded\r\nif he had been some terrible beast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. I\xe2\x80\x99m your second father. You\xe2\x80\x99re my son,\xe2\x80\x94more to me\r\nnor any son. I\xe2\x80\x99ve put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a\r\nhired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of\r\nsheep till I half forgot wot men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s faces wos like, I see\r\nyourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my\r\ndinner or my supper, and I says, \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s the boy again, a looking at me\r\nwhiles I eats and drinks!\xe2\x80\x99 I see you there a many times, as plain as\r\never I see you on them misty marshes. \xe2\x80\x98Lord strike me dead!\xe2\x80\x99 I says\r\neach time,\xe2\x80\x94and I goes out in the air to say it under the open\r\nheavens,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make that boy a\r\ngentleman!\xe2\x80\x99 And I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these\r\nhere lodgings of yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show\r\nmoney with lords for wagers, and beat \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly\r\nfainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one\r\ngrain of relief I had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ee here!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and\r\nturning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his\r\ntouch as if he had been a snake, \xe2\x80\x9ca gold \xe2\x80\x99un and a beauty: _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at\r\nyour clothes; better ain\xe2\x80\x99t to be got! And your books too,\xe2\x80\x9d turning his\r\neyes round the room, \xe2\x80\x9cmounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And\r\nyou read \xe2\x80\x99em; don\xe2\x80\x99t you? I see you\xe2\x80\x99d been a reading of \xe2\x80\x99em when I come\r\nin. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read \xe2\x80\x99em to me, dear boy! And if they\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nforeign languages wot I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, I shall be just as proud as\r\nif I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood\r\nran cold within me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you mind talking, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after again drawing his sleeve\r\nover his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I\r\nwell remembered,\xe2\x80\x94and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so\r\nmuch in earnest; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for\r\nthis as I wos. But didn\xe2\x80\x99t you never think it might be me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cNever, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see it _wos_ me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but\r\nmy own self and Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there no one else?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a glance of surprise: \xe2\x80\x9cwho else should there be?\r\nAnd, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There\xe2\x80\x99s bright eyes\r\nsomewheres\xe2\x80\x94eh? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the\r\nthoughts on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nO Estella, Estella!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy \xe2\x80\x99em. Not that a\r\ngentleman like you, so well set up as you, can\xe2\x80\x99t win \xe2\x80\x99em off of his own\r\ngame; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,\r\ndear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money\r\nleft me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got\r\nmy liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I\r\nwent for you. \xe2\x80\x98Lord strike a blight upon it,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, wotever it was I\r\nwent for, \xe2\x80\x98if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t for him!\xe2\x80\x99 It all prospered wonderful. As I giv\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou to understand just now, I\xe2\x80\x99m famous for it. It was the money left\r\nme, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr.\r\nJaggers\xe2\x80\x94all for you\xe2\x80\x94when he first come arter you, agreeable to my\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nO that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,\xe2\x80\x94far from\r\ncontented, yet, by comparison happy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here, to know\r\nin secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them\r\ncolonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I\r\nsay? I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m making a better gentleman nor ever _you_\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe!\xe2\x80\x99 When one of \xe2\x80\x99em says to another, \xe2\x80\x98He was a convict, a few year\r\nago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he\xe2\x80\x99s lucky,\xe2\x80\x99 what do\r\nI say? I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x98If I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman, nor yet ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no\r\nlearning, I\xe2\x80\x99m the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which\r\non you owns a brought-up London gentleman?\xe2\x80\x99 This way I kep myself\r\na-going. And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for\r\ncertain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on\r\nhis own ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for\r\nanything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt warn\xe2\x80\x99t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsafe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for\r\nI was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear\r\nboy, I done it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had\r\nseemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;\r\neven now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though\r\nthose were loud and his was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will you put me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, presently. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be put\r\nsomewheres, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And to sleep long and sound,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nsea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend and companion,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, rising from the sofa, \xe2\x80\x9cis absent;\r\nyou must have his room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t come back to-morrow; will he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost\r\nefforts; \xe2\x80\x9cnot to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dropping his voice, and\r\nlaying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, \xe2\x80\x9ccaution is\r\nnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean? Caution?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, it\xe2\x80\x99s Death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sent for life. It\xe2\x80\x99s death to come back. There\xe2\x80\x99s been overmuch\r\ncoming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if\r\ntook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched\r\nme with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to\r\ncome to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him\r\ninstead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the\r\nstrongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with\r\nthe strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary,\r\nit would have been better, for his preservation would then have\r\nnaturally and tenderly addressed my heart.\r\n\r\nMy first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen\r\nfrom without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did\r\nso, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I\r\nsaw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal\r\nagain. It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to\r\nfile at his leg.\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone into Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s room, and had shut off any other\r\ncommunication between it and the staircase than through the room in\r\nwhich our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to\r\nbed? He said yes, but asked me for some of my \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x99s linen\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nput on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and\r\nmy blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me\r\ngood-night.\r\n\r\nI got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire\r\nin the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to\r\ngo to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it\r\nwas not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked\r\nI was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not\r\ndesigned for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a\r\nsting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to\r\npractise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first\r\nsmarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,\xe2\x80\x94it was for the\r\nconvict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out\r\nof those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,\r\nthat I had deserted Joe.\r\n\r\nI would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to\r\nBiddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense\r\nof my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every\r\nconsideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that\r\nI should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could\r\nnever, never, undo what I had done.\r\n\r\nIn every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I\r\ncould have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door.\r\nWith these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I\r\nhad had mysterious warnings of this man\xe2\x80\x99s approach. That, for weeks\r\ngone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like\r\nhis. That these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over\r\nthe sea, had drawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sent\r\nthese messengers to mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as\r\ngood as his word, and with me.\r\n\r\nCrowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen\r\nhim with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had\r\nheard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him;\r\nthat I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild\r\nbeast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a\r\nhalf-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with\r\nhim in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it\r\nfilled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at\r\nmy dreadful burden.\r\n\r\nHe had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and\r\nlowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he\r\nhad a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the\r\nkey to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat\r\ndown by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the\r\nfloor. When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the\r\nperception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were\r\nstriking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the\r\nwind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP\xe2\x80\x99S EXPECTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so\r\nfar as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought\r\npressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused\r\nconcourse at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was\r\nself-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would\r\ninevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service\r\nnow, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by\r\nan animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room\r\nsecret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They\r\nboth had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically\r\nlooking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted;\r\nindeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get\r\nup a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning\r\nthat my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country.\r\n\r\nThis course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness\r\nfor the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,\r\nI was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there\r\nto come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black\r\nstaircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouching\r\nin a corner.\r\n\r\nAs the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but\r\neluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman\r\nto come quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind\r\nbeing as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the\r\nlantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we\r\nexamined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one\r\nthere. It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have\r\nslipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nleaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including\r\nthe room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and\r\nassuredly no other man was in those chambers.\r\n\r\nIt troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on\r\nthat night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the\r\nchance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at\r\nthe door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had\r\nperceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the\r\nnight, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in\r\nthe Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man\r\nwho dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in\r\nthe country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the\r\nnight, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe night being so bad, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the watchman, as he gave me back my\r\nglass, \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three\r\ngentlemen that I have named, I don\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind another since about\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when a stranger asked for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw him, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Oh yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikewise the person with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerson with him!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI judged the person to be with him,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the watchman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nperson stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person\r\ntook this way when he took this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working\r\nperson; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-coloured kind of\r\nclothes on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the\r\nmatter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching\r\nweight to it.\r\n\r\nWhen I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without\r\nprolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two\r\ncircumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent\r\nsolution apart,\xe2\x80\x94as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, who\r\nhad not gone near this watchman\xe2\x80\x99s gate, might have strayed to my\r\nstaircase and dropped asleep there,\xe2\x80\x94and my nameless visitor might have\r\nbrought some one with him to show him the way,\xe2\x80\x94still, joined, they had\r\nan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a\r\nfew hours had made me.\r\n\r\nI lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of\r\nthe morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been\r\ndozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an\r\nhour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up\r\nuneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now,\r\nmaking thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into\r\na profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.\r\n\r\nAll this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor\r\ncould I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly\r\ndejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way. As\r\nto forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an\r\nelephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild\r\nmorning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I\r\nsat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to\r\nappear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long\r\nI had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or\r\neven who I was that made it.\r\n\r\nAt last, the old woman and the niece came in,\xe2\x80\x94the latter with a head\r\nnot easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,\xe2\x80\x94and testified surprise\r\nat sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come\r\nin the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations\r\nwere to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they\r\nknocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream\r\nor sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94Him\xe2\x80\x94to come to breakfast.\r\n\r\nBy and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to\r\nbear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not even know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the\r\ntable, \xe2\x80\x9cby what name to call you. I have given out that you are my\r\nuncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, dear boy! Call me uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to keep that name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, dear boy, it\xe2\x80\x99s as good as another,\xe2\x80\x94unless you\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your real name?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagwitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, in the same tone; \xe2\x80\x9cchrisen\xe2\x80\x99d Abel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you brought up to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA warmint, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you came into the Temple last night\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said I, pausing to wonder\r\nwhether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had\r\nyou any one with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith me? No, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there was some one there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t take particular notice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dubiously, \xe2\x80\x9cnot knowing the\r\nways of the place. But I think there _was_ a person, too, come in\r\nalonger me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you known in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that\r\nmade me turn hot and sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you known in London, once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you\xe2\x80\x94tried\xe2\x80\x94in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich time?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a sharp look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up a\r\nknife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what I done is\r\nworked out and paid for!\xe2\x80\x9d fell to at his breakfast.\r\n\r\nHe ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his\r\nactions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed\r\nhim since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in\r\nhis mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to\r\nbear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun\r\nwith any appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat\r\nmuch as I did,\xe2\x80\x94repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and\r\ngloomily looking at the cloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a heavy grubber, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as a polite kind of apology\r\nwhen he made an end of his meal, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I always was. If it had been in\r\nmy constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 got into lighter\r\ntrouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as\r\nshepherd t\xe2\x80\x99other side the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s my belief I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 turned\r\ninto a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a had my smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the\r\nbreast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a\r\nhandful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having\r\nfilled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his\r\npocket were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the\r\ntongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the\r\nhearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favourite\r\naction of holding out both his hands for mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed\r\nat his pipe,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine\r\nOne! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip\xe2\x80\x99late, is, to\r\nstand by and look at you, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning\r\nslowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was\r\nchained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his\r\nhoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its\r\niron grey hair at the sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;\r\nthere mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be no mud on _his_ boots. My gentleman must have horses,\r\nPip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to\r\nride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood\r\n\xe2\x80\x99uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll show \xe2\x80\x99em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won\xe2\x80\x99t us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with\r\npapers, and tossed it on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyourn. All I\xe2\x80\x99ve got ain\xe2\x80\x99t mine; it\xe2\x80\x99s yourn. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afeerd on it.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s more where that come from. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the old country fur to\r\nsee my gentleman spend his money _like_ a gentleman. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be _my_\r\npleasure. _My_ pleasure \xe2\x80\x99ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once\r\nwith a loud snap, \xe2\x80\x9cblast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to\r\nthe colonist a stirring up the dust, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show a better gentleman than\r\nthe whole kit on you put together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to\r\nspeak to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you\r\nare to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what\r\nprojects you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly\r\naltered and subdued manner; \xe2\x80\x9cfirst of all, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here. I forgot\r\nmyself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was; low.\r\nLook\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to be low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\xe2\x80\x9d I resumed, half groaning, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat precautions can be taken\r\nagainst your being recognised and seized?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the same tone as before, \xe2\x80\x9cthat don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nfirst. Lowness goes first. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t took so many year to make a\r\ngentleman, not without knowing what\xe2\x80\x99s due to him. Look\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. I\r\nwas low; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ looked over it. In Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, don\xe2\x80\x99t harp upon\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but look\xe2\x80\x99ee here,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cDear boy, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t come so fur,\r\nnot fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear boy, the danger ain\xe2\x80\x99t so great. Without I was informed\r\nagen, the danger ain\xe2\x80\x99t so much to signify. There\xe2\x80\x99s Jaggers, and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nWemmick, and there\xe2\x80\x99s you. Who else is there to inform?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no chance person who might identify you in the street?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t many. Nor yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to\r\nadvertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from\r\nBotany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who\xe2\x80\x99s to gain by it? Still,\r\nlook\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I\r\nshould ha\xe2\x80\x99 come to see you, mind you, just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long do you remain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping\r\nhis jaw as he stared at me. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a-going back. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you to live?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done with you? Where\r\nwill you be safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s disguising wigs can be bought for\r\nmoney, and there\xe2\x80\x99s hair powder, and spectacles, and black\r\nclothes,\xe2\x80\x94shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what\r\nothers has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of\r\nliving, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take it smoothly now,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you were very serious last\r\nnight, when you swore it was Death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I swear it is Death,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting his pipe back in his\r\nmouth, \xe2\x80\x9cand Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What\r\nthen, when that\xe2\x80\x99s once done? Here I am. To go back now \xe2\x80\x99ud be as bad as\r\nto stand ground\xe2\x80\x94worse. Besides, Pip, I\xe2\x80\x99m here, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve meant it by\r\nyou, years and years. As to what I dare, I\xe2\x80\x99m a old bird now, as has\r\ndared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nafeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there\xe2\x80\x99s Death hid inside of it,\r\nthere is, and let him come out, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll face him, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbelieve in him and not afore. And now let me have a look at my\r\ngentleman agen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\r\nadmiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet\r\nlodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert\r\nreturned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must be\r\nconfided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I\r\ncould have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with\r\nhim out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so\r\nplain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved\r\nhis consent to Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s participation until he should have seen him\r\nand formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even then,\r\ndear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out\r\nof his pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have him on his oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\r\nthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to\r\nstate what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never\r\nknew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of\r\nhaving been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his\r\nknowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that\r\nwise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or\r\ncharm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he\r\nhad made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had\r\ndescribed himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in\r\nhis solitude.\r\n\r\nAs he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he\r\nlooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next\r\ndiscussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an\r\nextraordinary belief in the virtues of \xe2\x80\x9cshorts\xe2\x80\x9d as a disguise, and had\r\nin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him\r\nsomething between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable\r\ndifficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\r\nprosperous farmer\xe2\x80\x99s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,\r\nand wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the\r\nlaundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until\r\nhis change of dress was made.\r\n\r\nIt would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my\r\ndazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not\r\nget out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to\r\nremain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account\r\nto open the door.\r\n\r\nThere being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex\r\nStreet, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within\r\nhail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so\r\nfortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I\r\nthen went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to\r\nthe change in his appearance. This business transacted, I turned my\r\nface, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his\r\ndesk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before his\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbe careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what\r\nI was going to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t commit yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t commit any one.\r\nYou understand\xe2\x80\x94any one. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me anything: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know\r\nanything; I am not curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I saw that he knew the man was come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI merely want, Mr. Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cto assure myself that what I\r\nhave been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at\r\nleast I may verify it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut did you say \xe2\x80\x98told\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98informed\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nme, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a\r\nlistening way at the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cTold would seem to imply verbal\r\ncommunication. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have verbal communication with a man in New\r\nSouth Wales, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the\r\nbenefactor so long unknown to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cin New South Wales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd only he?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd only he,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for\r\nmy mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss\r\nHavisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you say, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me\r\ncoolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all\r\nresponsible for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet it looked so like it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I pleaded with a downcast heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a particle of evidence, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head\r\nand gathering up his skirts. \xe2\x80\x9cTake nothing on its looks; take\r\neverything on evidence. There\xe2\x80\x99s no better rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for\r\na little while. \xe2\x80\x9cI have verified my information, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Magwitch\xe2\x80\x94in New South Wales\xe2\x80\x94having at last disclosed himself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my\r\ncommunication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of\r\nfact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of\r\nfact. You are quite aware of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI communicated to Magwitch\xe2\x80\x94in New South Wales\xe2\x80\x94when he first wrote to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94from New South Wales\xe2\x80\x94the caution that he must not expect me ever to\r\ndeviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him\r\nanother caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his\r\nletter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I\r\ncautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all\r\nlikely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his\r\nnatural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be\r\nan act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the\r\nlaw. I gave Magwitch that caution,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at\r\nme; \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been informed by Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking\r\nhard at me, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from\r\na colonist of the name of Purvis, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr Provis,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr Provis\xe2\x80\x94thank you, Pip. Perhaps it _is_ Provis? Perhaps you know\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s Provis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it\xe2\x80\x99s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist\r\nof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on\r\nbehalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by\r\nreturn of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received\r\nthe explanation of Magwitch\xe2\x80\x94in New South Wales?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came through Provis,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; \xe2\x80\x9cglad to have\r\nseen you. In writing by post to Magwitch\xe2\x80\x94in New South Wales\xe2\x80\x94or in\r\ncommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention\r\nthat the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to\r\nyou, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.\r\nGood-day, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I\r\nturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two\r\nvile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,\r\nand to force out of their swollen throats, \xe2\x80\x9cO, what a man he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done\r\nnothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the\r\nterrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nNext day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.\r\nWhatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than\r\nwhat he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him\r\nthat made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed\r\nhim and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching\r\nfugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly\r\nreferable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar\r\nto me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there\r\nwere still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was\r\nConvict in the very grain of the man.\r\n\r\nThe influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and gave\r\nhim a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the\r\ninfluences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,\r\nhis consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways\r\nof sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,\xe2\x80\x94of brooding about in\r\na high-shouldered reluctant style,\xe2\x80\x94of taking out his great horn-handled\r\njackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,\xe2\x80\x94of lifting\r\nlight glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy\r\npannikins,\xe2\x80\x94of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it\r\nthe last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make\r\nthe most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and\r\nthen swallowing it,\xe2\x80\x94in these ways and a thousand other small nameless\r\ninstances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,\r\nBondsman, plain as plain could be.\r\n\r\nIt had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had\r\nconceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the\r\neffect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon\r\nthe dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it\r\nwas most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of\r\npretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It\r\nwas abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nWords cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful\r\nmystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his\r\nknotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head\r\ntattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit\r\nand look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all\r\nthe crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to\r\nstart up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of\r\nhim, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the\r\nfirst agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for\r\nme and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon\r\ncome back. Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and\r\nbegin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave\r\nhim there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a\r\nprivate soldier.\r\n\r\nI doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those\r\nlonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and\r\nthe rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and\r\nhanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and the\r\ndread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he\r\nwas not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged\r\npack of cards of his own,\xe2\x80\x94a game that I never saw before or since, and\r\nin which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the\r\ntable,\xe2\x80\x94when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would\r\nask me to read to him,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cForeign language, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d While I complied,\r\nhe, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire\r\nsurveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between\r\nthe fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb\r\nshow to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary\r\nstudent pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was\r\nnot more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and\r\nrecoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me\r\nand the fonder he was of me.\r\n\r\nThis is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It\r\nlasted about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go\r\nout, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one\r\nevening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite\r\nworn out,\xe2\x80\x94for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful\r\ndreams,\xe2\x80\x94I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,\r\nwho had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an\r\ninstant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet! It\xe2\x80\x99s Herbert!\xe2\x80\x9d I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the\r\nairy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again\r\nhow are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must\r\nhave been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my\xe2\x80\x94Halloa! I\r\nbeg your pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by\r\nseeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly\r\nputting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shutting the double doors, while\r\nHerbert stood staring and wondering, \xe2\x80\x9csomething very strange has\r\nhappened. This is\xe2\x80\x94a visitor of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Provis coming forward, with his little\r\nclasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it in\r\nyour right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in\r\nany way sumever! Kiss it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo so, as he wishes it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at me\r\nwith a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis\r\nimmediately shaking hands with him, said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99re on your oath, you\r\nknow. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan\xe2\x80\x99t make a gentleman on\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of\r\nHerbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I\r\nrecounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings\r\nreflected in Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s face, and not least among them, my repugnance\r\ntowards the man who had done so much for me.\r\n\r\nWhat would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there\r\nhad been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.\r\nSaving his troublesome sense of having been \xe2\x80\x9clow\xe2\x80\x9d on one occasion since\r\nhis return,\xe2\x80\x94on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the\r\nmoment my revelation was finished,\xe2\x80\x94he had no perception of the\r\npossibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast\r\nthat he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support\r\nthe character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as\r\nfor himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,\r\nand that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite\r\nestablished in his own mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Herbert, after having\r\ndiscoursed for some time, \xe2\x80\x9cI know very well that once since I come\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94for half a minute\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had\r\nbeen low. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you fret yourself on that score. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t made Pip a\r\ngentleman, and Pip ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to make you a gentleman, not fur me\r\nnot to know what\xe2\x80\x99s due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, you two\r\nmay count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on. Muzzled I have\r\nbeen since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled\r\nI am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert said, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d but looked as if there were no specific\r\nconsolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were\r\nanxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us\r\ntogether, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat\r\nlate. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and saw\r\nhim safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I\r\nexperienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of\r\nhis arrival.\r\n\r\nNever quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, I\r\nhad always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in\r\nbringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a\r\nlarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is\r\nconscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that\r\nany of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who\r\nwere passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty\r\nwhen I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate\r\nwith us, nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the\r\nfountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and,\r\nwhen I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I\r\nlived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and\r\nlifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.\r\n\r\nHerbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so\r\nblessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound\r\nwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the\r\nquestion, What was to be done?\r\n\r\nThe chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had\r\nstood,\xe2\x80\x94for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in\r\none unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with\r\nhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,\r\nand what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,\xe2\x80\x94I say his\r\nchair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but\r\nnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had\r\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\r\npatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\r\nconfidence without shaping a syllable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat is\r\nto be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, holding his head, \xe2\x80\x9cI am too stunned\r\nto think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\r\ndone. He is intent upon various new expenses,\xe2\x80\x94horses, and carriages,\r\nand lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you can\xe2\x80\x99t accept\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I?\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed, as Herbert paused. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of him! Look at\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\r\nme, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cafter all, stopping short here, never taking another\r\npenny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily\r\nin debt,\xe2\x80\x94very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,\xe2\x80\x94and I have\r\nbeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well!\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert remonstrated. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say fit for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\r\nis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but\r\nfor the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\r\nwarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, my dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said he presently, \xe2\x80\x9csoldiering won\xe2\x80\x99t do. If\r\nyou were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose you\r\nwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\r\nalready had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!\r\nBesides, it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is another question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an ignorant,\r\ndetermined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he\r\nseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he is,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you what evidence I have seen\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of\r\nthat encounter with the other convict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cthink of this! He comes here at the peril\r\nof his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment of\r\nrealisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from\r\nunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.\r\nDo you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night\r\nof his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\r\nputting himself in the way of being taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you may rely upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there would be great\r\ndanger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he\r\nremains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you\r\nforsook him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me\r\nfrom the first, and the working out of which would make me regard\r\nmyself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my\r\nchair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that\r\neven if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I should\r\nbe wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so\r\nwretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would\r\nfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I\r\nwould ever have come to this!\r\n\r\nBut there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first and the main thing to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cis to get him\r\nout of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be\r\ninduced to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next\r\nstreet, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to\r\nhim and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get\r\nhim away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything\r\nelse in his life, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, again!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands\r\nheld out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nnothing of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night\r\nand see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes,\r\nand yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified\r\nme two days in my childhood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and\r\nfro together, studying the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, stopping, \xe2\x80\x9cyou feel convinced that you can take\r\nno further benefits from him; do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you feel convinced that you must break with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert, can you ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he\r\nhas risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from\r\nthrowing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir\r\na finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see it out together, dear old boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,\r\nwith only that done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwith reference to gaining some knowledge of\r\nhis history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point\r\nblank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Ask him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we sit at breakfast in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would\r\ncome to breakfast with us.\r\n\r\nWith this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams\r\nconcerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear\r\nwhich I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned\r\ntransport. Waking, I never lost that fear.\r\n\r\nHe came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat\r\ndown to his meal. He was full of plans \xe2\x80\x9cfor his gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s coming out\r\nstrong, and like a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d and urged me to begin speedily upon the\r\npocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the\r\nchambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to\r\nlook out at once for a \xe2\x80\x9cfashionable crib\xe2\x80\x9d near Hyde Park, in which he\r\ncould have \xe2\x80\x9ca shake-down.\xe2\x80\x9d When he had made an end of his breakfast,\r\nand was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of\r\npreface,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that\r\nthe soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You\r\nremember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI think so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to know something about that man\xe2\x80\x94and about you. It is strange\r\nto know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to\r\ntell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re on your oath, you know,\r\nPip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to anything I say, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe oath applies to\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand it to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd look\xe2\x80\x99ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ninsisted again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,\r\nwhen, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think\r\nit might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,\r\nstuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each\r\nknee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent\r\nmoments, looked round at us and said what follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy and Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade. I am not a-going fur to tell you my life\r\nlike a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nput it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in\r\njail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,\r\narter Pip stood my friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been done everything to, pretty well\xe2\x80\x94except hanged. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nlocked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been carted here and\r\ncarted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and\r\nstuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more\r\nnotion where I was born than you have\xe2\x80\x94if so much. I first become aware\r\nof myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had\r\nrun away from me\xe2\x80\x94a man\xe2\x80\x94a tinker\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99d took the fire with him, and\r\nleft me wery cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x99d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen\xe2\x80\x99d Abel. How did I know it?\r\nMuch as I know\xe2\x80\x99d the birds\xe2\x80\x99 names in the hedges to be chaffinch,\r\nsparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as\r\nthe birds\xe2\x80\x99 names come out true, I supposed mine did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo fur as I could find, there warn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul that see young Abel\r\nMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at\r\nhim, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,\r\ntook up, to that extent that I reg\xe2\x80\x99larly grow\xe2\x80\x99d up took up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as\r\nmuch to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for\r\nthere warn\xe2\x80\x99t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the\r\nname of being hardened. \xe2\x80\x98This is a terrible hardened one,\xe2\x80\x99 they says to\r\nprison wisitors, picking out me. \xe2\x80\x98May be said to live in jails, this\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x99 Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured\r\nmy head, some on \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x94they had better a measured my stomach,\xe2\x80\x94and others\r\non \xe2\x80\x99em giv me tracts what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read, and made me speeches what I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But\r\nwhat the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach,\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x94Howsomever, I\xe2\x80\x99m a getting low, and I know what\xe2\x80\x99s due. Dear\r\nboy and Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afeerd of me being low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nthat warn\xe2\x80\x99t as often as you may think, till you put the question\r\nwhether you would ha\xe2\x80\x99 been over-ready to give me work yourselves,\xe2\x80\x94a bit\r\nof a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a\r\nhaymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don\xe2\x80\x99t pay and\r\nlead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a\r\nTraveller\xe2\x80\x99s Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs,\r\nlearnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a\r\npenny a time learnt me to write. I warn\xe2\x80\x99t locked up as often now as\r\nformerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 a man whose skull I\xe2\x80\x99d crack wi\xe2\x80\x99 this poker, like the claw of a\r\nlobster, if I\xe2\x80\x99d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,\r\naccording to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he\xe2\x80\x99d been to a public\r\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\r\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\r\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\r\nthat I know\xe2\x80\x99d on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\r\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\r\nsporting one) called him out, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I think this is a man that\r\nmight suit you,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94meaning I was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\r\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To judge from appearances, you\xe2\x80\x99re out of luck,\xe2\x80\x99 says Compeyson to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, master, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in it much.\xe2\x80\x99 (I had come out of\r\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\r\nbeen for something else; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Luck changes,\xe2\x80\x99 says Compeyson; \xe2\x80\x98perhaps yours is going to change.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI says, \xe2\x80\x98I hope it may be so. There\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What can you do?\xe2\x80\x99 says Compeyson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Eat and drink,\xe2\x80\x99 I says; \xe2\x80\x98if you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the materials.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\r\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on\r\nto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s business in which\r\nwe was to go pardners? Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s business was the swindling,\r\nhandwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts\r\nof traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs\r\nout of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was\r\nCompeyson\xe2\x80\x99s business. He\xe2\x80\x99d no more heart than a iron file, he was as\r\ncold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,\xe2\x80\x94not as\r\nbeing so chrisen\xe2\x80\x99d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a\r\nshadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\r\nrich lady some years afore, and they\xe2\x80\x99d made a pot of money by it; but\r\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he\xe2\x80\x99d have run through the king\xe2\x80\x99s taxes.\r\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\r\nand Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\r\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\r\nnobody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend I\r\nwas partick\xe2\x80\x99ler\xe2\x80\x94for where \xe2\x80\x99ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\r\nSo I begun wi\xe2\x80\x99 Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\r\nlived at the top of Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\r\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in\r\ncase he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled\r\nthe account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a\r\ntearing down into Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s parlour late at night, in only a flannel\r\ngown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of\r\nher. She\xe2\x80\x99s all in white,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98wi\xe2\x80\x99 white flowers in her hair, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s awful mad, and she\xe2\x80\x99s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she\r\nsays she\xe2\x80\x99ll put it on me at five in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays Compeyson: \xe2\x80\x98Why, you fool, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know she\xe2\x80\x99s got a living\r\nbody? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,\r\nor in at the window, and up the stairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how she\xe2\x80\x99s there,\xe2\x80\x99 says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\r\nthe horrors, \xe2\x80\x98but she\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\r\nawful mad. And over where her heart\xe2\x80\x99s broke\xe2\x80\x94_you_ broke it!\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrops of blood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. \xe2\x80\x98Go up alonger this\r\ndrivelling sick man,\xe2\x80\x99 he says to his wife, \xe2\x80\x98and Magwitch, lend her a\r\nhand, will you?\xe2\x80\x99 But he never come nigh himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\r\ndreadful. \xe2\x80\x98Why look at her!\xe2\x80\x99 he cries out. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a shaking the shroud\r\nat me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it awful to see her\r\nso mad?\xe2\x80\x99 Next he cries, \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99ll put it on me, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m done for!\r\nTake it away from her, take it away!\xe2\x80\x99 And then he catched hold of us,\r\nand kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed\r\nI see her myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\r\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. \xe2\x80\x98O, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone! Has her keeper\r\nbeen for her?\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 says Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x98Did you tell him\r\nto lock her and bar her in?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And to take that ugly thing away\r\nfrom her?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, all right.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a good creetur,\xe2\x80\x99 he says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\r\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, \xe2\x80\x98Here she is! She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot the shroud again. She\xe2\x80\x99s unfolding it. She\xe2\x80\x99s coming out of the\r\ncorner. She\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you\xe2\x80\x94one of each\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her lift me up to\r\nget it round me. She\xe2\x80\x99s lifting me up. Keep me down!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he lifted\r\nhimself up hard, and was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me\r\nwas soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own\r\nbook,\xe2\x80\x94this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done\xe2\x80\x94which \xe2\x80\x99ud\r\ntake a week\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, that\r\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always\r\nin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a\r\ngetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he\xe2\x80\x99d got craft, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no\r\nmercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Stop though! I ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbrought _her_ in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in\r\nthe book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and\r\nspread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them\r\non again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no need to go into it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking round once more.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time wi\xe2\x80\x99 Compeyson was a\xe2\x80\x99most as hard a time as ever I had; that\r\nsaid, all\xe2\x80\x99s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for\r\nmisdemeanor, while with Compeyson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, No.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI _was_, and got convicted. As to took up on\r\nsuspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that\r\nit lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both\r\ncommitted for felony,\xe2\x80\x94on a charge of putting stolen notes in\r\ncirculation,\xe2\x80\x94and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Separate defences, no communication,\xe2\x80\x99 and that was all. And I was so\r\nmiserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on\r\nmy back, afore I could get Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\r\nCompeyson looked, wi\xe2\x80\x99 his curly hair and his black clothes and his\r\nwhite pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.\r\nWhen the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,\r\nI noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\r\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\r\ncome for\xe2\x80\x99ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the\r\nmoney had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work\r\nthe thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see\r\nthe plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, \xe2\x80\x98My lord and\r\ngentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your\r\neyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be\r\nspoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to\r\nas such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here\r\ntransactions, and only suspected; t\xe2\x80\x99other, the elder, always seen in\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em and always wi\xe2\x80\x99 his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is\r\nbut one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is\r\nmuch the worst one?\xe2\x80\x99 And such-like. And when it come to character,\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t it his\r\nschoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t it him as\r\nhad been know\xe2\x80\x99d by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to\r\nhis disadvantage? And warn\xe2\x80\x99t it me as had been tried afore, and as had\r\nbeen know\xe2\x80\x99d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when\r\nit come to speech-making, warn\xe2\x80\x99t it Compeyson as could speak to \xe2\x80\x99em wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhis face dropping every now and then into his white\r\npocket-handkercher,\xe2\x80\x94ah! and wi\xe2\x80\x99 verses in his speech, too,\xe2\x80\x94and warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit me as could only say, \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most\r\nprecious rascal\xe2\x80\x99? And when the verdict come, warn\xe2\x80\x99t it Compeyson as was\r\nrecommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and\r\ngiving up all the information he could agen me, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t it me as got\r\nnever a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, \xe2\x80\x98Once out of\r\nthis court, I\xe2\x80\x99ll smash that face of yourn!\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t it Compeyson as prays\r\nthe Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And\r\nwhen we\xe2\x80\x99re sentenced, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,\r\nand ain\xe2\x80\x99t it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so\r\nwell, and ain\xe2\x80\x99t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of\r\nwiolent passion, likely to come to worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked\r\nit, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching\r\nout his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going\r\nto be low, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped\r\nhis face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had said to Compeyson that I\xe2\x80\x99d smash that face of his, and I swore\r\nLord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him\r\nand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at\r\nhim, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nstrong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I\r\nescaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there,\r\nenvying them as was in \xe2\x80\x99em and all over, when I first see my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent\r\nto me again, though I had felt great pity for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them\r\nmarshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to\r\nget quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him\r\ndown. I smashed his face. \xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 says I \xe2\x80\x98as the worst thing I can\r\ndo, caring nothing for myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drag you back.\xe2\x80\x99 And I\xe2\x80\x99d have swum\r\noff, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I\xe2\x80\x99d a got him\r\naboard without the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he\xe2\x80\x99d much the best of it to the last,\xe2\x80\x94his character was so\r\ngood. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous\r\nintentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought\r\nto trial again, and sent for life. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop for life, dear boy and\r\nPip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, being here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took his\r\ntangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his\r\nbutton-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, after a silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs who dead, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hopes _I_ am, if he\xe2\x80\x99s alive, you may be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d with a fierce look.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heerd no more of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He\r\nsoftly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his\r\neyes on the fire, and I read in it:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed\r\nto be Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by;\r\nbut we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he\r\nstood smoking by the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be\r\ntraced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state\r\nof mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison\r\nbefore meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which\r\nI now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,\r\nand the returned transport whom I harboured? The road would be none the\r\nsmoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not\r\nbe helped, nor I extenuated.\r\n\r\nA new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,\r\nhis narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already\r\nthere. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could\r\nhardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of\r\nhim, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any\r\nsuch man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release\r\nhimself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an\r\ninformer was scarcely to be imagined.\r\n\r\nNever had I breathed, and never would I breathe\xe2\x80\x94or so I resolved\xe2\x80\x94a word\r\nof Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could go\r\nabroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we\r\nwere left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story.\r\nI resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.\r\n\r\nOn my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley\xe2\x80\x99s, Estella\xe2\x80\x99s maid was called\r\nto tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House,\r\nas usual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there\r\nwithout me; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation\r\nin the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that\r\nher maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while. I\r\ncould make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make\r\nnothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.\r\n\r\nAnother night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I\r\nalways took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the\r\nconclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came\r\nback from Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to\r\nconsider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should\r\ndevise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious\r\nobservation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should\r\npropose an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything,\r\nand he would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his\r\npresent hazard was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\nNext day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise\r\nto go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe\r\nor his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and\r\nHerbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be\r\nabsent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his\r\nimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be\r\nbegun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert\r\nalso, that he might be best got away across the water, on that\r\npretence,\xe2\x80\x94as, to make purchases, or the like.\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, I set\r\noff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on\r\nthe open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and\r\nwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of\r\nmist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly\r\nride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,\r\nto look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!\r\n\r\nAs he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a\r\nvery lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into\r\nthe coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\r\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\r\nwell knew why he had come there.\r\n\r\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\r\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\r\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\r\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\r\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\r\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\r\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\r\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\r\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this a cut?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, poker in hand; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s you, is it? How do you do? I was\r\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself\r\nside by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have just come down?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\r\nwith his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeastly place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cYour part of the country, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I assented. \xe2\x80\x9cI am told it\xe2\x80\x99s very like your Shropshire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\r\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been here long?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong enough to be tired of it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\r\nbut equally determined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you stay here long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder had claimed another hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of room, I should have\r\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged\r\na similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.\r\nHe whistled a little. So did I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarge tract of marshes about here, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you amused, Mr. Drummle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cnot particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\r\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\r\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsmithies\xe2\x80\x94and that. Waiter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that horse of mine ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrought round to the door, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say. Look here, you sir. The lady won\xe2\x80\x99t ride to-day; the weather\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t dine, because I\xe2\x80\x99m going to dine at the lady\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\r\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\r\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\r\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\r\nhim on the fire.\r\n\r\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\r\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\r\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\r\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\r\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\r\nstood our ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been to the Grove since?\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that when we had a difference of opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, very shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come! They let you off easily enough,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lost your temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Drummle,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not competent to give advice on that\r\nsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\r\noccasion), I don\xe2\x80\x99t throw glasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\nAfter glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\r\nsmouldering ferocity, I said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it an\r\nagreeable one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, superciliously over his shoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think anything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your leave, I will suggest that we\r\nhold no kind of communication in future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle, \xe2\x80\x9cand what I should have suggested\r\nmyself, or done\xe2\x80\x94more likely\xe2\x80\x94without suggesting. But don\xe2\x80\x99t lose your\r\ntemper. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you lost enough without that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle, by way of answering me.\r\n\r\nThe waiter reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\r\nhand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\r\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\r\nand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\r\nboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\r\nintroducing Estella\xe2\x80\x99s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\r\nand therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\r\nno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\r\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for\r\nthe incursion of three thriving farmers\xe2\x80\x94laid on by the waiter, I\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\r\nrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\r\nwere obliged to give way.\r\n\r\nI saw him through the window, seizing his horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane, and mounting in\r\nhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\r\nhe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in\r\nhis mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dress\r\nappeared with what was wanted,\xe2\x80\x94I could not have said from where:\r\nwhether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,\xe2\x80\x94and as Drummle\r\nleaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a\r\njerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching\r\nshoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me\r\nreminded me of Orlick.\r\n\r\nToo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\r\nno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\r\njourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house\r\nthat it would have been so much the better for me never to have\r\nentered, never to have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles\r\nburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham\r\nseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.\r\nEstella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both\r\nraised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I\r\nderived that, from the look they interchanged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, \xe2\x80\x9cblows you here, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\r\nEstella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\r\nthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\r\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived\r\nI had discovered my real benefactor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\r\nEstella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\r\nI took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\r\noccupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural\r\nplace for me, that day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,\r\npresently\xe2\x80\x94in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not\r\ndisplease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the\r\naction of Estella\xe2\x80\x99s fingers as they worked that she attended to what I\r\nsaid; but she did not look up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,\r\nand is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,\r\nanything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not\r\nmy secret, but another\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to\r\ngo on, Miss Havisham repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not your secret, but another\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I\r\nbelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I\r\nsuppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have\r\ncome,\xe2\x80\x94as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid\r\nfor it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; \xe2\x80\x9cyou did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, \xe2\x80\x9chad\r\nnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and\r\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\r\nrelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\r\nas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAny one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\r\nsuppression or evasion so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\r\nyou led me on?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, again nodding steadily, \xe2\x80\x9cI let you go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho am I,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and\r\nflashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\r\nsurprise,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwho am I, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that I should be kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\r\ntold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was liberally paid for my old attendance here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, to soothe\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x9cin being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\r\nmy own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\r\ndisinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\r\npunished\xe2\x80\x94practised on\xe2\x80\x94perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\r\nyour intention, without offence\xe2\x80\x94your self-seeking relations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\r\nhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\r\nnot to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaiting until she was quiet again,\xe2\x80\x94for this, too, flashed out of her in\r\na wild and sudden way,\xe2\x80\x94I went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\r\nand have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\r\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\r\nfalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you\r\nor no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that\r\nyou deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you\r\nsuppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and\r\nincapable of anything designing or mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are your friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey made themselves my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they supposed me to\r\nhave superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and\r\nMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\r\nthem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and\r\nthen said quietly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would not confound them with the others. They\r\nmay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\r\nnature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so cunning, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in answer, conscious that I\r\nreddened a little, \xe2\x80\x9cas that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\r\nthat I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\r\nto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\r\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\r\nhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy must it be done without his knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, settling her\r\nhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI began the service myself, more than two years\r\nago, without his knowledge, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be betrayed. Why I fail\r\nin my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the\r\nsecret which is another person\xe2\x80\x99s and not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\r\nAfter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of\r\nthe slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the\r\ncollapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nfirst, vacantly\xe2\x80\x94then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\r\nthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\r\nattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in\r\nour dialogue,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\r\ntrembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I love you. You know that I have loved you\r\nlong and dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her\r\nfingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved\r\ncountenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from\r\nher to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\r\nto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought\r\nyou could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.\r\nBut I must say it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPreserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\r\nEstella shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in answer to that action,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know. I have no hope\r\nthat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\r\nof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\r\nyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook\r\nher head again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\r\non the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all\r\nthese years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected\r\non the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,\r\nin the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\r\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, very calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there are sentiments,\r\nfancies,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to call them,\xe2\x80\x94which I am not able to\r\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\r\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\r\nnothing there. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for what you say at all. I have tried to\r\nwarn you of this; now, have I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said in a miserable manner, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\r\nNow, did you not think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\r\nbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in _my_ nature,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. And then she added, with a stress\r\nupon the words, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\r\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can\r\ndo no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not true,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\r\npursuing you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, referring to him with the indifference\r\nof utter contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\r\nyou this very day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot love him, Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do\r\nnot mean what I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would never marry him, Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\r\nwork in her hands. Then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not tell you the truth? I am\r\ngoing to be married to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\r\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\r\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\r\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, that it impressed me, even in my\r\npassionate hurry and grief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\r\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,\xe2\x80\x94you have done so, I well know,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\r\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\r\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\r\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as\r\ndearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can\r\nbear it better, for your sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\r\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\r\nintelligible to her own mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going,\xe2\x80\x9d she said again, in a gentler voice, \xe2\x80\x9cto be married to\r\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\r\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\r\nadoption? It is my own act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn whom should I fling myself away?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, with a smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\r\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\r\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me\r\ninto what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\r\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\r\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say\r\nno more. We shall never understand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a mean brute, such a stupid brute!\xe2\x80\x9d I urged, in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x94or man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\r\nwhat I would to restrain them; \xe2\x80\x9ceven if I remained in England and could\r\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnonsense. This will pass in no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will get me out of your thoughts in a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\r\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\r\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\r\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,\xe2\x80\x94on the river, on the sails of\r\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the\r\ndarkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You\r\nhave been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever\r\nbecome acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London\r\nbuildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be\r\ndisplaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to\r\nme, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my\r\nlife, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the\r\nlittle good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I\r\nassociate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to\r\nthat always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me\r\nfeel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an\r\ninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering\r\nmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,\xe2\x80\x94and soon\r\nafterwards with stronger reason,\xe2\x80\x94that while Estella looked at me merely\r\nwith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\r\nstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\r\npity and remorse.\r\n\r\nAll done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at\r\nthe gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when I\r\nwent in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and\r\nthen struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time\r\ncome to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the\r\ninn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach\r\nand be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as\r\ntire myself out.\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow\r\nintricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the\r\nMiddlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was\r\nclose by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till\r\nto-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could\r\nget to bed myself without disturbing him.\r\n\r\nAs it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the\r\nTemple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it\r\nill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held\r\nthe gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I\r\nmentioned my name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a note, sir. The\r\nmessenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my\r\nlantern?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMuch surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to\r\nPhilip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cPLEASE READ THIS, HERE.\xe2\x80\x9d I opened it, the watchman holding up\r\nhis light, and read inside, in Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s writing,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDON\xe2\x80\x99T GO HOME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made\r\nthe best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney\r\nchariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed\r\nwas always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the\r\nchamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next\r\nin order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in\r\norder on his list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the\r\nback, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling\r\nover the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the\r\nfireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched\r\nlittle washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.\r\n\r\nAs I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,\r\nbefore he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those\r\nvirtuous days\xe2\x80\x94an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which\r\ninstantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever\r\nbe lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the\r\nbottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a\r\nstaringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and\r\nlay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more\r\nclose my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.\r\nAnd thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhat a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an\r\ninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I\r\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a\r\nnumber of blue-bottle flies from the butchers\xe2\x80\x99, and earwigs from the\r\nmarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\r\nby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\r\ntumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\r\napproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\r\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\r\naudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\r\nwashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\r\nchest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\r\na new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw\r\nwritten, DON\xe2\x80\x99T GO HOME.\r\n\r\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never\r\nwarded off this DON\xe2\x80\x99T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I\r\nthought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had\r\nread in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums\r\nin the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had\r\nbeen found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that\r\nhe must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\r\nassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\r\nto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\r\nof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\r\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\r\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\r\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\r\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\r\nthought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I\r\nrecalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\r\ntones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,\xe2\x80\x94even then I was\r\npursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don\xe2\x80\x99t go home.\r\nWhen at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a\r\nvast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\r\ntense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\r\nnot ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may\r\nnot and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and\r\nshould not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and\r\nrolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the\r\nwall again.\r\n\r\nI had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was\r\nplain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally\r\nplain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could\r\nbe taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had\r\nbeen so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to\r\nstartle me from my uneasy bed.\r\n\r\nThe Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The little\r\nservant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I\r\npassed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,\r\nand so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was\r\nmaking tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a\r\nperspective view of the Aged in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Mr. Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did come home, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI left a note for you\r\nat each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come\r\nto?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the\r\nnotes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a good rule never to leave documentary\r\nevidence if you can help it, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know when it may be put\r\nin. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a liberty with you. _Would_ you mind toasting\r\nthis sausage for the Aged P.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I should be delighted to do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you can go about your work, Mary Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick to the\r\nlittle servant; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich leaves us to ourselves, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, winking, as she disappeared.\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse\r\nproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s sausage and he\r\nbuttered the crumb of the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s roll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Pip, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and I understand one\r\nanother. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have\r\nbeen engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official\r\nsentiments are one thing. We are extra official.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted\r\nthe Aged\xe2\x80\x99s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accidentally heard, yesterday morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing in a\r\ncertain place where I once took you,\xe2\x80\x94even between you and me, it\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nwell not to mention names when avoidable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better not,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard there by chance, yesterday morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a\r\ncertain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not\r\nunpossessed of portable property,\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who it may really be,\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t name this person\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\r\nmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,\r\nand not quite irrespective of the government expense\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s sausage,\r\nand greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s; for which\r\nI apologised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of\r\nthereabouts. From which,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cconjectures had been raised\r\nand theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden\r\nCourt, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, evasively, \xe2\x80\x9cit might clash\r\nwith official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard\r\nother curious things in the same place. I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell it you on\r\ninformation received. I heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set\r\nforth the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing\r\nit before him, he went into the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s room with a clean white cloth,\r\nand tied the same under the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and propped him up,\r\nand put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then\r\nhe placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nright, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, Aged P.?\xe2\x80\x9d To which the cheerful Aged replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nright, John, my boy, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d As there seemed to be a tacit\r\nunderstanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was\r\ntherefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in\r\ncomplete ignorance of these proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to\r\nsuspect),\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Wemmick when he came back, \xe2\x80\x9cis inseparable from\r\nthe person to whom you have adverted; is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick looked very serious. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t undertake to say that, of my\r\nown knowledge. I mean, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t undertake to say it was at first. But\r\nit either is, or it will be, or it\xe2\x80\x99s in great danger of being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying\r\nas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out\r\nof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I\r\ntold him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to\r\nask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\r\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\r\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\r\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\r\nonce, to put my question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\r\nCompeyson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered with one other nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne other nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\r\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cquestioning being over,\xe2\x80\x9d which he emphasised and\r\nrepeated for my guidance, \xe2\x80\x9cI come to what I did, after hearing what I\r\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\r\nClarriker\xe2\x80\x99s to find Mr. Herbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd him you found?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\r\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody\xe2\x80\x94Tom,\r\nJack, or Richard\xe2\x80\x94being about the chambers, or about the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\r\nwhile you were out of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be greatly puzzled what to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my\r\nopinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too\r\nfar out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something. Under\r\nexisting circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you\r\nare once in it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things\r\nslacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\r\ndone?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cafter being all of a heap for half an\r\nhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\r\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\r\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\r\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\r\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot personally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\r\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\r\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very\r\nmoderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the\r\nstate of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time\r\nbefore I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful\r\nphilosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not\r\nbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;\r\nand thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara\xe2\x80\x99s esteem,\r\nand although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged\r\nmessages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I\r\ndid not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house with the bow-window,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing by the\r\nriver-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and\r\nbeing kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished\r\nupper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that\r\nas a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very\r\nwell of it, for three reasons I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual\r\nheap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it\r\nyourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,\r\nthrough Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be\r\nprudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a\r\nforeign packet-boat, there he is\xe2\x80\x94ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\r\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,\r\nand by nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or\r\nRichard,\xe2\x80\x94whichever it may be,\xe2\x80\x94you and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know,\xe2\x80\x94quite\r\nsuccessfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was\r\nsummoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and\r\ncornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that\r\nit was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself\r\nabout your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off\r\nand quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;\r\nand for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last\r\nnight, you should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and you\r\nwant confusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and\r\nbegan to get his coat on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,\xe2\x80\x94from a\r\nWalworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal\r\ncapacity,\xe2\x80\x94I shall be glad to do it. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the address. There can be no\r\nharm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is\r\nwell with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,\xe2\x80\x94which is another\r\nreason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone\r\nhome, don\xe2\x80\x99t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nhis hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; \xe2\x80\x9cand let\r\nme finally impress one important point upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid his hands\r\nupon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cAvail yourself of\r\nthis evening to lay hold of his portable property. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nmay happen to him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let anything happen to the portable property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I\r\nforbore to try.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime\xe2\x80\x99s up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand I must be off. If you had nothing more\r\npressing to do than to keep here till dark, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I should\r\nadvise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a\r\nperfectly quiet day with the Aged,\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll be up presently,\xe2\x80\x94and a little\r\nbit of\xe2\x80\x94you remember the pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; and a little bit of _him_. That sausage you toasted was his, and\r\nhe was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old\r\nacquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!\xe2\x80\x9d in a cheery shout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John; all right, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d piped the old man from within.\r\n\r\nI soon fell asleep before Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed\r\none another\xe2\x80\x99s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.\r\nWe had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and I\r\nnodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it\r\ndrowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire\r\nfor toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from\r\nhis glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight o\xe2\x80\x99clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,\r\nnot disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore\r\nboat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side\r\nregion of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to\r\nme; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted\r\nwas not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to\r\nfind. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin; and I had no other\r\nguide to Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.\r\n\r\nIt matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself\r\namong, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,\r\nwhat ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of\r\nship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into\r\nthe ground, though for years off duty, what mountainous country of\r\naccumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old\r\nGreen Copper. After several times falling short of my destination and\r\nas often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill\r\nPond Bank. It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered,\r\nwhere the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and there\r\nwere two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined\r\nwindmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\xe2\x80\x94whose long and\r\nnarrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden\r\nframes set in the ground, that looked like superannuated\r\nhaymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.\r\n\r\nSelecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a\r\nwooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is\r\nanother thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,\r\nMrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly\r\nwoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was\r\nimmediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the\r\nparlour and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very\r\nfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room\r\nand region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at the\r\ncorner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the\r\nchimney-piece, and the coloured engravings on the wall, representing\r\nthe death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George\r\nthe Third in a state coachman\xe2\x80\x99s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots,\r\non the terrace at Windsor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is well, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand he is quite satisfied, though\r\neager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll wait\r\ntill she comes down, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you known to her, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nupstairs. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ her father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably\r\nexpressed the fact in my countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid he is a sad old rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nhave never seen him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you smell rum? He is always at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt rum?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand you may suppose how mild it makes his\r\ngout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his\r\nroom, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and\r\n_will_ weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and\r\nthen died away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else can be the consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, in explanation, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nhe _will_ cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand\xe2\x80\x94and\r\neverywhere else\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without\r\nhurting himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious\r\nroar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs.\r\nWhimple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cfor of course people in general won\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nthat noise. A curious place, Handel; isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Whimple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, when I told him so, \xe2\x80\x9cis the best of\r\nhousewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her\r\nmotherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no\r\nrelation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely that\xe2\x80\x99s not his name, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s my name for him. His name is Mr.\r\nBarley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother\r\nto love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself\r\nor anybody else about her family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he\r\nfirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at\r\nan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home to\r\nnurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the\r\nmotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with\r\nequal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that\r\nnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by\r\nreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\r\nmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser\xe2\x80\x99s stores.\r\n\r\nAs we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley\xe2\x80\x99s sustained\r\ngrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door\r\nopened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came\r\nin with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the\r\nbasket, and presented, blushing, as \xe2\x80\x9cClara.\xe2\x80\x9d She really was a most\r\ncharming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that\r\ntruculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate\r\nand tender smile, after we had talked a little; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s poor Clara\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupper, served out every night. Here\xe2\x80\x99s her allowance of bread, and\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s her slice of cheese, and here\xe2\x80\x99s her rum,\xe2\x80\x94which I drink. This is\r\nMr. Barley\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two\r\nmutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two\r\nounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstewed up together, and taken hot, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice thing for the gout,\r\nI should think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something so natural and winning in Clara\xe2\x80\x99s resigned way of\r\nlooking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and\r\nsomething so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of\r\nyielding herself to Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s embracing arm; and something so gentle in\r\nher, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin,\r\nand the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the\r\nbeam,\xe2\x80\x94that I would not have undone the engagement between her and\r\nHerbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.\r\n\r\nI was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the\r\ngrowl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was\r\nheard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it\r\nthrough the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa wants me, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d and ran away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an unconscionable old shark for you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou suppose he wants now, Handel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary\r\nmerit. \xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.\r\nWait a moment, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There he\r\ngoes!\xe2\x80\x9d Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHerbert, as it was succeeded by silence, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s drinking. Now,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHerbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s down again\r\non his back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to\r\nsee our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley\xe2\x80\x99s door, he was heard hoarsely\r\nmuttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the\r\nfollowing Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something\r\nquite the reverse:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhoy! Bless your eyes, here\xe2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley. Here\xe2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley,\r\nbless your eyes. Here\xe2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the\r\nLord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley\r\nwould commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while\r\nit was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which\r\nwas fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.\r\n\r\nIn his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and\r\nairy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found\r\nProvis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel\r\nnone that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was\r\nsoftened,\xe2\x80\x94indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never\r\nafterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity that the day\xe2\x80\x99s rest had given me for reflection had\r\nresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting\r\nCompeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might\r\notherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\r\ndestruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\r\nfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\r\nand sources of information?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a grave nod, \xe2\x80\x9cJaggers knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I have talked with Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand have come to tell you\r\nwhat caution he gave me and what advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\r\nhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\r\nprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\r\nmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\r\nclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\r\nsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\r\ncame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\r\nbe safest in Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. What was to follow that I did not\r\ntouch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it\r\nin my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in\r\ndeclared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by\r\nenlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled\r\nand difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it\r\nwere no worse?\r\n\r\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\r\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\r\nventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\r\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help.\r\n\r\nHerbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that\r\nsomething had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are both good\r\nwatermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the\r\nright time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no\r\nboatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance\r\nis worth saving. Never mind the season; don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it might be a\r\ngood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs,\r\nand were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into\r\nthat habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,\r\nand there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or\r\nfifty-first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed that\r\nit should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never\r\nrecognise us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.\r\nBut we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part\r\nof his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was\r\nright.\r\n\r\nOur conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;\r\nremarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and\r\nthat I would take half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s start of him. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to leave\r\nyou here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Provis, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I cannot doubt your being safer\r\nhere than near me. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, clasping my hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know when we may\r\nmeet again, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like good-bye. Say good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time\r\ncomes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good-night, good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we left\r\nhim on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the\r\nstair-rail to light us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought of\r\nthe first night of his return, when our positions were reversed, and\r\nwhen I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at\r\nparting from him as it was now.\r\n\r\nOld Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no\r\nappearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the\r\nfoot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name\r\nof Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr.\r\nCampbell. He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there\r\nwas, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a\r\nstrong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a\r\nsecluded life. So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs. Whimple and\r\nClara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr.\r\nCampbell, but kept it to myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of\r\nthe motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a\r\nlittle affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk\r\nhad grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the\r\nhills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were\r\nredeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin to fill it\r\nto overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and\r\nwent home very sadly.\r\n\r\nAll things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The\r\nwindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\r\nand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\r\nfountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\r\nme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside\r\nwhen he came in,\xe2\x80\x94for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\r\nfatigued,\xe2\x80\x94made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\r\nhe looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\r\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\r\n\r\nNext day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\r\nwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her\r\nwithin a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\r\npractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\r\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\r\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\r\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\r\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\r\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But\r\nI knew well enough how to \xe2\x80\x98shoot\xe2\x80\x99 the bridge after seeing it done, and\r\nso began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to\r\nErith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were\r\npulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the\r\nblind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less\r\nfrequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single\r\nword of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there\r\nwas cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being\r\nwatched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning\r\npersons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.\r\n\r\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in\r\nhiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to\r\nstand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,\r\nand to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards\r\nClara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,\r\nand that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going\r\nswiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,\r\nand he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain,\r\nand had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at\r\nthe Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him\r\nas I did.\r\n\r\nMy worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed\r\nfor money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the\r\nwant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve\r\nit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But\r\nI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\r\nmoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\r\nplans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,\r\nto hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94whether\r\nit was a false kind or a true, I hardly know\xe2\x80\x94in not having profited by\r\nhis generosity since his revelation of himself.\r\n\r\nAs the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella\r\nwas married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a\r\nconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had\r\nconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her\r\nto me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of\r\nhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you\r\nwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own\r\nlast year, last month, last week?\r\n\r\nIt was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,\r\ntowering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a\r\nrange of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause\r\nfor fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror\r\nfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would\r\nwith dread, for Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s returning step at night, lest it should be\r\nfleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,\xe2\x80\x94for all that, and\r\nmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to\r\ninaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed\r\nabout in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.\r\n\r\nThere were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could\r\nnot get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London\r\nBridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be\r\nbrought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing\r\nthis, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the\r\nwater-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings\r\nthat I have now to tell of.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the\r\nwharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,\r\nand had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had\r\nbecome foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back\r\namong the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I\r\nhad seen the signal in his window, All well.\r\n\r\nAs it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort\r\nmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and\r\nsolitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would\r\nafterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved\r\nhis questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it is\r\nnowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that\r\nMr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the\r\ncontrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously\r\nheard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection\r\nwith a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen\r\nhim as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red\r\nbrick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.\r\n\r\nI dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,\r\nwhere there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every\r\nhalf-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the\r\nknives,\xe2\x80\x94to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the\r\nLord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s dominions which is not geographical,\xe2\x80\x94and wore out the time\r\nin dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of\r\ndinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.\r\n\r\nThere, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service,\xe2\x80\x94a most\r\nexcellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so\r\ntight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,\xe2\x80\x94who knocked all\r\nthe little men\xe2\x80\x99s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and\r\nbrave, and who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s paying taxes, though he was\r\nvery patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in\r\nthe cloth, and on that property married a young person in\r\nbed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of\r\nPortsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach\r\nto rub their own hands and shake everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s, and sing \xe2\x80\x9cFill,\r\nfill!\xe2\x80\x9d A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fill, or\r\ndo anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly\r\nstated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed\r\nto two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so\r\neffectually done (the Swab family having considerable political\r\ninfluence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then\r\nit was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white\r\nhat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a\r\ngridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down\r\nfrom behind with the gridiron whom he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t confute with what he had\r\noverheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s (who had never been heard of\r\nbefore) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of\r\ngreat power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all\r\nto go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down\r\nthe Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The\r\nboatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on\r\nthe Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your\r\nHonour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,\r\nconceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into\r\na dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that\r\ncorner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\r\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.\r\nWopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\r\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in\r\nthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\r\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\r\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\r\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,\xe2\x80\x94on account of\r\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x99s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\r\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,\xe2\x80\x94summoned a sententious\r\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,\r\nafter an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a\r\nhigh-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.\r\nThe business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked\r\nat, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various\r\ncolours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with\r\ngreat surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he\r\nwere lost in amazement.\r\n\r\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\r\nWopsle\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\r\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat\r\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\r\nwatch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking of\r\nit when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him\r\nwaiting for me near the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the\r\nstreet together. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw that you saw me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaw you, Mr. Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course I saw you. But who\r\nelse was there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the strangest thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost\r\nlook again; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet I could swear to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBecoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be positive;\r\nyet I think I should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me\r\nwhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! He can\xe2\x80\x99t be in sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle. \xe2\x80\x9cHe went out before I went\r\noff. I saw him go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected\r\nthis poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some\r\nadmission. Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw\r\nthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a\r\nghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak\r\nyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on\r\nto induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was\r\nperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is\r\nso very strange! You\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I\r\ncould hardly believe it myself, if you told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas\r\nDay, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery\xe2\x80\x99s, and some\r\nsoldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember it very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that\r\nwe joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took\r\nthe lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember it all very well.\xe2\x80\x9d Better than he thought,\xe2\x80\x94except the last\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that\r\nthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been\r\nseverely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it all before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,\r\nand that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,\r\nwith the torchlight shining on their faces,\xe2\x80\x94I am particular about\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x94with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an\r\nouter ring of dark night all about us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I\r\nsaw him over your shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. I asked him then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of the two do you suppose\r\nyou saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one who had been mauled,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered readily, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear I\r\nsaw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very curious!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with the best assumption I could put on\r\nof its being nothing more to me. \xe2\x80\x9cVery curious indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation\r\nthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhaving been behind me \xe2\x80\x9clike a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d For if he had ever been out of my\r\nthoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was\r\nin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I\r\nshould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I\r\nhad shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had\r\nfound him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\r\nbecause I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger\r\nthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.\r\n\r\nI put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He\r\ncould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.\r\nIt was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to\r\nidentify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,\r\nand known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How\r\nwas he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,\r\nin black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I\r\nbelieved not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no\r\nespecial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a\r\nface at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I\r\nextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate\r\nrefreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was\r\nbetween twelve and one o\xe2\x80\x99clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates\r\nwere shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.\r\n\r\nHerbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.\r\nBut there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what\r\nI had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his\r\nhint. As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to\r\nthe Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I\r\nwent to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.\r\nHerbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very\r\ncautious. And we were very cautious indeed,\xe2\x80\x94more cautious than before,\r\nif that were possible,\xe2\x80\x94and I for my part never went near Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBasin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank\r\nas I looked at anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred\r\nabout a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf\r\nbelow Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,\r\nundecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was\r\nstrolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy\r\nconcourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one\r\novertaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and he passed it through my\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.\r\nWhere are you bound for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Temple, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in\r\ncross-examination, \xe2\x80\x9cI do _not_ know, for I have not made up my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to dine?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind admitting\r\nthat, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind admitting that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are not engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9ccome and dine with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was going to excuse myself, when he added, \xe2\x80\x9cWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xe2\x80\x9d So I\r\nchanged my excuse into an acceptance,\xe2\x80\x94the few words I had uttered,\r\nserving for the beginning of either,\xe2\x80\x94and we went along Cheapside and\r\nslanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up\r\nbrilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely\r\nfinding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x99s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,\r\nopening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at\r\nthe Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.\r\n\r\nAt the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,\r\nhand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the\r\nbusiness of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s fire, its rising\r\nand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were\r\nplaying a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,\r\nfat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a\r\ncorner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance\r\nof a host of hanged clients.\r\n\r\nWe went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,\r\nas soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have\r\nthought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much\r\nas a look to Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no\r\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it\r\nwas not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he\r\nraised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if\r\nthere were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you send that note of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nJaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9cit was going by post, when you brought\r\nMr. Pip into the office. Here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d He handed it to his principal\r\ninstead of to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a note of two lines, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, \xe2\x80\x9csent\r\nup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your\r\naddress. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of\r\nbusiness you mentioned to her. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in\r\nthose terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you think of going down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an impending engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was\r\nputting fish into the post-office, \xe2\x80\x9cthat renders me rather uncertain of\r\nmy time. At once, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick to Mr.\r\nJaggers, \xe2\x80\x9che needn\xe2\x80\x99t write an answer, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I\r\nsettled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass\r\nof wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not\r\nat me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Pip! Our friend the Spider,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9chas played his\r\ncards. He has won the pool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah! He is a promising fellow\xe2\x80\x94in his way\xe2\x80\x94but he may not have it all\r\nhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to\r\nbe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do not\r\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and\r\nbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be\r\na question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work\r\nto give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\r\ncircumstances, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a toss-up between two results.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what they are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fellow like our friend the Spider,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9ceither\r\nbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but\r\nhe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither beats or cringes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo here\xe2\x80\x99s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, taking a\r\ndecanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of\r\nus and for himself, \xe2\x80\x9cand may the question of supremacy be settled to\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady _and_ the\r\ngentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow\r\nyou are to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the\r\ntable. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,\r\nnervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers,\r\nas she spoke, arrested my attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwas rather\r\npainful to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\r\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\r\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did\r\ngo. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and\r\nsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately!\r\n\r\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\r\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\r\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\r\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\r\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and\r\na stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\r\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\r\nme when I last walked\xe2\x80\x94not alone\xe2\x80\x94in the ruined garden, and through the\r\ndeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\r\nsaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\r\nwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\r\nlightning, when I had passed in a carriage\xe2\x80\x94not alone\xe2\x80\x94through a sudden\r\nglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\r\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\r\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\r\nchance swift from Estella\xe2\x80\x99s name to the fingers with their knitting\r\naction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\r\nwoman was Estella\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\r\nthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\r\nthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\r\nwine again, and went on with his dinner.\r\n\r\nOnly twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\r\nroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\r\nwere Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and her eyes were Estella\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and if she had\r\nreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\r\nsure that my conviction was the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,\r\nquite as a matter of business,\xe2\x80\x94just as he might have drawn his salary\r\nwhen that came round,\xe2\x80\x94and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of\r\nperpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,\r\nhis post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\r\nfor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\r\ntwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\r\n\r\nWe took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\r\namong Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\r\ntwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\r\nGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\r\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\r\nevaporated into the evening air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s over! He\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful man, without his\r\nliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine\r\nwith him,\xe2\x80\x94and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it to anybody but yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that\r\nwhat is said between you and me goes no further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s adopted daughter, Mrs.\r\nBentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of\r\nthe Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned\r\nMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll\r\nof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you remember telling me, before I first went to\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s private house, to notice that housekeeper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nsuddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wild beast tamed, you called her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do _you_ call her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\r\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\r\ngoes no further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d Wemmick replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know her story,\xe2\x80\x94that is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nall of it. But what I do know I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. We are in our private and\r\npersonal capacities, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\r\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\r\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\r\nwas up, as you may suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she was acquitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers was for her,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Wemmick, with a look full of\r\nmeaning, \xe2\x80\x9cand worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a\r\ndesperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and\r\nhe worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to\r\nhave made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day\r\nfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial\r\nwhere he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work it himself, sat under counsel, and\xe2\x80\x94every one\r\nknew\xe2\x80\x94put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.\r\nIt was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman\r\nin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick\r\n(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of\r\njealousy. The murdered woman,\xe2\x80\x94more a match for the man, certainly, in\r\npoint of years\xe2\x80\x94was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had\r\nbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched\r\nand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,\r\nthere was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\r\nwoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.\r\nJaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick,\r\ntouching me on the sleeve, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he never dwelt upon the strength of\r\nher hands then, though he sometimes does now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d Wemmick went on; \xe2\x80\x9cit happened\xe2\x80\x94happened, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee?\xe2\x80\x94that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her\r\napprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\r\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\r\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a\r\nbruise or two about her,\xe2\x80\x94nothing for a tramp,\xe2\x80\x94but the backs of her\r\nhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?\r\nNow, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\r\nbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not\r\nhave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles\r\nwere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the\r\nfact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\r\nbeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little\r\nspots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made\r\nwas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that\r\nshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the\r\nmurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man\xe2\x80\x94some three years\r\nold\xe2\x80\x94to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and\r\nwe show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and\r\nyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept\r\nall consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\r\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have\r\nscratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder\r\nof her child; why don\xe2\x80\x99t you? As to this case, if you _will_ have\r\nscratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted\r\nfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo sum up, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers was altogether too\r\nmany for the jury, and they gave in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she been in his service ever since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but not only that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cshe went into his service\r\nimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since\r\nbeen taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was\r\ntamed from the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember the sex of the child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid to have been a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing more to say to me to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for\r\nmy thoughts, though with no relief from the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s note in my pocket, that it might serve as my\r\ncredentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her\r\nwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I\r\nwent down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway\r\nHouse, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for\r\nI sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to\r\nleave it in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet\r\nechoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old\r\nmonks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong\r\nwalls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,\r\nwere almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral\r\nchimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried\r\non avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell\r\nof the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the\r\nrooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high\r\ntrees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was\r\nchanged, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.\r\n\r\nAn elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who\r\nlived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the\r\ngate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,\r\nand I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was\r\nnot in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.\r\nLooking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on\r\nthe hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the\r\ncontemplation of, the ashy fire.\r\n\r\nDoing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\r\nchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There\r\nwas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to\r\npity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could\r\ncharge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in\r\nthe progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked\r\nfortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in\r\na low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it real?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost\r\nno time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. Thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I\r\nremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto pursue that subject you mentioned to me when\r\nyou were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But\r\nperhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my\r\nheart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous\r\nright hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it\r\nagain before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\r\nsomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that I would like done very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had\r\nnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking\r\nin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be\r\nso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\r\nthat she was conscious of the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you break off,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\r\nof me, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped\r\nbecause I thought you were not following what I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I was not,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, putting a hand to her head. \xe2\x80\x9cBegin\r\nagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\r\nhabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\r\nforcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\r\nhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in\r\nthis I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\r\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\r\nwere the weighty secrets of another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhow much money is wanting to complete the purchase?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. \xe2\x80\x9cNine\r\nhundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as\r\nyou have kept your own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite as faithfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your mind will be more at rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch more at rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very unhappy now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an\r\nunwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my\r\nvoice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and\r\nsoftly laid her forehead on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of\r\ndisquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\r\nunhappiness. Is it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as\r\ndone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the\r\ntone of the question. But there is nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\r\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\r\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\r\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung\r\nfrom her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite. I dined with him yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\r\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\r\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\r\nit from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\r\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\r\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\r\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\r\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\r\nlooking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nforgive her,\xe2\x80\x9d though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI can do it now. There have been sore\r\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\r\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\r\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\r\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\r\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\r\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\r\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\r\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of\r\nmine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and\r\nwept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that\r\nthe relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was\r\nnot kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, despairingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done! What have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\r\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.\r\nIs she married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\r\nhad told me so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done! What have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d She wrung her hands, and crushed\r\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhave I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\r\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\r\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\r\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of\r\nday, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\r\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\r\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\r\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\r\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\r\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this\r\nearth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become\r\na master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,\r\nthe vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\r\ncurses in this world?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\r\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\r\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d And so again,\r\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, when her cry had died away, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may dismiss\r\nme from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and\r\nif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\r\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\r\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know it. But, Pip\xe2\x80\x94my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d There was an earnest womanly\r\ncompassion for me in her new affection. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear! Believe this: when\r\nshe first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At\r\nfirst, I meant no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\r\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\r\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\r\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter,\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help saying, \xe2\x80\x9cto have left her a natural heart,\r\neven to be bruised or broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and\r\nthen burst out again, What had she done!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew all my story,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have some\r\ncompassion for me and a better understanding of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, as delicately as I could, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I may\r\nsay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first\r\nleft this neighbourhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration,\r\nand I hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed\r\nbetween us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to\r\nEstella? Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and\r\nher head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose child was Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrought her here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me how that came about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered in a low whisper and with caution: \xe2\x80\x9cI had been shut up in\r\nthese rooms a long time (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long; you know what time the\r\nclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear\r\nand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent for\r\nhim to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the\r\nnewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would\r\nlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here\r\nasleep, and I called her Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I ask her age then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an\r\norphan and I adopted her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo convinced I was of that woman\xe2\x80\x99s being her mother, that I wanted no\r\nevidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I\r\nthought, the connection here was clear and straight.\r\n\r\nWhat more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had\r\nsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew\r\nof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No\r\nmatter with what other words we parted; we parted.\r\n\r\nTwilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I\r\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I\r\nwould not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before\r\nleaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,\r\nand I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.\r\n\r\nBy the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which\r\nthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and\r\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\r\nend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by\r\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the\r\npaths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary\r\nall!\r\n\r\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\r\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at\r\nthe opposite door,\xe2\x80\x94not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started\r\nand swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was\r\nencumbered with a growth of fungus,\xe2\x80\x94when I turned my head to look back.\r\nA childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of\r\nthe slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to\r\nthe beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam\r\nshuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,\xe2\x80\x94though to be\r\nsure I was there in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this\r\nillusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\r\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\r\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on\r\ninto the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let\r\nme out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go\r\nupstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I\r\nhad left her. I took the latter course and went up.\r\n\r\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in\r\nthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back\r\ntowards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly\r\naway, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw\r\nher running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about\r\nher, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\r\n\r\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\r\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\r\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same\r\npurpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,\r\nand all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the\r\nground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered\r\nher, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,\xe2\x80\x94that this\r\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\r\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\r\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\r\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\r\nbridal dress.\r\n\r\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\r\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\r\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\r\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\r\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the\r\nflames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her\r\ngarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.\r\n\r\nShe was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even\r\ntouched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I\r\nunreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire\r\nwould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my\r\nhands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nOn examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,\r\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay\r\nmainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s directions, her bed was\r\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to\r\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again,\r\nan hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her\r\nstick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.\r\n\r\nThough every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she still\r\nhad something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had\r\ncovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with a\r\nwhite sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that\r\nhad been and was changed was still upon her.\r\n\r\nI found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I\r\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next\r\npost. Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s family I took upon myself; intending to\r\ncommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he\r\nliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert,\r\nas soon as I returned to town.\r\n\r\nThere was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had\r\nhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she\r\nbegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that\r\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she first came, I meant to save her from misery like\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, \xe2\x80\x9cTake the pencil and write under my name, \xe2\x80\x98I forgive\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she\r\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in\r\nanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.\r\n\r\nAs I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that\r\npressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could\r\nnot drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I\r\nwould return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and\r\nbeing taken up clear of the town. At about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock of the morning,\r\ntherefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as\r\nthey said, not stopping for being touched, \xe2\x80\x9cTake the pencil and write\r\nunder my name, \xe2\x80\x98I forgive her.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter L.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in\r\nthe morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less\r\nseverely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames\r\nhad set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My\r\nright hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It\r\nwas bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand\r\nand arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like\r\na cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had\r\nbeen caught by the fire, but not my head or face.\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came\r\nback to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He\r\nwas the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,\r\nand steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put\r\nthem on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nAt first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I\r\nmight say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the\r\nflames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I dozed\r\nfor a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s cries, and by her\r\nrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain of\r\nthe mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I\r\nsuffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nNeither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That was\r\nmade apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our\r\nagreeing\xe2\x80\x94without agreement\xe2\x80\x94to make my recovery of the use of my hands a\r\nquestion of so many hours, not of so many weeks.\r\n\r\nMy first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all\r\nwas well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect\r\nconfidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the\r\nday was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more\r\nby the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was Clara?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear little thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was up and down with\r\nGruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor\r\nthe moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.\r\nWhat with rum and pepper,\xe2\x80\x94and pepper and rum,\xe2\x80\x94I should think his\r\npegging must be nearly over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you will be married, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I take care of the dear child otherwise?\xe2\x80\x94Lay your arm out upon\r\nthe back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down here, and get the\r\nbandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was\r\nspeaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and\r\ntold me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some\r\nwoman that he had had great trouble with.\xe2\x80\x94Did I hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.\r\nShall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me by all means. Every word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been\r\nrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour head is cool?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, touching it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a bandage off most charmingly, and\r\nnow comes the cool one,\xe2\x80\x94makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t it? but it will be comfortable presently,\xe2\x80\x94it seems that the woman\r\nwas a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;\r\nrevengeful, Handel, to the last degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what last degree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurder.\xe2\x80\x94Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHerbert, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, and\r\nthe reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis. It\r\nwas another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been\r\na struggle\xe2\x80\x94in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair,\r\nmay be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the\r\nvictim was found throttled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the woman brought in guilty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she was acquitted.\xe2\x80\x94My poor Handel, I hurt you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little\r\nchild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very\r\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\r\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\r\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\r\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s the worst arm\r\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\r\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light than\r\nby a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the poor\r\nblistered patches too distinctly.\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t think your breathing is\r\naffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere comes the darkest part of Provis\xe2\x80\x99s life. She did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, he says she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,\r\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says it all.\r\nI have no other information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, whether,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9che had used the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother ill,\r\nor whether he had used the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother well, Provis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say; but\r\nshe had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he\r\ndescribed to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for\r\nher, and forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be\r\ncalled upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause\r\nof her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept\r\nhimself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was\r\nonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the\r\njealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost\r\nthe child and the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,\r\nthe worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping\r\nout of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course\r\nafterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him\r\npoorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbed\r\nthe point of Provis\xe2\x80\x99s animosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand particularly, Herbert, whether he told\r\nyou when this happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His\r\nexpression was, \xe2\x80\x98a round score o\xe2\x80\x99 year ago, and a\xe2\x80\x99most directly after I\r\ntook up wi\xe2\x80\x99 Compeyson.\xe2\x80\x99 How old were you when you came upon him in the\r\nlittle churchyard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think in my seventh year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you\r\nbrought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would\r\nhave been about your age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you\r\nsee me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the firelight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Herbert, coming close again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do look at you, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do touch you, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much\r\ndisordered by the accident of last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, after taking time to examine me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the\r\nriver, is Estella\xe2\x80\x99s Father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving\r\nEstella\xe2\x80\x99s parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the\r\nquestion was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before\r\nme by a wiser head than my own.\r\n\r\nBut when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was\r\nseized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x94that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr.\r\nJaggers, and come at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I\r\nfelt that I did this for Estella\xe2\x80\x99s sake, or whether I was glad to\r\ntransfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some\r\nrays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps\r\nthe latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.\r\n\r\nAny way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street\r\nthat night. Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s representations that, if I did, I should probably\r\nbe laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive\xe2\x80\x99s safety would\r\ndepend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding,\r\nagain and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.\r\nJaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my\r\nhurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out\r\ntogether, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left\r\nHerbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.\r\n\r\nThere were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over\r\nthe office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things\r\nstraight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the\r\nouter office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s post that morning, I knew\r\nwhat was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick\r\ntogether, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to\r\ncompromise him.\r\n\r\nMy appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my\r\nshoulders, favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief\r\naccount of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to\r\ngive him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused\r\nour talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the\r\nrules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the\r\ndisaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.\r\nWemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the\r\npockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.\r\nThe two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official\r\nproceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsmell fire at the present moment.\r\n\r\nMy narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for\r\nHerbert. Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when\r\nI handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,\r\nwith instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was\r\nin course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.\r\nJaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked\r\non at me. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as I put the check in my pocket,\r\nwhen he had signed it, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we do nothing for _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham was good enough to ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether she\r\ncould do nothing for me, and I told her No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody should know his own business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw\r\nWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s lips form the words \xe2\x80\x9cportable property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Jaggers;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut every man ought to know his own business best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery man\xe2\x80\x99s business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis portable property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at\r\nheart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to\r\ngive me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave\r\nme all she possessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and\r\nthen straightening himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHah! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should have done so,\r\nif I had been Miss Havisham. But _she_ ought to know her own business\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know more of the history of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s adopted child than Miss\r\nHavisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated \xe2\x80\x9cMother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen her mother within these three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I know more of Estella\xe2\x80\x99s history than even you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow her father too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner\xe2\x80\x94he was too\r\nself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being\r\nbrought to an indefinably attentive stop\xe2\x80\x94assured me that he did not\r\nknow who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\r\nwhich I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reason\r\nfor claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this\r\nunconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s part before, though I was quite sure\r\nof it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! You know the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s father, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand his name is Provis\xe2\x80\x94from New South Wales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest\r\nstart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\r\nsooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\r\naction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\r\nannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\r\nthen, lest Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s sharpness should detect that there had been\r\nsome communication unknown to him between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on what evidence, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\r\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes Provis make\r\nthis claim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not make it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand has never made it, and has no\r\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\r\nunexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\r\nwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\r\nwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\r\n\r\nThen I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\r\nthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\r\nknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\r\ntowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been\r\nfor some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s look. When I did at last\r\nturn my eyes in Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s direction, I found that he had unposted his\r\npen, and was intent upon the table before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a\r\npassionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and\r\nmanly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had\r\nlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had\r\nmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I\r\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence\r\nfrom him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said\r\nthat I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\r\nassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\r\nand why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\r\ncared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\r\nand that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\r\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\r\nelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\r\nsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\r\nWemmick, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\r\nheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\r\ninnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\r\nlife. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to\r\nrepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be\r\nmore open with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.\r\nJaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving\r\ncrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\r\nemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something\r\nlike a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou with an old father, and you\r\nwith pleasant and playful ways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t bring \xe2\x80\x99em here, what does it\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling\r\nopenly, \xe2\x80\x9cthis man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink you\xe2\x80\x99re another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still\r\ndistrustful that the other was taking him in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ with a pleasant home?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince it don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with business,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9clet it be\r\nso. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if _you_ might be\r\nplanning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of\r\nthese days, when you\xe2\x80\x99re tired of all this work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and\r\nactually drew a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about \xe2\x80\x98poor\r\ndreams;\xe2\x80\x99 you know more about such things than I, having much fresher\r\nexperience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a\r\ncase to you. Mind! I admit nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly\r\nsaid that he admitted nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cput this case. Put the case that a\r\nwoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child\r\nconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal\r\nadviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to\r\nthe latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put\r\nthe case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\r\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI follow you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\r\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\r\ndestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\r\na criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\r\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\r\nneglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\r\nup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\r\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,\r\nto develop into the fish that were to come to his net,\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\nprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI follow you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\r\nheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\r\nno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\r\npower: \xe2\x80\x9cI know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,\r\nyou did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you\r\nthrough it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it\r\nshould be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be\r\nproduced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring\r\nyou off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,\r\nyour child is still saved.\xe2\x80\x9d Put the case that this was done, and that\r\nthe woman was cleared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that I make no admissions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you make no admissions.\xe2\x80\x9d And Wemmick repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cNo admissions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little\r\nshaken the woman\xe2\x80\x99s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\r\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\r\nsheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\r\nold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\r\nout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\r\nthe imaginary case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\r\nthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the\r\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\r\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\r\nstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\r\nto yourself very carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Wemmick said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father\xe2\x80\x99s? I think\r\nhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother\xe2\x80\x99s? I\r\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For\r\nthe daughter\xe2\x80\x99s? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\r\nparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\r\ndisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\r\nlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her\r\nthe subject of those \xe2\x80\x98poor dreams\xe2\x80\x99 which have, at one time or another,\r\nbeen in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you\r\nthat you had better\xe2\x80\x94and would much sooner when you had thought well of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right\r\nhand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ off\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his\r\nlips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStanding by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the\r\nodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times:\r\nwith this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to\r\nsay conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional\r\nlight to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now\r\ninflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and\r\nWemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest\r\npoint in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill\r\nterms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.\r\n\r\nBut they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of\r\nMike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on\r\nhis sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance\r\nwithin those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or\r\nin that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble\r\n(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest\r\ndaughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this\r\nmelancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially\r\nbefore the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\nhappened to twinkle with a tear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you about?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you come snivelling here for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you? You\xe2\x80\x99re not in a fit state to\r\ncome here, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.\r\nWhat do you mean by it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man can\xe2\x80\x99t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis what?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. \xe2\x80\x9cSay that again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here my man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and\r\npointing to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of this office. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no feelings\r\nhere. Get out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt serves you right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and\r\nWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and\r\nwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had\r\njust had lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss\r\nSkiffins\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the\r\naccountant, going straight to Clarriker\xe2\x80\x99s and bringing Clarriker to me,\r\nI had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the\r\nonly good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,\r\nsince I was first apprised of my great expectations.\r\n\r\nClarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House\r\nwere steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a\r\nsmall branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension\r\nof the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would\r\ngo out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for a\r\nseparation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more\r\nsettled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening\r\nits hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.\r\n\r\nBut there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home\r\nof a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told\r\nme no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara\r\nBarley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join\r\nthem (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the\r\nNile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in\r\nthose bright plans, I felt that Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s way was clearing fast, and\r\nthat old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his\r\ndaughter would soon be happily provided for.\r\n\r\nWe had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it\r\npresented no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal\r\nthat I was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably\r\nrestored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.\r\n\r\nOn a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received\r\nthe following letter from Wemmick by the post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say\r\nWednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try\r\nit. Now burn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire\xe2\x80\x94but not\r\nbefore we had both got it by heart\xe2\x80\x94we considered what to do. For, of\r\ncourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought it over again and again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think I\r\nknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A\r\ngood fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and\r\nhonourable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had thought of him more than once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how much would you tell him, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere\r\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know\r\nthat there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.\r\nYou go with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\r\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,\xe2\x80\x94Hamburg, Rotterdam,\r\nAntwerp,\xe2\x80\x94the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\r\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I\r\nhad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\r\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\r\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\r\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\r\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\r\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\r\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\r\nmade inquiries beforehand.\r\n\r\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\r\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\r\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\r\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\r\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\r\nourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated\r\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\r\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\r\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock reported it\r\ndone. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\r\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\r\n\r\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;\r\nour charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our\r\nobject, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not\r\ncome home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that\r\nhe should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he\r\nshould prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on\r\nWednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the\r\narrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that\r\nhe should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThese precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.\r\n\r\nOn opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter\r\nin the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not\r\nill-written. It had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left\r\nhome), and its contents were these:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow\r\nnight at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,\r\nyou had better come. If you want information regarding _your uncle\r\nProvis_, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time.\r\n_You must come alone_. Bring this with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange\r\nletter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I\r\nmust decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would\r\ntake me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of\r\ngoing, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And\r\nagain, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some\r\nimportant bearing on the flight itself.\r\n\r\nIf I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still\r\nhave gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,\xe2\x80\x94my watch showing\r\nme that the coach started within half an hour,\xe2\x80\x94I resolved to go. I\r\nshould certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle\r\nProvis. That, coming on Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s letter and the morning\xe2\x80\x99s busy\r\npreparation, turned the scale.\r\n\r\nIt is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of\r\nalmost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this\r\nmysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be\r\nsecret got mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same\r\nmechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling\r\nhim that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I\r\nhad decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss\r\nHavisham was faring. I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock\r\nup the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If\r\nI had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have\r\nmissed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out\r\nof the yard. I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in\r\nstraw, when I came to myself.\r\n\r\nFor I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it\r\nhad so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning\r\nhurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had\r\nwaited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now\r\nI began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt\r\nwhether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider\r\nwhether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against\r\never heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through\r\nall those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose\r\nvery few hurried people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis\r\nby name mastered everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already\r\nwithout knowing it,\xe2\x80\x94if that be reasoning,\xe2\x80\x94in case any harm should\r\nbefall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!\r\n\r\nIt was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary\r\nto me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside\r\nin my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of\r\nminor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was\r\npreparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she\r\nwas still very ill, though considered something better.\r\n\r\nMy inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I\r\ndined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able\r\nto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\r\nme. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain\r\nme with my own story,\xe2\x80\x94of course with the popular feature that\r\nPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the young man?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow him!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cEver since he was\xe2\x80\x94no height at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he ever come back to this neighbourhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, he comes back,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cto his great friends, now and\r\nagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim that I speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pumblechook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he ungrateful to no one else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt he would be, if he could,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Pumblechook say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay so!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cHe han\xe2\x80\x99t no call to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut does he say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would turn a man\xe2\x80\x99s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\r\nit, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord.\r\n\r\nI thought, \xe2\x80\x9cYet Joe, dear Joe, _you_ never tell of it. Long-suffering\r\nand loving Joe, _you_ never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour appetite\xe2\x80\x99s been touched like by your accident,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlandlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. \xe2\x80\x9cTry a tenderer\r\nbit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, turning from the table to brood over the\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x9cI can eat no more. Please take it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as\r\nthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;\r\nthe meaner he, the nobler Joe.\r\n\r\nMy heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the\r\nfire for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not\r\nfrom my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened\r\nround my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for\r\nthe letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it,\r\nand was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of\r\nthe coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the\r\nlittle sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.\r\nTowards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed\r\nlands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there\r\nwas a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large\r\nmoon. In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in\r\namong the piled mountains of cloud.\r\n\r\nThere was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A\r\nstranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were\r\nso oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew\r\nthem well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had\r\nno excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my\r\ninclination, I went on against it.\r\n\r\nThe direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor\r\nthat in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards\r\nthe distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old\r\nlights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew\r\nthe limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles\r\napart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night,\r\nthere would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two\r\nbright specks.\r\n\r\nAt first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand\r\nstill while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose\r\nand blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while\r\nI seemed to have the whole flats to myself.\r\n\r\nIt was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was\r\nburning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and\r\nleft, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It\r\nlay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the\r\ntools and barrows that were lying about.\r\n\r\nComing up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,\xe2\x80\x94for the rude\r\npath lay through it,\xe2\x80\x94I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened\r\nmy pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,\r\nI looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,\r\nand how the house\xe2\x80\x94of wood with a tiled roof\xe2\x80\x94would not be proof against\r\nthe weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and\r\nooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kiln\r\ncrept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I\r\nknocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch.\r\n\r\nIt rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a\r\nlighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle\r\nbedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any one here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it\r\nwas past nine, called again, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any one here?\xe2\x80\x9d There being still\r\nno answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.\r\n\r\nIt was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen\r\nalready, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the\r\nshelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was\r\nconsidering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be\r\ncoming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head\r\nto look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken\r\nup the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent\r\nshock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in\r\na strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said a suppressed voice with an oath, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it? Help, help, help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my\r\nbad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nsometimes a strong man\xe2\x80\x99s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my\r\ncries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled\r\nineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the suppressed voice with another oath, \xe2\x80\x9ccall out again, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make short work of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the\r\nsurprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in\r\nexecution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.\r\nBut, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt\r\nbefore, it were now being boiled.\r\n\r\nThe sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black\r\ndarkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.\r\nAfter groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he\r\nwanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the\r\nsparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and\r\nbreathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue\r\npoint of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nwonder there,\xe2\x80\x94and one after another the sparks died out.\r\n\r\nThe man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As\r\nthe sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and\r\ntouches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending\r\nover the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,\r\nbreathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and\r\nshowed me Orlick.\r\n\r\nWhom I had looked for, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I had not looked for him. Seeing\r\nhim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nHe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\r\nand dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away\r\nfrom him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms\r\nfolded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to\r\na stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,\xe2\x80\x94a fixture\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x94the means of ascent to the loft above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnbind me. Let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go to the moon,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go to the stars. All in good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you lured me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a deadly look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you set upon me in the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than\r\ntwo. O you enemy, you enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms\r\nfolded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a\r\nmalignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence, he\r\nput his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a\r\nbrass-bound stock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know this?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, making as if he would take aim at me. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cost me that place. You did. Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else could I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to\r\ncome betwixt me and a young woman I liked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done\r\nyou no harm, if you had done yourself none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a liar. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll take any pains, and spend any money, to\r\ndrive me out of this country, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, repeating my words to\r\nBiddy in the last interview I had with her. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a piece\r\nof information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of\r\nthis country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty\r\ntimes told, to the last brass farden!\xe2\x80\x9d As he shook his heavy hand at\r\nme, with his mouth snarling like a tiger\xe2\x80\x99s, I felt that it was true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a-going,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a\r\nheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na-going to have your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\r\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was always in Old Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s way since ever you was a child. You\r\ngoes out of his way this present night. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have no more on you.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked\r\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, folding his arms on the table again, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have a rag of you, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have a bone of you, left on earth.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll put your body in the kiln,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d carry two such to it, on my\r\nshoulders\xe2\x80\x94and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall\r\nnever know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences\r\nof such a death. Estella\xe2\x80\x99s father would believe I had deserted him,\r\nwould be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,\r\nwhen he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had\r\ncalled at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would\r\nnever know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I\r\nhad suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed\r\nthrough. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible\r\nthan death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And so\r\nquick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn\r\ngenerations,\xe2\x80\x94Estella\xe2\x80\x99s children, and their children,\xe2\x80\x94while the wretch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords were yet on his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cafore I kill you like any other beast,\xe2\x80\x94which is\r\nwot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a good look\r\nat you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few\r\ncould know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the\r\nhopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by\r\na scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I\r\nresolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some\r\nlast poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\r\nmen were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of\r\nHeaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no\r\nfarewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to\r\nme, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my\r\nmiserable errors,\xe2\x80\x94still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I\r\nwould have done it.\r\n\r\nHe had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his\r\nneck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink\r\nslung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and\r\ntook a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw\r\nflash into his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWolf!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, folding his arms again, \xe2\x80\x9cOld Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s a-going to tell\r\nyou somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted\r\nthe whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her\r\ndeath, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was you, villain,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it was your doing,\xe2\x80\x94I tell you it was done through you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nretorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the\r\nvacant air between us. \xe2\x80\x9cI come upon her from behind, as I come upon you\r\nto-night. _I_ giv\xe2\x80\x99 it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a\r\nlimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come\r\nto life again. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was\r\nfavoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?\r\nNow you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of the\r\nbottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly\r\nunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an\r\nend of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew\r\nthat when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept\r\ntowards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he\r\nwould do as he had done in my sister\xe2\x80\x99s case,\xe2\x80\x94make all haste to the\r\ntown, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My\r\nrapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with\r\nhim in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and\r\nthe white vapour creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.\r\n\r\nIt was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years\r\nwhile he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented\r\npictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of\r\nmy brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons\r\nwithout seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of\r\nthese images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him\r\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x94who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nI knew of the slightest action of his fingers.\r\n\r\nWhen he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which he\r\nsat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,\r\nshading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me,\r\nstood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWolf, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled\r\nover on your stairs that night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of\r\nthe heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s lantern on the wall. I\r\nsaw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;\r\nthere, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why was Old Orlick there? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something more, wolf. You\r\nand her _have_ pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as\r\ngetting a easy living in it goes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve took up with new companions,\r\nand new masters. Some of \xe2\x80\x99em writes my letters when I wants \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nwrote,\xe2\x80\x94do you mind?\xe2\x80\x94writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a firm mind\r\nand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s burying. I han\xe2\x80\x99t seen a way to get you safe, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked\r\narter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somehow or another I\xe2\x80\x99ll have him!\xe2\x80\x99 What! When I looks for you, I finds\r\nyour uncle Provis, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMill Pond Bank, and Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\r\nall so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was\r\nover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his\r\nback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running\r\nout to sea!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ with a uncle too! Why, I know\xe2\x80\x99d you at Gargery\xe2\x80\x99s when you was so\r\nsmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and\r\nthumb and chucked you away dead (as I\xe2\x80\x99d thoughts o\xe2\x80\x99 doing, odd times,\r\nwhen I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for\r\nto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old\r\nOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year\r\nago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a\r\nbullock, as he means to drop you\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x94when he come for to hear\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I\r\nturned my face aside to save it from the flame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, laughing, after doing it again, \xe2\x80\x9cthe burnt child dreads\r\nthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was\r\nsmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s a match for you and\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x99d you\xe2\x80\x99d come to-night! Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something more, wolf, and\r\nthis ends it. There\xe2\x80\x99s them that\xe2\x80\x99s as good a match for your uncle Provis\r\nas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him \xe2\x80\x99ware them, when he\xe2\x80\x99s lost his\r\nnevvy! Let him \xe2\x80\x99ware them, when no man can\xe2\x80\x99t find a rag of his dear\r\nrelation\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There\xe2\x80\x99s them that can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nand that won\xe2\x80\x99t have Magwitch,\xe2\x80\x94yes, _I_ know the name!\xe2\x80\x94alive in the same\r\nland with them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s had such sure information of him when he was\r\nalive in another land, as that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave it\r\nunbeknown and put them in danger. P\xe2\x80\x99raps it\xe2\x80\x99s them that writes fifty\r\nhands, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not like sneaking you as writes but one. \xe2\x80\x99Ware\r\nCompeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an\r\ninstant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\r\nlight on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and\r\nBiddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.\r\n\r\nThere was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the\r\nopposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and\r\nforwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever\r\nbefore, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his\r\nsides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left.\r\nWild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures\r\nthat rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand\r\nthat, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely\r\nperishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what\r\nhe had told.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed it\r\naway. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed\r\nslowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked\r\nat me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of\r\nhis hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and\r\nswearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw\r\nin his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.\r\n\r\nThe resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one\r\nvain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and\r\nstruggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I\r\ncould move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until\r\nthen unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard\r\nresponsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the\r\ndoor, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of\r\nmen, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly\r\nout into the night.\r\n\r\nAfter a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the\r\nsame place, with my head on some one\xe2\x80\x99s knee. My eyes were fixed on the\r\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,\xe2\x80\x94had opened on it before\r\nmy mind saw it,\xe2\x80\x94and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\r\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\r\n\r\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who\r\nsupported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came\r\nbetween me and it a face. The face of Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy, in a sober voice; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t he just pale though!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\r\nand I saw my supporter to be\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert! Great Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cGently, Handel. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too eager.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our old comrade, Startop!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, as he too bent over me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember what he is going to assist us in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand be\r\ncalm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in\r\nmy arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\r\nto-night? How long have I been here?\xe2\x80\x9d For, I had a strange and strong\r\nmisgiving that I had been lying there a long time\xe2\x80\x94a day and a\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x94two days and nights,\xe2\x80\x94more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can\r\nyou stand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\r\narm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen\r\nand inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they\r\ntore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully\r\nreplaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain\r\nsome cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the\r\ndoor of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the\r\nquarry on our way back. Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy\xe2\x80\x94Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s overgrown young man\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come\r\nin at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I\r\nhad last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.\r\nThe white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as\r\nI had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.\r\n\r\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,\xe2\x80\x94which at\r\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\r\nquiet,\xe2\x80\x94I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\r\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\r\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was\r\ngone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\r\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\r\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\r\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.\r\nFinding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\r\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\r\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\r\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\r\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, where they lost me.\r\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\r\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\r\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.\r\nAmong the loungers under the Boar\xe2\x80\x99s archway happened to be Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBoy,\xe2\x80\x94true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he\r\nhad no business,\xe2\x80\x94and Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy had seen me passing from Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy became\r\ntheir guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by\r\nthe town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went\r\nalong, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought\r\nthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsafety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be\r\nmischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and\r\nwent on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,\r\nendeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could\r\nhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was\r\nwhile my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I\r\nwas there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,\r\nand rushed in, closely followed by the other two.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\r\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\r\nwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\r\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be\r\nfatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\r\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\r\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\r\nlight of the matter to Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy; who, I am convinced, would have\r\nbeen much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his\r\nintervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy was of a\r\nmalignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it\r\nwas in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed\r\nto meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an\r\nill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).\r\n\r\nWednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London\r\nthat night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be\r\nclear away before the night\xe2\x80\x99s adventure began to be talked of. Herbert\r\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this\r\nstuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear\r\nits pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,\r\nand I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\r\n\r\nMy terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\r\nto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\r\nitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\r\nmental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\r\nme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with\r\nsuch consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\r\n\r\nNo precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from\r\ncommunication with him that day; yet this again increased my\r\nrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\r\nthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me\r\nso. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\r\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the\r\nfact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days\r\nwore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\r\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\r\nmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\r\nhead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\r\nhigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\r\nin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\r\nfatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\r\nmyself with a start, \xe2\x80\x9cNow it has come, and I am turning delirious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,\r\nand gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the\r\nnotion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and\r\nthe opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\r\nand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\r\nself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\r\nlights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\r\nmarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\r\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there\r\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the\r\nclustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\r\nunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn\r\nfrom the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.\r\nFrom me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\r\n\r\nHerbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\r\nthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the\r\nfire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In\r\ngood time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the\r\nsharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still\r\nflowing towards us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it turns at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9clook out\r\nfor us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind\r\nblows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade. We\r\nhad our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly\r\npossessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the\r\nbag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were\r\nquestions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for\r\nit was wholly set on Provis\xe2\x80\x99s safety. I only wondered for the passing\r\nmoment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered\r\ncircumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.\r\n\r\nWe loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if\r\nwe were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had\r\ntaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After\r\na little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two\r\nor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went\r\non board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then\r\nabout high-water,\xe2\x80\x94half-past eight.\r\n\r\nOur plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\r\nwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\r\nand row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\r\nreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\r\nbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\r\nwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we\r\ncould choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all\r\nnight. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would\r\nstart from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at\r\nwhat time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail\r\nthe first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we\r\nshould have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was\r\nso great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in\r\nwhich I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the\r\nmovement on the river, and the moving river itself,\xe2\x80\x94the road that ran\r\nwith us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us\r\non,\xe2\x80\x94freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use\r\nin the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,\r\nand they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present\r\nextent, and watermen\xe2\x80\x99s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing\r\ncolliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but\r\nof steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so\r\nmany. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and\r\nthere that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;\r\nthe navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a\r\nmuch easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and\r\nwe went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.\r\n\r\nOld London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its\r\noyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor\xe2\x80\x99s Gate, and\r\nwe were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,\r\nand Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking\r\nimmensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were\r\ncolliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off\r\nstages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up,\r\nwhich were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at her\r\nmoorings was to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good\r\nnotice; and here to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we\r\ncrossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a faster\r\nbeating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his\r\nsignal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot well from here; but I think I see it.\xe2\x80\x94Now I see him! Pull both.\r\nEasy, Herbert. Oars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,\r\nand we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas\r\nbag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his\r\nseat. \xe2\x80\x9cFaithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty\r\nchain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the\r\nmoment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and\r\nshaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the\r\nfigure-head of the _John of Sunderland_ making a speech to the winds\r\n(as is done by many Johns), and the _Betsy of Yarmouth_ with a firm\r\nformality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her\r\nhead; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders\xe2\x80\x99 yards, saws going at\r\ntimber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky\r\nships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible\r\nsea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent\r\nlightermen, in and out,\xe2\x80\x94out at last upon the clearer river, where the\r\nships\xe2\x80\x99 boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled\r\nwaters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly\r\nout to the wind.\r\n\r\nAt the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had\r\nlooked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We\r\ncertainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not\r\neither attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by\r\nany boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on,\r\nor to make her purpose evident. But we held our own without any\r\nappearance of molestation.\r\n\r\nHe had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural\r\npart of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he\r\nhad led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.\r\nHe was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his\r\ngentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not\r\ndisposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no\r\nnotion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted\r\nit, but it must come before he troubled himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knowed, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it is to sit here\r\nalonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day\r\nbetwixt four walls, you\xe2\x80\x99d envy me. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know the delights of freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, shaking his head gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it equal\r\nto me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it\r\nequal to me,\xe2\x80\x94but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to be low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he\r\nshould have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected\r\nthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the\r\nhabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I\r\nwas not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t\xe2\x80\x99other side the world, I\r\nwas always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for\r\nall I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could\r\ncome, and Magwitch could go, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s head would be troubled about\r\nhim. They ain\xe2\x80\x99t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be,\r\nleastwise, if they knowed where I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all goes well,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be perfectly free and safe again\r\nwithin a few hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, drawing a long breath, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dipped his hand in the water over the boat\xe2\x80\x99s gunwale, and said,\r\nsmiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose I think so, dear boy. We\xe2\x80\x99d be puzzled to be more quiet\r\nand easy-going than we are at present. But\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a flowing so soft and\r\npleasant through the water, p\xe2\x80\x99raps, as makes me think it\xe2\x80\x94I was a\r\nthinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the\r\nbottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this\r\nriver what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can\xe2\x80\x99t no more hold their tide\r\nthan I can hold this. And it\xe2\x80\x99s run through my fingers and gone, you\r\nsee!\xe2\x80\x9d holding up his dripping hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for your face I should think you were a little despondent,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of\r\nthat there rippling at the boat\xe2\x80\x99s head making a sort of a Sunday tune.\r\nMaybe I\xe2\x80\x99m a growing a trifle old besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of\r\nface, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of\r\nEngland. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been\r\nin constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer\r\ninto the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he\r\nwould be safest where he was, and he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nquietly sat down again.\r\n\r\nThe air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the\r\nsunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose\r\nnone of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By\r\nimperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of\r\nthe nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the\r\nmuddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.\r\nAs our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a\r\nboat or two\xe2\x80\x99s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch\r\nthe stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a\r\nlarge transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And\r\nsoon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,\r\nand presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking\r\nadvantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us\r\nin a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of\r\nthe tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and\r\nmudbanks.\r\n\r\nOur oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive\r\nwith the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s rest\r\nproved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery\r\nstones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. It\r\nwas like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim\r\nhorizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great\r\nfloating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed\r\nstranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round\r\nthe last low point we had headed; and the last green barge,\r\nstraw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some\r\nballast-lighters, shaped like a child\xe2\x80\x99s first rude imitation of a boat,\r\nlay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles\r\nstood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes\r\nstuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red\r\nlandmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage\r\nand an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was\r\nstagnation and mud.\r\n\r\nWe pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder\r\nwork now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and\r\nrowed until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a\r\nlittle, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on\r\nthe low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into\r\nblack; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were\r\nthe rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,\r\nsave here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.\r\n\r\nAs the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\r\nwould not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for\r\nclearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could\r\nfind. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for\r\nanything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or\r\nfive dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with\r\nher galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.\r\nThe night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and\r\nwhat light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as\r\nthe oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.\r\n\r\nAt this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we\r\nwere followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\r\nintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\r\nother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\r\nthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\r\ncreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\r\nnervously. Sometimes, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that ripple?\xe2\x80\x9d one of us would say in a\r\nlow voice. Or another, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that a boat yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d And afterwards we would\r\nfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with\r\nwhat an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.\r\n\r\nAt length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran\r\nalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\r\nby. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light\r\nto be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I\r\ndare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good\r\nfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various\r\nliquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csuch as\r\nthey were,\xe2\x80\x9d the landlord said. No other company was in the house than\r\nthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the \xe2\x80\x9cJack\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nlittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been\r\nlow-water mark too.\r\n\r\nWith this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came\r\nashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all\r\nelse, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the\r\nkitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop\r\nwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as\r\ncarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there\r\nwere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have\r\nthought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,\r\nnotwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.\r\n\r\nWhile we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the\r\nJack\xe2\x80\x94who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes\r\non, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as\r\ninteresting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a\r\ndrowned seaman washed ashore\xe2\x80\x94asked me if we had seen a four-oared\r\ngalley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must\r\nhave gone down then, and yet she \xe2\x80\x9ctook up too,\xe2\x80\x9d when she left there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought better on\xe2\x80\x99t for some reason or another,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Jack, \xe2\x80\x9cand gone down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA four-oared galley, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA four,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack, \xe2\x80\x9cand two sitters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they come ashore here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nglad to pison the beer myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack, \xe2\x80\x9cor put some rattling\r\nphysic in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ know why,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much\r\nmud had washed into his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale\r\neye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che thinks they was, what\r\nthey wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ knows what I thinks,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ thinks Custom \xe2\x80\x99Us, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong, Jack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAM I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in\r\nhis views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it,\r\nknocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on\r\nagain. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he\r\ncould afford to do anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,\r\nJack?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone with their buttons?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cChucked \xe2\x80\x99em overboard.\r\nSwallered \xe2\x80\x99em. Sowed \xe2\x80\x99em, to come up small salad. Done with their\r\nbuttons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be cheeky, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and\r\npathetic way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Custom \xe2\x80\x99Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nJack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nthey comes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and\r\nboth with and against another, without there being Custom \xe2\x80\x99Us at the\r\nbottom of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord,\r\nhaving no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind\r\nwas muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and\r\nI had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley\r\nhovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an\r\nugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced\r\nProvis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop\r\nby this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.\r\nWhether we should remain at the house until near the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s time,\r\nwhich would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off\r\nearly in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we\r\ndeemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour\r\nor so of the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s time, and then to get out in her track, and\r\ndrift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into\r\nthe house and went to bed.\r\n\r\nI lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a\r\nfew hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house\r\n(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled\r\nme. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the\r\nwindow. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,\r\nas my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw\r\ntwo men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at\r\nnothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I\r\ncould discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction\r\nof the Nore.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going\r\naway. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back\r\nof the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder\r\nday than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I\r\ncould see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I\r\nsoon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the\r\nmatter, and fell asleep again.\r\n\r\nWe were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before\r\nbreakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our\r\ncharge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the\r\nmen belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no\r\nthought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,\xe2\x80\x94as, indeed,\r\nit might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away\r\ntogether to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take\r\nus aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about\r\nnoon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he\r\nand I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.\r\n\r\nHe smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me\r\non the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in\r\ndanger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As\r\nwe approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,\r\nwhile I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had\r\npassed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no\r\nboat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were\r\nthere any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the\r\ntide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I\r\nwaved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;\r\nsometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving\r\nabout to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got\r\naboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that\r\ntime it wanted but ten minutes of one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and we began to look out\r\nfor her smoke.\r\n\r\nBut, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards\r\nwe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on\r\nat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of\r\nsaying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands\r\ncordially, and neither Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\r\nsaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\r\nahead of us, and row out into the same track.\r\n\r\nA stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s smoke,\r\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\r\ncoming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the\r\ntide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to\r\nsit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, \xe2\x80\x9cTrust to\r\nme, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was\r\nvery skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and\r\nfallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,\r\nshe kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or\r\ntwo when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and\r\nlooked at us attentively,\xe2\x80\x94as did all the rowers; the other sitter was\r\nwrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some\r\ninstruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in\r\neither boat.\r\n\r\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\r\nand gave me the word \xe2\x80\x9cHamburg,\xe2\x80\x9d in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\r\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew\r\nlouder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,\r\nwhen the galley hailed us. I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a returned Transport there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who held the lines.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\r\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\r\nand you to assist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\r\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke\r\nahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on\r\nto our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\r\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\r\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but\r\nfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw\r\nthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\nand saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,\r\nand saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\r\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,\r\nlean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\r\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that\r\nthe face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.\r\nStill, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white\r\nterror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board\r\nthe steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink\r\nfrom under me.\r\n\r\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\r\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\r\ntaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;\r\nbut our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.\r\n\r\nWhat with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of\r\nher steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first\r\ndistinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the\r\ngalley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong\r\nstrokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and\r\neagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,\r\nbearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up\r\nhis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and\r\ntrue before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,\r\nbut not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled\r\nat the wrists and ankles.\r\n\r\nThe galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water\r\nwas resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not\r\nunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had\r\nbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and\r\nwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out\r\nwas kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were\r\ngone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.\r\n\r\nAt length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\r\nwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.\r\nHere I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,\xe2\x80\x94Provis no\r\nlonger,\xe2\x80\x94who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and a\r\ndeep cut in the head.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\r\nsteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to\r\nhis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\r\nhe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did\r\nnot pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,\r\nbut that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify\r\nhim, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had\r\nboth gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him\r\n(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him\r\nin it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down\r\nfiercely locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and that there had been a\r\nstruggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,\r\nand swum away.\r\n\r\nI never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told\r\nme. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their\r\ngoing overboard.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked this officer\xe2\x80\x99s permission to change the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s wet\r\nclothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\r\npublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\r\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\r\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer\xe2\x80\x99s. He further\r\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\r\naccord that grace to my two friends.\r\n\r\nThe Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\r\ndown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\r\nlikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\r\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\r\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\r\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\r\nvarious stages of decay.\r\n\r\nWe remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then\r\nMagwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and\r\nStartop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a\r\ndoleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch\xe2\x80\x99s side, I felt\r\nthat that was my place henceforth while he lived.\r\n\r\nFor now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,\r\nwounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man\r\nwho had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,\r\ngratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a\r\nseries of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to\r\nJoe.\r\n\r\nHis breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,\r\nand often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm\r\nI could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I\r\ncould not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was\r\nunquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,\r\npeople enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not\r\ndoubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had\r\nbeen presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken\r\nprison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation\r\nunder a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who\r\nwas the cause of his arrest.\r\n\r\nAs we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,\r\nand as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how\r\ngrieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite content to take my chance. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.\r\nApart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s hint now.\r\nI foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s best as a gentleman should not\r\nbe knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by\r\nchance alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for\r\nthe last o\xe2\x80\x99 many times, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never stir from your side,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I am suffered to be\r\nnear you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away as\r\nhe lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his\r\nthroat,\xe2\x80\x94softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing\r\nthat he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might\r\nnot otherwise have thought of until too late,\xe2\x80\x94that he need never know\r\nhow his hopes of enriching me had perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been\r\nimmediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down\r\nfor an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,\r\nto speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had\r\nmeant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened\r\nthat there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could\r\ngive the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his\r\nprivate house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and\r\nMr. Jaggers on the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s behalf would admit nothing. It was the\r\nsole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five\r\nminutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could\r\nprevent its going against us.\r\n\r\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\r\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\r\nhaving \xe2\x80\x9clet it slip through my fingers,\xe2\x80\x9d and said we must memorialise\r\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\r\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the\r\nforfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this\r\ncase to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not\r\nrelated to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;\r\nhe had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his\r\napprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I\r\nfinally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my\r\nheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to\r\nestablish one.\r\n\r\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had\r\nhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\r\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. When his body was found, many\r\nmiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\r\nwas only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\r\nlegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\r\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\r\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\r\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\r\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His\r\nignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but\r\nthat my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s aid.\r\n\r\nAfter three days\xe2\x80\x99 delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\r\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\r\ncame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial\r\nat the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.\r\n\r\nIt was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one\r\nevening, a good deal cast down, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am\r\nvery much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but\r\nmy need is no greater now than at another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be so lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not leisure to think of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I am\r\nalways with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I\r\nshould be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from\r\nhim, you know that my thoughts are with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to\r\nboth of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9clet the near prospect of our\r\nseparation\xe2\x80\x94for, it is very near\xe2\x80\x94be my justification for troubling you\r\nabout yourself. Have you thought of your future?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for I have been afraid to think of any future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must\r\nnot be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few\r\nfriendly words go, with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nclerk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as a\r\nclerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,\r\nHandel,\xe2\x80\x94in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in\r\nwhich after saying \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d as if it were the grave beginning of\r\na portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,\r\nstretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClara and I have talked about it again and again,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert pursued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in\r\nher eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come\r\ntogether, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,\r\nHandel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could\r\nnot yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my\r\nmind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.\r\nSecondly,\xe2\x80\x94Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my\r\nthoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury\r\nto your business, leave the question open for a little while\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor any while,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cSix months, a year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so long as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three months at most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,\r\nand said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must\r\ngo away at the end of the week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Clara?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dear little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cholds dutifully to her\r\nfather as long as he lasts; but he won\xe2\x80\x99t last long. Mrs. Whimple\r\nconfides to me that he is certainly going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to say an unfeeling thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9che cannot do better than go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that must be admitted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cand then I shall\r\ncome back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I\r\nwill walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed\r\ndarling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the\r\nred book, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for\r\nthe son of my mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,\xe2\x80\x94full of\r\nbright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,\xe2\x80\x94as he sat on one of the\r\nseaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note\r\nto Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and\r\nover again, and then went to my lonely home,\xe2\x80\x94if it deserved the name;\r\nfor it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.\r\n\r\nOn the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an\r\nunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him\r\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\r\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\r\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe late Compeyson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9chad by little and little got at\r\nthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was\r\nfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people\r\nbeing always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,\r\nseeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I\r\nthought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only\r\nsuppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,\r\nhabitually to deceive his own instruments. You don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me, I hope,\r\nMr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\r\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, thank you very much. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad job,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick,\r\nscratching his head, \xe2\x80\x9cand I assure you I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been so cut up for a\r\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable\r\nproperty. Dear me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, there can be no objection\r\nto your being sorry for him, and I\xe2\x80\x99d put down a five-pound note myself\r\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\r\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and\r\nbeing so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have\r\nbeen saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been\r\nsaved. That\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between the property and the owner, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of\r\ngrog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\r\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up\r\nto it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese twelve years, more likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\ntake a holiday. More than that; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a walk. More than\r\nthat; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you to take a walk with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\r\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your engagements,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know you are out of sorts,\r\nMr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\r\nIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t a long walk, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an early one. Say it might occupy you\r\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nstretch a point and manage it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\r\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,\xe2\x80\x94would manage it,\xe2\x80\x94and he was so\r\nvery much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\r\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\r\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.\r\n\r\nPunctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\r\nmorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\r\ntighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\r\nglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\r\nbeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\r\nbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\r\n\r\nWhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\r\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\r\nconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it\r\nover his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we are not going fishing!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I like to walk with one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\r\ntowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\r\nsuddenly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a church!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\r\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked\r\nall round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,\r\nand getting something out of paper there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of pair of gloves! Let\xe2\x80\x99s put \xe2\x80\x99em\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\r\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\r\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\r\ndoor, escorting a lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Skiffins! Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\r\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\r\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the\r\naltar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\r\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to\r\nput him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\r\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\r\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\r\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\r\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\r\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out\r\nof his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nring!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;\r\nwhile a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby\xe2\x80\x99s, made a\r\nfeint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of\r\ngiving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the\r\nclergyman\xe2\x80\x99s being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.\r\nWhen he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho giveth this woman to be married to this man?\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nold gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we\r\nhad arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.\r\nUpon which, the clergyman said again, \xe2\x80\x9cWHO giveth this woman to be\r\nmarried to this man?\xe2\x80\x9d The old gentleman being still in a state of most\r\nestimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cNow Aged P. you know; who giveth?\xe2\x80\x9d To which the Aged replied\r\nwith great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John,\r\nall right, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon\r\nit, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely\r\nmarried that day.\r\n\r\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\r\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,\r\nand put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,\r\nput her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_, Mr.\r\nPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9clet me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\r\nwedding-party!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\r\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\r\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\r\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\r\nunwound Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in\r\na high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,\r\nand submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\r\ntable, Wemmick said, \xe2\x80\x9cProvided by contract, you know; don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid\r\nof it!\xe2\x80\x9d I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the\r\nCastle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with\r\nhim, and wished him joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s such a manager of\r\nfowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\r\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d calling me back, and speaking low. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nWemmick nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may\r\nas well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or\r\nsomething of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his\r\ncommittal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken\r\ntwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\r\npain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\r\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\r\nvery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\r\nfirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\r\nought to hear.\r\n\r\nBeing far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\r\nthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of\r\nbeing with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his\r\nillness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\r\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\r\n\r\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\r\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\r\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\r\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\r\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\r\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\r\n\r\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\r\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\r\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\r\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\r\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\r\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\r\n\r\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his\r\ndesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in\r\nattendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his\r\neyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had\r\nseen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was\r\na little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I\r\nnever knew him complain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be\r\nmade for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It\r\nwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,\r\nand was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the\r\nbar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting\r\nclose to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he\r\nstretched forth to me.\r\n\r\nThe trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said\r\nfor him were said,\xe2\x80\x94how he had taken to industrious habits, and had\r\nthriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that\r\nhe had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It\r\nwas impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nAt that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible\r\nexperience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing\r\nof Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of\r\nDeath. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds\r\nbefore me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that\r\nI saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\r\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\r\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,\r\ndown to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering\r\nin the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside\r\nit at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and\r\nwomen; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\r\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\r\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\r\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\r\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\r\ngallery full of people,\xe2\x80\x94a large theatrical audience,\xe2\x80\x94looked on, as the\r\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\r\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\r\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\r\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments\r\nand punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of\r\nyears; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had\r\nmade his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable\r\nman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when\r\nfar removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a\r\npeaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those\r\npropensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered\r\nhim a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and\r\nrepentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.\r\nBeing here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading\r\nthe officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of\r\nflight, he had resisted them, and had\xe2\x80\x94he best knew whether by express\r\ndesign, or in the blindness of his hardihood\xe2\x80\x94caused the death of his\r\ndenouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment\r\nfor his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his\r\ncase being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\r\n\r\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\r\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\r\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\r\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\r\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all\r\nthings, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face\r\nin this way of light, the prisoner said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, I have received my\r\nsentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,\xe2\x80\x9d and sat down\r\nagain. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had\r\nto say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of\r\nthem were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard\r\nlook of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three\r\nshook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had\r\ntaken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of\r\nhaving to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held\r\nmy hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got\r\nup (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),\r\nand pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him\r\nand me.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nReport was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that\r\nnight to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting\r\nforth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my\r\nsake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I\r\nhad finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men\r\nin authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the\r\nCrown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took\r\nno rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed\r\nin these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away\r\nfrom the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful\r\nand less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable\r\nrestlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,\r\nwandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.\r\nTo the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,\r\ndusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and\r\ntheir long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.\r\n\r\nThe daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more\r\nstrictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an\r\nintention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I\r\nsat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,\r\nthat I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the\r\nsingleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There\r\nwas duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer\r\nalways gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick\r\nprisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as\r\nsick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be\r\nthanked!) always joined in the same report.\r\n\r\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\r\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\r\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\r\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\r\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\r\nunderstand his meaning very well.\r\n\r\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in\r\nhim than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\r\nlighted up as I entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as I sat down by his bed: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was late.\r\nBut I knowed you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI waited for it at the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always waits at the gate; don\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Not to lose a moment of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee dear boy, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee. God bless you! You\xe2\x80\x99ve never deserted me,\r\ndear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\r\nmeant to desert him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the best of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been more comfortable\r\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s best of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\r\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and\r\na film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in much pain to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t complain of none, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never do complain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\r\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid\r\nit there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\r\n\r\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\r\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t go yet.\xe2\x80\x9d I thanked him gratefully, and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cMight I\r\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\r\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\r\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had a child once, whom you loved and lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a\r\nlady and very beautiful. And I love her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\r\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\r\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying\r\non it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,\r\nand his head dropped quietly on his breast.\r\n\r\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\r\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\r\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, be merciful to him\r\na sinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention to\r\nquit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally\r\ndetermine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills\r\nup in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and\r\nbegan to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought\r\nrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and\r\nconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\r\nbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me\r\nhad enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that\r\nit was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even\r\ncareless as to that.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,\xe2\x80\x94anywhere,\r\naccording as I happened to sink down,\xe2\x80\x94with a heavy head and aching\r\nlimbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which\r\nappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;\r\nand when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I\r\nfound I could not do so.\r\n\r\nWhether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the\r\nnight, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether\r\nI had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great\r\nterror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found\r\nmyself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up\r\nthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been\r\ninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and\r\ngroaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my\r\nown making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark\r\ncorner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again,\r\nthat Miss Havisham was consuming within it,\xe2\x80\x94these were things that I\r\ntried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that\r\nmorning on my bed. But the vapour of a limekiln would come between me\r\nand them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapour at last\r\nthat I saw two men looking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, starting; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the\r\nshoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a matter that you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon arrange, I dare say, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the debt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s account, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better come to my house,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cI keep a very nice\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to\r\nthem, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I\r\nstill lay there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see my state,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI would come with you if I could; but\r\nindeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die\r\nby the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to\r\nbelieve that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in my\r\nmemory by only this one slender thread, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they did,\r\nexcept that they forbore to remove me.\r\n\r\nThat I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I\r\noften lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I\r\nconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a\r\nbrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the\r\ngiddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a\r\nvast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored\r\nin my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered\r\noff; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own\r\nremembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes\r\nstruggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and\r\nthat I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and\r\nwould then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me\r\ndown, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a\r\nconstant tendency in all these people,\xe2\x80\x94who, when I was very ill, would\r\npresent all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,\r\nand would be much dilated in size,\xe2\x80\x94above all, I say, I knew that there\r\nwas an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to\r\nsettle down into the likeness of Joe.\r\n\r\nAfter I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice\r\nthat while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature\r\ndid not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I\r\nopened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the\r\nbedside, Joe. I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the\r\nwindow-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw\r\nJoe. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s. I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that\r\nlooked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.\r\n\r\nAt last, one day, I took courage, and said, \xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ it Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the dear old home-voice answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich it air, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell\r\nme of my ingratitude. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so good to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and\r\nput his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich dear old Pip, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and me was ever friends.\r\nAnd when you\xe2\x80\x99re well enough to go out for a ride\xe2\x80\x94what larks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back\r\ntowards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me\r\nfrom getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holding\r\nhis hand, and we both felt happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long, dear Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old\r\nchap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you been here all that time, dear Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your\r\nbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post,\r\nand being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal\r\nof walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part,\r\nand marriage were the great wish of his hart\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you\r\nsaid to Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich it were,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat how you might be amongst strangers,\r\nand that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a\r\nmoment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, \xe2\x80\x98Go\r\nto him, without loss of time.\xe2\x80\x99 That,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, summing up with his\r\njudicial air, \xe2\x80\x9cwere the word of Biddy. \xe2\x80\x98Go to him,\xe2\x80\x99 Biddy say, \xe2\x80\x98without\r\nloss of time.\xe2\x80\x99 In short, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t greatly deceive you,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe added,\r\nafter a little grave reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cif I represented to you that the word\r\nof that young woman were, \xe2\x80\x98without a minute\xe2\x80\x99s loss of time.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to\r\nin great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\r\nstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\r\nI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\r\nquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEvidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at\r\nhim, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\r\npride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\r\ncurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\r\nthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the\r\nroom kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\r\nwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\r\nJoe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\r\npen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\r\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\r\nnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\r\nand to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;\r\nand when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\r\nhave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\r\nspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on\r\nthe side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\r\nspace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\r\ntripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he\r\ngot on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\r\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\r\nhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\r\neffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\r\nwith unbounded satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNot to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\r\ntalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\r\nshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she dead, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you see, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by\r\nway of getting at it by degrees, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as to say that,\r\nfor that\xe2\x80\x99s a deal to say; but she ain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiving, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nigher where it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cshe ain\xe2\x80\x99t living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she linger long, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you\r\nwas put to it) a week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; still determined, on my account, to\r\ncome at everything by degrees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cit do appear that she had settled the most\r\nof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had\r\nwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\r\naccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,\r\ndo you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand\r\nunto him? \xe2\x80\x98Because of Pip\xe2\x80\x99s account of him, the said Matthew.\xe2\x80\x99 I am\r\ntold by Biddy, that air the writing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, repeating the legal\r\nturn as if it did him infinite good, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98account of him the said\r\nMatthew.\xe2\x80\x99 And a cool four thousand, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature\r\nof the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money\r\nmore to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being\r\ncool.\r\n\r\nThis account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I\r\nhad done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other\r\nrelations had any legacies?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cshe have twenty-five pound perannium fur to\r\nbuy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty\r\npound down. Mrs.\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the name of them wild beasts with humps, old\r\nchap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCamels?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.\r\n\r\nJoe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Camels,\xe2\x80\x9d by which I presently understood he meant\r\nCamilla, \xe2\x80\x9cshe have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\r\nspirits when she wake up in the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give\r\nme great confidence in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s information. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one\r\nadditional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he\xe2\x80\x99s been a bustin\xe2\x80\x99 open a\r\ndwelling-ouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoe, apologetically; \xe2\x80\x9cstill, a Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s ouse is his Castle, and\r\ncastles must not be busted \xe2\x80\x99cept when done in war time. And wotsume\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s house that has been broken into, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cand they took his till, and they took his\r\ncash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,\r\nand they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him\r\nup to his bedpust, and they giv\xe2\x80\x99 him a dozen, and they stuffed his\r\nmouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he\r\nknowed Orlick, and Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s in the county jail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow\r\nto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe\r\nstayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.\r\n\r\nFor the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,\r\nthat I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in\r\nthe old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old\r\nunassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my\r\nlife since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles\r\nof the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except the\r\nhousehold work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, after\r\npaying off the laundress on his first arrival. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich I do assure you,\r\nPip,\xe2\x80\x9d he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; \xe2\x80\x9cI found her\r\na tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the\r\nfeathers in a bucket, for sale. Which she would have tapped yourn next,\r\nand draw\xe2\x80\x99d it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away\r\nthe coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the\r\nwine and spirits in your Wellington boots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\r\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\r\ncame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\r\ntook me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\r\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\r\nthe wealth of his great nature.\r\n\r\nAnd Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\r\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\r\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\r\nSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how\r\nit had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\r\nforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\r\nby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\r\nand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\r\nthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\r\nbells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I\r\nfelt that I was not nearly thankful enough,\xe2\x80\x94that I was too weak yet to\r\nbe even that,\xe2\x80\x94and I laid my head on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, as I had laid it\r\nlong ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too\r\nmuch for my young senses.\r\n\r\nMore composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to\r\ntalk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\r\nwhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\r\neyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me\xe2\x80\x94so\r\neasily!\xe2\x80\x94across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\r\nChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\r\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\r\nmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself\r\nnow, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself\r\nwhether I ought to refer to it when he did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him that evening, upon further\r\nconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, \xe2\x80\x9cwho my patron\r\nwas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heerd,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cas it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear who it was, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv\xe2\x80\x99 you\r\nthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in the placidest way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear that he was dead, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I presently asked, with\r\nincreasing diffidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\r\nevasively at the window-seat, \xe2\x80\x9cas I _did_ hear tell that how he were\r\nsomething or another in a general way in that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot partickler, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would like to hear, Joe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I was beginning, when Joe got up and\r\ncame to my sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, bending over me. \xe2\x80\x9cEver the best of\r\nfriends; ain\xe2\x80\x99t us, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was ashamed to answer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWery good, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all right;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\r\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There\xe2\x80\x99s subjects enough\r\nas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\r\npoor sister and her Rampages! And don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember Tickler?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do indeed, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cI done what I could to keep you and\r\nTickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\r\ninclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\r\nwere not so much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\r\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ngrab at a man\xe2\x80\x99s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\r\nsister was quite welcome), that \xe2\x80\x99ud put a man off from getting a little\r\nchild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\r\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\r\nand says to himself, \xe2\x80\x98Where is the good as you are a-doing? I grant you\r\nI see the \xe2\x80\x99arm,\xe2\x80\x99 says the man, \xe2\x80\x98but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the good. I call upon\r\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man says?\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man says,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe assented. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he right, that man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Joe, he is always right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthen abide by your words. If he\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nright (which in general he\xe2\x80\x99s more likely wrong), he\xe2\x80\x99s right when he\r\nsays this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when\r\nyou was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know\xe2\x80\x99d as J.\r\nGargery\xe2\x80\x99s power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal\r\nto his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two\r\nsech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy\r\ngiv\xe2\x80\x99 herself a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost\r\nawful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this\r\nlight, as I should so put it. Both of which,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, quite charmed\r\nwith his logical arrangement, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing done, now this to you a true\r\nfriend, say. Namely. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go a overdoing on it, but you must\r\nhave your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt\r\nthe sheets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact\r\nand kindness with which Biddy\xe2\x80\x94who with her woman\xe2\x80\x99s wit had found me out\r\nso soon\xe2\x80\x94had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\r\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all\r\ndissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\r\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\r\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\r\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\r\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\r\nthe dear \xe2\x80\x9cold Pip, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d that now were music in my ears. I too had\r\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\r\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hold upon them began\r\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\r\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\r\nall mine.\r\n\r\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\r\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\r\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\r\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\r\n\r\nIt was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\r\nTemple Gardens leaning on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s arm, that I saw this change in him very\r\nplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at\r\nthe river, and I chanced to say as we got up,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back\r\nby myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich do not overdo it, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall be happy fur to\r\nsee you able, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\r\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker\r\nthan I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\r\nthoughtful.\r\n\r\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\r\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\r\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\r\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\r\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\r\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\r\nmust not suffer him to do it.\r\n\r\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\r\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow being\r\nSunday,\xe2\x80\x94and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\r\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\r\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\r\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\r\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\r\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\r\narrived at a resolution too.\r\n\r\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\r\nthen walked in the fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old Pip, old chap, you\xe2\x80\x99re a\xe2\x80\x99most come round, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a memorable time for me, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikeways for myself, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\r\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\r\nforget these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, \xe2\x80\x9cthere has\r\nbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us\xe2\x80\x94have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\r\nall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\r\nas in the morning?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Joe, quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are always a getting stronger, old chap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Joe, steadily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\r\nsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, \xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\r\nmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\r\nbreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\r\nfor, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\r\nhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\r\n\r\nI hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\r\nwere its brief contents:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\r\nPip and will do better without\r\n\r\n\r\nJO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S. Ever the best of friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\r\nhad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\r\ncreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be\r\nquite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s having paid the money;\r\nbut Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.\r\n\r\nWhat remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and\r\nthere to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance\r\nwith him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved\r\nSecondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my\r\nthoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?\r\n\r\nThe purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how\r\nhumbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost\r\nall I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in\r\nmy first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, \xe2\x80\x9cBiddy, I think you\r\nonce liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed\r\naway from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been\r\nsince. If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take\r\nme with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can\r\nreceive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and\r\nhave as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am\r\na little worthier of you that I was,\xe2\x80\x94not much, but a little. And,\r\nBiddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge\r\nwith Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in\r\nthis country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an\r\nopportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until I\r\nknew your answer. And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will\r\ngo through the world with me, you will surely make it a better world\r\nfor me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it a\r\nbetter world for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to\r\nthe old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I\r\nhave left to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to\r\nmy native place and its neighbourhood before I got there. I found the\r\nBlue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a\r\ngreat change in the Boar\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated\r\nmy good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,\r\nthe Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out\r\nof property.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so\r\noften made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,\r\nwhich was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and\r\ncould only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and\r\npost-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as\r\nin the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and\r\nthe quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled\r\nround by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits\r\nof carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of\r\nthe Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to\r\nbe sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in\r\nwhitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of\r\nthe main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were\r\nmarked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn\r\ndown to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in\r\nthe dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open\r\ngate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger\r\nwho had no business there, I saw the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk walking on the\r\ncasks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler,\r\npen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so\r\noften pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to my breakfast in the Boar\xe2\x80\x99s coffee-room, I found Mr.\r\nPumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved\r\nin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and\r\naddressed me in the following terms:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be\r\nexpected! what else could be expected!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I\r\nwas broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, \xe2\x80\x9cput a muffin on table.\r\nAnd has it come to this! Has it come to this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me\r\nand poured out my tea\xe2\x80\x94before I could touch the teapot\xe2\x80\x94with the air of a\r\nbenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cput the salt on. In\r\nhappier times,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing me, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you took sugar? And did you\r\ntake milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat watercresses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t eat \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his\r\nhead several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if\r\nabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue.\r\nThe simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any, William.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand\r\nover me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle more than skin and bone!\xe2\x80\x9d mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread\r\nafore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\r\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\r\nsame fat five fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, handing me the bread and butter. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd air you\r\na-going to Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, firing in spite of myself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does it\r\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\r\nthe opportunity he wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, releasing the handle of the article in\r\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\r\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ leave that\r\nteapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I\r\nforgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to\r\nwish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of\r\nprodigygality, to be stimilated by the \xe2\x80\x99olesome nourishment of your\r\nforefathers. And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and\r\nwaiter, and pointing me out at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is him as I ever\r\nsported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I\r\ntell you this is him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\r\nparticularly affected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cas I have rode in my shay-cart. This\r\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\r\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M\xe2\x80\x99ria from\r\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\r\nthe case a black look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\r\nfashion, \xe2\x80\x9cyou air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask\r\nme, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to\r\nJoseph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of\r\nsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\r\nconclusive, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\r\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is\r\nWilliam, which his father\xe2\x80\x99s name was Potkins if I do not deceive\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said William.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn their presence,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you, young man,\r\nwhat to say to Joseph. Says you, \xe2\x80\x9cJoseph, I have this day seen my\r\nearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun\xe2\x80\x99s. I will name no\r\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\r\nseen that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear I don\xe2\x80\x99t see him here,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that likewise,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cSay you said that, and even\r\nJoseph will probably betray surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you quite mistake him,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI know better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays you,\xe2\x80\x9d Pumblechook went on, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Joseph, I have seen that man, and\r\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\r\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\r\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\r\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,\xe2\x80\x99 says you,\xe2\x80\x9d here Pumblechook shook his head\r\nand hand at me, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98he knows my total deficiency of common human\r\ngratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,\r\nJoseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\r\nto talk thus to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays you, \xe2\x80\x98Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\r\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\r\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\r\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to\r\nhis earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun\xe2\x80\x99s_. But that man said he\r\ndid not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to\r\ndo it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would\r\ndo it again.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted\r\nbreakfast, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the man did not say what he had done and would do\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSquires of the Boar!\xe2\x80\x9d Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town\r\nor down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do\r\nit, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\r\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by\r\nthe virtues of that same indefinite \xe2\x80\x9cit.\xe2\x80\x9d I was not long after him in\r\nleaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him\r\nholding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a\r\nselect group, who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as I\r\npassed on the opposite side of the way.\r\n\r\nBut, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose\r\ngreat forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,\r\ncontrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for\r\nmy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew\r\nnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\r\nfurther and further behind.\r\n\r\nThe June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were\r\nsoaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more\r\nbeautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many\r\npleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the\r\nchange for the better that would come over my character when I had a\r\nguiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I\r\nhad proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for\r\nmy heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,\r\nthat I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,\r\nand whose wanderings had lasted many years.\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the\r\nlittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a\r\nholiday; no children were there, and Biddy\xe2\x80\x99s house was closed. Some\r\nhopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,\r\nbefore she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.\r\n\r\nBut the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it\r\nunder the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hammer.\r\nLong after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I\r\nheard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,\r\nand the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and\r\ntheir leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the\r\nclink of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.\r\n\r\nAlmost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I\r\nsaw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no\r\nglittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nBut the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be in\r\nuse, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the\r\nwindow was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning\r\nto peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in\r\narm.\r\n\r\nAt first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but\r\nin another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she\r\nwept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she,\r\nbecause I looked so worn and white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dear Biddy, how smart you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Joe, how smart _you_ are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear old Pip, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my wedding-day!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am\r\nmarried to Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the\r\nold deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich he warn\xe2\x80\x99t strong enough, my\r\ndear, fur to be surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. And Biddy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have\r\nthought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.\xe2\x80\x9d They were both so\r\noverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to\r\nthem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their\r\nday complete!\r\n\r\nMy first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never\r\nbreathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me\r\nin my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been\r\nhis knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have the best husband in the whole world,\r\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have\xe2\x80\x94But no, you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t love him better than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\r\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble\r\nJoe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\r\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\r\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I\r\nam going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I\r\nshall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have\r\nkept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don\xe2\x80\x99t think, dear Joe\r\nand Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I\r\ncould cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if\r\nI could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\r\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\r\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\r\never. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him, Biddy,\r\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you\r\nboth, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,\r\nI said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, from behind his sleeve, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell him\r\nnothink o\xe2\x80\x99 that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain\xe2\x80\x99t. Nor yet no one ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\r\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\r\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and\r\nthen I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better\r\nof me, in the time to come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear old Pip, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cGod knows as I forgive you, if I\r\nhave anythink to forgive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen! And God knows I do!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\r\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\r\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\r\ngood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition\r\nwith my creditors,\xe2\x80\x94who gave me ample time to pay them in full,\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nwent out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England, and\r\nwithin two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four\r\nmonths I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across\r\nthe parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under\r\nold Bill Barley\xe2\x80\x99s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to\r\nmarry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until\r\nhe brought her back.\r\n\r\nMany a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived\r\nhappily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my\r\ndebts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It\r\nwas not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to\r\nHerbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s partnership\r\nhad been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he\r\ntold it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow\r\nand I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not\r\nleave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we\r\nmade mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had\r\na good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so\r\nmuch to Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often\r\nwondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I\r\nwas one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude\r\nhad never been in him at all, but had been in me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily\r\neyes,\xe2\x80\x94though they had both been often before my fancy in the\r\nEast,\xe2\x80\x94when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I\r\nlaid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it\r\nso softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking\r\nhis pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as\r\nstrong as ever, though a little grey, sat Joe; and there, fenced into\r\nthe corner with Joe\xe2\x80\x99s leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking\r\nat the fire, was\xe2\x80\x94I again!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe giv\xe2\x80\x99 him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe,\r\ndelighted, when I took another stool by the child\xe2\x80\x99s side (but I did\r\n_not_ rumple his hair), \xe2\x80\x9cand we hoped he might grow a little bit like\r\nyou, and we think he do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we\r\ntalked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took\r\nhim down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,\r\nand he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the\r\nmemory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife\r\nof the Above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little\r\ngirl lay sleeping in her lap, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must give Pip to me one of these\r\ndays; or lend him, at all events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Herbert and Clara say, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall, Biddy. I have so\r\nsettled down in their home, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all likely. I am already\r\nquite an old bachelor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips,\r\nand then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into\r\nmine. There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of\r\nBiddy\xe2\x80\x99s wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t fret for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no,\xe2\x80\x94I think not, Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a\r\nforemost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But\r\nthat poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x94all\r\ngone by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly\r\nintended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for\r\nher sake. Yes, even so. For Estella\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nI had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being\r\nseparated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and\r\nwho had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice,\r\nbrutality, and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband,\r\nfrom an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. This\r\nrelease had befallen her some two years before; for anything I knew,\r\nshe was married again.\r\n\r\nThe early dinner hour at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s, left me abundance of time, without\r\nhurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.\r\nBut, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think\r\nof old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.\r\n\r\nThere was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the\r\nwall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a\r\nrough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had\r\nstruck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A\r\ngate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.\r\n\r\nA cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet\r\nup to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the\r\nmoon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where\r\nevery part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,\r\nand where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was\r\nlooking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nThe figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving\r\ntowards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the\r\nfigure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away,\r\nwhen it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if\r\nmuch surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable\r\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,\r\nI had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,\r\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was\r\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.\r\n\r\nWe sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter so many years,\r\nit is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our\r\nfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been here since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white\r\nceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought\r\nof the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had\r\nheard on earth.\r\n\r\nEstella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been\r\nprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and\r\nthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing\r\nthat I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she\r\nsaid quietly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in\r\nthis condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not\r\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\r\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\r\nmade in all the wretched years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it to be built on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nlive abroad still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do well, I am sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore\xe2\x80\x94yes, I do\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often thought of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from\r\nme the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant\r\nof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the\r\nadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have always held your place in my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\nAnd we were silent again until she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI little thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should take leave of you in\r\ntaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,\r\nthe remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and\r\npainful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said to me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella, very earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98God bless\r\nyou, God forgive you!\xe2\x80\x99 And if you could say that to me then, you will\r\nnot hesitate to say that to me now,\xe2\x80\x94now, when suffering has been\r\nstronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what\r\nyour heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but\xe2\x80\x94I hope\xe2\x80\x94into a\r\nbetter shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me\r\nwe are friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from\r\nthe bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will continue friends apart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\nI took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as\r\nthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so\r\nthe evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of\r\ntranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GREAT EXPECTATIONS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1400-0.txt or 1400-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/0/1400/\r\n\r\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer, and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
